review/summary: Watch that shipping charge for multiple items!
review/text: If you order more than one of these Equal sweetener tablet dispensers, BE AWARE that while they are all shipped in a single package with negligible weight [** even ==10== of these dispensers would not weigh more than a half-pound, if even that!], you will be charged $1.99 shipping and handling for EACH DISPENSER in your multiple dispenser order! I wrote to the seller about this matter and through Amazon but I did not receive a response from the seller. In my case, I ordered 6 Equal dispensers which amounts to $17.34 but then I was charged $11.94 for shipping [$1.99 for 'each' dispenser] even though they were shipped together in a single package with very negligible package weight. I asked the seller to perhaps consider [no matter who orders the product] a more reasonable [read: equitable] shipping and handling charge based on the actual weight of the package and the fact that the multiple item order is shipped in one single package, but as I said, and to date, I received no response from the seller.<br /><br />So too, various of these dispensers have tablet jamming problems and you've got to often bang on the thing to get the small tablet out in one piece. Further, it's difficult to find these tablet dispensers in supermarkets, the why of which escapes me, but when they first came out, the dispenser had a small lid on the bottom and the tablets came out intact and freely but when the Equal folks moved to the newer tablet 'click' dispensers, the tablet jamming became a problem and this 'may' account for the Equal folks going with the sweetener 'granule' or sweetener 'powder' packets for their sweetener vs the hard tablet dispensers.<br /><br />I think charging $1.99 for 'each' dispenser but which is shipped in a 'single' package borders on shipping and handling fee inequity. In the future, I'll simply order the dispensers one by one and 'then' I can at least justify the seller shipping and handling charge even though I'll wind up paying the same but it would then have to be sent in multiple packages! I think the seller would do much better in 'adjusting' the shipping fee for multiple item orders that they mail out in one package and based on true mailing weight considerations.<br /><br />Doc Tony

review/summary: Defective dispensers?
review/text: I purchased 10 of these because they are so hard to find in our local stores.  The tablets are just as I've used before, but the plastic dispensers (2 so far) don't work correctly.  In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if they're factory "rejects".  So, if you can deal with the fact that you may get a bunch of powder from the tablets before one even comes out of the dispenser, than this product should be OK for you.  Hopefully I'll have better luck with the remaining 8 dispensers.

review/text: I ordered the the sweetner because I could not find it in stores anymore. The original dispenser was a much smaller container with a small flip lid that was very easy to get 1 or 2 tablets out. This new dispenser has a spring loaded mechanism that is supposed to shoot out 1 tablet at a time but half the time crushed bits of the tablet come out and sometimes nothing comes out . Another example how trying to make something so simple is made into something that seems smarter but is not!!!!!!!!

review/text: My wife just loves these little things as this is what she carries everywhere. A purse is perfect for tucking this dispenser away and purchasing them in quantity means you won't have to rely on a Super Market (as I do) which does not carry this product any longer. In fact, we have not been able to find this product in any stores in this area of Indiana.  My advice is this: If you like your Equal and want to be sure you have it wherever you go, then purchase this item.  You can't beat it with a stick.

review/summary: Not the same strength as powder form
review/text: I'm a Type 2 diabetic and wanted to try the tablet form of Equal since it doesn't have the "fillers" as the packets, thus raising blood sugar levels. I did notice a few points difference in my readings before and after my first cup of coffee. Also, the sweetness level is not as advertised (1 tablet = 1 teaspoon sugar). I have to use 3 tablets and 1 packet of Equal to get the right sweetness that 2 packets give me. The "fillers" in the packets include a form of sugar and therefore make the packets' sweetness more intense. So, I can solve the whole problem by not using sweetener in my coffee, but I swear, I've tried that and just can't do it. My solution is: since I drink only 2 cups of coffee per day, I'll continue to use 2 packets of Equal per cup and get the taste I want, while searching for other alternatives. Note: some of the alternatives are expensive and, to me, have an unacceptable after-taste.<br /><br />That said, I will agree with some of the other folks who complained about the ejection mechanism grinding up the tablets into a powder form. So, I have to take the top off and get them out that way.

review/summary: DISPENSERS ARE UNUSABLE
review/text: It's hard for me to understand how Equal, which is a good product, could be packaged in such defective dispensers for as long as this has gone on.  I noticed the problem a year ago and in a dispenser that my wife  bought last month.  Is anyone at the company listening?  The product should have been recalled.<br /><br />I like the product, but the tablets would not properly dispense, would get stuck in the outlet, and create frustration.  I opened the top and tipped them out by hand.<br /><br />The result is that I now use Splenda.  It's an equally good sweetener and the dispenser works just fine.

review/text: Am using the Equal Sweetener Tablets for many years. The tablets are solid, they do not create a mess and they give a consistent amount of sweetening.<br />Recently this product is Made in Agentina and now the tablets often get jammed in the outlet of the dispenser. Many users complained about this problem but it has not been corrected yet.<br />I always turn the dispenser upside ddown and back before I squeeze the button ... that seems to clear the passage.<br />But I still prefer the tablets to the messy small packs.

review/text: This snack is scrumptious beyond words!!! But it deserves words,so here I am reviewing it. All the different flavors of Snyder's of Hanover Pretzel Bits are good, but this one, the Honey Mustard and Onion flavor is my favorite--and it's one that you should definitely try at least once in your life if you haven't before.<br /><br />These pretzel bits are, after probably healthier than potato chips--the only remotely negative about it, is that they're so tasty it's hard to stop eating them! I find it's good to divide the 10 oz. snack into zip loc bags--otherwise, the whole bag might as well be one serving.<br /><br />Make sure you try out these pretzel bits!!

review/summary: Sososo tasty. &lt;3
review/text: I buy these as often as I can at my supermarket, as they usually sell out ridiculously fast. If SoH sold the honey mustard they coated these pretzels in, they'd make so much money they wouldn't know what to do with it. These honey mustard pretzels are really that good. My only problem is that once I open the bag, all the pretzels are gone (I inhale them). Damn them for being so tasty!<br /><br />And finding them on Amazon is a steal, as these sell for $3 plus; you can just subscribe and save, and then oh-so-slyly, unsubscribe. You save $9 doing this, rather than buying 12 of these at $3 a pop at the supermarket. That makes this snack all the more satisfying. &lt;3

review/text: This is a great-low fat snack that I eat between lunch and dinner almost every day. It has a good flavor and fills me up after just a few pieces. Buying them in bulk like this has saved me a lot of money versus buying them one or two at a time from the grocery store, and the free shipping to my door is a wonderful perk.<br /><br />I do wish there was a little more seasoning on the pretzels, something between these nibblers and the "pieces" would be my ideal amount of seasoning, but that would add to the fat content. Other than that, I don't have any complaints.

review/summary: As good as factory pretzels get
review/text: There's no way to package soft "street" pretzels in a bag you keep on the shelf(though they do come frozen).  For handy salty snacks, the factories have made so-called "hard pretzels" for decades, and these are the best.  The proper blend of sweet and salt, blandness and tart, they hit the spot.  As a snack, their only handicaps are that they are very hard(only original teeth please), and they are very salty(they deliver a "wallop" of saltiness that potato chips just don't, due to the fact that their salt is on the surface and concentrated in large salt grains.)  But if you like old timey pretzels like they used to sell in the general store or your local bar, these are for you.

review/text: We regularly take Yerba mate as our tea and this particular brand is what we consume. It is easily  available at our local supermarkets.<br /><br />I would like to see subscribe and save of amazon become more popular and useful as it allows us to simplify things. But boy, someone at Amazon needs to listen to the customers and understand that the customers are educated.<br /><br />Many many of your grocery prices are silly when compared with local market prices in US. This product is a perfect example. It sells at normal MSRP for $9.99/lb in Austin TX in WholeFoods or SunHarvest, yet amazon price is $16.67/lb for a bulk pack? In fact this trend is true in many of the departments. Amazon needs to start showing prices that are real rather than try to "show" a big discount. A good mindset to follow would be that of Costco/Sams rather than a shady pawn show.<br /><br />Fix it, and amazon's subscription business for groceries & household utilities will take off like you wouldn't belove it. I  for one would be happy to shift *all* of my reoccurring, non perishable food supply to Amazon.

review/text: I use mate with black tea to get an extra dose of caffeine in the morning. That way my brew is not bitter and it packs a punch. This mate is the best I have had. It is fresh smelling and tasting, and it has a lot of flavor in the cup. Most mates are more in the background of the black tea in my concoction. This mate is front and center. I really enjoy it.<br /><br />On top of all that, it is not expensive. In fact, for its quality it is quite a bargain. I hope I can continue to get this product at this price.<br /><br />I have a gourd and I have used it once or twice.<br /><br />My preferred method is to use three cups of water to two teaspoons of tea and two of mate. I cool the water for 60 to 70 seconds before pouring it over the mixed tea and mate. I'm not a purist, but I get something I like and can drink on a consistent basis. It makes a good amount of liquor and it is mild to the palate and gives a good dose of caffeine.<br /><br />For tea, I use PG Tips Loose Tea.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5JJQ">PG Tips Black Tea, Loose Tea, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

Well, it is bitter but that's how nature intended it! And I have to say, I feel the difference in my day when I drink it in the morning...nice, steady energy and positive mood. If you look up Yerba mate's nutritional values, it kind of clarifies why! It's like a multivitamin with more antioxidants than any other tea (even green tea) without the caffeine. I used to sweeten it with honey but have grown to appreciating it's own taste.<br />Enjoy it!

review/summary: A reasonable price at less than $23 for 48 ounces!
review/text: Based on the current retail price for 3 one pound packages of $22.73, this product is fairly priced. I can buy it locally for $7.99 per pound at our local health food store.  It is a great tea "staple" to have on hand because you can mix it with other herbal, black or green teas.  It definitely gives you a non-jittery energy boost and it is an excellent source of chromium plus it has some iron, magnesium, niacin, zinc and riboflavin.<br /><br />Please note this one major difference that I just picked up on:  The kind that I purchased is called "Green Energy" and it is packed with vitamins including riboflavin, niacin, iron, magnesium and zinc.  No chromium, however.It has 80 mg of caffeine.  As far as I can see, "Green Energy" is only available on Amazon as tea bags not loose leaf.

review/summary: lame, big disappointment...
review/text: I ran out of mate, and have been drinking mate for a long time. I ended up picking this up at the local Co-op. Well I gotta say this tastes horrible. I have been drinking mate for a long time as I lived in Argentina, and this tastes nothing like normal mate. I understand the idea behind this mate, and the better health reasons behind having it unsmoked and organic, which organic and unsmoked sounds like an amazing idea, especially since I prefer organic everything! The problem is that this mate tastes nothing like normal mate, and really doesn't have a good taste. There are a lot of Americans who when they drink mate out of a gourd and bombilla who think that it tastes like dirt. Well this mate is definitely a dirt earthy taste. It tastes nothing like a good crop of mate, this is highly agreed by my Argentinian friend who ended up throwing his purchase in the garbage just after 2 gourds full, and eventually I tried to struggle through this yerba, but in the end it was just too much for me. Waste of money, and the many Argentinians that are friends of the family want to stay away from this mate, when even they would prefer to drink organic as well. Sorry eco teas, but your crafty wording, and healthy image doesn't always mean it is good. I mean just because you have a pretty label, and you take out all the stalk from your teas does not mean they are truly better. The stalk is fundamentally part of yerba mate, as an image and why waste the other part of the plant right? For an alternative to smoked mate and non organic there are better ones out there....

review/summary: Not My Cup of Tea!
review/text: I have tried many different types of Mate over the last few years. Flavored, unflavored, with herbs, with sweeteners, roasted, and organic. This is the first "Unsmoked" Mate that I can recall having tried and it has turned out to be the strangest Mate yet. My taste buds really hated me for sticking with this Mate. I can now say that the bag is finished, the damage is done, but man it really is bad tasting Mate. I gave this stuff and fair try and thought maybe it would grow on me, but like hell! This stuff tastes more like dirt and hay than it does Mate! As for why the taste is off, it is difficult to say what is actually going on. It is entirely different from the traditional taste of Mate. The bad taste has nothing to do with it being "Organic", that much I know. I've tried several "Organic" brands and this is the only one Ive had a problem with. I toyed with the idea that it may be a bad batch, but I know that's not the case as I've bought two bags of this stuff and it's the same taste. The only obvious problem with this Mate is it being unsmoked. So if you are looking to buy that traditional tasting Mate, look elsewhere. And another problem, perhaps, is a simple issue of it not being aged long enough? I don't know. I've heard that two years is the ideal length of time, but really don't know much about the subject of aging Mate. Anyways, I looked on the website for any information on how long it is aged but found nothing.<br /><br />As for recommendations on other Mate, and really I suggest finding another brand, here are some brands worth looking into; Titrayju (highly recommended), Roapipo (a personal favorite), Taragui, Cruz de Malta, Amanda, Nobleza Guacha, and Rosamante.<br /><br />Rosamante, Cruz de Malta, and Taraqui are all found on Amazon I believe. Good luck!

review/text: Someone I knew gave me a bag of this because they knew that I love mate unfortunately this is the worst mate I have ever had. The stuff is not even smoked which is weird because that has been part of the curing process ever since mate has been drank. The best way I could describe the taste of this mate is if you had a pile of really moist grass (like if you cut your lawn) and let it ferment in a dark warm room and then brewed it. Not good.

review/summary: Bold coffee, in between espresso and coffee
review/text: I bought the Tassimo (Bosch machine) for the darker Starbucks coffees available on it. But I've gone and tried many of the European and other brands available as well.<br /><br />The only brand that stands up to Starbucks for my personal taste test is Carte Noire. This is a little funny, because Carte Noire is a supermarket brand in France. (Kraft markets both Starbucks and Carte Noire in grocery channels, and they developed the Tassimo system.) To my taste, it's full-flavored without being overly bitter.<br /><br />This Carte Noire Kenya is one of my favorites. It's in between the espresso discs and Starbucks coffee discs. It is bolder/darker and more intense than the strong coffees like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WDCAJ2">Starbucks Verona</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WD93EW">Starbucks Kitamu</a>; but less bitter than straight espresso. The volume produced is in between as well--it underfills a coffee cup, but overflows an espresso cup. Finally, the Kenya is programmed in the Tassimo to add the "crema," the dark foam on top of an espresso, on a short cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you have Tassimo, and if you like the darker Starbucks blends on it, and you want to check out one of the European brands--this is the one to try.

If you like a fairly bold coffee in the european style (I lived in Germany for 3.5 years) then I would highly recommend this. I've tried all the Starbucks (African Kitamu is my fav from that line but I always stopped it a bit short during brewing to keep it a bit stronger) and this is way better. This is now going to be part of my tassimo collection and probably my daily coffee.

review/text: I tried Tassimo made coffee for the first time at a friends house. It just so happened to be the Kenya blend. When the coffee finished brewing I thought there was something wrong with the machine since such a small amount was produced with foamy stuff laying on the top. My friend said that was the way it suppose to be so I added some organic cream and organic sugar and WOW!!! The best coffee I have ever tasted. I drank it up like candy. If it wasn't 10:30pm I would have had a second cup. Now I am on a mission to buy my own Tassimo just so I can brew my own Kenya T-cups....

It has some earthy and chocolaty undertones, I would venture to say even fruity. This is not marketed as a crema, but yet it delivers a nice layer of crema that lasts to the last sip.<br /><br />I do not find this coffee very acidic; it is not a true bold coffee, but yet it does deliver a very smooth full bodied flavor. If you like the Verona / Kitamu or the ML Crema, you are going to enjoy this great cup of jeaux.<br /><br />If you are expecting a venti size cup, be forewarned this serves about 4oz of pure caffeine Stardome!

review/summary: One of our very top picks for the Tassimo coffee choices!
review/text: We've bought probably every single "upper end" (that sounds so bad but I just mean we don't like Maxwell House etc. and I don't know how else to say it.) coffee for the Tassimo just to try new things all the time. We recently got these and it quickly became one of our absolute favorites. It has a VERY smooth taste, it's got a full flavor that is a touch fruity and is made with 100% Kenyan Arabica beans, rather than a blend like you often see in other brands.<br /><br />Negatives: This is "European style" so you should know it's a smaller cup.  If more is important to you, you might want to go with Starbucks since they seem to make the largest cups. This doesn't mean this one is stronger and that one is watered down since the Tassimo reads how much water to add to whatever brand you put in from the barcode on the disc. The Starbucks we found that is closest to this is their Kitamu. I like that the t-disc makes more of that one, however we do like this taste better...it's smoother. So it's really what's important to you. Size or taste...some mornings we need the largest cup!<br /><br />Conclusion: Excellent coffee. Wish it was "American sized" rather than European but it's still great!

review/text: I purchased because I like bran muffins and have been unable to buy them locally since they're available only some of the time. Easy recipe on the bag with few additional ingredients needed. I prefer to add some apple sauce to provide additional moisture and a few raisins for texture and flavor. Further (independent) research on the product reveals that this product is very healthy in that it contains whole grains and unbleached flower. I prefer to sweeten with Agave Nectar which is also billed as a healthy choice. I like it because it tastes good...

review/summary: Nice healthy food -Udate - New grain free flavors!!
review/text: I like this food for my dog. Avaoderm seems like a repudable company. Dogfoodadvisor is a good website to go to to find good information about all kibble and wet food. My dog likes this food, and did very well on it. Her coat was super soft and she had lots of energy. I just noticed during the summer months her urine burned the grass. After some reading on the subject I found that high fish and beef diets can increase the uric acid in dogs and cause burn spots on your grass. Once off the fish and beef soley foods the urin grass burns stopped.<br /><br />Update: Avoderm just came out with a revolving grain free line of kibble. Turkey, Duck, and Trout. My dog is on the Turkey and loves it. She is allergic to Chicken. Even though this has chicken fat in it, it's the chicken protein she is allergic to and chicken fat does not contain the protein. I buy thick slices of fresh, low sodium turkey at the deli and top the food with peices of turkey and she eats everything. I could barely get her to eat once a day and now she is eating 2 -3 times a day and seems to be enjoying it. So far Petsmart, and Webers is the only ones carrying it. I give the Turkey a 5 stars!!!

review/text: My chihuahua/dachshund developed a horrendous skin allergy which got worse when he went outside. He scratched so much, we took him to the vet for a shot, prednisone and antibiotics. I had read about the benefits of Avoderm, and already was feeding them this dog food. I also have a miniature schnauzer. I noticed, when I didn't have Avoderm for a week, but did have Blue Buffalo which is also high quality, that my mix began to shed noticeably. When I bought more Avoderm, he hardly shed. That alone, is reasons for Avoderm. We also bath him with Avoderm shampoo which works effectively with this dog food. He is still on Prednisone, and I bought the largest bag of Avoderm available. With my schnauzer, I've noticed minute changes...no outside odor when she comes inside, breath smells better, even better mood and more running and jumping. She is older.<br /><br />Another benefit, and this is a huge plus, they seem to empty their bowls instead of letting it sit in the evening when they are fed. My mix is still of puppy age so I feed them "All Stages no grain" dogfood. It's not the cheapest, but the benefits make it worth it. I'm very pleased.

review/text: We have an old Jack Russell who started exhibiting stress-related problems after our other dog died. Her skin was looking bad and she was chewing on her own feet and legs. I suspected that depression was suppressing her immune system from the loss of her housemate. So I ditched her garden-variety lamb/rice dog food and got her this grainless salmon potato blend instead. It worked! She stopped chewing herself and the skin irritations from that cleared up. She still has some other bumps but she is generally very improved and no longer presents stress-related behaviors or symptoms. Best of all, with this food her poop stopped stinking. Salmon!

review/summary: Very Good Dog Food For Dry Skin & High Allergies
review/text: My dog is allergic to almost all major ingredients in almost all dog food. I feed him RAW food but it's getting kind of expensive. He doesn't like eating chicken. Which is the cheapest of all RAW food. He is highly allergic to beef, turkey, duck, egg, wheat, soy, barley, sweet potato, and his list goes on =( So its very hard to find a dog food that has nothing he is allergic too. Have tried so many brands it's unbelievable. Because even if one item is on the very bottom of the list he would break out everywhere for days. his nose turn pink etc. I feed him raw food which he loves and has no problem at all but we travel & sometimes its very hard to have raw meat with you. So it's just a bit easier if he ate kibbles. His poop is solid hard with Avoderm Salmon Grain Free. His coat is shiner & soft. The only thing I don't like about this is that Peas is the 1st ingredients on the list. Also tomato pomace is a controversial ingredient most people say its a by-product remaining after processing tomatoes into juice, soup and ketchup.<br />But so far my dog is very happy eating this and he can't wait until it's time for him to eat.<br /><br />But I will keep looking for something better which is really hard unless I make my own dog food which I don't have time for =(

review/summary: Mind the Laxative Threshold Value (LTV)
review/text: The Amber Lyn sugar free (!) DARK CHOCOLATE & COCOA NIBS bar, weighing-in at 34 grams with the ingredients unsweetened chocolate, maltitol (from wheat), cocoa butter, unsweetened cacao nibs, soy lecithin, and natural vanilla is good eats even if you're not a diabetic. (Maltitol is also commercially derived from corn and potatoes, which is good to know in case you want to whip up a batch at home.)<br /><br />An ever bigger endorsement comes from my nutrition-conscious wife who, while wagging her finger at my dietary lapses and counting-up the potential life insurance payout from my expected cheese burger-induced demise, finds nothing overly objectionable in the candy's Nutrition Facts for the 1-bar serving: Calories 170, Fat Cal. 110, Total Fat 12g, Sat. Fat 8g, Trans Fat 0g, Cholest. 0mg, Sodium 25mg, Total Carb 19g, Dietary Fiber 2g, Sugars 0g, Maltitol 15g, Protein 2g, Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 1%, Iron 5%.<br /><br />After munching a bar down, the wife's comment was "Smooth, with a nice crunch!" (I must mention at this point that she's the dark chocolate aficionado in this house.)<br /><br />While I think the bar is pretty good also, I'm the cerebral type that finds more of interest in the product packaging. There is the tag line "Fine Belgian Chocolate", as well as the reminders that the confection is "gluten free", "carb controlled" and "all natural."<br /><br />Interestingly, while the Total Carbs dose is listed as 19g, the Net Carbs is but 2g and the "Non-Impact Carbs" is 17g. I had to ask the in-house expert about that last bit, and she said that was the non-digestible total represented by the 15g Maltitol plus 2g Dietary Fiber. Gee, who would've guessed?<br /><br />But, for me, the MOST INTERESTING component of the label is the very small print advisory that "Excessive consumption may have a mild laxative effect." What's that all about?<br /><br />A bit of research reveals that maltitol is one of several polyols, i.e. low digestible carbohydrates, which can cause flatulence and, um, loose stools. It seems that each polyol has a certain laxation threshold, which is the amount of the polyol that can be consumed on a daily basis before the laxative effect is likely to kick in (though the outcome, so to speak, differs among individuals). The threshold is expressed as the LTV, or Laxative Threshold Value. The relevant point here is that the LTV for maltitol is 100g - or just over six DARK CHOCOLATE & COCOA NIBS bars! Is seven excessive? (I wonder if that many cheeseburgers have the same effect. Maybe if they're double-doubles. You think?)<br /><br />Also of note was the fact that Amber Lyn Chocolates, Inc. is located in St. George, UT. I've driven through there twice without taking much notice. I may have to go back; perhaps the company has a factory outlet store. If so, I'm in!

review/summary: rather dry
review/text: These cookies are much healthier than other large, soft, packaged cookies. Unfortunately, they taste like it. They are relatively low in sugar and fat, which is good, and they actually have a very nice flavor. The only problem is that they are dry and "airy" and fall apart. I thought about dipping them in milk, but with the texture, they'd fall apart into nothing. I've been looking for a good breakfast cookie that is healthy and my kids will eat. This is not it.

review/summary: Neither tasty nor healthy
review/text: I tried one of these cookies without looking at the nutrition label and I think the taste was at the one star level.  It tasted highly processed and while soft, was dry.  It didn't have the taste of an indulgent treat.  I give it an extra star because my child seemed to like it.<br /><br />However, I wouldn't want my children eating these often because when I looked at the nutrition label, I saw that indeed, these cookies are highly processed.  Yes, the first ingredient is whole grain oat flour and rolled oats and whole wheat flour are up there.  So I suppose things could be worse.  The four grams of fiber per serving is nice, though it may come from the inulin rather than the whole grains.  What is not nice is the palm oil, multiple sugars (including corn syrup) and multiple preservatives in the ingredient list.<br /><br />The cookies are individually wrapped and the packaging is probably the most attractive part of the product.<br /><br />For myself or my children, a home baked cookie would be much preferable to these. So would a power bar or a handful of nuts, which would also be more healthy. Or a packaged cookie with fewer preservatives.  I wouldn't purchase these again.

review/summary: Bland
review/text: I don't expect the taste of home-made from a store-bought cookie - it's a naughty pleasure, and I expect a consistent chewiness and not-too-crumbly texture combined with sweetness and, when chocolate chips and nuts are involved, some pleasing chunks of crunchiness and bursts of chocolate flavor.  Well, Quaker Oats got the TEXTURE right...<br /><br />These cookies were a TOTAL disappointment.  There's just NO richness to them at ALL - the flavor is mostly a sort of mechanical reference to the taste of oatmeal in a real homemade cookie. Even when licking one of the chocolate chips directly, the chocolate taste just sort of briefly tantalizes then evaporates, and the nut-bits are too small to be noticeable.<br /><br />I won't be looking for these in stores!

review/summary: Where Is The Taste?
review/text: Maybe my taste buds are impaired, but these cookies taste like nothing!<br /><br />No oatmeal taste, no chocolate taste, and as for the almonds, all you feel is the crunch when you bite into them, but no almond flavor.<br /><br />I normally LOVE the taste of chocolate and almond, but not these!<br /><br />I wonder who in the company tested these, or tasted these BEFORE they were put out for sale?<br /><br />It makes me wonder how good their taste buds are!!<br /><br />It's very disappointing, because this is a Quaker product, which has been around as long as I can remember.<br /><br />On the back of the box they show Granola Cookies. I wonder if those taste any better, or if there is any taste to those either?<br /><br />The best thing I can say about these cookies, is that they are individually wrapped, and fairly high in fiber, 4 grams per cookie, which is 16%.  The sugar content of each cookie is 9 grams, so not too bad. The carbohydrates are 26 grams, which is kind of high, at least to me, per cookie.<br /><br />Calorie wise they are 180 calories per cookie.  The total fat is 8 grams, of which 2 of those grams are saturated fat, 15 milligrams of cholesterol, which is 5%, 160 mg of sodium, which is 7%.<br /><br />What really bothers me is that there is a LONG list of ingredients.<br /><br />I tried two of these cookies, to see if I felt any different about the taste.  Unfortunately the second cookie tasted like the first one, which was actually no taste.<br /><br />If you like beyond bland foods you may like these cookies, but if you think a cookie should actually taste like something, I would pass these cookies by!

review/text: Disappointed in these on flavor or make that lack of flavor.  They taste like a cereal bar to me.  Nice and soft, just not much taste.  I think you would be better off with the lower cost oatmeal cookies at the bakery.  The only advantage to these is the convenience of individual wrapping, but that is what plastic baggies are for.  Sorry, these strike out as being tasty.  There are better cookies at your store bakery department.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: I thought these were ok. Not great but not terrible. I'll end up eating the rest of them but I don't know if I'll continue to buy them. I like that they are individually packaged. I like their medium size. I like that they are soft-baked.<br /><br />Otherwise I thought they were rather dry and tasteless and they did a lot of crumbling.  The almonds were whole but small and the chocolate was in small chunks but there weren't enough of either to be a very strong taste.  I even thought it could have used more oatmeal which maybe would have kept it from being so crumbly.<br /><br />I guess I was just expecting more of a sweet taste from something with chocolate and almonds.  Adding brown sugar probably would have ruined the nutrition label but it would have helped the taste problem considerably.

review/summary: No Flavor
review/text: Hate to say it, but these were pretty dry and tasteless.<br /><br />My daughter and I both tried one, and the first thing my daughter said was, "These have chocolate chips?"<br /><br />I said, "Yes."<br /><br />She studied the cookie as she ate, then said, "I can't even taste them." Then she picked one of the chips out of the cookie and ate it on its own. "Are they REAL chocolate chips, or fake?"<br /><br />I read the package. "Says they're real chocolate chips."<br /><br />"They don't taste like any chocolate chip I've ever eaten. They taste fake."<br /><br />I agreed, but I do understand that to deliver a soft cookie that stays soft, but is still preserved, you have to put stuff in the cookie that's not exactly what Grandma would put in her own cookies. They do have a slightly chemical taste, but that's typical for this kind of cookie. I would have liked them to be a bit less dry. I found I had to drink a whole bottle of water while I ate just one of these.<br /><br />While they do have slightly more healthy stuff than, say, a normal packaged chocolate chip cookie, (I did like that they had 4 grams of fiber), I just felt myself wishing they would taste slightly better.

review/summary: soft but dry and crumbly.....
review/text: Ok, I'll admit, I do bake a lot, so maybe my expectations were too high....My first impression was that it was a nice big cookie, but it didn't smell like an oatmeal cookie.  Next I broke off a bit, thinking, ok, soft, usually means butter or shortening, so I didn't expect the cookie to crumble...ok, I was disappointed right there, but the real disappointment came at the first bite.  I don't know, but this did not taste like any oatmeal cookie I've ever tasted....no cinnamon or brown sugar flavor, just....well, kind of sawdusty.  I couldn't make out the almond and barely tasted the chocolate.  I think on every level this cookie was not a winner.  If I was absolutely desperate to eat something I would probably eat one I suppose, but I definitely would not buy these.<br /><br />Overall, no taste, terrible texture and a disappointment from start to finish. Quaker would do well to go back to the drawing board on this one and make a chewier, soft cookie with a bit of flavor to it.

review/summary: very dry!
review/text: For an oatmeal cookie I was very surprised at how dry these were; usually oatmeal cookies, and particularly commercially produced ones, are super soft.  Definitely needed a glass of milk to get it down.  On the positive side, there were quite a bit of almonds -- larger bits at that -- which are often promised but not delivered.  The chocolate chunks were not plentiful but I didn't mind that as much as I don't like big hunks of chocolate in my cookies; chocolate lovers might be a bit disappointed.  Due to the dryness of this cookie I wouldn't be likely to purchase these in the store as I really prefer a much moister cookie.

review/summary: Not too bad for a soft baked cookie
review/text: Each box contains 6 individually packaged ("Packs To Go") cookies.<br /><br />The cookies list out at 1.48 oz each and 180 calories.<br /><br />The cookies are anywhere from 3 to 3.25 inches in diameter, and uniformly about a half inch thick.<br /><br />They do come out of the wrapper pretty soft and when you break the cookie in half it splits pretty well and doesn't crumble too much.<br /><br />I noticed a great deal more almond pieces in my cookies than chocolate "chunks", but I also noticed some of the chocolate had melted int he wrapper and was maybe left inside.<br /><br />The texture is good, but once you start chew the cookie just kind of come apart in your mouth, but in my experience that is how most "Soft Baked" cookies are.  Plus, these are oatmeal cookie so the texture is much looser, you do definitely see and taste the oats which is nice.<br /><br />The flavor is okay, the chocolate is nothing special, I would say the almonds are of good quality and flavor.  The cookie itself is sweet, but not too, with an okay butter and vanilla flavor to them.  Which is surprising since there is no butter in the ingredients, I can only guess the flavor was added.<br /><br />Overall a decent cookie, nothing special, but they are soft, and come individually wrapped so you don't have to worry about them drying out.  I think without much effort you could make something just as good at home, but if you are looking for something to throw in the lunchbox that provides some fiber (4g) and some nuts (3g protein) you wouldn't be too far off going with these.<br /><br />If you have a question feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to answer.

review/summary: Just make them yourself
review/text: I don't generally buy packaged cookies.  I am of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114964">Michael Pollan</a> camp that says if you want to eat something unhealthy, then make it yourself.  It will taste better, and be packed with actual ingredients instead of chemical filler.<br /><br />And yes, these "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond" are unhealthy, no matter that they are qualified with "a wholesome way to satisfy your sweet tooth."  There may be 10 grams of whole grains per serving, but look closely at that ingredients list and you will find a whole bunch of things that mother nature never intended to be used as food.  Each cookie carries a pretty hefty calorie count as well, so this isn't a carefree snack.<br /><br />They taste ... OK.  They have that same chemical aftertaste of most packaged cookies, and for a soft cookie they are somewhat dry and flavorless.  There are chocolate chunks and almonds,  which is a nice addition, but doesn't make up for the chemical flavor and dryness.<br /><br />For me, I will just stick with homemade.  Oatmeal cookies are easy and fun to make, and taste 100% better than these packaged ones.  Quaker Oats has some good ideas, and I think I will toss some almonds and real chocolate chips into my next batch of cookies, but I won't be buying these again.

review/summary: Gritty and dry cookies
review/text: I usually love Quaker products, but lately the two items I've tried have disappointed me.  These cookies are SO dry, the nuts and chocolate are so tiny, you can't even see them, and the texture is simply dreadful.  I doubt I'll get anyone in my family to finish this box, I'll probably bring them to my brother, he'll eat anything!<br /><br />As far as packaging goes, I love the individual wrapped style.  They would certainly keep them fresher than other sorts of packaging I've seen with cookies, but again, these just aren't worth the trouble.  Get yourself some Chunky Chips Ahoy if you are looking for a cookie.  If you want health food, buy some apples!  I hate when companies try to make a healthier cookie.  If people wanted health food, they wouldn't buy a cookie!

review/text: If you are expecting Grandma's soft and deliciously moist cookies, you will be seriously disappointed. 6 small cookies come in the package. Out of the six, two did not have even ONE chocolate chip on them. For size and content, please take a look at the pictures I have uploaded.<br /> The flavor leaves a lot to be desired. While they are soft, they are very dry if that makes sense. You feel the need to drink a LOT of milk or water with them. Out of our family of four, two of us thought they were horrible tasting and two thought they were okay. Price wise - just not worth it.

review/text: I didn't find these to be particularly good. I don't expect them to be the same quality as homemade but these were not even good for a store bought cookie. As other reviewers mentioned, they are very dry and bland.<br /><br />The quote on the back that says "Try one, you won't believe it's that good!" is kind of laughable.<br /><br />I also thought it odd that they come individually wrapped packages of *one* cookie each. You'd think if they were going to be individually wrapped they would come with at least two. Seems like a lot of packaging waste and expense for cookies that aren't even that good. I could get better cookies from the grocery store bakery.

review/text: What I like about this cookie:<br /><br />The size: It's not huge, but definitely large so one is quite filling.<br />The taste: Very nice, subtle blend of oatmeal, chocolate (real pieces) and almond pieces.<br />The freshness: I don't usually like boxed cookies. They tend to be unexciting and dry. But these cookies are specially wrapped individually so that they maintain freshness and softness.<br /><br />True, one must handle them gently as they do crumble easily. If one does that, they shouldn't crumble. I find they taste especially nice with coffee, hot or iced.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this cookie and am looking forward to finishing the box. Would definitely purchase these and I rarely buy cookies in the store.

review/summary: Healthy rival to cookies made by my wife, mother, & grandma
review/text: A reliable soft oatmeal cookie among brand-name manufactured choices, as compared to homemade. I review, thus, on what it is, a 5-star, but my wife's oatmeal cookies are 6-star, of course. Being older, diet conscious, and needing to watch nutrition labels due to health conditions, I found this cookie to compare favorably with another brand recommended by my doctor & nutritionist. Honest! The big difference is the other had a serving size of 30g while this individually packaged cookie is 42g. Quaker oatmeal cookies had 3 � inch diameter, full � inch thick, with a shelf life of 4 months after arrival into my house. Too good to keep shelved that long. Grandkids approved.<br /><br />Comparing nutrition on equal gram basis, the oatmeal was fractionally more on calories & fat, but considerably better on sodium and fiber (things important on my diet.) Ideal for moms packing lunches, or office people needing a snack, I'd recommend this since the cookie is large enough to halve, making 2 snacks, or use as is. Being less than a chocoholic, the bits of chocolate were just enough. Being a giant nut fan, the ample almonds won me over. Almonds are the healthiest nut according to my nutritionist. Being a 64-year-old Quaker Oatmeal fan may have helped, as I enjoy oatmeal in meatloaf, bread, cookies, pie crust, cornbread, biscuits, granola, and any form except hot breakfast.<br /><br />I will be trying another Quaker oatmeal cookie flavor.

review/text: Okay, taste is subjective, so your mileage may vary when it comes to these cookies. With that disclaimer, I will say that I was looking forward to consuming these cookies because I do not just have a sweet tooth, all of my teeth are sweet--and baked goods are my number one temptation. I had one of these cookies and did not want another, even when I was jonesing for sweets and dying of hunger. I wouldn't even eat a second one of these when there was nothing else available. That's a bad sign. I ended up putting out my box in the break room at work, where they were snatched up (note: if you put out a half-eaten sandwich in that breakroom, someone is sure to eat it, if you get my drift). The cookies were bland, dry and nothing at all like good homemade cookies. If you're going to indulge, don't waste calories on something like this!

Compare to the ultra decadent Pepperidge Farm big cookies? this is just bland by itself. With coffee, the flavors perked considerably.<br /><br />Me, if I need a big cookie for lunch packing, I'll spring for the Pepperidge Farm and get total indulgence. However moms and dads with kids might like the fact that each of these is individually wrapped and that Quaker is a good quality company.

review/text: In my mind, to qualify as a "cookie," a food needs to possess two ingredients: sugar and fat. If you reduce or eliminate either or both of those, you no longer have a "cookie," but a sad imitation of one, generally not worth eating. Quaker has tried to make a better-for-you cookie not by reducing its evil components, but by adding other virtuous ones, in this case whole grain oats. This yields a cookie with whole grain and fiber to offset, at least partially, its less nutritious aspects.<br /><br />Let's look at the numbers of two very classic cookies. Three Nabisco Oreos weigh 34 grams, have 160 calories, 7 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber. Three Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip cookies weigh 33 grams, have 160 calories, 8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber.<br /><br />One of these Quakers weighs 42 grams, has 180 calories, 8 grams of fat and 4 grams of fiber. So you get about 25% more cookie for about the same calories and fat, and you get 4 times the fiber. If they were as good as the other two, you'd have a hands down winner. Unfortunately, this is where reality intrudes. They aren't.<br /><br />On the other hand, they're not bad at all, perhaps just a step behind the Nabiscos and Keeblers that we all love. If you're like me and have reached that stage of life where you need to be sure to get enough fiber every day, they represent a painless way to get about a sixth of what's needed. And you will feel like you've eaten a cookie and not a styrofoam imposter.

review/summary: Good, Healthy Pick Me Up
review/text: With the temps this Summer being in the 90's and 100's, it's been 1/2 a year since I turned on the oven and baked anything. I love to have a small sweetie to snack on in the afternoons to provide a pick me up and this does the job nicely. I enjoy it coming in an individually wrapped package so I didn't have to have an entire box of cookies go stale in the humidity. Much healthier than I normally like my snacks, it was still very sweet and tasty and actually stayed with me much longer than a regular high fat cookie. I plan on keeping more of these around so I can toss one into my work bag in the morning and munch on it when I feel the need for "sweet".

review/summary: Blech!
review/text: The good thing about these cookies?  They have a lot of fiber.  The bad thing?  They have a lot of fiber.  As I chewed, all of that fiber made me think that I was eating sawdust.  The first ingredient on the list is whole grain oat flour.  Good.  However, the ingredient list is rather extensive and includes many different types of sugar in the form of sugar: fructose, invert sugar syrup, sugar, honey, corn syrup and brown sugar molasses.  Quite a variety of sugars there!  Which is interesting, since the cookie itself isn't very sweet.  Actually, the sweetness level is just right, in my opinion.<br /><br />The total carbohydrate count for one cookie is 26 grams.  Total fat = 8 grams.  Sugars = 9 grams.  I'm not so sure that this is the healthiest option for a snack.  Probably a better choice than a candy bar since it has fiber, but not something you'd want to snack on if you're on a diet.<br /><br />Bottom line?  The texture is very gritty and the taste is okay (not too sweet).  However, it is not a low calorie, low sugar snack.  If you're dieting, these probably wouldn't be a good choice.

review/summary: Okay but not the bomb.
review/text: I had high expectations for these cookies but they weren't quite as good as I anticipated.<br /><br />They are very chewy and fresh-tasting -- that's the good news. But they're not exactly bursting with flavor and, as moist as they seem to the touch, they tasted dry as I ate them. My wife said the same, unprompted. I tried them with black coffee and they're just a bit gluey as you munch.<br /><br />If you want chocolate, this would not be a great choice. If you want something more akin to the mild taste of a scone, these individually-wrapped cookies would be okay if you don't mind the dryness.

review/summary: As Close to Homemade as I've Ever Tasted!
review/text: I'm very picky about my cookies, especially oatmeal and chocolate chip. I greatly prefer homemade over store-bought, and I will frequently turn down a store bought cookie.<br /><br />I would have a hard time turning down Quaker's chocolate almond oatmeal cookie!<br /><br />These do not have the over-processed taste of many boxed chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies. The texture is perfect, and they are pretty close to home-baked goodness! My only complaint about the taste of the cookie is that the chocolate and almonds are sparse. The size of the bits as shown on the box is pretty accurate, but more numerous than what we found to actually be in each cookie. Some cookies only had two or three bits each of chocolate and almond. For a cookie that is rather large like this one, I would increase the nuts and chocolate by at least 50%, but preferably a whole lot more.<br /><br />In all honestly, six large cookies in each box makes this a rather impractical packaging for our family of five. But, the cookies are good, so they will definitely go on our list for times when we are out and about and can't just whip up a batch of homemade chocolate chunk oatmeal cookies.

review/summary: Soft and Fresh
review/text: Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are indeed soft. Individual wrapping of each cookie ensures that they stay soft and fresh until your are ready to eat them. Unfortunately, they are very bland tasting, which is a surprise for Quaker products. I wouldn't buy them if you expect a flavorful cookie. So you trade soft and fresh for flavorful. So if you are looking for cookies that excite your taste buds, I'm afraid you will have to look elsewhere.

review/text: the cookie is moist and chewy and has a great deal of sweetness from the combination of almonds and oats. if it had a little more chocolate it would be an excellent cookie. i couldn't help it, but every time i had one, i was chewing for the chocolate after the first few bites. and there wasn't enough there to keep me interested. but, i wouldn't put them out of my lunchbox by any means.

review/text: Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorite cookies and so I was looking forward to trying these cookies, made by Quaker.  Needless to say from the title of this review, the cookies are dry, bland and taste nothing like the oatmeal cookies I can make at home with Quaker Oats, using their recipe.  This cookie crumbles easily and the consistency is akin to drywall.  No thanks!

review/text: Personally, I loved the Quaker Oatmeal cookies. But, I usually eat healthier cookies, so I don't know if that makes a difference or not. To me, they had a great oatmeal and chocolate taste. They were soft and chewy. Also, they are easy to take places, because they are individually wrapped. They are pretty big cookies, so they will be a great on the go snack. I would recommend them, as I thought they were really tasty.

review/summary: Not something I'd get with my own money
review/text: I'd selected this without seeing that it had almonds in it (reading fail, I know) but I had a house full of critics to run this through.<br /><br />My mother ripped into the box before I even had a chance to ask her if she wanted one. She was actually somewhat disappointed, as this was exactly the type of thing she likes. She said that they're good, but that they're sort of mediocre as far as cookies go. My grandparents liked the cookies and would eat them, but it was clear that it was only because they're there.<br /><br />I do have an allergic reaction to tree nuts, but for the sake of the review I tried a tiny piece. (Don't worry, I took precautions and I felt I owed it to at least try the cookie myself..) It's pretty bland and while it smells really great and is very soft, those two things just didn't translate into a huge flavor situation.<br /><br />The general consensus was that while these were decent enough to eat, they're really not something anyone is overwhelmed by. The box has sat in the kitchen pantry for almost a month now and there's still half a box left, if that says anything to you. This is just a mediocre cookie. If my family had liked these then I'd have gladly bought some for them again (I love feeding them), but their reaction was so ambivalent that I don't think I'd get these on my own.

review/text: I love to bake, but it is nice to have some foods on hand for a snack in a pinch. My kids loved these soft chocolate almond oatmeal cookies! They are individually wrapped for freshness and would be great for packing in a school lunch. They were a wee bit skimpy on the chocolate part, but they still tasted pretty good. I liked how they didn't crumble all over the place.<br /><br />You only get six in a box, but they are meant to be a treat afterall. I will probably buy again.

review/text: I received Quaker Soft baked Oatmeal cookie, chocolate almond box by post. What I saw after receiving it baffled me. Even though each of the cookie has been individually wrapped, the cookies are not fresh enough when you open them. They lack the crispness. Due to this the flavor of the product is lost. I did not relish this cookie as much as I would have loved it to be.

review/summary: These disappeared from my kitchen though they are crumbly
review/text: For a soft style cookie, these are a bit crumbly, or maybe they were that way being sent in the mail.  I enjoyed the taste of them.  I am used to oatmeal cookies though, my boyfriend loves them and took off with half the box.  I do feel slightly bad all the cookies are wrapped individually in a box.  Though I can recycle the box, it seems a lot of unnecessary packaging.  Overall, the cookies have a good soft yet crumble to them, they taste like oatmeal cookies with the tasty addition of chocolate chips and almonds. Both of those items tasted true for form.  Not something I would go out of my way for, but if they were on sale or someone offered me one, I wouldn't refuse it.

review/summary: school lunch snack?
review/text: This is a pretty substantial cookie with a decent amount of fiber conveniently packaged for work or school. At 180 calories per cookie (1 per pack) it's not a diet food in my opinion, and it's not a gourmet treat (nothing like, say, a Pepperdige Farm cookie in the taste department). It is a dry, soft cookie with pleasant chocolate and almond flavor. Decent choice for a school lunch or on-th-go snack, but unlikely to satisfy a cookie lover wanting a treat.

review/summary: Too Soft And Not that Tasty
review/text: Is there such thing as a too soft cookie? Yes, yes there is. I am amazed these cookies managed to get shipped to my place without falling apart in the wrapper. They crumble pretty badly when you take them out. In terms of texture, there is something just off about them. They are soft cookies but do not mistake that description as chewy. In fairness, quaker doesn't really call them chewy anyway, but I think some people will expect that they are. Sweetness is... okay, but it feels lacking in a cookie. Yes, I realize these are supposed to be wholesome, but the problem is there are better tasting soft cookies out there that are natural, organic and wholesome. Kashi has better line of cookies that I love. I am not saying that because I am on a health food kick or need to throw out brands that claim to be green and "whole". I still like a Grandma cookie now and then, and Sandies and Grasshoppers. These cookies are... just not satisfying.  If you don't like chewy, Kashi or other name brand cookies, maybe these would be for you because texturally and taste wise they are different.<br /><br /> Just a warning, if you hand these to children, expect to pick up crumbs wherever they go.

review/summary: Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie w/chocolate and almonds
review/text: I am on the fence with these, as they are pretty tasty for being a store bought cookie but they are 180 calories each, and granted they are a decent size, it would be WAY easy to eat several at one sitting. Maybe the good thing is they come individually wrapped so you stop and think before you eat more than 1 cookie. I know my husband would of had more =) I'm not so sure I would purchase these on a regular basis, but I can see where they would be VERY convenient for travel or for lunches.

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: I am a big Quaker Oats brand fan.  But, these cookies are horrible.  And that's not just my opinion.  Two others in my family sampled this cookie and were equally appalled at its taste.  So, let's start there.  This cookie is almost tasteless:  no almond flavor; nor chocolate; and there is no pronounced earthy oatmeal flavor, too.<br /><br />The cookie is soft, and while I don't care for soft cookies, the other two do, but this soft baked oatmeal cookie didn't win any fans between them.  To Quaker's credit, they individually wrap each cookie to maintain its softness.<br /><br />Each cookie is nearly 200 calories for barely more than an ounce of pleasure.  The box's photo leads one to believe there are large chunks of chocolate and almonds lodged in each cookie.  That's just not the case--unless you are viewing them with a magnifying glass.<br /><br />In our house, cookies cannot get stale.  They're gobbled up and gone in no time.  It's no exaggeration to say that this less-than-half-eaten cookie sat on the kitchen counter for over 24 hours and would be there still, had we not thrown it into the garbage can.<br /><br />Overall, this new product is a disappointment.  If it were possible to rate it below one star, that's what it would earn.<br /><br />Quaker, we love you, but send your bakers back into the test kitchen.  This one's a dud!

review/summary: Suprisingly Not-so-Good
review/text: I'm usually a pretty big fan of Quaker products and I was certainly tempted by the picture on the box.  It's great that whole-grain oat flour is used to make these cookies, and it's also great that each cookie comes with 4 grams of dietary fiber which is about 16% of what we each need in an ideal day.  The taste however, is merely OK and that's putting a good spin on it.  I was glad to see that each cookie is individually wrapped and when I unwrapped my first cookie, it certainly seemed moist and inviting.  But when I bit into it, my anticipation turned to disapointment. The fiber must come from sawdust because that was my first thought.  The flavor was mediocre at best, not very strong and not, unfortunately, enough to overcome the fibrous texture.  I wish I could taste some of the almond flavor and a bit more chocolaty goodness instead of the bland nature of the oat flour.<br /><br />So if you're looking for healthy snacks, there are better alternatives out there that offer all of the fiber, etc. but without the 180 calories per cookie.  And if you're looking for a good tasting cookie, well, then I'd avoid this product all together.

Yeesh. I was expecting something like an "Archway" cookie from the mid-70s -- soft cookies you'd put in a lunchbox. I'm unclear what the story is with these cookies, but they're just not very good. Far from what we expected. Not worth buying.

review/summary: Not a bad cookie
review/text: The Quaker chocolate and almond naturally flavored oatmeal cookie is really not bad.  I recently got a package of six individually wrapped cookies.  I ate the first one, and was surprised at how fresh it tasted.  You can really taste the milk chocolate, as well as the small nuts in the cookie ( I assume the chocolate and the nuts are not larger in the cookie due to the company wanting to control calorie content).  And speaking of calorie content, each cookie according to the package has 180 calories.<br /><br />Some of the few drawbacks with this cookie are the small size of the nuts and chocolate used to make the cookie. As I mentioned above, I am sure the company did this to control calorie content.  This cookie also bills itself as a "good source of fiber" - that is right on the package - yet I could not find any type of breakdown on fiber content per cookie on the box package or the individual wrapping.<br /><br />In summary, this is a product that will appeal to women trying to pack a more nutritious lunch for themselves on a work day or for their children in their lunch to school.

review/summary: More Healthy Than Flavorful
review/text: I'm really on the fence on this product.  On the one hand, I certainly appreciate the effort that went into making a truly healthy cookie.  Each cookie contains only 9 grams of sugar, zero Trans Fats and 16% of the recommended daily fiber intake.  This is a truly great cookie from a health standpoint.<br /><br />However, 9 grams of sugar doesn't have much taste or sweetness.  I didn't know if I was eating a cookie or a bowl of dry oats.  Now dry outs may be very good for you, but they're not terribly tasty, and the flavor of Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies was, on the whole, rather a disappointment.  It tasted nothing like what I expect an oatmeal cookie to taste like, and I don't mean that in a complimentary way.  And these were chocolate chip almond oatmeal cookies?  I really couldn't taste the chocolate chips or the almonds.<br /><br />The box contained six cookies, individually wrapped.  But the size of each cookie was not terribly impressive, especially considering that there are only six cookies to a box.<br /><br />In the end, I will give it five stars for wholesomeness, but detract two for flavor.  And when it comes to oatmeal cookies, I like flavor.
