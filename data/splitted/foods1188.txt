review/summary: Fantastic for little fingers
review/text: We attribute our son's new-found interest in eating finger foods to these little cheese sticks.  He first discovered them on a visit to grandma's.  They're perfect - long enough that he can hold them in his hand and still bite off the ends, and he appears to think they're quite delicious.  He's start being interested in other finger foods now that he has mastered these, but they are by far his favorites.  Would definitely recommend!

review/text: I love these and my 8 month old loves them but I don't think the product canister does a good job of keeping them fresh.  It seems like they go stale VERY fast.  I don't think the baby cares but since I eat them with her it bothers me.

review/summary: Too hard to eat!
review/text: Gerber has an amazing line of products for babies and toddlers, but this product is a miss.  The Wagon Wheels are extremely hard.  They do not dissolve at all in the mouth.  I had hoped they would be similar to the puffs Gerber makes (only larger), but they are nothing like them.  We had to toss these.  I was scared my child would hurt her teeth or choke.

review/summary: My 15-mo. old son LOVES these.
review/text: I wish I knew how to make these with a bit less salt. ALL my kids want to eat them from the 13 y.o. down to the toddler, but we try to save them for travel or a special snack because they cost so much per pound!<br />They do taste very good. They are more spicy (not hot, just spice) than I had anticipated, but my toddler likes that. If yours doesn't like spice or you don't want them to eat a snack with a higher salt content (for toddlers) I'd skip buying this.<br />I did buy these earlier, but then waited to feed my son until he was old enough to handle the spice.

review/text: I got these for my 8 month old twins, who at the moment are very big on self-feeding (and not on spoon feeding haha).  These are nice because they are bigger than the puffs and easier for them to hold on to.  They are pretty good, basically just a healthier version of cheese curls though.  My mother-in-law bought them the cinnamon maple flavor, and they are wonderful!  I wish they had a variety 6 pack on Amazon so that we could try all the flavors!

review/summary: good flavor, perfect crunchy texture
review/text: My 10 month old loves these. I've tried the Veggie Dip as well as the Garden Tomato. Actually, my hubby loves them too so I find myself running out pretty quickly!<br /><br />I love the fact that these are tasty, healthy, provide teething relief since they are crunchy, yet soft enough for our (as yet) toothless baby to "chew", melt in her mouth pretty quickly so there's no choking hazard, and are easy for baby to pick up with her own hand. Sometimes when my daughter is in a fussy mood and wont eat anything else, I put some of these in front of her and while she's concentrating on feeding herself, I sneak in a few spoonfuls of food. Very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend.

review/summary: Excellent snack for baby and toddlers
review/text: My son loves to feed himself and prefers salty snacks to sweet ones. These were an instant hit with him as not only are they great tasting but healthy and safe for babies as they melt away in the mouth. My 3 year old also likes to share it with him and takes some to her pre-school. Its convenient on the go and reasonably priced. I recently got some Gerber Graduate coupons and combined it with sales and got some great deals.

review/summary: Great Puff alternative to the "Fruity-yogurt" kinds
review/text: Our daughter loves these!  She had a lot of trouble transitioning to solid foods, and we had to take her to a specialist. The specialist mentioned that if your child has trouble with solids and with chewing motions... you should use foods that are longer and thinner to encourage chewing on the sides of the mouth. These were perfect.  THey can be easily cut into rounds using a serated knife, and to encourage chewing, they are long enough for you to hold them to the one side of the mouth.<br /><br />Also, since our daughter loved puffs of all kinds... we wanted to at least introduce a variety of flavors. The garden tomato ones were a hit right from the get go and we continue to use them in "mixes" with other easy to pick up foods (goldfish, veggie crisps, etc.)<br /><br />Would recommend, will buy again!

review/summary: Too hard and too big
review/text: I bought these for my almost 9 month old twins. I was totally shocked by how hard these wagon wheels were. I bought them thinking they would be like there other products, soft and safe to eat. While I can break them up into little pieces to eat that defeats the purpose I could just give Cheerios for a fraction of the price. I have to say i dont feel comfortable giving them a whole one to eat, they put in there months and they take forever to dissolve. Big miss on Gerbers part for these items.

review/text: My 10-month old loves these! They are helpful to teach him how to eat and relieve pain from teething, too. Look around for a better price: I was able to find a great deal at my local BJ's club: a mixed 6-pack for $9.99. At the supermarket, they are $2/can.<br /><br />Whenever we go out and run errands, I make a snack container for him. I mix a bunch of different snacks together and let him choose what he wants when fussiness ensues. He always chooses these or the Dr. Sears yogurt melts.

review/summary: VERY HARD
review/text: MY DD has trouble with solid foods but loves the puffs. I ordered this to get some variety from the standard gerber puffs/ sticks.  Unfortunately I ordered a pack of six thinking that these would have a similar texture to the other snacks.  These snacks are hard for ME to chew and actually cut the roof of my husbands mouth when he tried them. At first we thought it was just a bad canister, but when we opened the next canister... same issue.<br /><br />IF your child is to the point where they can chew these... they certainly are not in a stage where they need puffs anymore!<br /><br />Would not recommend.

review/text: My son, age 2, loves this line of products from Gerber. The only bad thing about this particular product is that he REEKS of maple syrup the day after having these for snack (no more than 1/2 cup size serving). It is a 3 feet away and can smell maple syrup type of odor - even after wash hands, face, and taking a bath.

review/summary: Big hit with my daughter
review/text: My daughter loves these!  I used to be so super worried about her choking on anything; I even used to cut those Gerber star puffs in half.  Then one day she just chewed it up.  So I then tried the Gerber crunchies and she loves those too.  The cheese are her favorite, but she doesn't like the cinnamon maple ones.  Then I tried the Gerber Wheels and she loves them.  She holds them with one hand and then bits a piece off and chews it.  They are harder than the rest of the snacks but they still dissolve.  She did stick the whole thing in her mouth one time and I told her no, and out it came.  She hasn't stuck the whole thing back in her mouth since.  I would defiantly recommend these, just watch your child while she is eating them.

Although he can eat an entire can in one day now that he's 3...doctor told me that as a snack/filler this is not a bad thing to feed kids at young ages, has some good ingredients and isn't fried or full of fat.  Do try to eat the contents within a week, so they stay fresh and crisp.

review/text: These have been my son's favorite snacks since I had first bought them almost 1 year ago. They're great for tiny fingers and for little ones learning to self feed. They fit perfectly into a diaper bag/purse so you can have one on you at all times. They're great with little one's meals or just a simple snack. The ONLY downfall is that they're a bit messy. After eating them I always have to find that I'm cleaning my son's hands of crumbs, but that's with everything. HIGHLY recommended.

review/summary: My toddler LOVES these!  I wish they made these for adults as well.
review/text: These may not be the #1 healthiest snack for toddlers, but they are very good.  The flavor is perfect.  It's not too strong, nor too bland.  They have a touch of salt, but it's not nearly as salty as many alternatives.  They are just the right size for little hands.  They're crunchy, yet dissolve easily.  In fact, these were my toddler's first finger food.  I often like to go with store brands to save money, but I've found that the taste of these is quite superior.<br /><br />As my toddler is getting older, I'm not buying these as often as I used to since they are expensive.  However, when she was still in the early stages of eating table foods, these were awesome.  I'm actually a little bummed that I'm not going to be getting them all that often anymore.

His breath smells a little like garlic after he eats, them, but I'm not a vampire, so I don't mind. Ha ha! I call them baby cheetos, although they are very soft for toddlers learning to self-feed. I signed up for Amazon's subscribe and save program to get a pack of 6 of these every 2 months. I love the program and hope they keep adding more items to it. It's an easy way to keep those constantly used items in the house. I know as he gets older, we'll stop the subscribe and save, but for now, he loves them and eats them like crazy so I'm glad I don't have to worry about running out!

review/summary: too much salt and WAY too much garlic
review/text: First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.<br />I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack?

review/summary: Some are too big!
review/text: My son is now 9 months old, he has been eating finger foods for a few months now. We first purchased the Gerber Graduates Mild Cheddar & he loves them! They do just melt in the mouth, perfect because he only had 5 teeth at the time. The only negative I have for these is some of the puffs are fairly large! If I give my son a handful of them, he stuffs them in his mouth, so the larger ones make me nervous. I ususally cut them in half. My new find would be the Target Up & Up brand - they are fairly cheaper & they are all the same size (perfectly smaller) So from now on, I will be saving a few bucks, and using those!

review/summary: DO NOT DISSOLVE-CHOKING HAZARD
review/text: Great in theory...healthy, organic, etc. ... however, this product does not dissolve in babies mouth NOR in Mommy's mouth.  My child, 7 months old, put one in his mouth, he has two teeth, tried to bite it, it did not break...he then sucked one for about 2 minutes then ... just like a kid...placed another in his mouth.  Reminding you, the reader, I was right there when this happened...he began to choke!  I lifted him out of his highchair, turned him around, did the Heimlich maneuver on him...he blew one out and then I pulled the first apple wagon out of his mouth.  On a lighter note, he's fine, prefers the puffs and whole grain cereal...but the dog couldn't even chew these!!!  We do, however, have friends, with a baby girl...same age...and she loves these!!!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBU2CO">Happy Baby Gluten-Free Organic Puffs, Sweet Potato Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>

It's nice having a savory snack as most of them tend to be on the sweeter side.<br /><br />He goes NUTS for them and I know it's not as empty as junk food since it has the tomato and cheese in it.<br /><br />The only thing is you have to use it quickly or it can go soft in the can if left for too long.<br /><br />It's also a bit messy so not so good for special clothes.<br /><br />Other than that ... OMG it tastes great!!  The Veggie Dip and Mild Cheddar are also great.

review/text: Thank you Gerber, for helping us get our kids off to the right start!  Why should we parents take the time to prepare healthy snacks for our children and teach them to like REAL food, when you have Baby Cheetos in a can for them to enjoy?  One-third of America's children being overweight or obese simply isn't enough -- we need to strive for more.  America's kids need to learn to fill up on empty calories and eat for boredom, not hunger, starting at a year old or younger!  And thank goodness this product "tastes good" -- because that's all that matters, right?

review/summary: Crunch N Clean Taste Test
review/text: To see if the claims were true I decided to do a taste test with the Hartz Crunch 'N Clean bone-shaped biscuits and chop-shaped treats from another national brand.<br /><br />Not having been snubbed before with the chops, I was somewhat surprised to see my pups choose the Crunch 'N Clean biscuits first.  These dogs have never been known to be choosy eaters, and all the biscuits were eventually consumed, but it was apparent they they liked the flavor of the Crunch 'N Clean treats.<br /><br />The biscuits have a texture similar to whole wheat Danish crisp-bread just not as tasty or savory (yes, I tried one, too).  They also break into pieces with uneven edges to help scrape off gunk from tooth enamel.<br /><br />So all in all the dogs like the flavor of the biscuits, the treats are crunchy, and the texture helps keep their teeth clean.<br /><br />Pretty good.

review/text: My little Maltese liked these a LOT.  They're really hard, so I'm sure they're good scrubbers on his teeth.  Although they call these small, I wish they were a bit smaller (they are about 2 inches long by about 1 inch at the wide part of the bone).  Generally I would break a biscuit this size in half for him (but he's only 7 lbs, so for a "normal" dog they would be fine).

review/summary: Crunchy, Smelled Good, Large, Heavy on Wheat
review/text: Our Ridgebacks and Dobermans all scarfed these up immediately. Opening the box the treats smelled fresh, there was no greasy feel to them when I handled them and they did not have that icky odor that some of the chemical coated red colored, cheap biscuits have. I also liked that each biscuit was really large and thick. Even the elderly dogs liked them and the 16 year old Doberman with very few teeth left had little trouble eating this biscuit. These are hard, crunchy biscuits, but they do break apart with a little effort so they can be managed for an older dog. Our whole pack seemed to like the flavor and texture and there were no crumbs left on the floor afterward.<br /><br />Two days is too soon to tell if the Crunch 'n Clean biscuits will actually help with bad breath or tartar on their teeth or not. Honestly, no dog biscuit or treat or food is going to eliminate tartar on your dog's teeth - only annual cleaning by the vet will do that. (Proper nutrition will certainly help keep the problem in line)<br /><br />The reason for the four stars instead of five is simply due to the primary ingredients. We have Rhodesian Ridgebacks and they are prone to food allergies with regard to wheat and corn. The high wheat content in these biscuits means I cannot give them to the majority of my dogs. Many other breeds out there have the same allergen issues as well - if you are feeding an organic or wheat/corn/soy free diet for an allergy prone dog then you'll need to stay away from the Hartz treats.

review/summary: Paws up from my dog
review/text: My dog is actually a bit picky when it comes to treats. When you give her something new, it takes her 2 or 3 tries before she decides to try it. So I was pleasantly surprised when she immediately decided these dog biscuits were acceptable. She chowed down pretty quickly and was looking for another one. This is the highest praise I can give a dog treat product. I don't know how effective these biscuits are at tartar control, because (a) my dog is still pretty young, and (b) it takes a long time to see a difference in doggie dental hygiene. But as far as taste is concerned, Stella votes yes. I would definitely buy these again!

review/text: My Pug likes these biscuits more than the usual peanut butter ones we give him, but the jury is still out on whether they really do clean his teeth.  I notice some improvement, in particular in the realm of doggie bad breath; but he's a young dog and tartar isn't a big problem for him yet so it's difficult to determine how well these are working.  However, the dog likes them, his breath IS improved, and so I'd consider buying these again!

review/text: I have a Rottweiler puppy and he really loves these. He loves to gnaw on them for a few minutes before actually eating them. The medium size is just about right for his since he just a puppy. They biscuits are mostly protein with a few percent of fat. I have purchased other biscuits and he just refuses to eat them. He will sniff them and just ignore them. He didn't even hesitate with these. I had these on the counter and his nose was right up there trying to figure out if that box was for him. These biscuits are loose in the box. They are not sealed in a bag and in the box. I threw these in a plastic container to seal the scent and to keep them fresh. Although, I don't think dogs really care about freshness. I will be purchasing these again.

I don't know if they really help with tartar but it seems to me that their DOGGIE BREATH is a lot less offensive and that is a big plus.<br /><br />The biscuits take longer to chew than one would expect for their size which is a good thing, No little bits are left on the floor, they really enjoy these. The list of ingredients is long and sugar and salt are both near the top - for that I took away 1 STAR. I would purchase these again and might try the large size as both dogs are strong chewers.

review/summary: Very pleased with these biscuits & will buy more.
review/text: I am reviewing the "small" size Hartz Crunch 'n Clean dog biscuits.<br /><br />I believe I've finally found a biscuit to help with the tartar problem I've got with both my dogs -- a dachsund and mini-pin.  When the box arrived, my dachsund became so excited he was shaking from the smell!  Now, he eats anything and everything, but he was especially anxious to gobble up these biscuits....and even started a fight with my other dog over the shipping box!  Even my mini-pin ate 2 of the biscuits right away, and he is a very picky eater.  Of course, I didn't taste the biscuits, but the smell was similar to that of seasoned "curly fries."  They are shaped like a small, short bone with flared ends -- dimensions are 2" long, 1" wide at each bone end tapering to 1/2" wide in middle of the bone, and 1/2" thick.  I noted that pieces crumbled off, as opposed to splintering off, when the dogs were eating them, which I liked for safety reasons.  I just tried to break one with my hands and could not, so, even though I don't see any immediate teeth cleaning after just two biscuits, I would assume that the hardness will help remove tartar after a few days.<br /><br />There is along list of ingredients in these biscuits, many of which are vitamins.  There is also "sodium hexametaphosphate," which is a tooth whitener found in Crest toothpastes.  Other ingredients are flavorings, meals, flours, fats, and sugars, and I didn't see anything in the list that made me reluctant to feed them to my little guys.  The suggestion is to feed dogs 4 of these biscuits daily "for maximum dental benefits."<br /><br />I will be buying more of these, as my dogs love them, and it's very hard to brush their teeth, the little monsters.

review/summary: Dry and Not as Appealing as other treats
review/text: I love the idea of this dog treat, that it cleans teeth and freshens breath.  However, to get the maximum effect of that, the box suggests feeding him two bones a day every day for the cleanest teeth.  I normally don't treat my dog that often, because I don't think it's that good for him and also the cost of treats.  I'd have to buy a box a week to keep up with that!  But as to the taste of it, my dog was very unappealed by it.  He still ate them, as he is a dog afterall, but he would put it down and come back to it and work on it almost in the way he does actual dry bones.  I just think it lacks the taste and therefore his interest.  He much prefers tastier treats as he gobbles them up or spends his time gnawing on his bones. But I still give 3 stars as it does seem to help his teeth and breath!  Now if they could just make it more appetizing.  My guy is not, by far, a picky eater, so if he's pickin' there's a problem!

review/summary: My Doggy Gave this 2 Paws Down...
review/text: Wayyyyyyyy down.  I received a box of the small biscuits for my 15 lb, West Highland Terrier, and mind you, she's a little piggy.  The saying "will work for food" describes her perfectly, but these?  She wouldn't even take them out of my hands!!  Now, that's just crazy!<br /><br />To be fair, her treats include more holistic brands like Old Mother Hubburd, and Innova Evo Dog Treats, which includes no chemicals, by-products, or grain.  It's a rather high protein, low carb treat....the complete opposite of these which is filled with all sorts of fillers including grain, by products and chemicals, and hardly, if any real meat at all.<br /><br />Hence why I don't blame her.<br /><br />And as for the price, it's kind of high for being in the same category as milk bones, and for only a dollar more, you can get much better quality dog treats out there, such as Innova Evo and Dogswell.<br /><br />She gives these 2 paws down.... way down, and I can't say I blame her.

review/summary: Dogs liked it better than I did
review/text: Hartz isn't the brand that comes to mind when I consider 'quality' dog treats, and I wasn't sure mine would eat them.  My "small" dog weighs in at 25 lbs, and these biscuits were just right for her.  Her big sister, at 65 lbs, did also have to chew them before swallowing. I also tried them on my boss's crew of 5 miscellaneous dogs, and they all ate them except the one who won't eat anything. I wouldn't put much faith in their effectiveness as teeth cleaners though.<br /><br />As a "dog mom", I was not impressed with the ingredients.  These biscuits had far too many ingredients that just didn't measure up as "health encouraging" to inspire much faith on my part.  I can find treats that are far healthier, and chews that are far better as tooth cleaners than these biscuits do either one.<br /><br />All in all, its a 3 star ho-hum product.  Nothing to get excited about, and I won't be excited enough to seek them out at the store either!

I broke one in half to see if the size was the problem, but she still did not eat it.<br /><br />I did not try these myself, but I'm going to say that my household consensus is that these are not a favorite.

review/summary: A big box of hard biscuits
review/text: The biscuits were pretty hard.  They came directly in the cardboard box, without any airtight seal to keep them fresh.  However, my dog does enjoy them, licking up the crumbs.  I was afraid the green specs might stain the rug, but it doesn't appear they will stain.

review/summary: A bit large for a small mouth, but definitely enjoyed
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:59 Mins<br /><br /></span>What better way to review a dog biscuit than to show how much a dog enjoyed eating it? That was my logic behind this very amateurish but heartfelt video review starring my 1 1/2-year-old Shih Tzu, Missy.<br /><br />The video was very impromptu and, in hindsight, I realize that I didn't do a great job of explaining why I only gave the product 3 stars, so I'm adding some further explanation here.<br /><br />First, I took a star off because I felt that if you're going to make a multi-sized dog biscuit, the small should be small enough for the very small breeds like Yorkies and Chihuahuas.  As you can see in the video, this small biscuit is not only 2 inches long and quite thick but VERY hard, so I feel like a very small or more delicate breed may have trouble with even the small biscuit.<br /><br />Second, the ingredient list on the box is almost 3 inches long.  Sugar and salt are within the first 10 ingredients and, while there are a lot of vitamins and minerals included, there is also partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, several food colorings and chemicals I can hardly pronounce.  I just prefer to feed Missy more natural foods and snacks.<br /><br />Third, the "feeding instructions" (which hardly seemed necessary) direct me to give Missy 2 biscuits twice a day.  That's 4 large (compared to the small Mother Hubbard bone-shaped treats she usually gets) treats a day, which seemed a bit much, especially much considering my issues with the ingredient list.

review/summary: I LIKE them....
review/text: Hi, my name is Herdle and I am a fox red lab.  Milk bones are my usual brand and though I am a recovering biscuit addict, I decided to try these.  I've never met a treat I didn't love ...greenies, milk bones and when I can snag it, people food.<br /><br />Anyway, these treats are thicker and shorter than my usual brand (~1inch x 4inches) and they have a few lines and dots stamped in them along with Hartz on the top.  I actually preferred them to my regular brand when tested -- three times out of three.  I was given the option to freely choose one or the other.  This is not unique for me as I often love a new brand of food, but tire of it before the bag is empty (why does she buy those bushel bags?).<br /><br />The biscuits smell like people food.  The box says they contain 'denta-shield' and breath freshening crystals.  The crystals are really small, but the buiscuits do seem to leave my mouth smelling better than usual... kind of a 'fresh bread' smell.  oooh I love bread and marshmallows too.<br /><br />I could eat the whole box tonight but she's only giving me one per day.  I highly recommend them.  ingredients (in order from the box):  wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, wheat germ meal, sodium hexametaphosphate, Poultry fat, salt, poultry digest (what?), Sugar (I LOVE SUGAR, but my vet sez it's not so good for me), Dried Whey, Malted Barley Flour, Dried cane molasses, calcium carbonate, brewer's yeast, citric acid, corn starch, choline chloride, sodium metasibulfite, partially hydroxogenated vegetable oil (if it's not good for mom, can it be good for me?), mono-diglycerides, mixed tocopherols (preservative), veg oil, rosemary extract (there's that people food smell), chlorophyll, aritificial coloring (red lake #40, yellow, blue) ferrous sulfate and other vitamin supplements (E, B12, zinc, A, copper, Niacin, Manganese, Riboflavin, D3, thiamine, Calcium Iodate, and Folic acid).<br /><br />Calories per biscuit - 170  wow, it's kind of like a candy bar for dogs.  Treat that tastes great, but not so great for you.

review/summary: Hard Biscuits -- I didn't taste them, but my dogs liked them
review/text: I have two dogs and both love their daily biscuits. To keep their weight within reasonable parameters I do limit their treats, but am nonetheless familiar with most brands.<br /><br />These biscuits are quite different from any I've purchased in the past. They are at least twice as thick as a normal dog biscuit. I know this because I usually break biscuits in half, and in this case it was accomplished with great difficulty. I assume the hard consistency is part of what helps remove tartar on teeth.<br /><br />The dogs loved them and begged (yes, they did) for more. Notably there were absolutely NO crumbs at the bottom of the box -- NONE. That's something I've never encountered in a box of dog biscuits -- more evidence of the thick, tough texture.<br /><br />So, why didn't I rate the Crunch 'n Clean five stars?  Additives. I read the labels for my food and my dogs, and I don't like, in particular, added colors. And, not just one color, but three were added (why?) Yellow Lake #5, Blue Lake #1 and Red Lake #40.<br /><br />Also, it seems a bit incongruous to me to add sugar and dried cane molasses to tartar control dog biscuits. How good is sugar for dog teeth? I admit I'm not a chemist, but I suspect the sugar might be best avoided.  Salt is # 7 on the long (46 item) list of ingredients -- something else I believe isn't too good for dogs.<br /><br />Some of the many ingredients are unpronounceable and worrisome. Some are vitamin supplements. I prefer ingredient labels to reflect a simple straightforward list of deciferable food stuffs, and I'd rather no added vitamin supplements to treats because almost all basic dog food includes them. It is time consuming to keep track of it all. That said, my dogs loved the biscuits and I liked giving them something really hard to munch on.

A Sheep hound mix, a Jack Russell, Chihuahua and Mini-Pinscher all loved the biscuits with equal enthusiam.  Four solid stars.<br /><br />But... I might point out that the above dogs like chicken, cheeze bits, kibble and dead birds and mice not to mention the odor of other dog's butt.<br /><br />So as I dog owner, I read the ingredients and found it to be typical of commercially prepared pet foods, relying on grain, meat byproducts and sugars for the bulk of the volume.  I can't endorse it as a "healthy snack"  for my pets.  But then again,  just like I visit McDonalds occassionally as a treat, neither can I complain.

review/summary: Apparently a great product
review/text: I got this for my friends dog (I don't know much about dogs). I always thought a treat is a treat, but apparently, her dog has high standards. We went over for the weekend, and I brought them. She warned me of her dogs narrow tastes and was fairly certain that Tobi would not like it. Well, to her surprise, she was wrong. Tobi ate the treat and wanted another. The weekend was a success, and my friend now has a new treat to offer her dog. This was pretty hard and I wonder how good it would be for a small or small/medium sized dogs teeth. I suppose the hardness helps to remove the plaque. I suspect it would take more than a weekend to evaluate how well it cleans, and I'm sure that you still will have to take your dog for cleanings, though I don't know the frequency. I would guess this would give you a little more time in between cleanings. I think the most important thing is that a dog with picky tastes enjoyed it and also did not get sick from it. Just getting back to the hardness, it is not really harder than some of the other chew toys I have seen other dogs eat, e.g. bones, etc. Lastly, for the price, it seems like a good value. You get a lot of biscuits....and I suspect this 24 ounce box will last a while.

review/summary: lukewarm reception
review/text: I gave my dog one of the Hartz Crunch n Clean dog biscuits and he was very excited. He ran around the house with it in his mouth, drooling like a faucet. After playing for a while, he laid down to eat it. I could definitely tell it was harder to crunch up than the similar sized milkbone, he had to work it around and position it in his jaws just right. Once bitten into a couple of pieces, he ate one half and then took the other half and buried in the couch cushions. Sadly, I think that's probably a "paws down" vote from my dog. Also, at 35 calories, it's a pretty significant contribution to the daily intake for a small dog compared to a small Milkbone at 20 calories and a Liva Snap at 13 calories. If my dog had liked it more, I might give them to him as a special treat which wouldn't really help with regular dental cleaning because it is recommended to give them two biscuits a day (we would have to short him on kibble if we added the treats at that quantity). As he isn't in love with them, I think we'll just see if one of our doggie friends likes them better.

review/summary: Satisfying, and sensible in moderation
review/text: When we brought our new pup for her first check-up with our longtime family vet, he told us that the two ailments he and his partners see most often in their practice are pets that are overweight or have tooth problems. Both can lead to serious issues and health risks, but as he pointed out, by maintaining good habits, we owners can reduce the chances our pets' health will be affected.<br /><br />However, let's face it, no matter how eagerly our dogs greet their daily servings of healthy kibble, there are a whole lot interesting smells in the world, especially when your sniffer is so much more powerful than those of your human companions.<br /><br />Our pup, who loves to eat, is a lab -- a breed noted for its appetite and its wheedling expression as much as for its happy nature.  In our household, that means accurate measuring at mealtime and strict rationing of treats.<br /><br />Because she's food- and praise-motivated, we've been able to use bits of dog biscuits when introducing a behavior and to transition to clicker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMDIL6">StarMark Clicker</a> reinforcement and praise pretty rapidly ... and save the "treat calories" for a substantial chew or bone each day.<br /><br />I was eager to see what our pup would think of the Hartz Crunch `n Clean <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q9EFWI">Hartz Crunch n Clean Dog Biscuit, Large</a>  because it's got a pretty nutritious list of ingredients and includes a product developed at a dentistry university that's designed to block formation of tartar on teeth. Right out of the box, the bone-shaped treats have a nice heft and mild, pleasant aroma. My expert hovered hopefully, tail wagging, and seemed surprised that the treat was much heavier than her usual Checkups-brand treats. She nosed it around and licked it a few times before settling in next to my herb garden to polish it off. More later on this.<br /><br />While I'll have to wait for her next check-up to find out whether these biscuits are helping with our regular toothbrushing program, I could tell from the very first biscuit that her breath was better. (She has an unfortunate habit of nosing in our fish pond; thankfully the fish are faster than she is.)<br /><br />Our pup's daily maximum is 1,100 calories, which means that we're picky about the content and calorie count of snacks and treats, since they come straight from that bottom line.  To crunch a few numbers, these Hartz treats contain 170 calories each, and the recommended feeding is two per day. There were 14 treats in the carton. By comparison, her usual treat comes in at 137 calories, with a recommendation of two to three per day. The most we give her, though, is one a day so we don't have to short her on kibble. So far, she's seemed fuller for longer with the Hartz treats, which counteracts the slightly higher calorie count.<br /><br />When offered her choice between the two today, she promptly and politely chose Hartz, and headed straight to her niche between the rosemary shrubs. Turns out she's not just a chow hound but also a bit of a gourmet -- these treats are flavored with rosemary extract.

review/summary: Approved by three Miniature Schnauzers
review/text: These very hard biscuits seem to do their job. I have given one to each of my three Miniature Schnauzers and have not had any adverse effects.<br /><br />One of my dogs has a rather sensitive stomach and I was a little nervous about giving her these biscuits and so with anything new I usually try just a little to see how she can handle it.  She handled the biscuit just fine so these passed the sensitive stomach test.  I am now comfortable with giving her the whole biscuit and have not had any problems.<br /><br />Another one of my dogs has a tendency to wolf down his food so I was pleasantly surprised to find that the density of these biscuits to be hard enough to warrant him breaking the biscuit down to chunks to eat it rather than one bite and it's gone.<br /><br />None of my dogs stuck their noses up to the biscuit but only one of my dogs is a real food snob so that's not saying much.<br /><br />I'm not big on giving my dogs junk food even those which are supposedly healthy or beneficial such as these but if you don't have time or don't want to take the time to clean your dog's teeth and treats such as bones just don't do it for you then these are better than doing nothing.<br /><br />Ingredients listed is: wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, wheat germ meal, sodium hexametaphosphate, Poultry fat, salt, poultry digest , sugar , Dried Whey, Malted Barley Flour, Dried cane molasses, calcium carbonate, brewer's yeast, citric acid, corn starch, choline chloride, sodium metabisulfite, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil , mono-diglycerides, mixed tocopherols , veg oil, rosemary extract , chlorophyll, artificial coloring (red lake #40, yellow, blue) ferrous sulfate and other vitamin supplements (E, B12, zinc, A, copper, Niacin, Manganese, Riboflavin, D3, thiamine, Calcium Iodate, and Folic acid).<br /><br />Calories per biscuit - 170<br /><br />If I was to recommend anything to Hartz it would be to get rid of the food color, lower the sugar content and add real chicken. I don't have a clue what chicken digest is, is it the stomach or extremely cooked down chicken?<br /><br />Four out of five stars for me.<br /><br />Though my dogs like these and they didn't upset my dog's stomach so no adverse affects at the end of the box I won't be repurchasing. I think I can find a better options for the health of my dogs than this.

review/summary: My dog loved them
review/text: My big girl dog has an indoor crate where she spends her nights, usually by choice, and some time while we are out. On top sits a box of milk bones and a big bag of cookies from the farm store.  They have sat there for months, we occasionally replenish them, and she never bothers them, she waits until we give her one.  My plan was to do a video review of this product, I was going to go outside and put out a couple of different brands, and see which one she ate.<br /><br />That night, when I got home, she was wagging her tail, obviously happy to see me as she always is when I return to our pack. And the cookies were gone. Oh, the milk bones were there, and the generic cookies were there. They still are. But these were gone.<br /><br />All I can say is that she has a sensitive stomach, and eating a box of these might have upset her stomach, but it didn't. I have no idea how they would have kept her teeth clean in the long run, because she ate them all at once!<br /><br />I'm rating them by how irresistible my dog found them. A product like this won't do any good unless the dog eats it, and she ate it.

review/text: Our dog, a 10 year old bichon frise, goes wild when he sees these coming, so the flavor must be pretty great; he is not a huge fan of dry dog treats usually.  After his recent difficulties with a teeth cleaning at the vet, I resolved not to have him go through that again, so it is a good thing to have the extra dental shield ingredient that protects teeth from tartar build up. There are also a lot of vitamins in the biscuits. The recommended feeding is 2 biscuits twice a day, which I think is way too much. This would be too filling and cause the dog to not eat enough of its dog food. If 4 biscuits per day are needed in order for the dental benefits to be realized, that is not good. Overall, I would use these biscuits several times a week to possibly give the dental benefits, but not as often as recommended.  :)

review/text: I guess when they did the taste test for these and stated preferred two to one sadly my dog (Chloe) was sitting in the other group. I have a 12 lbs. Papillon and give her the competitor bones and she loves those. I don't think it was the flavor as much as the size with these. For being `small' the bones are twice as large as the other ones. I think that was the issue for my `Chloe', she could not get her poor small mouth around it. She would try to suck it until it was ready to break. Even if I broke it, the pieces were too thick. I think if they were not so thick she would not have any issues. As far as the breath factor I did notice it improved in that area! That alone I would buy them but the size is what would deter me. I gave some to a bigger dog, a 55 lbs lab mix and he did not have a problem chewing them but still had to break the bone up. Over all I think it is a good idea but the size is not what I would consider small. Maybe a small treat for a bigger dog but too big for small dogs.

review/summary: Tastes Great - but lots of filler
review/text: I have two pound puppies (well not puppies) who are not picky eaters - apparently living on death row in the pound will open up the horizens on edible vs non-edible.  Though they are both considered "medium sized" dogs, we give them the Large dog biscuits because they THINK they are large dogs.  Normally they each get one large biscuit every night before bed.<br /><br />So the box came in the mail.  I admit that I was surprised when I opened the box that more of them weren't smashed or broken in transit - I generally can't get the box home from the grocery store without smashing half of them.  So they now have a box full of non-broken snacks.  As the doggie mommy I inspected the ingredients - and was a bit dissapointed.  Lots of wheat and grains.  I had hoped for at least animal by-product or something as the first ingredient.  What really bothered me was the fake coloring, there's a list of artificial dyes - now I've never met a dog who would turn anything away based on color so I don't understand the point of colored dog treats.  The last ingredient was added on vitamines - so I was happy about that.  Still, lots of salt, sugar and grains in the box.<br /><br />Then I read the directions - feed 2 biscuits twice a day, so that's 4 biscuits per dog per day... that's a LOT of snack food for a dog.  After closer inspection it seemed to be stating that for maximum DENTAL benefit to follow that feeding routine.<br /><br />Rosco, our 30lbs 2year old sheepdog figured out pretty quickly that the box contained snacks.  After a sit then shake, I gave him one.  He was curious at first (he's a cautious doggie after having been abused so badly) there was some sniffing, some poking with the nose, but then once his big brother started moving in - Rosco crunched happily away at it.<br /><br />Indiana Jones (aka IndyBear) our 60 lbs 12-13 year old mix (maybe spaniel and austrailian shepherd? Who knows) has been on a weight management diet for over 10 years now, but severe arthritis and hip displaysia prevent much excercise.  Indy will eat anything - though I have recently started to worry about the hard food on his teeth.  Once Indy figured out that we were testing new biscuits, he went through the routine, sit, shake, laydown, situp - then he took off with his new snack.  Indy wolfed it down and came back for more.<br /><br />Over the next 24 hours there were no upset tummies or 2am walks due to the "runs" so we'll at least finish off the box.<br /><br />Final Opinion:<br />The Good - hard and crunchy to help prevent additional tartar buildup.<br />Apparently very tasty.<br />The Medium Size is good for the 25-40 lbs weight range.<br />I liked the added vitamins.<br /><br />The bad/questionable - I wasn't a fan of the dyes included.<br />Smaller or older dogs may not be able to chew these comfortably.<br />The dental benefit is only to PREVENT NEW buildup - not to help with current dental issues.<br />Feeding Directions may lead to plump puppies - especially with the ammount of non-meat ingredients.<br />Doesn't seem that it would be as beneficial on the teeth as a rawhide, at least with my dogs.<br /><br />Please remember - Doggies need their teeth brushed too, even if you give them hard treats like these.

review/summary: My dog wasn't big on these...
review/text: I got these treats for my extra large Chihuahua who will eat anything.  She wasn't a fan of these.  Whenever we decide to give her a treat we ask her if she wants a "snackee" & she gets very excited.  She'll run in circle & stand on her hind legs.  When we gave her this for a "snackee" she just looked at it, smelled it & then looked to us like we were joking her.  We left it there & she looked at it again & smelled it & then chose to walk away from it.  This dog turns down nothing except for lettuce.  After it sat there for about 30 mins I put it in her dog dish & about 6 hours later she decided to get it out & contemplate eating it for about 10 more minutes before she decided to finally try it.  She did finally eat all of it but we know she wasn't big on it because the next couple times we gave her one it was the same routine, it sat for hours before being eaten.<br /><br />Her opinion is that she's not big on them & wouldn't recommend them but if given one she'll eventually eat it to make it go away.

review/summary: Better than nothing
review/text: These biscuits are probably better than nothing, and they did seem to clean some of the yellowish gunk off his teeth; after three of these over the span of a weekend, my dog's teeth were noticeably whiter, although spots of tartar and plaque remained in the remoter portions of his teeth.<br /><br />I generally prefer organic dog food with short, simple ingredient lists, and at first was a little concerned when I saw that the  list on these things was half the height of the box. However, spot checking the ingredients shows that most of them (Calcium Pantothenate or Pyridoxine Hydrochloride for example) were just vitamin supplements; a few were harder to decipher, though (Sodium Hexametaphosphate?)  The most common ingredient is wheat, so if your dog has a wheat allergy, avoid these.<br /><br />As to taste, I refrained from trying them myself, but it did seem a bit dryer and more powdery than other treats I feed him; he didn't seem as wildly enthusiastic about them as he is about his organic kibble, but he sure ate every speck, and started noticing when I got the box out. (To be fair, he'd probably eat bark if I put it in a bowl with some kibble and water).<br /><br />Overall, these are probably a good option if you want to do something for your dog's teeth; they're certainly far cheaper than the other dog dental treats I've seen for sale. I don't think they're going to be an adequate substitute for getting your dog's teeth cleaned at the vet, though.

review/summary: Dogs love them! But certainly not a dental supplement.
review/text: I have 2 dogs, a sheltie mix and long haired chiauaua, I will say that the "LARGE" size biscuits were way to big for both of my dogs so I broke the large biscuit in half and gave each dog a piece of it. The dogs loved them! In fact I went to my front door to get the box and normally my dogs don't get excited about boxes. But this time I guess they could smell the treats inside because they both went crazy! I'll say that the box is bigger then I expected, contains approx 16 biscuits. The "serving size" on the box I'm not sure about as it says "for best results give 2 twice a day. If my math is right they want you to feed your dog a total of 4 of these a day and at that rate the box will last 3 and a half days.  If the treats were healthier and not so much filler I wouldn't see a problem with this IF it really helps the teeth, but with it being mostly filler I couldn't see feeding my dogs 4 of these every day. They are a good treat every now and then, but certainly not to be used as an on-going dental treatment because you would go through 2 boxes a week and at the current price it would be about $48 a month and that is just for 1 dog. These in my opinion are purely TREATS and not dental supplements. I will be submitting a picture of my dogs with these treats if you would like to see how excited they were when I got them out! I rated these at 3 out of 5 simply because of the healthiness of these compared to the "recommended serving." As far as my dogs go, I think they would give it a 5.

review/text: We have a pretty picky dog when it comes to food and treats.  If she doesn't it like it, then she won't eat it.<br /><br />Well, she has no problem eating this biscuit and this thing is HUGE.  Can't comment on the cleaning ability yet, but taste is apparently out of this world to my dog.  :o)

review/summary: Hartz Crunch n Clean Dog Biscuits (Medium)
review/text: If your dogs are like mine, then they love pretty much any treat you give them, but I must say then when I pick up this box they do seem a little bit more excited then with other treats. Also, my dogs will not let me brush their teeth at all, so I always look for treats to help protect their teeth. After about a week, I have to say I notice a difference. They have no plaque build-up and their chompers are pretty white and clean looking. So I would have to say they product definitely works. And seeing as how I am always curious what my dogs are eating, I took a bite of the treat myself, and now I see why they get so excited, it's pretty tasty. Yeah, I'm weird like that. For almost two pounds of treats, the price is also very good. I have a Boston Terrier, a Pug, and a little Chihuahua / Beagle mutt thing and the medium is a good size for them, though you might be better off with the small size for those breeds. Great product all around.

review/summary: My dogs really liked them
review/text: My dogs started eating these the minute I gave them to them, and they seemed to last a little longer than other biscuits I've bought for them.  I can't say if these biscuits really will cut down on the amount of tarter on their teeth just yet, but I'm sure time will tell.  For now I see no harm in giving them the 2 two biscuits each day that the box recommends, and hopefully it will help cut down on the tarter.  That they really liked them was an added bonus.

review/summary: This treat really cleans teeth
review/text: These biscuits are a hit with my German Shepherd. He loves them, and they really have made his teeth cleaner. I try to brush his teeth, but it can be a challenge to get to all of those back teeth before my pup is over the process. After only a couple of these treats this week, his teeth are noticably cleaner already.

review/text: My dog loves these new Hartz dog biscuits with DentaShield.<br /><br />The front of the box really boasts all the dental advantages pretty obviously, so I will just speak for my dog in that he loves the taste and chews them up really fast and it's something he looks forward to.<br /><br />Since it has it's benefits and he likes them, I'll continue getting these as well as Greenies which are also good for teeth.

review/summary: made 15 lb pom lose teeth!
review/text: Our 5 year old (healthy) pomeranian took these, although I could tell they were not his favorite treats, and ate them over a period of about a month.  I began to notice that his gums began to be sore, and he was having tenderness in his mouth.  I took him to our vet to have his teeth checked, and discovered that several of his teeth had become loose, and he had to have two of the front bottom ones extracted, and 5 more molars extracted.  A third (front tooth) is just hanging there tonight. The vet told me that several more were loose, and he could have pulled more.  I am heart sick that I fed these to my pomeranian....hindsight being what it is, they are way to hard for his little mouth and his teeth.  I thought I was HELPING him by giving him "Denta Shield" and instead he lost several of his teeth!  The small ones (for dogs up to 15 pounds) seemed OK for our bigger golden retriever, but are way to hard and thick for a small dog.  :(

review/summary: Great Product Outrageous Price
review/text: I have bred and sold dogs for over 45 years.  I know my dogs.  And I know what dental scaling and cleaning costs.  I discovered these biscuits and tried them and I am wowed.  They're fantastic.  All my dogs have polished white teeth now, and clean breath too.  I am so pleased with this product.<br /><br />Problem is that each and every store in America keeps running out of them.  So when you go to Amazon to find them to keep your dogs on the proper regimen (you can't bounce dogs around with their diet, it must be habitual), you get prices that are out of this world.  Wall Mart sells this product for under three dollars.  the LOWEST price at Amazon is OVER NINE DOLLARS.<br /><br />I have been a solid shopper at Amazon for over 15 years, but these prices have run me off to Wall Mart, where the shipping is free.  Shipping on this product is SIX DOLLARS OR MORE.<br /><br />Come on store owners!  Why do you want to screw your customers?  Are you JUST concerned with your own investment or your stock holders that you would screw your customers?  DID YOU REALLY SNAP UP ALL THE SUPPLY TO GOUGE US?  We want reasonable prices for products and a box of dog biscuits is NOT WORTH TEN BUCKS.  GET REAL!!!!

review/summary: My dogs liked them but....
review/text: ...judging by the list of junk food ingredients I wouldn't give them enough to even try to see a difference in their dental health.  But my dogs are raw fed and very picky about any grain based "treats" and they gobbled these down in a heartbeat.  They're a good snack but I wouldn't rely on them for any kind of dental health and they certainly are no substitute for brushing their teeth.

review/text: I bought the Hartz Crunch 'n clean biscuits (small) and my Pekingese hated them. The first time i gave it, he took it with excitement and then laid it on the floor and looked at me as if he were thinking, "where's the REAL treat?".  So later i tried it again and even broke it in half. No, not interested at all. I'm glad to know that i can go to the Hartz website and get a refund. It's a hassle to do that, but i appreciate it.

review/summary: NO MORE DOG DENTAL APPTS!
review/text: My dog is 15ys old, he doesn't chew much and I felt awful after his last dental appt. He looked so ill, and I paid $300.  Luckily, I found Hartz Crunch and Clean.  These are magic!  I give him two a day, almost all of his tarter is gone.  I have to scrape a tiny bit.  It has been several months, and Mom's dog eats them and my sister's cats use the kitty variety. Their tartar is almost all gone too.<br /><br />Update: Roswell, now 16 at 26 lbs gets 4 a day (for 2+ yrs). Just had a vet check, and vet was amazed at how good his blood work is.

review/text: Reviewing dog biscuits is a little difficult. Did my golden retriever eat the biscuits? Yes, quite readily.  Did her teeth and breath get noticeably cleaner? Perhaps, but having only tried one box--which lasted a couple of weeks--I am not sure I can guarantee such a result.  Like all dog treats, they seem to recommend a lot per day.

review/summary: Great treat for your best friend
review/text: I am sure my dog could do a better review but seeing as he can't type, I will try to translate.  My dog(Welsh Terrier) is actually a very picky eater and only likes a handful of things.  Believe it or not, he loves these treats and can't get enough of them.  Of course all dogs are different, but typically, if my dog is happy, your dog will be happy.<br /><br />Now for what I love about this product:<br />- the medium size bone is a perfect treat for a medium sized dog (25-35 lbs)<br />- if you want to break them into pieces (for training or just to give a small treat), it is easy to do.<br />- thes bones don't break into a billion crumbs when your or the dog cracks into them<br />- they have relatively no smell, yet my dog still loves them - they must have great flavor<br />- My dog has problems with tartar build up.  These bones appear to help reduce the tartar and certainly don't add to any build up.<br />- One box seems to go a long way.  I don't treat my dog everyday but my first box is still half full.  I am guessing around 50-75 bones in a new box
