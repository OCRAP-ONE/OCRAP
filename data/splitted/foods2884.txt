review/summary: Great Treats for Older Dogs
review/text: My older dog (a beagle) loves his treats but struggles with the crunchy ones as he's gotten older and his teeth/mouth have become more tender.  These treats look like soft cookies and he loves them!  Easy to chew, he loves them, and they are easy to break into pieces (if you want a smaller treat).  I actually store mine in small baggies to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I suspect these would be great for younger dogs, as well.

review/summary: My puppy loves these
review/text: My beagle puppy loves these treats. He doesn't particularly cares for his crate but he goes right in it when he comes from outside because he knows he is going to get this treat. I only feed him natural foods that have no by products, so this products fits the bill. It doesn't smell bad either. I plan to buy more of  this for him in the future.

review/summary: Great for older beasts
review/text: For some reason, finding morsel-sized soft treats for old dogs at almost any pet store is challenging. My mixed breed wonderdog (Golden/Shepherd/Chow)just turned 14 and he loves these treats which have the texture of compacted brownies. Like a lot of older beings, he now has trouble with crunchy, chewey foods. He won't eat any other treats now other than these quality-made, nutritious soft chews. A bit pricey but highly recommended.

review/summary: 2 BOXES OUT OF SIX STALE
review/text: Have ordered these doggie treats several times as our three dogs really love them however this time two out of six boxes are stale.  When I opened the boxes that were stale there was a small hole in the plastic wrapper making the treats really not suitable for feeding to a pet and return policy reads food items cannot be returned and product cannot be found in any local stores. Really disappointed and now have to order six more boxes as will run out of them sooner than expected.

review/text: Great deal with 6 boxes for only $15.<br /><br />My dogs love them. +Coton De Tulear +Pomeranian Chihuahua + Maltese Terrier<br />All small dogs as you can see.<br /><br />***Only thing is despite being the "Softies" or "soft Dog Treats"  of Blue Dog Bakery, they all have somewhat of a difficult time chewing the treats so I break them up and cut them prior to their training. (Teaching them the basics of doggie discipline!)<br /><br />So maybe not necessarily the best treat for smaller dogs, but a great treat overall.

review/summary: Scrumptious!
review/text: This is my 9th year of purchasing Blue Dog Bakery products and I am still very happy with their line of snacks. My two shelties just love them and I have used the  Super Stars not only as rewards for training but also for their night time cookie before bed. I always have my shirt pocket full for the neighborhood dogs when we go on walks, now I am the Pied Piper of dogs!<br />These products are always fresh and consistent in size color and taste, yes I said taste! I read years ago that people take these snacks with them hiking and share them with their dogs. There are human consumption quality. So I tried it, ok maybe I would prefer an Oreo, but they are not that bad at all. So now I test them on occasion to see if they are consistent, and they are. The Natural soft peanut butter chews, they look like Fig Newtons, stay fresh from the time I open the package till they are all gone. Now you never want to overdo it with snack because it is the fastest way to cause obesity in your pet. So I actually count out their cookies for the day and put them in a little tin to keep me for over doing it. This has helped me to control their weight and to help me remember how many I have given them.

review/text: My dog recently had 19 teeth extracted (dogs have 42 teeth, so that was nearly half of her teeth).  I needed to find an all natural, healthy treat which is soft.  This product is all of those.  The main flavor is peanut butter, which my dog loves.  She had no problems whatsoever eating these treats. I recommend this product for any dog with dental issues, or if your dog likes peanut butter.  They are reasonably priced, too, which was okay with me!

review/summary: My dog is addicted
review/text: I would give these six (or more) stars if I could.<br /><br />My dog is absolutely addicted to these biscuits; they are the only ones she will eat after she comes back from a walk.  I had been getting them at Trader Joe's (under their own label) and I was distraught when they were discontinued (fortunately I did not tell my dog, because she would have been inconsolable).  A quick Google search brought me to Amazon and these biscuits--which had been packaged under private label for TJ.<br /><br />Now I no longer have to worry about reproachful looks when she doesn't get her favorite cookies.<br /><br />Reasonably priced, they are easy to break in half or in quarters and great for dogs that cannot chew hard biscuits--or to hide a pill inside.

review/summary: Sugar-free, soft, and my dogs both go crazy for them
review/text: RE: Blue Dog Bakery Natural Soft Dog Treats, Peanut Butter Flavor Softies, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I like these because 1) they are soft enough for my smallest dog's teeth and I can break them apart into smaller pieces and 2) because they are sugar-free.  Both of my dogs -- a finicky pekingese and a pound-rescue mix that weighs 50-lbs -- go crazy over these.  I have gone through probably 8 boxes in a year and am looking to order more.<br /><br />It is difficult to find treats which my smallest dog can eat.  Hard treats are just too difficult for him; he has hard enough time crunching small-bites kibble.  Soft or jerky-like treats often have sugar or corn syrup, the last thing he needs for his teeth.  I am very glad to have finally found these sugar-free soft treats.<br /><br />Regarding the person who complained about what these looked like, I asked my dogs if they cared what these look like, and they just fell over each other trying to get closer to my feet to get a bite of one.  If they don't care what the treats look like, why should I?<br /><br />UPDATE: I have 5 dogs now and all of them like these treats.  Pekingese are known for becoming bored with the same thing over time, however my Pekingese still goes crazy for these treats.  Although these are easy to break apart, even 5 ways now, breaking them apart like that does produce crumbs.  I store my opened package in a zip-lock bag to retain freshness.<br /><br />I wish Amazon didn't combine reviews for the different types of treats.  It really skewers the ratings and adds unnecessary confusion.

review/summary: Perfect For Dog Pills!
review/text: Our two-year-old female Golden Retriever was diagnosed a year ago with severe outdoor allergies. The vet prescribed two Benadryl tablets in the morning and two at night. I happened upon the Blue Dog Bakery Soft Peanut Butter Dog Treats at a local grocer. I break one in half and insert one pill in each half each morning and night. She LOVES them and gobbles her medicine right down! Yes, they will fall apart sometimes but they're pliable and can be shaped around the pill. When I say "Time for your medicine," she comes right over as I insert the pills, all the while making gutteral anticipation noises like a person makes when their "mouth waters" at an aroma! The grocery quit carrying them and, after a call to the Blue Dog people in Seattle, they suggested that I try Amazon. What a relief that they carried them! I go through a box every two weeks and I saw NO OTHER items at any grocery that could take the place of these. If your dog is on medication and is a larger breed, these treats are a winner! (A finicky, smaller breed dog that chews a lot before swallowing may spit the pill out---It will have to be tested on a dog-to-dog basis.)

I've been looking online for different ways that I can still enjoy some of the same foods with my family that I technically shouldn't be having because of the carb count.  I was skeptical when I first looked at low carb chocolate muffins... but I thought, what do I really have to lose?  And I am so glad that I ordered these!  They are VERY chocolatey.  I made up the package and froze most of them.  Now when my family has brownies I can have a small chocolate muffin.  The one downfall is that they aren't HUGE, but I think that's the 'Super Size Me' mentality that we've all grown accustomed to.  They muffins are cake like and really do hit the spot.  They are a perfect snack for a diabetic and the carb count is so low that it won't cause a big spike in blood sugar.  I'm very happy to have found this product and I'm anxious to try the other things that I purchased from this seller - as well as ordering different flavors of muffins and the pie crust!

review/text: I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought.

review/summary: no lemon. not much green tea
review/text: If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled "lemon ginger green tea." It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.

review/summary: Great Green Tea and Great Company!
review/text: This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several "natural" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using "natural" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them.

review/summary: Excellent Green Tea from a real Tea drinker!
review/text: I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional "Gyokuro" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.

review/summary: Interesting blend
review/text: My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct "earl grey" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.

review/text: I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!

review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy.

This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!

review/summary: Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Bitter Green Tea
review/text: First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit "add to cart" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought "oh, boy" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The "burnt" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .

review/text: Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+

review/summary: This tastes like CINNAMON OIL, not a traditional chai blend
review/text: Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed.

review/text: I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a "burnt" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away.

review/summary: This is a staple at my house
review/text: I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of "tea time," where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic "bite" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the "subscribe & save" option, this is an especially good deal.

I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills.

review/text: I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment.

review/summary: Excellent Mellow Tea, Hot or Cold
review/text: This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet.

review/text: I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil.

review/summary: My 'everyday' tea. :c)
review/text: I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)

review/summary: Time for Tea!
review/text: I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too.

review/text: The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.  Ends every day nicely.

review/summary: Great tasting Green Tea
review/text: For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners. This tea is perfect for me because it tastes great by itself. I would recommend it to anyone who likes green tea and wants a relatively cheap box set.
