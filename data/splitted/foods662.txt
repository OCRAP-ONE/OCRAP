review/summary: Worst Pistachios Ever!
review/text: I'd like to make it clear that I really like pistachios. I eat a lot of this particular nut but these Setton Farms pistachios were beyond bad. There was a large percentage of nuts which were hard as rocks. The nuts which I could actually bite into tasted rotten. Also there were more empty shells than in any purchase I have ever made. I decided to check the expiration date and found that the date is not printed on the bag, but instead is on a stick on label. I carefully peeled back the label and discovered parts of other labels beneath. Imagine that?! No wonder these were totally inedible. I returned them for a refund. If anyone has any suggestions for good quality pistachios, please let me know.

review/text: We just finished off our first bag of Setton Farms Premium California Dry Roasted with Sea Salt Pistachios.  I really like pistachios and have had many other brands, but can tell you that these are really the best I have had. They were very easy to open, fresh, and had a wonderful, flavorful taste. I will most definitely buy them again.

review/summary: Great pistachios, terrible packing
review/text: I received this bag broken, the pistachios were all over the box, I contacted amazon to return them to get a refund to then order them again, but since I left them open in our kitchen table my partner came and started eating them, by the time I noticed she had about a cup of them so I felt I couldn't return them. The box was in good condition so the damage was not in transit, I am not sure how the bag was so broken but the only explanation was that it happened while they packed them. On another note, my partmner didn't get sick from eating them but we didn't want to take a bigger chance. I do like this brand since I ordered the smaller bag before and that is why we decided to get the bigger one.

review/text: This sauce is for those who love high heat and flavor to their favorite dishes, so it's not intended for the casual hot sauce lover who is not acquainted with the strong spice just yet. The heat on this product is very high, even a small amount that will leave your mouth and tongue burning several seconds after consumption.<br /><br />Personally, I like this sauce and the heat lingers for a while and goes great on sandwiches, in chili, salsa and other things you want to add an intense kick to.<br /><br />Recommended for the hot sauce enthusiasts.

review/text: I have to say I am a beef jerky lover, I have tried many brands and makes of jerky and really have not found one I didn't like... until now. These beef sticks are not too spicy but have an odd taste to them, not sure what it is but one friend described is as a smokey twang. I have to agree, its an odd taste that is just not good, followed by a smokey cover up. I bought these to take to a boating party out at the lake because they looked like a good snack food, turned out I could not even give them away at the end of the day.

review/summary: Sour and mushy
review/text: I finally received my order of  buffalo bills  hot shot Hot flavor 2.1 lbs. I bought this because of all the review. My first thought about the taste of this beef stick is that it tasted really sour and i tasted some spices but it was far from hot,it wasn't even hot at all. Its easy to chew probably because it tasted too mushy and soft. The reason why i gave it a 2 star instead of 1 star is because it's was going for a good price. Overall, I wouldn't buy this beef stick because it taste mushy and sour, I'm sure it's not expired because  it says feb 2013. I knew i should've gotten the peperoni flavor beef sticks. Also, from all the other people's review i was expecting a sample from them since i read a lot of people received samples. I was kinda disappointed. So i won't be buying the hot shots again and its not because i didn't receieve a sample. haha

review/summary: They're ok
review/text: I love jerky, and try most new brands I come across. Now and then I get a yen for beef sticks too, and here we are...<br /><br />Good points-- I agree that these are much less greasy than Slim Jims. The consistency of the filler is also much better.<br />  They came very quickly.<br /><br />Not so good points-- One review described them as 'spicy'. To me, 'spicy' adds twang while you're chewing. 'Hot' hangs around in your mouth after you've swallowed. These are 'hot'. They're not blisteringly hot; I'd go for maybe 4 or 5 on a 10 scale, but I wanted 'spicy' not 'hot'.<br />  They mostly just taste like some, uh... unique kind of liquid smoke. They almost taste like meat, but not quite.<br /><br />They're ok. I don't hate 'em, but doubt I'll repeat this particular experiment.

review/summary: Poor product
review/text: I wanted to try these out because of the price and because it seemed to have solid reviews. I really like Slim Jims, and this looked similar and had good reviews.<br /><br />I didn't notice any mushiness that some people claimed. I thought it had a good snap to it, although you can definitely see where the casing is and the rest of the product, and sometimes it will just slide out a bit.<br /><br />I like the packaging. You can stick these into a big slider ziplock bag and it makes it far more convenient than any individually wrapped product, like Slim Jims are. I don't know how well it will keep that way, but I think it should be fine because, well, these products are pretty much designed to be kept like that. I don't know why some companies individually wrap theirs, maybe someone else can chime in on that.<br /><br />And now for the negative. Originally I tried to be more diplomatic with it, because I didn't want to dock stars for it not tasting like a Slim Jim. My brother absolutely hated the sticks and considers them disgusting. I held out that they weren't that bad, but after forcing myself to eat them the last few days I now give up.<br /><br />But worse is the ingredients. These things pack MSG. There is no nutritional label so we don't even know the percentage of it. But it is listed as an ingredient. Now it depends on you if that is a problem or not, for me personally I want to avoid MSG so this product doesn't work for me.<br /><br />I will likely throw away the rest of what I have. It is better to go for regular jerky, which can actually be healthy. These sticks are however a different product that you have to look at carefully, and for me the taste just isn't good enough to justify eating them.

review/text: I bought these on the strength of the reviews.  Inside the thin wrapper the texture was mushy, and I didn't like the taste at all.  It tastes mostly of beef heart, smoke and spices.  I found them inedible.  I had several of my friends try them since I didn't want to waste them if someone else could eat them.  The first two friends did not like them, but the third did, so they found a home.  The free sample of barbeque beef jerky was delicious, and I am going to order some of that.<br /><br />Addendum: Not long after I wrote the above review, I recieved a telephone call from the company.  He said that they stand behind all of their products, and even though I could not return the item since I had given them away, he would send me a replacement of any other jerky.  He sent me the barbeque jerky which I had sampled before. with two additional free samples of other flavors, which were also quite good.  I have never dealt with such a wonderful concern for their customers as I experienced with this company.  I think you can't go wrong buying from them.  He said if anyone doesnt like what they get, they will replace it.

I think it would best describe these as slim jims without the massive amounts of grease and with a more satisfying spicy flavor. If you're still having trouble finding slim jims these are the perfect substitutes or even replacements.

review/text: When I ordered these I was really hoping for some seriously tasty pepperoni sticks after reading reviews claiming that these were "packed with big flavor."  Pepperoni they are not.  If you are expecting seriously spicy and rich pepperoni you will be let down as I was.  Does that make these treats bad?  No, I still found them to be good in their own right.  They're like Slim Jim's that actually taste like you're eating meat as opposed to extruded grease logs.  They're pretty good and I may buy them again but be warned that it's just not quite pepperoni.<br /><br />On a side note, I received a sample of their 3 day cold smoked "Old Smokies" and those things are God in meat form, I highly recommend those.

review/text: I purchased these for my family to snack on and I haven't tasted flavor this good since I was a kid. It's worth every penny and you won't be unsatisfied. I found that we have purchased more of these and will be ordering more. This company has awesome products and stands behind their customers. Customer satisfaction is their number one priority.

review/summary: Taste is passable, they have other products that are better.
review/text: I give the company high marks!  The product arrived quickly, and I very much appreciate the 'gift' package of free 'Honey' Jerky' included. The package was small, but delicious. That in itself prevents me from going below 3 stars.  I took off a star because the Hot Shorts are not even close to being 'mild', and far off from being 'hot'.  Another star because the taste is...just passable.<br /><br />I don't plan on ordering these specific 'Buffalo Bills Hot(?) Shorts' again, but I do plan on ordering other products of theirs.  I am a 'subscribe & save' customer here on Amazon and have a couple of other 'Jerky' subscriptions that I'll end up cancelling and then changing to other offers once I find better replacements.

review/summary: A great snack!
review/text: I bought the Hot Short Shots because I was craving jerky and I wanted something inexpensive. I like really spicy food, so I should first agree with the other reviewers that these snacks will not light your mouth on fire, but there is a noticeable bite to them. But that doesn't stop them from being a thousand times tastier than a Slim Jim or even from regular, grocery store jerky. Plus, they are low calorie - just 25 cal per stick - so they make a great mid-day snack.<br /><br />But there's more to them than their deliciousness. When they arrived, they came well packaged, with a menu of other Choo Choo R products, and even some samples of their other great jerky. This is clearly a company that wants happy customers, and I am happy that my business is going to someone who deserves it.<br /><br />I will definitely be getting these on a regular basis now - I'm hooked!

review/text: Shipping was very fast, but the product is so so. Many other reviews compared these to Slim Jims in one way or another,so here is my thoughts. These are alot drier and a whole lot less greaser than Slim Jims, which is 2 good things about them, but I didn`t care for the flavor or after taste they leave you with. I rate these average at best, but will keep them for a quick snack now and then. Along with my order I also recieved 2 samples; Maple Pepper Beef Jerky & Buffalo Bills "Moist & Tender" Beef Jerky, both are very tasty and a product I will buy again. I still plan on trying more of CHOO CHOO SNACKS other products in the future.

review/summary: Meaty and Delicious
review/text: Just received my first order today.  I purchased lots of different styles of this company's products and will review each one as I try them.  Well packaged and delivered, 2 packs had lost their vacuum.  Was given 2 different samples to try and will review those as well when I taste them.  I consider myself somewhat of an unofficial jerky connoisseur, even making my own jerky in the past.  I like the meat to shine through the taste, not sugar or salt.  A vegetarian I am not!<br /><br />Tasted my first pepperoni mild short shot today.  Upon the first bite I noticed it didn't have squishy fat oozing out of it like I remember these types of beef sticks having years ago when I ate them as a kid.  It had a mild pepperoni taste, not hot, not spicy.  Was that a slight hint of vinegar behind the nuance of flavor?  Had a nice, firm mouth-feel and a slight 'snap' around the edges when bitten into.  Wasn't hit with any sweet, and it certainly wasn't over salted.  Over-all, I rate this product high on the beef stick scale.  These weren't dried out, they were supple.  As a treat, I gave my dog a couple inches of it.  When his face came up to my hand and his nose hit the beef-stick, his eyes sort of rolled back in his head, Ha! To say the least, he loved it too!<br /><br />I have put all the packs of beef into my big freezer so they stay fresh and hold their integrity, since I bought over 150.00 worth (free shipping with 125.00 or more, at this time!)  I started a low carb diet and these are the perfect snack item to have on hand.  The beef is USA grown!  I would reorder these mild pepperoni short sticks again.

review/summary: Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots
review/text: Buffalo Bills Premium Snacks<br /><br />I realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.<br /><br />First, customer service is excellent.  I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.<br /><br />So far I've ordered the following products:<br /><br />1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots<br /><br />2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots<br /><br />3) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Pepperoni Short Shots<br /><br />The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.<br /><br />4) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys<br />These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.<br /><br />5) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size)<br /><br />Taste great if you are a jerky lover.<br /><br />6) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots<br />Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots<br /><br />7) Big Buffalo Ole Smokies<br />Fatter, crisp not as crunchy as short shots, individually wrapped.<br /><br />8) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung<br />O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.<br /><br />All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2010

The Hot Short Shots are the perfect treat with a zing anytime you need a quick snack. I love the 2.1 lbs package. I can keep plenty of beef sticks on hand for when the gang drops in to watch the game. Everyone loves the delicious beef taste of Short Shots and the hot ones are perfect with the cool beverages. Our friends would call it a foul if there was football without Hot Short Shots!

review/summary: Not too bad but probably won't be buying more...
review/text: First off, I feel that in this day and age, with all the online shopping people do, most places should not be so greedy with their shipping prices.  Maybe I've just become spoiled by my Amazon Prime membership but even beyond that, I'd be willing to wait a couple extra days to save the money it costs to ship these things if they shipped free.  I'm sorry but $6 to ship these had me skeptical already and that alone will probably keep me from purchasing more.  That puts the price at just under $30 and in my opinion, they are not worth that.<br /><br />Second, the taste.  To be honest, there isn't much of a difference between these and Slim Jim's.  They might be a bit less greasy, but they are practically the same shape, only shorter.  It's like someone cut a bunch of Slim Jim's into quarters and then bulked them together to make it seem like you're getting much more than you really are.  Okay, sorry, back to the taste.  They do happen to taste fairly well.  If you like Slim Jim's I can't see you not enjoying these.  Also, in terms of heat, they are not bad.  If you hate hot things then you'd probably have to eat more than a couple without drinking anything before it started to bother you and even then it wouldn't be unbearable by any means.<br /><br />Third, the texture is decent on the outside.  The skin provides that "snap" that most people enjoy, however the inside is, as other reviewers have described, a bit on the mushy side.  Maybe that's your thing and you enjoy that but I prefer mine a little more dense.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say 3 stars is all I'd give this product.  Were they ever to offer free shipping then I'd have to bump it up to a 4 star review but like I said, at $30 I will not be purchasing more of these.

review/summary: Much more appealing than Slim Jims
review/text: As a kid I loved to eat Slim Jims but gave them up as an adult because I can't tolerate the greasiness.  I wish I knew about Short Shots sooner because these things are a great replacement!  I originally bought the Mild flavor as a camping/hiking take along snack and it was well received by all of the adults, but none of the kids.  After our trip and running low, I bought the Pepperoni flavor which I found to be more peppery and much saltier than the Mild flavor.  While I prefer the Mild, my husband and older daughter prefer the Pepperoni.  Next flavor we will try is the hot.  The texture is drier and chewier than Slim Jims, but I think the quality is better also.  I realize some people have a problem with beef heart as ingredient, but muscle is muscle (and this is probably in Slim Jims too).

review/summary: Not for everyone.
review/text: Before purchasing this product, I read the reviews.  Most were very positive which ultimately convinced me to make the purchase.  Unfortunately, the only real way to know if you would like a product such as this is to taste it.  After doing so, I was very disappointed.  I found the flavor to be absent except for all of the salt.  It's labeled "hot", however, I didn't detect any spicy heat whatsoever.  The texture was stringy and chewy.  After chewing on them, the Short Shots wind up as a balled up mass which you either decide to swallow or spit out.  Overall, I did not like the product one bit and rated it with one star.

review/summary: These Are NOT Slim Jims....They're BETTER!
review/text: I read the reviews of these Short Shots & they get compared to Slim Jims a lot.  They are not anything like Slim Jims!  These are small, moist & most of all tasty little sticks of beef.  When you finish eating 1/2 a dozen (if you can stop there) of these, your fingers & mouth are not bathed in that orange grease that Slim Jims leave you with.  One bag of the Short Shots is almost 1/2 the cost of Slim Jims.  What gives there?  On the "Bang For The Buck" Scale, this product receives a 9+.  Only because a 10 is perfect & everybody knows that nothing is perfect nowadays.  Now I know I've said enough because I've just finished the 8th stick while typing this review!  Enjoy them, they're addicting!!!!

review/text: I have memories of when my father used to bring us slim jims and we just loved them. As an adult I do not like the taste any longer of most slim jim products. I think these taste much better and the 2.1 lb bag goes a long way. I use food saver to put them in smaller packages. I have ordered several bags of these over the years and enjoy them as a quick snack. These are labeled HOT but to me are not that hot. Hope this review helps, pick up a bag I am sure you will enjoy them.<br /><br />Cheers.

review/summary: Usually excellent---what happened?
review/text: I have ordered the Hot Short Shots many times in the past, and they are usually of excellent quality. My family loves them, as well as our two pups. However, this last order was not as good. Some of them were very tough and were collapsed and wrinkled on the outside. The taste seemed a little off, and I thought it was my imagination so I didn't say anything, but when my husband tasted his first one, he noticed right away. I am hoping that this is just an off batch, because this is one of our favorite snacks and I don't know of any other snack sticks that have the distinctive flavor and texture that these have. I will cross my fingers and order again!

review/summary: Mostly tastes of beef heart
review/text: I've had several brands of beef sticks and am not a very picky eater, so was surprised that there was a pretty big discrepancy between how this product was reviewed here and how it tasted. To me it tasted more like beef heart than beef (and I have actually sampled beef heart before, so I know what it tastes like! Not something I would buy); the skin provided some resistance but then it was very mushy on the inside. Maybe my batch had a higher proportion of that than normal? I got the hot flavor, but that did not mask the weirdness of the taste.<br /><br />The reason for two stars instead of one: I brought it with us while we were camping, and we were a little short on food. The short sticks provided sustenance even if we all grumbled a little bit about the taste. They didn't cause any diarrhea or stomach problems.<br /><br />Unlike other people I did not receive any samples from Buffalo Bills and so have no input with regards to how their other stuff tastes.

review/summary: Good, but possible quality control issue
review/text: I've bought Slim Jim and Jack Links X-Sticks quite a few times, so figured I'd give these a try. I purchased these based on the reviews, and they taste absolutely awful. I choose to go with the "Mild" flavor, and there is no mild flavor to it. Just extremely salty and some sour taste as well. I don't write reviews often, but considering how high the ratings are and how bad the product I received was, I figured I should share my experience.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Update. The seller happened to email me and sent me a "free sample pack" of beef jerk products after I wrote my initial review. The strange thing is that sample pack included a pack of "Beef Sticks (didn't say mild, hot, or anything on it). These beef sticks look just like the mild beef sticks I got from Amazon. However, they actually taste good, slightly less salty, and have the mild flavoring. This leads me to believe that there was something wrong with the ones from Amazon, and that these do taste quite good as long as you get a good batch.

review/summary: Great Deal & Tasty but Hot is a little mild for me.
review/text: Only tried Hot.<br /><br />Amazon $25 on 02/12/2012.<br /><br />Pro<br />Value for weight & price<br />Tasty.<br />Nice Texture.<br />Outside Snappy.<br />All Beef.<br /><br />Cons<br />Hot is kind of mild, takes about 3 sticks before I feel it mildly.<br /><br />Would be nice if individually wrapped but Zip Lock Bags work just fine for portability.

review/text: The delivery was quick and the package arrived without issue. The reason for the 2 stars is because i wasnt satisfied with the Flavor . I just dont have a taste for it. so now i have 2 pounds of meat sticks that im not going to eat. the company did send a sample of its barbecue beef jerky which was really nice. next time i will have to order that. you win some and you lose some. it happens.

Please note this is for the "Hot" version of this product (there are three flavors and I have not tried the other two so your millage may very on the other flavors) Shipment was fast and packaging was A1.

review/text: These are realy great.  They have a nice tangy smoke flavor, that goes great with the heat.  They're also alot less salty then other beef sticks I've had.  I guess they use the smoke to perserve them.  Instead of using lots of salt.<br /><br />The heat is not super intense.  It might be to much if you are sensitive to heat, but in that case.  Buffalo Bills has a mild version.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I bought these as a birthday gift for my jerky-loving husband and was he ever happy. He thought they were great and we intend to order many more products from this company.<br />They are salty, and a bit greasy with a mix of chewy crunchy outer and a chewy inner. The first bite is a tad spicy but after that its fine. You defiantly can't stop at just one! My husband made me hide them from him because he quickly polished off about 8 of them and he wanted to make them last!<br />Also, our order was received three days ahead of the estimated time to ship them so that was a big plus.<br />My hubby was thrilled because the company also threw in a free sample pack of honey pepper jerky as a thanks ( the price of which covered the shipping and handling charge, so I feel like I got a good deal).<br />Completely pleased with this product!

review/summary: Great product, Good price
review/text: I had never purchased Beef Jerky or Beef Sticks through an on line vendor, prior to placing an order with Choo Choo R. Snacks. The products arrived on time and in good shape.  They were great. The peperoni sticks lasted about 4 days.  The big bag of jerky, about 6.  I had heard several customers complain about the jerky being tough.  When I was growing up, some 50 yearsw ago, jerked meat WAS TOUGH, chewy, but tough.  Bufflo Bills' Hickory smoked jerky was delicious.  They sent along a packof Teriaki (SP), flavored jerky.  Wow, that was soooo good!  I have placed another order with Choo Choo R Snacks.  I will buy all my Jerky, Beef Sticks, etc from Choo Choo.  They do these products right!

review/summary: Damn they're good
review/text: I've been ordering these for the past year or so. They make amazing snacks for camping trips and they're fun to share with people (until they come back asking for 2nds... and 3rds...). Yeah, they're that good. As some others have said, imagine a Slim Jim, but without all of the grease that soaks out everywhere. It's true that it doesn't have that 'authentic' pepperoni taste, but in my opinion it's more than good enough. Not only that, but the people at Choo Choo snacks are generous enough to add in a sampler for some of their other products in every order. Their jerky samples taste incredible, but I'm more of a beef stick person. I like the snap that they make when you bite into them. Buffalo Bills short shots are more than worth the asking price. If you've never tried them before, don't be afraid. If you're a fan of meat snacks, you'll like these without a doubt. Hell, I bet you could even get some vegetarians to convert just from the scent. :D

review/summary: Good but not excellent, but I'd buy again
review/text: These are good little beef sticks.  I bought the mild, but I wonder if I'd enjoy a more spicy one.  The flavor isn't the best for this sort of thing, but it's far from the worst and is quite good.  Just not quite up to a "five star" rating for me.  Still, I can't complain and I'd order products from these people again, just try a different flavor or product maybe next time.<br /><br />As an aside, they also sent a sampler size pack of their "country cut" beef jerky in Teriyaki flavor, and that I found to be excellent.  The next thing I buy from them might be the beef jerky instead, just based on the small sample package I found that much closer to a five star product.<br /><br />I did a seperate review for the seller proper, but in brief I'd call their shipping five star, very fast and well packaged.  Just for the record without making a comment pro or con about whom they used to ship, they used US Mail.

I have not had any problems with these short shots other than having to hide them from scavengers.

Much better than slim jims or any other kind of beef straws out there. If these sticks sound good to you then chances are you'll be happy with this purchase.

review/text: If you have a chance to visit the Tao of Tea shop at 3430 SE Belmont Street in Portland, Oregon, you'll find a unique place with a unique approach to tea. Fine tea there is not chopped beyond recognition. Think of a salad bar of various teas, all nicely dried, of course, displaying a range of colors and shapes that cry out to be sampled. Tea is, of course, a matter of taste. I especially like the Kukicha, which includes tea leaf stems that provide a richer, darker taste that I crave. Getting it from amazon.com is much easier for me, since I live in Southern California, and cheaper than at the local store that carries it.

review/text: I have generally purchased loose teas at one of the brick and mortar specialty stores.  I took a chance on this selection as I've enjoyed Boston Tea's bagged selections in the past.  They did not disappoint.<br /><br />If you like fruit flavored, black tea this is a KEEPER; mild, yet fruity and flavorful with just enough ginger to tantalize.  Black tea can be strong and sometimes bitter if brewed incorrectly.  However, this tea hasn't been bitter through my first whole pound!  The black tea has never overpowered the subtle added flavorings and vice versa; an absolutely perfect blending for an absolutely satisfying cuppa either on its own or with a little something.  I suggest a little sweetener of your choice and you're ready to sit back for that "Ahhh!" moment.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommend.

I did get a response from the seller, and they said that they were in a warehouse, and due to the cold weather, they were firmer. The ropes were within their expiration --or shelf life date. I probably will not order them again.

review/summary: Good pop. Not to be confused with the gum.
review/text: BR is a great soda found in mainly the southern US, and is a very popular drink in Texas.<br /><br /> The flavor is quite hard to describe, some say bubblegum, others say vanilla, others say cherry. But it tastes great!<br /><br /> Another thing you can make is a Big Red Float. Just pour a glass of Big red into a glass, put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it and VIOLA! A great treat!<br /><br /> Try this pop out! It also comes in a new flavor, Big Red Vannila Float. BR with a hint of vanilla!

review/summary: Big Red - Absolutely the Best!!
review/text: Big Red - the unofficial soda of Texas is excellent.  It's hard to pinpoint the exact taste; some say bubble gum, while others compare it to cherry.  Regardless, you should definitely give this a try.  Best tasted cold - you won't regret.  I only wish it was distributed in New England.
