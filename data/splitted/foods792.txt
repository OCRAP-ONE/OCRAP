review/summary: Fantastic, but extremely rich
review/text: I'm surprised! These are awesome! They are just like the organic ones I used to buy for my kids before we stopped eating gluten. They're crunch and tasty. They are quite sweet though. Not something you could eat a lot of in one sitting. I'm done at 2. Maybe that's a good thing though. :)

review/text: I've been gluten free for about 10 years now and love my cookies!  I generally order Schar products and love their vanilla sandwich creams which really are as good as or better than gluten cookies.  With Glutino I feel it's hit and miss.  Their crackers are generally delicious and I love their pretzels but these cookies tasted like styrofoam and the icing was super sweet.  Not my favorite product from Glutino.  If you didn't care for these, you might try the Schar vanilla cremes.  They're amazing!

review/text: Having tried a couple of other brands of gluten-free sandwich cookies, these are the best of the bunch.  They're crunchy and true to the texture of the other "real" cookies that aren't gluten-free.  Some might think that the filling makes them a bit too sweet, but for me that just means I've satisfied my sweet tooth sooner!  The chocolate version from Glutino is just as good and has a true "chocolatey" taste - something that isn't there with the other gluten-free brands out there.

review/text: I loved these cookies when I first tried them, but found that in the humidity they will get soggy and gross if left open for too long.  Easily fixed with a Ziploc, but one time I tossed them in the fridge to keep them extra fresh.  That was when I fell IN love with these cookies.  When cold the creamy layers really hold up against the crunchy wafer and make a wonderful combination.  They are truly addicting.  Also, because we keep our entire house allergen free for my boys, these cookies are some that I can confidently serve when entertaining gluten-eating friends.  They often ask where they can get their own!

review/text: I really shouldn't complain:  the world would be a sadder place without these.  They are like gluten-free Kitkats, which is wonderful.<br /><br />However, they also smell like potatoes.  The chocolate covers the potato taste and smell, for the most part, but, it's still a little bit like eating chocolate-covered crispy potatoes.<br /><br />However, as you are probably aware, there are variations in what people can taste and smell.  Personally, I can tell what vodka was made from--potatoes, wheat, whatever--even though it's so finely distilled that there shouldn't be any way to distinguish that.  If you're not super-sensitive to tastes and smells, you probably won't notice the potato at all, in which case, these would be fabulous.

review/summary: It's good junk food.  They also smell like potatoes.
review/text: First, let me say that I love this company.  They have somehow managed, with very difficult flours, to make normal junk food.  (These kinds of cookies are sold in American supermarkets in packages that are three times the size.)<br /><br />The packaging is pretty;  the cookies are crispy, light, and very appealing in your hand.  They are an exact duplicate of the wheat version.  However, once you get them up to your nose, you can smell the potato flour they are made from.<br /><br />Pull them away from your nose, and you have a very pretty cookie.  Bring them back in to your nose, and it's a surreally icky potatoey experience.  Cookies like this shouldn't smell like potato vodka.<br /><br />They do have a chocolate-covered version of this that you can't really smell, because the flour is covered. It's such a sugar rush that you may not care what it tastes like, particularly because it has an excellent chocolate-sugar-bomb wafer cookie texture.<br /><br />Just hold your nose.

review/summary: Beware of Glutino
review/text: My son and I who are both Celiacs loved Glutino wafers in both chocolate and dark chocolate varieties. We were on our 3rd box when I opened one of the bars and went to bite into it. It was the equivalent to biting into some sort of spongy rock. I immediately spit out what chocolate had fallen into my mouth while biting it. The bar itself seemed extremely stale to me. I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada, then sent to USA to be bought. It seems to me like one of the bars I had floated around a facility for quite some time before it was actually packaged and sent. Or worse who knows. I'm glad it was me and not my 3 year old son who bit into it.<br /><br />I tried contacting Glutino about what happened. I tried calling several times as well as sent messages via the internet. But no response. It went from being suspicious to down right scary, what are they hiding and if this is how they treat their costumers- how do they treat their food?<br /><br />Please be forewarned. Going gluten free isn't easy and Glutino is a big brand on the celiac's grocery list but since our incident we avoid Glutino at all costs.

Only mushroom I can buy locally is regular mushroom, but now I can keep this in my pantry for whenever I need to use it in a recipe. I just made a Pasta with one of the packs and that was great! Just enough for 4 people, and the mushrooms are ready to use after soaking them in hot water for 30 minutes. The left over liquid can be used to make a recipe like cream of mushroom soup or something as it has great extract from them. Considering they are organic, price is good for me. I also bought Shiitake and Matsutake too.

There is something about the tatse that makes it feel like you are not drinking plain water.  I even use it in my coffee machine and when I make tea.<br /><br />The only down side, is the cost.  But this proves that old saying "You Get What You Pay For" is true and you can usually find it on sale at a grocery store.<br /><br />I personally feel much better drinking more water, and would not have done so without Smart Water.

I've been looking for a supplement water without flavoring for quite some time, and I've found the perfect specimen in the Glaceau Smart Water. As a highly active individual, there was a noticeable change in my energy level with the addition of the water to my routine (as compared to regular water). For a fairly inactive individual, I'm unsure as to how significant the difference may be, but at the very least, this product is refreshing and nourishing. Now, if only it had vitamins in it in addition to the electrolytes...

review/summary: Overpriced bottled water
review/text: This product is no better than any other bottled water brands name or simple tap water. First of all, Glaceau is distilled MUNICIPAL water. Second of all, buying this product for the sole reason that it is  distilled water isn't very advantageous to your health or is a waste of money. Distilled water does more harm than good. Drinking distilled water for a long period will remove necessary electrolytes from your body such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and several trace elements that are absolutely necessary for your health. These deficiencies can cause irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure. So what if it contains electrolytes. The average person is not doing very strenuous activities that requires them to drinks with added electrolytes because he/she is profusely sweating out electrolytes  onto skin. Water has naturally occurring electrolytes. Also, fruits and vegetable are good sources of electrolytes.

review/summary: A great gift
review/text: I was very worried how this would arrive, whether the chocolate would be broken or all over the place.  This box includes a few trays that serve as crates for the mini bottles. The crates are slid into the box as if it were a shelf.  It was like the equivalent of an egg in an egg carton.  When I opened it, the bottom tray had its chocolates fallen out. The other trays had their chocolate secured. Needless to say I freaked out a little bit and inspected all of the bottles.  The chocolate is thick and did not break...for any of them! The presentation of each bottle is very cute and not cheap looking at all.  The packaging came in a 1st class, prefect fit, package.

review/text: I know this is a gross title for a review, but it's true. You can tell a lot about the quality of dog food and its ingredients by the consistency and quantity of dog poop.  I've tried a lot of high-end dog foods before finally settling on Innova EVO. The ingredients and the nutritional composition were exactly what I was looking for, and my Bichon Frise and Havanese absolutely love this food.  And I can tell they're absorbing the nutrients from this food because their poops are smaller, firm (but not hard), and regular.

review/text: Okay, let me be one to say my "kids" love this food. I have three longcoat Chihuahuas who are very finicky. One would eat something I got and the others wouldn't and, this has been going on for a couple of years now. My oldest, a male was the worst and even he eats it. This is the first food I've gotten that they all like and eat regularly which, cuts back on my preparing wet foods for them. I am so happy with the product and will continue to buy this brand of foods. I've done lots of research and this has most of what I'm looking for, no by-products, grains, and chemicals I've never heard of or would want to eat myself, much less feed to my loved ones. The cost in comparison to the store brands is a bit more BUT, I save in not having to make larger qty meals from fresh, organic foods myself and...they are worth it. I can already see a change in their coats and stamina over about 4-6weeks. Happy Customer.

Well no more -- he's like a different dog at mealtime. Happy and satisfied. Enough said!

review/summary: Protein content too high... gave my dog acute renal failure.  RIP Ollie
review/text: About 3 months ago I researched all the different foods and finally decided to purchase EVO because I thought it was what was best for my dog.  He is 3 1/2 and healthy (or at least he WAS until recently).  He has routine physicals including bloodwork for kidney problems so I didn't worry when I read that this food can cause problems with underlying kidney disease.  One day he began having diarrhea and refused to eat... I thought, no big deal dogs get tummy upsets once in awhile, right?  But he didnt get better.  His Belly and hind legs started to swell so much that the skin looked like it would tear...  multiple labs and fecals showed kidney disease of unknown cause.  He has had ultrasounds, multiple blood and urine cultures, a plasma transfusion and is now on multiple medications.  His BUN/CREAT has shot up and he now refuses to eat ANYTHING.  His entire diet consists of water, pills and whatever vitamin paste I can force him to take.  My heart is breaking for him...  I can't do anything and feel helpless.  If it goes on much longer without improving I will face the horrible decision of humane euthanization.  I feel that it was caused 100% from the high protein diet.  We can find NO other cause and he has no underlying kidney disease.  Please choose a different food and save the pain that my dog and I are going through right now.<br />UPDATE>>> Not long after I made this review Ollie lost his battle to acute renal failure at the young age of 3.  No other underlying condition was found and my vet feels that the extremely high protein content in EVO is what shut his kidneys down.  RIP Ollie... :-(

review/summary: Outstanding Quality
review/text: I can honestly say that I have done my research on high quality foods for my cat and dog.  Evo has the highest meat content in any dog food I've seen.  My dog loves the small bites.  It is very high in protein, so I do not recommend this to people who have little dogs unless they are very active.  I have a 8mo old Belgian Malinois and her breed needs good quality food as she is a working dog.  She did have diarreah in the beginning, but I think its because I switched it from red meat to chicken too fast.  So, if you are planning to switch to Evo, just make sure you take at least 10 days to fully switch it to Evo.  I am serious, I never wait that long, but with this high of protein, you really need to transition this food slowly.  Otherwise, your dog will have a rumbling tummy and possibly poopy accidents in your house.<br /><br />The wet food is amazing too.  It contains quality ingredients and even smells decent.  I wish more people would buy better quality food for their pets.  Its such a shame to see dogs eating Kibbles and Bits or Pedigree or basically anything you buy from Walmart or Target.  All those contain are fillers and by-products.

review/text: Procter & Gamble - A Probing Look at Corporate Ethics<br /><br />Iams and Eukanuba Dog Foods<br /> In 1999, P&G purchased the Iams Company, which included the Eukanuba dog food brand, for $2.3 billion.<br /><br />Prior to the buyout, Iams was a respectable family owned and operated dog and cat food company. Iams and, Eukanuba in particular, were a cut above other mass market dog food brands, and were only available through specialty pet stores and veterinary clinics. (Note, one can't compare their original foods with the quality of our present products, as premium all natural dog food, as we know it today, did not exist in the 1990s).<br /><br />Shortly after the acquisition, P&G expanded both Iams and Eukanuba to the mass market, making it widely available in supermarkets and retail stores such as Costco, K-Mart and Walmart, across the globe.<br /><br />Within months of the takeover, it became very apparent that changes had been made to the formulation of the foods. There were numerous accounts of dogs and cats suddenly developing various health issues and dog food allergies -- from diarrhea to intense itching, brittle and poor quality coats, skin rashes, hot spots, and even blown coats.<br /><br />The packaging remained unchanged, and no notification was given to retailers, pet owners or vets. (Note: Pet food companies are not required to list ingredient changes on dog food labels for 6 months -- a legal loophole for P&G).<br /><br />After much publicity and a huge public backlash, P&G admitted to switching ingredients from rice to barley, but denied making any other formula changes. They went as far as adding a PR page to their website in an attempt to dispel what they referred to as "rumors", and insisted they were continuing to use the same quality ingredients as before!<br /><br />In April 2000, P&G implemented another strategy in an attempt to further reassure the public of their "emphatic commitment to maintaining the premium quality of Iams and Eukanuba dog and cat foods" - and that - "any product changes that occured were designed to enhance the product". They convened an independent seven-member panel, known as the Iams Quality Review Board, consisting of veterinarians, breeders, research nutritionists and pet specialty store owners. The members met at the Company's Ohio plant to observe and review the manufacturing process and analyze and compare ingredients lists against product samples obtained over the past twelve months

review/text: Needing a healthy snack to take to work with me one day, I picked these up. As most of the packaging was in Japanese, I just automatically assumed that these were wasabi peas because they looked just like wasabi peas usually look. I didn't really give the ingredients more than a slight glance, as I was in a hurry.<br /><br />If you were wondering, these are not wasabi peas. They are, however, still very tasty & crunchy. They are lightly salted, having only 100 mg of sodium in each serving. (There are 4 servings in the bag.)<br /><br />The bag doesn't look huge, but it packs quite a big amount for the size it is & it really was good. If you want a nice Japanese snack that isn't spicy, has low sodium & tastes nice, you'll like this stuff. If you're looking for something spicy, you might want to pass over this product.

review/summary: the best pasta
review/text: I have been searching for pasta the meets the exacting criteria of whole grain and low sodium, and this delicious penne qualifies for my highest recommendation.  Carbohydrates can be a problem with most pasta, due to the processed white grain product that used to make them, but this pasta is made from whole wheat, a far more wholesome option.  Because of this fact, it has a deep and rich flavor, which I have never found in any other kind of pasta, and unhampered by unhealthful added sodium salt.<br /><br />I bought 5 bags, and filled a gallon jar, which left two bags to spare.  With my nose in the jar, is smells _exactly_ like whole wheat, and you can see the bran in the noodles.  When it is cooked, it looks like regular pasta.  Due to the fact that it is unseparated semolina, the cooked noodles are a little brittle, but it tastes much better than the regular stuff.  Don't worry, this is the real deal.  This pasta is dream pasta!  Congratulations to an insightful manufacturer.<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]

review/text: I try to limit processed sugary foods in our diet, however these are my favorite treat to give my son.  They are fairly low in sugar and he likes to ask the letters on them.  These are the only food item I have purchased in the baby isle at the grocery store... I think they are fresher from Amazon... and cheaper too!

review/text: My son loves these cookies & I love that we can learn letters during snack time.  He really gets into looking through the box for a certain letter, asking about things that start with that letter etc.  Some whole grain would be nice that is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Check the EXPIRATION DATE!!!!
review/text: These candies are great if they are NOT expired. I have ordered these candies from several different sellers on multiple occasions and I have consistently received expired products. Additionally, some sellers put company stickers over top of the expiration date so you can't tell when the product expires. Beware of the following sellers as I have had trouble with each of them: Toys Samurai, ABCTOY4me and ToysDiva. I have reported each of them to Amazon (4 different complaints in the past 4 months) and Amazon has done nothing to stop them from sending out expired products or products with hidden expiration dates. Good luck.

review/summary: Very nice soup
review/text: I don't normally care for soup mixes, but thought a single serving mix was worth trying, especially for 150 calories per serving.  I was pleasantly surprised by the full flavor of these soups. They are a little thin, but still flavorful, and they don't have that 'processed' taste a lot of mixes have. They are high in sodium, but that's nothing new for a soup. Just be careful with the rest of the daily menu so it all balances out.  The red chili and the green chili soup mixes are perfect with a cup or two of chopped broccoli thrown in.  I tried broccoli in the tortilla soup but it wasn't a good mix. I may try adding chopped squash or some other veggie instead.<br /><br />My package was leaking powder when it arrived. Several of the packets were not sealed properly and had leaked out. Comida Loca customer service was genuinely concerned and very attentive and sent a replacement. I've also ordered another box from Amazon.

review/summary: Very expensive spice mix
review/text: The reviews were good; variety sounded good, but by the time you add the chicken and the tomatoes and the milk, you've paid several dollars for about 1/2 cup of dried potatoes and spices.  Was not surprised to see that potato is the primary ingredient.<br /><br />Yes, as reviewers said, nice blend of spices but unless you add quite a lot of your own ingredients to the pot, there is no substance - just nicely flavored milk/water.  Will not buy again.

review/text: This soup takes a little bit of time to make - it's not a mix with water and boil soup.  I followed the directions exactly the first time I made it and the second time, I added frozen corn and only used milk (instead of milk and water) for a heartier richer soup.  But the spices are just right!  I really like this product.  It is a quality product!  I live in Europe where I can't get any Mexican food, so this satisfies my cravings for something spicey.  And it's easy to pack or ship.

review/summary: What makes this taste good...
review/text: Salt makes this taste good. I hate to say it but this stuff has been sitting on my pantry shelf for months and months. After making my first cup of hot soup (very easy, by the way, just add water and microwave....), I thought it tasted bitter and a bit flat. So, out of desperation, lately, I had nothing for snacking, so I made myself a cup of this soup. I added some soy sauce (don't know why). That made it absolutely delicious - salt was what it needed. Salt has that ability to 'fix' what is lacking. And it certainly fixed this for me. It has a very good taste, once adjusted with just a little bit of salt.

review/summary: This soup is super.....good
review/text: I had Turtle Island tortilla soup before, it was very good but I can't find that in the local markets, that's why I checked into Amazon and looked for it. Instead I came across the comida loca soup mix reviews, people seem really like it, so I ordered some and tried it out myself. I really enjoy the soup, it is very tasty and easy to make. I won't say it tastes better than Turtle Island brand, but it's definitely a lot cheaper. It cost about half the price of the other brand, but it taste just as good as the other brand. I'll definitely buy it again. Thank you for the reviews.

review/text: Actually, I couldn't make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients, and a fully-stocked kitchen.  The flavors are crisp and balanced, not too veggie-heavy nor too sharp, just the right balance and thickness.  And they are almost complete -- you just add milk, or water, and more ingredients if you happen to have them -- bell peppers, for instance -- and you have a full-fledged soup.  The Comida Loca soups are not "open and serve soups" nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients -- they are ALMOST complete from the container, and you add a little bit (milk, corn chips, etc) at the end.  So they are a terrific mix of easy but not over-preocessed.  As you can tell, I am a big fan and always have a variety of them on hand -- perfect for a northeast winter's day!

review/text: The soups that I ordered were delicious. Let me begin with that. However, it took me awhile to receive them. The first order I received was only an empty box. Apparently it was damaged during shipping and was torn open. I emailed Amazon and they replaced the shipment immediately with no questions asked. THANK YOU.<br /><br />The second (same) shipment that I received was also damaged. This time, the outside of the packaging was fine, but the soups were leaking. Of the 32 total soup packets, 8 of them work broken open.<br /><br />The failing, I believe, is not in the shipping but rather the packaging of these. They need to be shipped in a tight box rather than the large box they were delivered.<br /><br />I operate a small shop inside an office building, and really would like to continue ordering these soups, however, they are too expensive to lose 25% upon delivery.<br /><br />Thanks, I look forward to improvements...at least in shipping.<br /><br />Regards,<br />John Jean<br />[...].

review/text: This barely qualifies as food. It's a little plastic bag of dried corn, a few little pieces of dried potato and some spice reminiscent of what you'd find in a 10 cent pack of ramen. Add water and you've got yourself spicy corn water. Honestly, who are these other reviewers?<br /><br />Just awful. I'm throwing the rest out, what a waste of time and money.
