review/summary: Meow Mix
review/text: Meow Mix is a very awful cheap cat kibble that has carcinogenic food colorings, and other unhealthy ingredients in it.  The price is high and can be purchased cheaper at Walmart, Target or Petsmart but to feed this junk to your cats is like feeding them poison.

review/summary: Sunflower Seed - it really is a great deal
review/text: I bought the sunflower seed thinking the ad must be a misprint - fifteen two-pound bags for $9 or so (~$17 including shipping).  When they sent me the sunflower seed - they did send just one bag.  But, I wrote and said the Amazon ad said 15 bags.  So, they sent me 14 more bags which was the amount I was supposed to get.  Thus, the sunflower seed with shipping cost about $0.60 a pound.  You can't beat this bargain!  And the birds love the seed -so it must not be old.  I (and the birds) couldn't be more pleased.

review/summary: Leek dish a disaster
review/text: I am not sure I want to purchase anything from you all again. It was like a quarter slice instead of a round shape like on the catalog. I was suppose to pay $7.49 for shipping and the product cost was $5.71 which would be a total of $12.00 and it was to be delivered in two days, it came like four days after. So you all took $25.00 out of my credit card. So if you would like to retain me as a customer please resolve this matter as soon as possible. ASAP. Looking forward to a favorable reply. marla luben.

review/summary: Nightmare!
review/text: What a nightmare. I received a couple samples of the Cafe Escapes Cafe Caramel K-Cups direct from the manufacturer and I was so excited to try them. I use my Keurig everyday and routinely clean the thing. I put in the first cup this morning and it made the regular noise, then stopped. I thought maybe something was wrong with my machine so I took out the K-Cup (a mess!) and ran water through the Keurig a few times to "clean it". I tried again with another Cafe Caramel K-Cup and got the same results. I think whatever is in the K-Cup itself is too thick to push through the machine. It sputtered a few times spraying caramel everywhere. I tried a third new one with the same results so I just gave up. I tried one of my regular coffee K-Cup right after and it brewed just fine. Such a disappointment that I couldn't try the caramel flavor. Maybe they'll release an updated formula that will work better!

review/summary: Excellent for Allergies in Bulldogs!
review/text: I have an English Bulldog, who is now 1.5 years old.  He has suffered since he was about 6 months with terrible scratching.  He will chew on his paws, lick his legs, do the fancy 3-leg-standing belly scratch, and often would lay on the brick hearth and scrape his chin back and forth.  Needless to say, this would cause his skin to be red, raw, often broken, etc.  Hot Spots weren't really a problem, but we could tell he was miserable.  Ear infections plagued him for about 3-4 months repeatedly...<br /><br /> The vet was no help - the did try to alleviate his symptoms, but never tried to find the source of the problem.  I decided after researching for a while, that a food allergy was to blame.  I eradicated all corn and chicken from his diet, as these are common Bulldog allergens in food.  I slowly switched him to Blue Buffalo Fish and Sweet Potato formula.<br /><br />Previously, he had been on Eukanuba adult maintenance formula.  I had raised many dogs in my life with this food formula, and they had led long and healthy lives.  With a proper, slow integration of food, he did not encounter any loose stools, and his itching has greatly subsided.  i have had him on this food now for 3 weeks, now eating only this food.<br /><br />Bulldogs are BIG chewers, so I traded all his chicken basted rawhides for beef basted rawhides, and changed from Milkbone treats to another one made from Cranberries and Oatmeal with NO corn or poultry products.<br /><br />He was tentative at first with the food change, as he would normally eat once a day around 4:30. Now, with his new Blue Buffalo food, he eats the food as soon as it hits the bowl, and is a much happier dog.  His coat is healthier, and his shedding has slowed to a crawl!!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this food to anyone!

I am assuming this was the sweet potato. They have never done this with the Natural Balance. They did this thru the entire bag. yippee. I just swept it up and fed it to the squirrels. The cats wouldnt eat it either. Picky snobs!

review/summary: Love Blue Buffalo
review/text: Blue Buffalo is the best pet food out there.  My dog Bailey loves the Fish and Sweet Potato flavor.  He eats it down so fast I am amazed that he doesn't choke!  I have tried other brands with him and while he eats them, it's not with the same relish that he eats the Blue Buffalo.  I also like knowing that the ingredients are healthier for him than Science Diet or Purina.  He is 3 years old and I want him to have a long healthy life, and I believe that with a diet of Blue Buffalo, he will.

review/summary: Rave reviews from my Airedales!!
review/text: A few months ago we adopted two adult Airedales.  They had been pretty neglected and were overweight.  Both frequently limped when they walked and neither would run and play.  The female groaned every time she had to get to her feet.  They were lethargic and had been fed a supermarket brand dry food.  We immediately switched to Blue Buffalo Adult Fish and Sweet Potato food - they absolutely love it.  Both have lost weight and the change in their energy level is remarkable.  I'm a believer!  I can't recommend this food highly enough.  The Blue Buffalo cookies are a real favorite around here, too.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Product
review/text: There are a couple of poor reviews on this product that attack the amount of sodium in these crackers. Firstly, I don't know what the regular diet or pallet of these parents are, but according to my family, these are on the bland side, the last impression I got when I tasted these crackers was that they were overly salty. You want salty, go eat a Ritz. The nutrition information states that 30 crackers will provide 220mg of sodium. Well, unless you pile half a bag in front of your kid and plop them down in front of a TV and thereby introduce them into the life of the American couch potato, there should be nothing to complain about. (In addition, any competent medical authority will state that a child should average around 1 gram of sodium per day, that means 1000mg.)<br /><br />These crackers are small and that needs to be taken into consideration, observe your child closely and ensure they are ready for them. Our daughter started these when she was 9 months and has done perfectly fine with them. She usually consumes 2-3 crackers per feeding (nothing near 30). They are 'plain' flavored, I would describe them as buttery in flavor.<br /><br />Again, thanks to Earth's Best for a great organic, non-GMO product without the nonsense ingredients, Good Job and keep up the good work!

review/summary: The 6 box set of tiny crackers is a very long-lasting supply.  They're salty but better than others I've seen in terms of health
review/text: I think this is the best choice for babies in the cracker category in terms of health and likability.  I had tried other types of crackers and they just threw them after biting into them. They like these and eat them and only sometimes throw them. Babies are amazing at how expressive they are when they don't want food offered to them.<br /><br />My ten month old twins eat these crackers, but not every time they're offered, and they're fairly healthy with the possible exception of saltiness.  They're by far the saltiest thing they eat.<br /><br />Considering that they need to put things in their mouths due to teething and basic discovery of the world, this is a great product to have on hand just to give them something edible that can go in the mouth.<br /><br />Getting it in a pack of 6 at this discount beats buying them one box at a time at the store.  I haven't seen this in a big box store yet, so I believe this must be one of the better deals at the moment.<br /><br />One box of these for babies around the age of mine (10 months) will last a long time.  The crackers are tiny and since they're so salty, they don't gobble them up.  When you get the 6 boxes, you've certainly got a long-lasting supply.

They taste really good (about what you would expect from a Keebler cracker), but the ingredients are all things you recognize and would put into crackers you make at home. They are organic, so if you care about that - this would be a plus as well.<br />The price is fair, especially if you use subscribe and save. My kids have been eating these since they were toddlers and even though they are older now, they still enjoy them. Yes, they do have Elmo crackers, so they may not be welcome in your older child's lunch bag, but would be a great guilty pleasure for them to have as a snack at home.<br />I will also admit that I LOVE them as well!

review/text: The first time I tasted these crackers, I thought to myself "Are you kidding Earth's Best?"  Really EB should know better.  220 mg of Sodium in a single serving of 20 g.  Save your developing baby's kidneys and buy low sodium Ritz crackers which has 30 mg in 16 g (I know it's not organic).  I would never each these crackers because they are too salty for my tastes.

review/text: I had posted a really great review previously but was asked by a company representative to remove it.  So I just wanted to post a new one to give my personal opinion & recommendation, because I feel so strongly positive about this particular flavour & brand.  If you are the type of person that loves the taste of rich flavourful coffee, and you are looking for an Organic coffee, and you are not afraid to empty a packet of 'instant' coffee into a mug, and pour 8 ounces of hot filtered water to taste deliciousness, then you really should order this King Of Coffee ASAP.<br />This is the best tasting coffee I have ever had (I've been drinking coffee since I was 16 yrs young), and within 20 minutes, I feel so darn happy, I can't contain myself.  Do you want to taste exquisite organic coffee? Do you want to feel good, if not great, after drinking it?  Would it bother you at all, if after drinking this brand and flavour for one month, you noticed any benefits? NO?  Then do yourself a tremendous favour and get this brand quick!  I cannot say enough about the taste.

Unfortunately, it was only one bag :( It's too much trouble to send it back for a few bucks...but now I know better. I think the product feature description is very misleading.

review/summary: Old Fasioned Sodas Made With Cane Sugar.
review/text: The other day I purchased a 12-bottle case of Vintage Soda that I found at Costco and reviewed it. The selling point was that each of the four brands (Dad's Root Beer, Bubble Up, Nesbit's Orange and Nu Grape Soda) are made with cane sugar, rather than high fructose corn syrup and, as such resemble the good old fashioned drinks we used to enjoy. Well, they're excellent! Very good tasteing1<br /><br />A day later, while looking it up again, I discovered this case of "All American Vintage Soda." Well, it's thew same thing. Same brands, same manufacturer. Everything is the same except the brand name and the box that they're in. I'm bringing this up because if you can't find one (Vintage Soda Variety Pack), you might be able to find the other (All America Vintage Soda).<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: best snack chip made
review/text: Don't be put off by the "rice" or the "seaweed" or the "sesame."  These chips incorporate seaweed and sesame, but that is not what you will notice when you chomp them.  They are extraordinarily delicious in the ordinary potato-chip/Dorito level of things.  If you crave salty snacks like potato chips or Doritos, you MUST try these.  These chips have a mighty CRUNCH.  A great depth of flavor that will satisfy the Dorito crowd.  And they have an excellent sensation of saltiness.  You can check it out.  The ingredients will blow your mind.  More so after you try them and do a double-take at the label.  In my opinion, all of the Lundberg chips are well done, but these are in their own class--by a mile.

After spending a small fortune on the premium foods (Evangers, Merrick, Taste of the Wild,Orijen, Fromms..)this is the ONLY food she will consistently eat. She has been on this kibble for over a year and her coat is amazing and she is super healthy. I'm transitioning my male havanese puppy to his food. He loves it too-must be pretty tasty stuff. A 6 star rating on dogfoodanalysis makes me like it even more. Great stuff!!

review/summary: Excellent nutrition AND great taste - PICKY dog approved!!
review/text: We are determined to feed our lab nutritionally sound food whether she likes it or not, and before this it was the former.  We'd mix Taste of the Wild (great nutrition) Duck and then Salmon with pureed liver to get her to eat it, and she'd actually suck off the liver juice and SPIT OUT the food.  She'd eat right before bed when it became clear that she'd eat that or starve.  Not fun for any of us.  And, I wanted her to eat DRY food as it's much better for her teeth.  (Oh, and we found out from our vet that her feet were itching because she is allergic to the duck formula.)<br /><br />Wilderness Chicken is the FIRST dog food we've fed her that she's actually eaten before the end of the day (even before 9:00 AM!) and licks the bowl clean asking for MORE.  I literally have to cut her off so she doesn't overeat, and before Blue Buffalo we were wondering if she had a stomach problem she was so finicky and waited until so late in the day to eat.<br /><br />Great nutrition, great taste even for an extremely picky eater who almost would rather starve than eat food she doesn't like.  I'd say you can't go wrong if your dog likes chicken...which I knew ours does.

It was like eating Carrot Cake with no icing, and someone forgot to put the sugar in.<br /><br />My fix:  I just happened to have some whipped cream cheese icing from a Carrot Cake that I made.  The 2nd cookie I ate, I warmed in the microwave for about 10 seconds, then spread some icing on it.<br /><br />BEST COOKIE EVER!<br /><br />(even better than Cheryl & Co)

review/summary: Great Taste for any Chocolate lover!
review/text: I discovered the Monin Sugar Free Dark Chocolate sauce at a local frozen yogurt place.  I am currently on a weight loss diet and have a No Sugar Added / Non-Fat yogurt occasionally.  This Sugar Free syrup really makes the usual Vanilla Frozen yogurt a real gourmet treat.<br /><br />I purchased it and found that it works great in turning plain coffees into yummy mocha's. Add it to your milk and heat it slightly, then whip it to make a really tasty mocha latte.<br /><br />I gave it only 4 stars because it is sweetened with Maltitol, a "sugar alcohol" which can upset your stomach if you're sensitive, but I haven't had the problem, but I think if you use enough it can force frequent trips to the bathroom, if you know what I mean.  If it was sweetened with sucralose (Splenda) then it would get 5 stars from me.<br /><br />I look forward to trying their other flavors as this was a winner... I have since re-ordered in the "6-pack."  It is also available in a larger size bottle that you can use a hand pump to dispense.<br /><br />I recommend it for any chocolate lover who is looking to top ice cream, yogurt, even coffee drinks!

review/summary: Love the coffee but...
review/text: My wife and I love the Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) coffee and have been ordering it for our Keurig for months but have always purchased it in the smaller boxes (25 K-cups).  When we saw this box of 50 K-cups for about the same price per cup, we decided to order two and that way place fewer orders.<br /><br />However, we have thrown away more defective K-cups from this one box than we have from everything else we've purchased in the 6 months since we bought our Keurig machine.  And we have bought A LOT of coffee & tea, much of it from Green Mountain.  I don't know if its a problem at the factory or if its an issue with the packaging but 1/3 of the K-cups in the first box had to be thrown away.  Frankly, these things are too expensive to accept that kind of waste...not to mention the hassle of cleaning up the mess they make first thing in the morning when all I want to do is sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and wake up.<br /><br />I hope that its from the packaging (the K-cups are not as tightly packed and therefore get bounced around a lot more during shipping - I HOPE that's the root cause of the problem) and not an issue with manufacturing because I would HATE it if we had to stop buying Green Mountain products altogether. Dark Magic and Triple Black Diamond have become our two favorite coffees, replacing Newman's Own Special Blend. As it is, I will go back to ordering the smaller packages and hope that this solves the problem.<br /><br />I give the coffee five stars but only one for the packaging so I compromised by assigning 3 stars to this product.

review/text: Just finished off my first Amazon packaged (50 count) box, and am impressed with the quality of the k-cup (ZERO wasted cups - no cups with broken seals, and no cups that resulted in a cup full o' grounds).<br /><br />My 5-star rating comes with a caveat.  It's not the best coffee I've had, but it is very good.  I almost gave it 4 stars, but then realized that out of all the x-bold offerings I've tried (and I've tried quite a few), it's one of my favorites at its price point.  It is a good coffee with good, bold flavor... and I did just put in an order for a second box.  My favorite from Amazon was Coffee People's Oraganic x-bold coffee (yellow foil cap).  Not sure what happened to this one, but I only see it rarely, and then at a ridiculous price (just saw it at $99 for a 24 pack... that's over $4/k-cup!!).

review/text: If you like good bold coffee to get you moving, look no further.  A bit smoother than Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond but stronger and more complex than both Nantucket Blend and Newman's Own Bold, it is full bodied even when brewed on the 14 oz setting.  It is my first cup, make that mug, in the morning as I sit in my sunroom and watch the fox make tracks into the woods and the finches and cardinals arrive at the bird feeder.  It's coffee to greet the sunrise and help you face the day ahead.

review/text: I don't know that I've ever tried anything quite like this.  I like it though, although I probably wouldn't drink it every day.  I find it a little difficult to describe, but it's kind of like the difference between milk chocolate and dark chocolate, with the Dark Magic being the dark chocolate.  I intend to pick up a box for those days when I feel like something a little different.

review/summary: Dark Magic is a great cup of coffee
review/text: I am just 1 week into owning my Kuerig B60 and this was in the sample pack. When I brewed it up, coffee grounds were in the cup and I was hoping this was just one faulty package. It smelled so good and I didn't want to throw it out I strained it twice added my cream and it was really good! This was a keeper and I went back today after church to B3 with my 20% off coupon and purchased a box and promptly had a cup while I was preparing my lunch.  I determined I could buy 3 boxes-18 count each with coupons for $24.28 once I finish this box and the two others (French Roast and Butter Toffee) I bought at the time I purchased my Kuerig. Dark Magic along with French Roast are my morning travel mug brews, and I will usually finish the evening with a smooth Butter Toffee.<br /><br />Update 7/25/12: Dark Magic is the only K Cup I am drinking.Truly a great cup of coffee, I have a 10 oz travel mug on my morning commute and then a 6 oz in the evening either before or after dinner. At either amount and a little cream it taste great, not bitter or weak. Love it!!! New owners definitely want to register your Kuerig and receive the  buy 2 get 2 free k cup offer, I paid $29.68 for 4-(24)count Dark Magic k cups

review/text: Green Mountain Dark Magic is one of my favorite Keurig pods. I make the big cup, add 1/4 c. skim milk, 1/4 sugar free Vanilla Coffee Mate, 1 Sweet and Low, and it's still strong but delish--my version of a latte. And the price is great. A friend warned me to check the expiration date--mine had plenty of time left. All is good in my coffee world.

review/text: What a great purchase.  I was originally looking for the ice coffee k-cups but they are ridiculously expensive (I feel).  After reading that their is not much of a difference and I was most concerned of the "watered down" taste so I thought and "extra bold" strength would do the trick, which it did!!!! I will be buying more soon and in a larger quantity now that I know how well it works ;)p

review/summary: It is Extra Bold and Extra Acidic
review/text: I love bold, robust coffee and decided to purchase Green Mountain Dark Magic k-cups. Definitely a bold coffee, but so acidic it's not enjoyable. Severely disappointed in this coffee. Am trying other brands but because of this experience trying to steer clear of all coffees distributed by Green Mountain; and that's a shame because they offer so many choices. Money is too hard to come by to blow it on coffee you can't drink!

review/summary: Gave this a try after GMC Espresso Blend was discontinued...
review/text: I'm on the second k-cup in the box and find myself comparing it to Green Mountain Coffee Espresso Blend which I've been drinking for over a year now.  The box reads, "offers the rich aromatics and flavor qualities of espresso".  Even Keurig is recommending Dark Magic to those who previously purchased the Espresso Blend.  Another reviewer wrote this coffee was: "Strong but flat, lacking definition".  Well, it does taste watery compared to the espresso blend and lacks that burst of flavor in every sip.  I'm not a big coffee drinker but love making daily lattes and cappuccinos from my Green Mountain Espresso Blend and now Dark Magic coffee.  This coffee is barely acceptable for this purpose but it is acceptable for someone who likes a strong/bold cup of coffee.

Any one that drinks this coffe loves the product as well. I brew my coffee twice on my Keurig. I brew a large cup then brew a small cup with the same cup. Still very bold and nice. I would recommend this but then again it's the matter of personal taste.

review/summary: Nice Bold Flavor
review/text: Not as strong/bold as I was expecting based on other reviews, but still a nice strong flavor when brewed at the standard 10oz setting. I like a nice strong cup of coffee, black. Dark Magic (Extra Bold) competes with Starbucks Verona and also Barista's Italian Roast for my "go to" morning coffee choice. If I was to rank these 3, I would say #1 Barista's Italian Roast, #2 Starbuck Verona, #3 Green Mt. Dark Magic. Emeril's Extra Bold dark roast is also a good choice.<br /><br />Costco (my local store) sells Starbuck Verona. My next purchase will probably be Barista's Italian... If I catch Dark Magic on sale, I may buy some more of that brand.<br /><br />I give it 8/10 on 1-10 scale. If you like strong coffee, you will probably like Dark Magic.

review/text: I've enjoyed the Dark Magic coffee and re-ordered several times.  What I like about it is the strong taste and dark roast.  This is definitely one that I brew on the biggest cup size (12oz on my unit).<br /><br />The only negative I have is the lingering flavor is not quite as good as some of my more favorite k-cups.  However, I still put this in my top 10 and will continue to order occasionally for variety's sake.<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this to anyone who likes a strong, dark brew.

If you are a fan of SB Verona than you should like this too. If you like Nantucket, Breakfast Blend or Coffee Shop it might be too bold for you. It's perfect for a 12oz cup or even a 14oz travel mug.
