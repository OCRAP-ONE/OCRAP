review/summary: DELICIOUS, CRUNCHY, CHEWY & NOT TOO SWEET
review/text: I am always on the lookout for a healthier not too sweet but crunchy & tasty little snack, and I came across this and thought I would give it a try.  It is wonderful!  I don't think it tastes sesame-ish, but seed-ish, and delicious, the flavors blend so well together.  I keep these in the refrigerator as I think it improves its edibility and keeps it very fresh, and it actually tastes better cold!

review/text: These chocolate sesame bars are small, but they're filling.  I've just received my second box of these, my whole family has to remain gluten free and they're just right for snacking, or going out the door in a hurry, grab a few and put them in purse or pocket and we're gone!  Best of all, they're gluten free!  I'll be ordering more when these are gone!

review/text: These are perfect snacks to take with you if you're on the go or traveling.  I took them with me camping last summer and I'm so glad I did as rural Nova Scotia's not exactly a hotbed of gluten-free foods.  Not too sweet unlike some bars.  I love the taste of sesame so these were great.

review/text: I just had my first Gluten Free Cafe Chocolate Sesame bar not even a full minute ago and I'm already on here ready to rave review it. I am sensitive to gluten and try to avoid it in my diet. But most gluten free bars are chalky or tasteless. These bars are the opposite though! The texture is awesome - chewy, not sticky, plenty of interesting variety between the seeds and the chocolate. The taste is not too sweet but sweet enough to kill the afternoon candy craving. I highly recommend these to even those who aren't GF!

review/text: This recent order was smoked to perfection now that Mr. Fink is back watching the Paulswood Smokehouse. Its NOT over priced compared to what one would pay from the supermarket or other Amazon sellers. Even though i received it well packed and cold i would liked to have it sent with dry-ice and frozen solid because i live in a hot part of the USA. The individual one half pound flat packs store easily in the freezer untill ready to defrost in the fridge and use. Give the 4-lb size a try from Amazon.

review/summary: the real deal
review/text: I'm so glad Post finally made the smart choice to bring these back. So yummy. If you've never had them before, it's a little like a Captain Crunch and a Cheerio made babies that were alphabet shaped (less crunchy and more oat-ey than captain crunch; slighly crunchier and more corny than cheerios, with a somewhat less dense texture and a slightly sweet, but not oversweet, exterior). These taste just like I remember, and everyone in my family (wife, teenagers, toddlers) is also a fan. Plus they are fun to eat, since they are letter shaped.<br /><br />I can't believe somebody gave these a 1-star review, but clearly that person does not like boxed cold cereal from the major brands. The 10 grams of sugar in these is not excessive at all. Sodium is very slightly high at 180 mg, but at those levels, even patients with late-stage kidney disease or congestive heart failure could have a bowl a day and do just fine.<br /><br />Eat up!

review/text: I was so frustrated with not being able to purchase Alpha Bits. I love them, but couldn't buy them. It's one of the few sweet cereals I like and I actually eat them as a snack, not for breakfast. I have been eating them since I was a child and I knew they still were being made but no stores carry them. I don't get it, since there are so many really "crappy" sweet cereals available. Anyway, I was thrilled to find them here and having them delivered to my door is a real plus.

review/summary: Old and Stale to Great!
review/text: I ordered this cereal because I can no longer find Alpha-Bits in the grocery stores anywhere around here. Alpha-Bits are my favorite cereal of all time, and I was SO excited to find it! All 3 boxes of cereal I've opened so far tasted really OLD. The date codes weren't expired, but were within a few months of expiring, when normally the dates are 2 years away. The cereal was stale and tasted almost RANCID. I threw it away! Since there are so many good reviews of this product, I'll try ordering again and hope my stale cereal was an anomaly.<br /><br />Update: This item was replaced for me by Customer Service, FREE of charge, and the replacement cereal was GREAT! This time, the cereal was fresh and delicious! Thanks so much; I really appreciate the excellent response I got from Amazon Customer Service!

review/summary: A Childhood Favorite!
review/text: I would come home from high school and get the biggest bowl I could find (that wouldn't land me in hot water with my mom....) and fill it with Alphabits and Milk. I've loved this cereal my whole life!! As I've gotten older and moved around, I've found it difficult to find it in the stores. My mom, sister, and even mother in law would snag me a few boxes whenever they saw it on a shelf of their store and send it to me (because I have the Best. Family. Ever!) but it wasnt the same. I'd find myself not sharing with my kids, because who knew when I'd get more?? :) One BEAUTIFUL day, my mother sent me a link telling me I can buy my favorite Post cereals online from their site and I didnt hesitate! I grabbed my phone from my pocket, zipped to the site and proceeded with a one click purchase! When it came a few days later I posted pictures to Facebook and have been sharing the love and re-ordering the cereal when it gets low :) It's sweet. It's crunchy. It's fun to see what my milk is trying to tell me near the end :) No marshmallows needed! It's perfect the way it is!!!

review/text: I should have known better but this was on sale and I thought why not? Perhaps I can donate this to a food bank but maybe I can salvage it by a dusting of cinnamon or cocoa powder. The one good thing is that it is low in calories and relies on sugar rather than HFCS. I will definitely not be purchasing this again but if you are one who likes the taste of brand cereals, this is probably the best of the worst. It is no wonder this country has a problem with obesity- all these convenience cereals are high in sugar and esp. sodium, something that is neglected in all the discussions about nutrition and the focus on corn syrup. Cut back on the salt Post! High levels of salt are really not necessary for young children.

review/summary: The perfect grilled cheese complement!
review/text: I bought this product for one reason only: to accompany my grilled cheese sandwiches!<br /><br />For me, regular cans of soup just have way too much soup for a meal with one grilled cheese sandwich, but not quite enough to split in half and still have a satisfying amount.  The soup at hand servings are perfect.  The taste is creamy, the consistency is smooth...it pretty delicious for something that comes in a can.<br /><br />Downsides: For a small container of soup, it sure packs a punch of your suggested daily sodium intake (~30%) and it has more calories than I expected (190 cals).  In the future, I would rather get the classic tomato soup and make it creamy on my own by adding a dollop of sour cream (or better yet, greek yogurt) for a much lower calorie, but still creamy, tomato soup.

review/summary: Yummy soup, packaging needs help
review/text: Love the soup! The creamy tomato is my all time favorite, and it's easy to pack for lunch.<br /><br />I'm taking one star away because the packaging is a little rough. Taking the lid off for microwaving is rough on your hands and nails. Not nearly as easy to remove as the lids on the microwavable bowls from Campbell's. I can't imagine kids or older people removing the lid with ease.

review/summary: Tasty portable meal, snack or emergency food!
review/text: These are soul-warming soups, hot or cold.  My husband actually prefers them cold and drinks them for breakfast, lunch, dinner or late-night snack with total delight.  Great to grab when running off without time to eat, or when planning to be away.  Ideal for travel or emergency stash, because no refrigeration required, not even a microwave for reheating if you're like my husband and enjoy them cold!  We have 2 cases a month on Subscribe-and-Save and go through them pretty fast.  Their nutritional profile isn't as bad as you might think (at least according to Weight Watchers), and they're very satisfying.  If you're craving a late-night snack, think:  would you be better off with cookies/candy/chips or with tomato soup??  I love that these are just as convenient as those usual snack culprits!!

review/summary: More Coffee In Pods Than Most Others
review/text: I have owned a Senseo machine for about three years now and was using Senseo brand coffee for a full year before I found the Baronet coffees on Amazon. I buy this Medium Roast and Izzy's Blend Medium Roast and they are delivered to me monthly at a price cheaper than the Senseo brand pods at Target (which is the cheapest I have found for the Senseo brand). The thing that really sells this for me is the amount of coffee per pod - much more than the other pods on the market. Not all Baronet pods are this super size...be sure to check the weight. There is a good 30% more coffee in these pods than the other brands.  I am on auto delivery which cuts the price by 15% they are delivered to my front door monthly or whenever I need them.  All this and the flavor is wonderful!

review/summary: Found a perfect alternative for my Senseo
review/text: Where do I start? The boxes of coffee are double wrapped in plastic to retain freshness. As I work my way through the first box, I am confidant that the others will be just as fresh. Note: each pod is also sealed in a packet. The double plastic is just a bonus.<br /><br />The pods fit into my Senseo perfectly using the double pod attachment for the machine. This is an attachment that one must order, it is not the attachment that comes standard with the machine. I had the double pod on hand. I normally use two Senseo pods per small mug of coffee on a daily basis anyway.<br /><br />With the Baronet, I ordered a strong, dark coffee and run both the 2-cup cycle and the one-cup cycle to get a full mug of coffee that suits my taste buds just fine.<br />Very satisfied.

review/text: I had been purchasing Senseo, but since it has become unavailable I had to find another brand. I took a chance on the baronet, and though it's a little pricier, it's worth it. Each pod is individually wrapped and also noticeably bigger/fuller  than the Senseo, and I get a much richer cup of coffee with a nice crema. The only downside is a few of the pods have been ruptured before I even open the package, but some are still usable. Overall I am pleased with the product and will continue my smart ship subscription.

review/summary: Excellent Product - Excellent Value
review/text: I recently purchased these pods for the first time because the Senseo brands ones I had been buying for almost a year were out-of-stock. I am very pleased with Baronet's dark roast and recommend it to anyone who enjoys  bold and fully flavored coffee. The pods are very full - so full that I have to use the double-pod holder on my Senseo maker to accommodate a single Baronet pod. The pods come in a dispensing box, and each pod is individually foil wrapped. This is a big improvement on the Senseo brand pods, which come loose in a foil pouch and deteriorate once exposed to the air after the pouch is first opened.<br /><br />Baronet pods are an excellent product, better than the Senseo ones I had been using, and I highly recommend them.

review/summary: A hostage to Senseo no longer...
review/text: I bought these pods when Senseo made it harder and harder to find their pods.  The taste is comparable to the Senseo dark roast.  However, I found this to be smoother and hardier.  The best part of all is that you do not need to use 2 pods for a mug of coffee...therefore, they last twice as long.  I use the pod holder ("duck") for the single pod, but push the button for the 2 pod (mug) size and it brews a perfect cup every time.  Overall, I am very pleased.

review/summary: Definitely a French roast
review/text: This roast is for the person who wants a bold French roast. You could make it less bold by making an 8 oz. cup or larger. Pods are typically made to serve about 6 oz. or less. The pods fit very tight in my Senseo (once brewed it's hard to open). I recently ordered a Bunn professional model and they work great in this brewer (much better in the Bunn, because the Senseo pod holder is made for smaller pods.) These pods contain more coffee than the weak Senseo pods. Overall - good flavor, fresh, and bold.  HINT: If you are using a Senseo - prime your pod first by placing a new pod in the single pod holder and slowly pour boiled water over the pod - just enough to soak it through, but not running over. Then put it in the machine. You don't need to prime these with the Bunn. I'm not responsible if you burn yourself or something else. Use caution and common sense. Using the double pod holder didn't work for me... water spilled over during the brew.

A warning to fellow Ribena lovers, at some stage I bought a diet, or reduced sugar, or 'lite' version of Ribena (the exact branding escapes me now), and it tasted terrible. Watered-down and reduced flavour was what it was. Yucko, stay away. But the real stuff, bring it on!

review/summary: A very British drink with medicinal value
review/text: I've been familiar with bottled Ribena for more than half a century and no matter what type of bottle it comes in, it remains as it always was. I have not tried the alternative flavors, nor have I ever bought Ribena in cartons. So my review is limited to the original blackcurrant drink and while my own taste has changed over the years, Ribena has never changed the original drink despite experimenting with alternatives.<br /><br />The blackcurrant is a fruit native to Britain and some other European countries, but its most important quality as a food is that it is rich in Vitamin C. It was once popular in America prior to being banned there early in the 20th century because blackcurrants were seen as a threat to the logging industry. The decision to continue the ban was eventually delegated to state level and some states now permit blackcurrants to be grown. Nevertheless, blackcurrants may struggle to regain their former American popularity.<br /><br />Meanwhile in Britain, Ribena was launched in 1936. Blackcurrants became popular in World War II because so many other fruits became hard to obtain and the government encouraged blackcurrant production by providing free blackcurrant drinks (actually Ribena without the brand name) to children, to give them that all-important Vitamin C. With peace restored, the Ribena brand went from strength to strength in its home market. As a post-war baby boomer, I was inevitably introduced to Ribena and it was my favorite drink as a child. My tastes changed and I grew out of it, but never forgot its medicinal value.<br /><br />As an adult, I have as far as possible avoided medicines and pills of any kind. I believe in letting my body learn to cope with the nasty stuff that comes along, at least for a while. When I feel the time is right to help nature cure me of my ills, I buy a bottle of Ribena. Whether it's because of the Vitamin C or because of the other blackcurrant nutrients I wouldn't know, but Ribena has helped me get over many a bad illness.<br /><br />There will be those who drink Ribena for the pure pleasure of it, as I did back in the fifties and sixties. As such, it can be drunk hot or cold, remembering that it is concentrated and needs plenty of added water.  Medicinally, I always drink it hot. Those who follow my reviews may have wondered why I suddenly stopped just as I was getting into reviewing again after a long hiatus. Yes, I had a particularly nasty cold/flu/whatever and Ribena is aiding my recovery, which is by no means complete as I write this. Hey, Ribena is not a magic potion, merely a drink.

They blamed it on the U.S.Postal Service when it wasn't even them who delivered it.  Don't even know who delivered it because they left it on the front porch and never did ring the doorbell (I know this because we were home).  Anybody could have taken it from the porch.

review/summary: Good crunch, healthy ingredients, but sweeter would be better.
review/text: We are an organic, natural food household. While I like these banana chips -- all of the ingredients (bananas, sugar, coconut oil) are organic, and they use no hydrogenated oil or preservatives -- but they just lack a bit of sweetness that would have made these at least a 4 star snack. Perhaps it is due to the thick cut. We still eat them - I mix them with Good Sense dried pineapple (excellent by the way!) and nuts for a nice trail mix, or sprinkle them into cereal. But we love banana chips, and flavorwise these are OK but just not a home run.

review/summary: Value and Organic Favors Country Choice
review/text: Recently I've substituted steel cut oats for our cereal of choice after years of eating  rolled oats (both regular and quick cook). I've tried McCanns and Country Choice, and since there are many reviews already posted,  I'll slant mine based on Taste (mouth), Flavor (nose), Preparation, and Value.<br /><br />I rate Taste (nutty and chewy) and Flavor (pleasant aroma) a dead heat (5*). I also looked at the Nutrition Labels of McCanns, Country Choice, and Quaker's rolled oats, both regular and instant. List included calories, total fats, carbs, fiber, and protein and all were virtually identical from a nutritional standpoint<br /><br />Preparation. I've cooked all types of oatmeal via stove top but have not used the microwave. However, for the steel cut oats I also used a rice cooker, a Zojirushi model that had the capability for making porridge (this is the setting you want to use for steel cut oats),  and this  model had a timer that could be set in advance to finish cooking at a predetermined time. Although use of the rice cooker still requires a passage of time, actual cooking is automatic,  whereas using the stovetop required at least 25-30 minutes of simmering and close supervision to prevent scorching. (Of course, rolled oats takes less time.)<br /><br />Value: McCann's oats comes in a very attractive and elegant metal container (28 oz) and stresses the fact that it's Irish in origin whereas Country Choice comes in a cardboard container(30 oz) similar to the rolled oats type and boasts the fact that it is home grown (Minnesota) and is certified "organic." It should be noted that McCann also packages its steel cut oats in a cardboard box (16 oz). If you make your purchase via Amazon (current prices) and disregard the shipping expense, the per ounce cost is: McCann's 28 oz container cost 20.6 cents, McCann's 16 oz container cost 19.13 cents, and Country Choice cost 11.27 cents.<br /><br />Since my personal evaluation finds both products even in Taste and Flavor, and both have similar cooking methodologies, my FIVE STAR choice is for the home grown, organic certified Country Choice which is also a big budget saver.

review/summary: Almost as good as Mccann's
review/text: I love irish oats.  This style of oats is simply the best bowl of cereal period.  I eat at least one bowl everyday.  That said, all steel cut oats are NOT the same.  As many people know, there is no comparison to the taste of Mccann's Irish oats.  Why are they better? Honestly, I don't know.  Maybe because they're Irish.  Anyway, I have previously tried other types of steel cut oats and quite honestly, they were no comparison.  Well one day recently, when I was shopping and realized that I was out of Mccann's, I found that my grocery store was out.  Right next to the spot was this brand of oats.  I had tried the Country Choice Rolled Oat and Multigrain cereals, and they are both great.  So I figured I'd give it a try.  They are very, very good.  These are as close to Mccann's as you can get.  Since they are about half the price of Mccann's, I figure i will switch between these two.  In summary, these are a great choice if you can't get Mccann's or if you prefer a cheaper breakfast.

review/summary: 1 cup of oats expands to four cups of oats after cooking
review/text: These oats are a staple for breakfast at my house. I completely agree with the other reviews and wanted to add one small detail regarding cooking the oats. These are not instant oats. They take some time to prepare so don't expect a quick breakfast with this product. The benefit to cooking the oats for 30 minutes is that the long cooking time actually expands the oats to approximately four times their volume. One cup of oats expands to four servings of hot delicious ready-for-brown sugar and cinnamon goodness!! Also, these oats are by far the best deal when you take a look at the serving size and cost per ounce.

review/summary: Country Choice oats are sold at Trader Joe's
review/text: I discovered this steel cut oatmeal at Trader Joe's 2-3 years ago.  At ~$3 a canister, it is almost half the price of McCann's (the brand that comes in a round tin can).  If you compare the two grains, Country Choice oats are cut into smaller pieces than McCann's.<br /><br />I find that both taste the same to me.  I initially had trouble figuring out how to cook steel cut oatmeal, so I emailed Country Choice and they responded with several ways of cooking it.  I now bake it in a casserole dish: 1 cup oats + 4 cups hot water, bake at 350-375 covered for 20-25 minutes, stir well, and then uncovered for 10-15 minutes.  Comes out great every time!<br /><br />Note that steel cut oatmeal is chewy and fibrous and lasts 4-6 hours in your tummy!  A great way to start an active day.

We will never go back to rolled oats and it is terrific to have such an easy way to make them perfectly. As much as I love this product, I don't love Amazon's price.

review/summary: Very good quality organic oats.
review/text: The Country Choice brand is domestically produced and certified organic by Oregon Tilth and is significantly less expensive than the imported brands as a bonus.<br /><br />These oats are of such high quality that I admit to sometimes eating them uncooked with milk and a few raisins or dried tart cherries.  (Yes, it gives the old jaws a bit of a workout.)<br /><br />I also eat these steel cut oats for dessert by preparing them just like rice pudding:  oats, water, raisins, milk, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon in that order of quantity, cooked slowly according to the directions on the label but not overcooked, to retain chewiness.  To make it even better, I top it with sour cream or whipped cream when serving.  Delicious and absolutely outrageously rich in healthy fiber:  4g per 1/4 cup of dry oats.<br /><br />The quality is superb; always very fresh, fairly uniform, free of foreign objects with a very pure oat taste.<br /><br />I also like that the paper container takes less toll on the environment to manufacture and ship than a metal container and is also easily recycled.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: Upon receiving the product I conducted a taste test against the accepted standard -- McCann. I prepared tow batches of 1/3 cup oats, 4/3 cup water, one ounce granulated brown sugar. Served each portion with a pat of butter and 1/4 cup of milk.<br /><br />I could tell no difference in texture or 'creaminess'. The CC, however, had a fuller, more natural taste to me.<br /><br />CAUTION: six cannisters contain a LOT of oats. I live alone and this could probably sustain me through nuclear Armageddon, or at least through global economic collapse.

review/summary: Healthy, Organic Breakfast Option
review/text: I buy these for my toddlers' breakfast - steel cut are a healthier option than pressed oatmeal, and organic is a personal preference for me when feeding my kids.  And, since they are just toasted oats, there is no added sugar or any of the unfortunate stuff they add to instant oatmeal packets.  I had been purchasing McCann's, since that is all I can find in the store, but again, I prefer organic.  The only downside is that these take 30-35 minutes to cook - they are definitely NOT instant or fast.  The kids (and I) love them though.  They are a product of the USA, which means less environmental impact than buying something shipped from Ireland (if that's important to you).

review/summary: Nutritious and a good breakfast meal
review/text: Steel cut oats take much longer to cook but provide a nutritious breakfast meal particularly with added nuts and dried fruits.<br />As other reviewers mentioned, keep in mind that you will need more than 30 minutes to cook and then let it stand for some more time before eating. I usually buy a box containing 6 canisters. The price is reasonable comparable in weight to what one gets at a supermarket for rolled oats. Of course the same weight in rolled oats takes much more volume, therefore this 30-ounce canister looks small, but as you cook them they expand a lot more. A good product and I will keep on buying.

I had leftovers as a snack.  Yum Yum Yum!<br /><br />BTW, like one reviewer said, when the UPS guy was walking up to my house with the package, he was wondering what was in it because it was making a swooshing sound.  When I opened up, 3 of the canisters were popped open so the oats spilled all out to the bottom.  the other 3 were dented on the bottom and probably would pop open just like the other 3 if longer transit.  Amazon made it right and sent me another package which came fully intact.<br /><br />I think Amazon needed better packaging of these because the canisters are paper cup type of materials and not cushioned.  They should be taped up before putting in the box like other bulk items I've ordered previously.

review/summary: Great value for a great oatmeal
review/text: I happen to like the texture of steel cut oats, but couldn't justify the huge increase in price over old fashioned rolled oats for only that advantage.  I believe - after reading a lot of research about the nutritional difference in the two - that steel cut, after boiling for 30 minutes, has no advantage. The supposed disadvantage of rolled oats is that they are steamed (to soften) and rolled to make them cook in 5 minutes.  Boiling the steel cut is "processing" them with heat, so enough with pontificating about their advantage since they are both analyzed raw and the steel cut cannot be digested/nutrients utilized by our bodies without cooking.  That said, I do like the texture.  Buying it in enough quantity got me free shipping and it ended up costing about 1/4 of what McCanns does in the stores.  I cook them using fruit juice or the fruit/veggie mixed juices instead of water and do it in batches for the whole week, that I then refrigerate and microwave bowls daily.  Boiling 30 minutes every morning is a hassle, hence the weekly batches.

review/summary: Country Choice vs. McCann
review/text: I'm a long time fan of McCann's oatmeal and a new fan of Country Choice (CC). The McCann's is cut larger so is a more chewier product. For those converting to steel cut oats, the finer cut of CC might make the transition easier. I could not tell a flavor difference between the two. Also for one serving I use one cup of boiling water w/ 1/3 cup of oatmeal. Here's my comparison based on Trader Joe's pricing:<br />McCann $4.99/28 oz., metal can, non-organic<br />Country Choice $2.99/30 oz., cardboard canister, organic<br />Surprisingly the CC has 5G of protein vs. 4G for McCann and 4G of fiber vs. 3G for McCann based on � c. dry of each. Clearly CC is the best value, particularly since it is organic and made in the USA. BUT when Amazon has the coupon code deal, it's more of a coin toss and personal preference.

review/summary: Great oats
review/text: Good texture and good taste. A lot better than regular rolled oats. It does take a long time to cook (>30 mins from start to finish), so it might be difficult for some to cook this in the morning. I simply cook the oats the night before, and eat them in the morning. You can put your desired amount of oats/water in a pot, put a lid on it, bring it to a boil, let it boil for 30s-1m, and just take it off the stove, and put it in a a cabinet. The oats will continue to cook overnight, and they will be mostly cooked in the morning. Put it on the stove in the morning to recook for about 10 mins, and you'll have delicious oats! One downside is that each canister was smaller than I expected; I am used to the larger Quacker canisters and each canister was smaller than the Quacker canisters. The description DOES say each is 30 ounces, so I guess this was just an expectation of mine. Great product!

review/text: As stated in my title this is the right stuff all the way around.<br />I add walnuts, rasins, and dried cranberries for an excellent nutritious start to my day. You cannot beat the price with a stick.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Country Choice for a great product and thanks to amazon, its amazing.

review/text: This is my second order of the Country Choice Organic Irish Steel Cut Oats, 30-Ounce Canister (Pack of 6).  I just love them and the price can't be beat IMO.<br /><br />You do get 6 canisters in one order so you have to like oats or, like I do, share them with others.
