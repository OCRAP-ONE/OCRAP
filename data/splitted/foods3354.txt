review/summary: Heavy on the hazelnut, light on the coffee.
review/text: This has a good hazelnut flavor, but I could not really taste the coffee at all. The flavor is just a bit strong and the coffee is on the weak side. My 18 year old daughter who is just starting to drink coffee and was not allowed to have cafeinne at all growing up, loves it. She is at the Sure I like coffee if I can add half a cup of cream and 6 teaspoons of sugar stage of drinking coffee. She does not have to add nearly that aount to this coffee and she really likes it. She is in college and this coffee has become her study buddy. I would say it has a good flavor to it, but if you like a stronger coffee than this is not for you. If you like coffee as long as it does not taste like coffee, then I highly recommend this one. I do like it. It just does not have that coffee taste and does not really get me going. This is a super light blend in my opinion and I do not like super strong coffee. I am picky about flavored coffee and this one just does not taste like coffee to me.

review/summary: K Cups Rock!
review/text: I love my Keurig coffee maker and the convenience of these K-Cups!  Since convenience can be costly, it's great to be able to buy the K-Cups in bulk.  The savings are substantial.  The coffee itself is always delicious!  My shipments always arrive quickly and in good condition.  Being a single mom, a full time college student, and a full time Realtor, I don't have much time for anything else.  Brewing my coffee in 50 seconds has made my tight schedule much easier to juggle.  I highly recommend buying these K-Cups from Amazon!

review/text: I have a standing order with Amazon for some time now where a case of K cups is shipped to me each and every month at a discounted price.  Amazon has raised their pricing without informing of they're doing so and shipped the case without my approval at the newer higher pricing.  To me, this is bad business and taking advantage of the dedicated consumer.<br /><br />The coffee itself is more than wondeful.

Counted three times just to be sure.<br /><br />Mistakes happen and I get that, but I will continue counting with the next few shipments just to be sure.

review/summary: Good Product Bad Packeting
review/text: I was happy to get my coffee. Me without coffee is like a baby without her sippy cup! I tore the box open and my heart sank. The individual K-Cups were just thrown around. The bottom of the box had a good amount of coffee grinds. I don't think the post office is responsible for the mishap because the box didn't appear damaged. The only logical explanation is the damage originated where the K-Cups were loaded into the box. Five out of the 50 K-Cups were unusable. If you don't think 10 percent is a big deal, then imagine going on a blind date and your blind date answers the door and you notice he/she is missing 10 percent of his/her teeth! See, 10 percent is a lot. Bottom line, I'm not ordering K-cups on-line anymore. I guess I'll just get of my butt and head down to the store. It will be worth the extra expense.<br /><br />Arthur M.

review/summary: Changed ingredients!
review/text: I was so happy with this food before petcurean changed the ingredients. The salmon and oatmeal was the only dry food I've found (and I've tried nearly all of the quality brands) that worked for my very food sensitive dog. I liked that it had limited ingredients and was perfect for him since it was only salmon, canola oil, oatmeal, and kelp. Petcurean must be getting cheap or have been bought out by someone because now they're including tons of fillers in this food for "sensitivity and shine" that we're not previously there like alfalfa, potatoes, kamut flakes, and quinoa, all of which, other than the quinoa, my dog can not have if I am to avoid him chewing himself up. I am so disappointed! I searched long and hard for a food that worked for him. We went through three big bags with my dog looking his best and then the fourth bag arrived from amazon today and along with the packaging being changed, I noted the ingredients had also. Completely useless as a hypoallergenic food for my dog and not worth giving to him to have him destroy his currently beautiful coat. What a waste of money. The food search continues I guess.<br /><br />On a side note-since petcurean's go recipe has gone to crap I have discovered "back to basics grain free instinct" , another limited ingredient dog food, and so far am happy with the results. I hope they don't change their recipes!

review/summary: Great FOOD
review/text: My dog had weak stool, constantly getting diarhea. I put him on regular oatmeal until I could find something he could digest. Long story short, once I got him this food all his digestive problems disappeared. This is an amazing brand, and my dog now goes regularly without any issues or special medication. Our vet wanted him to go on IBS medication, instead I ignored the advice and just looked for an oatmeal bland brand in a dry food format. This has not only changed his stool, but his attitude. At 7 years old, he is running and playing like when he was 2-3. If your dog has digestive issues and doesn't go regularly I suggest to get this brand. You'll see the difference after just one complete day of meals.

Salmon and Oatmeal diet, she has stopped scratching excessively.  Her coat has grown in and looks absolutely gorgeous.  She loves the food (especially with yogurt) and seems to have more energy.  She also sheds less so I no longer have to vacuum everyday!  The extra cost is worthwhile worth while for me and my dog.

review/summary: Like raising hell in your mouth
review/text: When I was a kid my older brother gave me this hot sauce from one of his trips.  He wanted me to taste it, so I did.  On a side note I was really brave about it.  And let me tell you it was HOT!  Hotter than you can ever imagine!  Just a couple drops and your mouth will feel the scorching heat like a devil raising hell.  They're not kidding when they really call it Hot Sauce From Hell: Devil's Revenge.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce like me, this one for you.  But be warned: Don't feed it to those that can't handle the heat like your mother or your pets or the elderly.  It might choke on the heat and maybe die of it.

review/text: This is by far the best flavored with a great heat.  I have been eating hot sauce for 25years.  I have tried over 80 different types of hot sauce and this is my favorite.  It is always a gamble buying hot sauce especially since most of them are not very good (my opinion), but I personally will vouch for this one.  But this sauce is not for the Texas Pete user, it has some heat.  Good eats my friends.

I would estimate that it now takes 10 drops to equal one of the previous recipe. I'm not kidding. They even made the hole in the top of the bottle bigger. It really sucks!!!

review/summary: My Dog Likes Natural Planet Better than Steak!
review/text: Over the past few years, my dog Gracie has been sick a lot with chronic urinary tract infections. When she starts to get sick, she stops eating her current food. Eventually we went through every type of canned and dry food at the supermarket. Then I started feeding her actual human food. She liked ground beef, steak, and chicken well enough, but she wasn't thrilled by it. I got a sample of Natural Planet Organics dry food and she gobbled it up as fast as she could.<br /><br />Now that I'm feeding it to her, it doesn't look like she's getting tired of it -- like she did with other food -- and she's looking better and healthier than she's done for a year. If I give her a choice between Natural Planet and raw or cooked chicken breast or beef, she chooses Natural Planet instead.

review/text: Most bottled salad dressings don't appeal much to me. But Wish Bone Spritzers fill a niche in a unique way. Sometimes, especially with garden fresh  veggies, we don't want the dressing to overpower the amazing flavors of the just picked salad ingredients. With these spritzers, you can add a light mist of dressing that enhances rather than obscures. Light on calories and fats, too, because you use so little. Mmmmm!

review/text: This stuff tastes better than any other dressing I've tried.  Other Italian dressings -- both light and regular -- taste comparatively bitter and low-quality, but this is sharp, salty and savoury.  A sprinkling of bacon bits and shredded cheddar on romaine enhances the flavour even more.<br /><br />The spray bottle concept may seem a little strange, but it creates a perfectly light and evenly-distributed flavour for your salad.  15-20 sprays on a small salad will create plenty of flavour and still be extremely low calorie.<br /><br />It's fantastic and the only dressing I care to use.  If it ever goes out of production, I'll be stock-piling :)

review/summary: Pretty good so far with slight modification
review/text: I bought this dispenser to replace a Bags om Board bone dispenser which worked great until it fell off my leash and I lost it. The problem with the bone dispenser was the plastic ring that attached it to the leash popped open and the bone dispenser fell off the leash without me knowing it  --and this was after only having it for 2 weeks! I decided to order the white dispenser but wasn't too impressed with the plastic zip tie that attached it to the leash either-- as another reviewer pointed out, the end of the plastic tie irritated my hand, the tie itself couldn't be readjusted once you attached it, and I was afraid the plastic tie would eventually break off and I'd lose this dispenser too. So I removed the plastic tie and substituted a metal key ring to attach  the dispenser to my leash and so far so good! The bags are great, the metal key ring securely attaches the dispenser to my leash yet I can easily detach the key ring from my leash if I want to, and I have no problem getting the dispenser open. It's too bad the company doesn't use metal key rings instead of the cheap plastic rings and plastic zip ties-- if they did, I'd give this product a 5 instead of a 4.

review/text: I was skeptical and at first didn't like the bulkiness of the Bags-On-Board holder attached to my dog's leash.  But once I got used to having the holder and bags in it...it's great.  No more stuffing my pockets with large shopping bags, no more searching in garbage cans for discarded cups or bags to pick up dog poo with...I always have bags with me.  Only down side is being able to find affordable refills...which was no problem on Amazon!  I order the 120 bag refill for $6.30 (so far) and have plenty!<br /><br />The only down side to the style I have is that it is attached with an electrical zip tie and the end scratches my hand occasionally.  Bags-On-Board now offers a retractable leash with the bag holder built in...but I'm not sure of the quality of the leash or the sizes (animal weight) that it comes in.

After over a year it is showing no signs of wear or of breaking down.<br /><br />So, if you have strong hands and only ever use one leash.... this is a 5 star choice. But for me there is still room for improvement.

review/text: I used to salvage plastic bags from the grocery stores etc. to dispose of kitty litter waste but recently I have stopped using plastic bags and am using cloth bags for my shopping. I purchased these bags because they are the perfect size for multiple daily waste removal (the litter scoop fits right into the bag) and because they are environmentally friendly. I attached the little dispenser right onto the litter box (it comes with a plastic zip tie) and it is super convenient to have the perfect little sized bags ready to go. I have not had a problem with tearing or holes in the bags and they are easy to tie up after use. Will purchase plenty of refills!

review/summary: Bags On Board Review
review/text: We have always used "Bags on Board" for our pet clean up.  Unfortunately, this time, the container that hangs on the leash broke off and we had to purchase a new one.  I can't say how it happened because my husband was walking the dog.  However, I would not let that keep me from purchasing this product. It is lightweight, easily dispensed and, having them on the leash, makes it so simple to clean up after your dog.  Everyone should be required to carry something as a courtesy to walkers.  You can use other types of plastic bags from groceries or other purchases, but these are the most compact and easiest to carry around and use.

B on B makes excellent bags and put them in an excellent dispenser.  I find the cap a little hard to get off (note: it pops off, but not easily), but I expect as it ages, that will loosen up a bit.  Perhaps the stiffness is intended to give it a longer useful life.<br /><br />BTW, I don't have a dog.  These are the bags I use for my daily scooping of my cat's litter box.

review/summary: WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR
review/text: This product works perfect.  You can clip to you leash or easily fits in jacket pocket.  Easy to load and use, the cap stays on and doesn't fall off as others do.  There is nothing negative to say about with this product.  There are different styles made by same company, I have used this one here and it works great.  I am actually buying another one.

review/summary: Give this one a wait
review/text: I have two of the fire hydrant versions of this product. As my dog's name is Gunny, I just couldn't resist getting this version. I received it promptly from Amazon, but when I stuck it on the leash, the "tie" wouldn't "lock" in place. So Amazon exchanged it for another one and the same thing is wrong. I have contacted [...] in order to avoid another exchange (guessing this is a batch problem.) They got back to me in less than 12 hours and are sending me a tie. Do order this, but wait until Amazon has sold their existing units off or sent them back. It is very cute, so between that and bagsonboard's great customer service, they do deserve a 5-star. I wish there was more quality control, but most products don't seem to have any these days...

review/summary: Not easy to open
review/text: If you don't have a lot of hand strength it's not the right container to get.  The lid is pretty much impossible to get off if the plastic is cold.  It gets very frustrating to have to wait for someone else to get the lid off for you.  The bags themselves are great though.  I think the bone shaped one might be easier to use and will probably give that one a shot.

review/summary: Good Deal on some Good Stuff
review/text: If you already know the taste and texture differences between 100% whole wheat and refined flour pastas, and you like the whole wheat variety, I can highly recommend this purchase.  If you are not familiar with the difference, pick up a single box at the store and give it at try first.<br /><br />Note too that while products labeled "100% whole wheat" are certainly whole wheat products, products labeled as merely "whole wheat" are probably not 100% whole wheat.<br /><br />So this is good stuff, a quality 100% whole durum wheat pasta. Good for you and good on the table. And $1.30 a box seems quite fair for the good stuff.<br /><br />BTW, the pasta I received in early October, 2010, has a "best by" date of March, 2012.  While a "best by" date is not an expiration date we'd still prefer to use the product before that date, so that gives you around 17.5 months to go through 20 boxes, assuming you get the same kind of lead time on your product.  Just thought that information would be useful to anyone contemplating buying in bulk.

review/summary: Simply: The Best Whole Wheat Spaghetti
review/text: I've been eating whole wheat spaghetti for 25 years now- so I guess that makes me somewhat of an expert (That, and the fact that I'm Italian!). This is simply the best whole wheat spaghetti on the market. I only wish I would have discovered this sooner- it is one of the most reasonably priced WW spaghettis, and it just can't be beat. It cooks up very similar to regular white spaghetti- it is not dry or sticky or heavey. For being 100% whole wheat, it is surprisingly mild and soft. I recommend boiling it for 15 minutes- and it is done to perfection. This is the only spaghetti I'll buy. When my local Wal*Mart stopped selling it, I bought a case of it here on Amazon, and it arrived amazingly quickly.

review/summary: I love whole wheat pasta!
review/text: This pasta has a unique flavor, and more subtle notes than processed wheat. Unfortunately, you have to try it to decide for yourselves, as tastes are very personal preferences.  You can get a sample of the difference by trying whole grain or whole wheat bread versus regular white bread.<br /><br />You may see this review in 3 other reviews of Heartland products, because I have them all, and use them all for variety.<br /><br />Don't confuse whole grain with whole wheat, they are not the same and have slightly different tastes.  Whole grain tends to be sweeter and contains the same overall fiber and health benefits.  Whole grain is an amalgam of different grains: rice, oats, wheat, etc., using all the portions of the grain, whereas whole wheat is just 100% of the whole wheat grain. Heartland sells both so you can try each too. Either whole grain product holds their body more al dente and require a slightly longer cooking time. I like them both with whole wheat seemingly less sweet.  The angel hair variety is notable as the fiber really makes it easier to make it al dente [ as its thinner, its more sensitive to over cooking].

review/summary: It's my new obsession.
review/text: I have always preferred round beef jerky sticks over any other, and I have sampled my fair share over the years. The only problem that I have ran into was that there simply was not enough to calm my craving. However, Jack Links has solved my problem with the Sasquatch Big Stick.  What I obviously enjoy about this beef jerky is the quantity, but I must also commend the quality as well. Every stick that I have opened (quite a few) has smelled and tasted fresh. I especially enjoy the *crunch* it makes when being bitten. Yes, there is some grease involved (like another reviewer stated), but I haven't eaten a good jerky stick that didn't have some grease (it isn't enough to coat your mouth and leave an after taste).  So, if you enjoy round jerky, I highly recommend the Sasquatch by Jack Links but beware... Once you eat one, you will be stopping at every gas station you see to get another one!

review/summary: YUMMY MANGO GUMMIES!
review/text: Sour Mango gummies have a wonderful mango flavor that is just sour enough to be pleasant without making your mouth pucker.  These are very soft, slightly chewy (not nearly as chewy as gummy bears or the Phantasia shapes), full of flavor and just the right size to pop into your mouth and roll around with your tongue to hit all of the different sections of taste buds.  Just two or three of these are enough to completely satisfy that craving for sweet that hits a few hours after dinner.  I would have been happier with them if they hadn't been coated with sugar granules on the outside, but I realize most folks like that sort of thing and, if you're like me, you can just brush the sugar off.
