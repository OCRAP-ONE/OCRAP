review/summary: Yum!  I like these better than popchips!
review/text: The smart fries are really tasty!  I ordered the 6 flavor variety pack.  While I did enjoy all of the flavors, my two favorites had to be the Jalapeno Trio and the Honey Mustard and Onion.<br /><br />I will be ordering these again, but I will pick and choose the flavors I like best.<br /><br />These make a great potato chip alternative.  I've also tried the popchips and I do prefer these.  the serving size is actually very large!  When I saw the size of the bag I figured it had to be all air, or that there were multiple servings in the bag.  Nope!  Granted it is 110 calories vs the popchip's 100 calories.  But honestly, I get way more satisfaction out of these.

review/summary: Better than expected!
review/text: After being on a very strict diet for over two years, the same foods, day in and day out, become repetitious, and it becomes very difficult to maintain the will-power to continue.  However, Smart Fries are an excellent product that offers a bit of a variety to a healthful diet.  As another customer wrote, I, too, was skeptical of purchasing this product, but, at 110 calories per bag, I was very impressed and have become a loyal customer after the first try.  Additionally, I find that I can not eat an entire bag.  My fiancee and I shared a bag of the Smart Fries, and I had some left over for another meal.  A great product for those looking for healthy alternatives, while maintaining a great taste.

review/summary: Folks these delicious snacks are 3 POINTS on the New Weight Watchers Points plan!!!
review/text: I purchased a bag at a local gourmet deli in NYC because they had about 1/3 the calories of all the kettle fried chips.  First, I was shocked that there was only 1 serving in the bag (even though the measurement says 1 once the bag is bigger than you think).  After calculating the points I decided to give them a try.  Boy am I glad I did!  I almost felt guilty for having soo much to crunch on (there are a lot of these fries in that there bag).  I must reiterate 1 bag (1 oz) is 3 points!!! This is major.  The flavor is great and you will not feel hungry.  I am ordering a bunch of these right away.

The honey barbeque, honey mustard and onion and cheddar are my favorites!  These are similar in texture to the Andy Capp's Hot Fries.  I've lost over 80 lbs and am always on a lookout for low cal, yummy snacks and these fit the bill.  My kids really like these too and I don't feel bad letting them have them because they don't have a lot of fat or calories.  I would like to try the cinnamon ones soon!

review/text: These SmartFries are so awsome!  With regular chips and bagged snacks you get maybe 10 - 15 per serving, but with SmartFries you get 65 per serving and only 110 calories.  I never even get close to that many though as I usually get my fix in around 20.  If any of you love the Trader Joe's Skinny Fries, then you're in luck because these are the same thing and the same price if purchased in multiple bag packs.  I am a frequent buyer of this product.

review/summary: Good for Low Cal Snack
review/text: I am always dieting and ordered the multi flavor package of these.  I admit I like some flavors more than others.  At first I wasn't sure I liked them because they are so light and airy but they are filling and only 110 calories, 2grams fat, 1g fiber. A filling, crunchy snack bagb you can keep in a desk or in the car that won't wreck a diet but is emotionally satisfying if you need a saltry crunch.  I didn't think I would like the vinegar ones, but I really do.  The sligtly salty ones are the least flavorful in my opinion but sometimes I use dip with them. I will definitely order again.  The bagsv are big and sometimes I only need to eat half to feel satisfied, honestly. (Not like the PopC**ps where I can eat a whole ig bag) Wish I could get them in stores. They grow on you and for me they were worth the money to stay on my diet.

review/summary: love love but take out some salt please!
review/text: I was so excited about receiving these and wow the crunch and flavor is great! 1 ounce for only 110 calories is awesome. At the bottom of the bags though I found a lot of salt so I re-checked the nutritional info and found one bag has 11% of daily intake of salt! That is just too much for me with my BP issues etc. The pop chips are yummy too and only have 6% daily salt.. for a little less than one ounce and the pop tortilla chips are also 6% per 1 oz. bag. With the great taste of the fries you just don't need all that salt anyhow! So to people not worried about their salt intake ( everything else is very healthy) go for it.. but for people like me just be a bit cautious. This was to be my newest best healthy snack but guess I will have to enjoy sparingly and keep on looking. My score would def. been a 5 if not for the extra, in my view, unnecessary salt. Hope this helps!

review/text: I purchased the 1.1 oz.-24 bag variety pack.  I actually didn't care for 2 of the 6 flavors though I realize this is just personal preference.  I thought the other flavors were tasty.  You get a lot of snack for the calorie content.  I think they are very comparable to PopChips but you get a much bigger portion(1.1 oz. of Smart Fries for 110 cal vs. popchips - 100cal for 0.8 oz.). I like PopChips but I'd rather be able to have more snack for the same calories. The Honey Mustard & BBQ flavors are delicious & were my favorite.  If you're a chip addict like I am, this is a good deal.  It was a big enough serving to satisfy my craving without completely blowing my daily calorie intake.  I will definately purchase again.

review/text: Looking at the shape of this snack you will think you are eating Cheetos. But rest easy there's no grease here. This is the perfect snack if you're trying to diet. There should be something fun if you're fighting the calories, and this was perfect! For 110 calories, you get 65 smart fries, and I actually felt full after eating a bag. They're light and crispy and very flavorful. Here's what I thought about the flavors:<br /><br />Honey Mustard and Onion: My fav by far! I can taste the honey dijon and the sweet onions. Delicious!<br />Vinegar Splash: Lots of vinegar flavor!<br />Honey BBQ: More subtle in flavor, but very tasty.<br />Vintage Cheddar: Classic Cheese Curl flavor, light and salty.<br />Sea Salt: allows the potato flavor to shine through. Yum!<br />Jalapeno Trio: I liked this one the least, if I'm going to eat a flavor like this I would want something greasy with it, which would defeat the purpose of a healthy snack!

review/summary: Wow! Tart and Salty
review/text: First off, I am not a big fan of vinegar potato chips or fries, but these came in the variety pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AZ2ECY">Gourmet Basics Smart Fries 6-Flavor Variety Pak, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>.  Nonetheless, I must say that they are enjoyable.  However, I still prefer BBQ and plain potato chips or fries.  They are not my favorite, but would make a good from time to time.  They have a strong tart vinegar flavor with a touch of salt.  The acid of vinegar may pair well with the bland or complement something less intense.

The one ounce bag is almost more than one can eat with their lunch.  I have tried the jalepeno, cheddar, honey mustard and bar b que, so far.  All of the flavors were delish.  The jalepeno was good, maybe just a little too much kick for me.  I would and have recommended these to anyone who is looking for a 110 calorie snack with eighty percent less fat than regular chips.

review/text: Love these fries (chip alternative).  Much more healthier then potatoe chips.  I am on Weight Watchers and you can have a bag for 2 points, which is great.  They taste great, love all the flavors, and there are a lot of them, great variety.  The bags are chocked full, unlike potatoe chip bags.  I highly recommend.  Kids even like them!  Crunchy and fun to eat.

review/summary: Smart Fries taste great!
review/text: I purchased these for my kids. I am always purchasing alternatives for chips (that they love so much) and I stumbled upon these. I ordered the variety pack so the kids could experience different flavors and they were so happy when they ate them. I usually purchase Pop chips and Pop corners, but I thought these would be a fun change for my kids and I was right. After they each tried their own bag, they immediately told me how much they liked them and almost everyday during the Christmas break they wanted a bag for their afternoon snack. They have tried all the flavors in the variety pack and I have not heard any objections yet. I tried the sea salt, cheddar and salt and vinegar varieties and enjoyed the flavors of each. If you like Pop chips, then chances are you will like these too. Although the seasoning on the fries are not as intense as the flavoring on Pop chips, I still think these are an enjoyable snack for kids and adults.

If you're the type that's aware that you have to make small sacrafices for a healthy lifestyle, then you will love these. They satisfy my cravings when I need a cruchy, saltly snack. And when i'm craving something sweet...the honey mustard flavor does the trick. I say give em a try! Just got my second order in the mail yesterday.

review/text: If you're ever in the mood to just munch on something and not have it kill you in calories, this is it.<br />It has crunch and a little salt. Looking at other reviews, it IS a lot like eating air, but again,<br />for those of us who can't afford to eat a bag of chips, this is the best substitute. You're not going to<br />eat one and be like - WOW. This is the best snack I've ever had. BUT, it's the  best when you're looking to find something crunchy that you can eat while watching a movie. It works for me so well, that when my local BJ's stopped carrying them (which is a sign I know), I had to go directly to the vendor to find where I can get them. Now I have to buy at Trader Joe's and they're much more money now. Still - they work for me like nothing else.<br />I must add I only like the Sea Salt. I've only tried one other flavor and didn't like it. If anyone finds out where I can buy the huge economy sized bag that BJ's used to sell, PLEASE tell me! It's a great deal! I wish they didn't stop selling it...

I expected the consistency to be like that of Hot Fries but they are actually really smooth. You get a ton of them in the bag, too. I usually don't like to buy the 100 calorie Oreo packs because half the bag is air and you're still hungry afterwards but that's not the case with these. Full bag, full of flavor, full belly. I'm happy with the price too so I think I"ll stick with these.

review/text: I discovered these on a whim at a discount store and they were surprisingly delicious. They have an awesome crunch and great potato flavor. The best part was the nutrition stats: only 110 calories, 1.5 fat, and 2 fiber per ounce (which is a much larger portion than expected and very satisfying). The original flavor is very good, but could use a touch more salt. The jalapeno is also really tasty: a little sweet, a little smoky, and just a little spicy.

review/summary: These are great but the mix of flavors is not the best
review/text: I love Smart fries so they get 5 stars. However this pack is not the best mix of the flavors. It good if you don't know what you like and want to try 1-2 bags of each different flavor. However, if you know you like certain flavors and are looking for a bunch of them you should just buy the seperate flavor packs.<br /><br />The flavor of the smart fries themselves are amazing. I have been using these as a subsitute for eating other salty or sweet snacks. The whoel bag is only a little over 100 calories and if you swap them out for the right cravings they are going to save you a junk load of calories.<br /><br />The price here is alot better then local stores that I have seen. At my work cafe they have these for about 2 dollars a bag. So anything under 1.50 would have been great but under a dollar a bag that's just awesome. I am planning on stocking up on some of the 1 flavor packs for a long road trip since these are an excellent "snacking food" when your not starving but want to munch :).

review/text: Had my first package of these today - the Cheddar.  I was surprised at how many are in the bag.  I was expecting maybe a dozen and it was easily 3-4x that. If you're looking for an alternative to potato chips and greasy stuff that's bad for you, these will do the trick. I'm trying to cut all saturated fat from my diet so having something like this to snack on or to throw a bag in my lunch is going to be great. Great flavor and texture.  Sure they aren't as filling as regular chips but that's kind of the point, right? A full bag should do the trick - it certainly did for me.

It's too bad that Amazon doesn't give an option to customers to mix and match varieties.

review/summary: Potato Styrofoam Tubes...
review/text: These are nothing like french fries. When you open the bag, a bunch of little tube-shaped flavorless "potato sticks" are staring back at you. They are literally the consistency of styrofoam. Ever had cheese curls? They're the texture of that, but the exterior is smooth. It is extremely odd. Due to the smooth exterior, the "sea salt" (which I find to be remarkably similar to table salt) doesn't stick. So the entire bag is covered in salt, but very little ends up being on the actual "fry"<br /><br />I'm sitting here eating a bag as I type this, and honestly, it's really hard for me to finish. They don't even taste like potato. They taste like paper. Salty paper. I mean if you're into bland and tasteless food, this will be right up your ally. But there are many other healthy alternatives that taste SO much better.

This brand's packages are much fuller than others.  The chips or fries have a sweet and spicy, tangy BBQ flavor.  I say they have more of a Memphis than Carolina style BBQ taste.  I would say they will pair with almost any kind of hearty sandwich or make a filling snack.  Yummy!

I gave them to my grandkids and they LOVED them!!<br />I was VERY surprised when I opened a bag and saw how many were in a 1 oz serving! WOW!!! Not like your typical lo-cal/lo-fat snack chip where you get about 10 chips and you're done. I love the texture and everything about these fries. I'm already trying to decide what flavor/flavors to reorder. This is definitely on the top of my snack list.<br />My only suggestion is if a little bit more salt could be added to the Classic Sea Salt flavor. They didn't have quite the flavor punch I was expecting but they were still very good. I think a bit more salt would make them PERFECT!!<br />I'm so glad I came across these fries and I'll definitely spread the word to friends and family.

Once they see the can, they will follow me until dinner is served.<br /><br />I'd recommend getting it delivered monthly for the extra discount, but amazon's price is very good.

review/summary: pricing changes
review/text: I really love ordering pet food to be delivered and it started out at a good price, same as the local store but the prices keep changing. One time the prices even doubled for the exact same order, so I cancelled my pet food shipments.  Wish it could have been more dependable and cost effective. It's a pain to have to get online and check the pricing for grocery/pet items every month.

review/summary: Good price and free shipping with a subscription
review/text: This is my cats' (there are 5, all Rescue Cats) favorite flavor food but for<br />some reason, the local grocery stores do not stock it regularly and it is hard<br />to find in this area of Florida, so I was glad to see that I can now order it<br />from Amazon. I did several price comparisons; while the regular price for 24 cans<br />on Amazon was the same as the regular store price (although the on-sale store price<br />was lower), the subscription price at this time on Amazon is better than the store price.<br />I have seen other posts talking about the changing prices on Amazon, so this will be<br />something I have to watch. A huge advantage is having this delivered to my door--<br />carrying home 140+ cans of cat food a month is a burden. And best of all, with the<br />subscription, the shipping is free. Better price, front door delivery-a great deal and<br />I plan to activate a subscription starting in March.

review/summary: Great blend, though hotter than expected
review/text: I made a quick pot of chili to test this out, and the results were excellent (cubed chuck steak, this chili pepper blend, some ground cumin, finely diced onion and garlic, salt and some tomato sauce).  The heat level, though, is just a bit higher than I expected (definitely hotter than Gebhardts chili powder), but it doesn't burn long.  Definitely good flavor, and a great price.

review/summary: GREAT for on-the-go energy
review/text: I use these as an energy source for bike riding.  They fit great in a bike jersey pocket, they have a Zip-lock seal, and you can eat just one or all of them depending on your energy need.  Much better than an energy bar which are yucky to only eat a bite or two out of and put back in your jersey pocket!  Plus, they don't taste like cattle-feed like so many energy bars tend to.  They have the same consistency as a jelly bean, but you won't eat them like candy because they make you thirsty.  They aren't kidding when they put on the label "Alwasy consume with water."  OK, sometimes I do eat them as "candy" but not many.  The only draw back is if they sit in your car in the hot sun, they tend to stick together, even after they gave cooled... especially if they were being pressed on by something (like they were in your duffel bag and your shoes were laying on the bag of beans).  Still edible, not messy, but not as easy to pop just one.  Highly recommend.

review/text: This product arrived in a timely manner, but was not nearly as hot as expected. The smokiness was excellent and it was a great addition to the pantry, but certainly not "the hottest pepper powder on the planet". Think a really angry cousin of chipotle powder. I really like it and would probably recommend it, but not as a really hot powder.

review/text: I found the powder to be more than most people can handle by itself. The trick is to mix it with other spices and ingredients and you can make it tolerable. For me I thought the taste of the whole dry chile was better. The drying process and grinding must do something to the powder. If you have never tried it.... go for it. You only live once.... or die once!!

review/summary: Too weak to be the perfect potful
review/text: Even though it showed this item as in stock, it took 3 weeks to arrive with free shipping. The coffee has a nice aroma, but there is no way you will get 100-120 cups of coffee out of this product unless you are drinking coffee flavored water. You really need 2 packets to make a decent pot. People like me who drink black coffee and are interested in flavor may even need to use slightly more. For those who add cream and sugar, perhaps you can live with this, but for a true coffee drinker, it isn't worth the money. I put the packets in coffee cans just to see how it measured up.  The entire box is equal to about 2 small cans of coffee which you could purchase in the store for $10 or less (decaf). Once I realized I could only get 4 cups from a packet, it did taste good.

review/summary: Great Way to Start your morning
review/text: I am the worst about eating fruits and wanted to try to set a better example for my children. I have never been a fan of orange juice, but at my local grocery store I found Simply Orange Pulp Free on sale and decided I would try it. I must say I got one glass and my girls drank what was left in one sitting. Needless to say I had to get more. This juice is sweet and delicious. With most orange juice you will pucker. Not with this one! It is a great way to start your morning! A great source of vitamin C. To be honest my kids were alway catching colds to, at least once a month, it has been a month and counting and no one with a cold! I would recommend this orange to to anyone! I have also served this juice at my Wednesday brunches, and it has always been a huge success!

review/summary: Preferred Orange Juice
review/text: I happened to pick this up in the grocery store several years ago on a whim since I was trying to add more fruits and vegetables to my family's diet.  I had not been a big fan of orange juice due to the pulp, but this was pulp free and I thought it worth a try.  That was a long time ago and I now regularly purchase this and it's WONDERFUL!<br /><br />The acidity of any orange juice means that I don't drink it when I first get up in the morning, but I do drink it mid-morning after working out or in the middle of the afternoon for a pick-me-up.  All natural, and full of vitamins, it has been a great addition to my diet.<br /><br />Due to price, last week I decided to try another brand (larger amount of juice for the same price) and it turned out in the end to be very expensive.  I drank half of a small glass of the other brand before pouring the entire container down the drain.  I couldn't even force myself to drink it after getting spoiled with Simply Orange.<br /><br />If you typically don't like orange juice and have avoided it in the past, you might want to give this a try -- it converted me into a regular o.j. drinker.

review/text: This has definitely changed since the previous dry milk in the cardboard box. I would have hoped it got better, but was very disappointed in it. It is fine like sand and floats when water is added. It never floated before. I guess that means something extraneous has been added to it. I will go back to store brands, which are cheaper, and just as good now. Carnation used to be the very best. Not any more.

review/text: I've used this product in somewhat of a niche way.  I have never drank it.  I purchased it on behalf of the biochemistry research lab where I work.  We use it for blocking membranes during western blotting.  I'm not sure if this is lab lore or what, but supposedly Carnation nonfat dry milk is superior to other brands for its ability to block membranes with the lowest background.  Amazon was the only place that we could find it - seems like grocery stores are not carrying it these days, at least locally where I live.

review/text: There is a strong bitterness to this that makes me wonder if it is half peel. I will not ever buy it again and it was a waste of my money money. It may be good for pies, I don't know, but the bitterness over-rides anything with which it is used. Buy the real thing, limes, or don't buy this. I used a small<br />amount in a smoothie and it was ruined. I'll stick to the lemon juice.
