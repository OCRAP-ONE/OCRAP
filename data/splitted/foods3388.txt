review/summary: Very disapointing!!
review/text: I received my order of Grove Square hot cocoa mix today, and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix. I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels. I would urge Amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale. If the ingredients had been listed, those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products.

review/summary: Dark chocolate lover - best I've tried
review/text: I mainly use my Keurig for coffee but thought I'd try this one since I love dark chocolate and it was getting mostly good reviews.  I've tried some other chocolate K-cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery.  If I can taste water I don't consider it real hot chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others I've tried.  (I must admit there are many I haven't tried, but I don't really feel like making a big scientific study of it.)  This will be my source of hot chocolate from now on.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to see how many ingredients it contains.  That sort of thing worries me a little.  Still, I don't drink hot chocolate that much, so I think I'll survive.  I'll copy the ingredient label here for those concerned plus a few items from the nutrition info:<br /><br />Calories 60, from fat 20.  Trans Fat 0g. Sodium 200mg. Sugars 6g.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: sugar, glucose syrup solids, cocoa (processed with alkali), partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (may contain coconut, soybean, sunflower, palm and/or canola), modified whey, maltodextrin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, cellulose gum, sodium caseinate, cornstarch, lactose, dipotassium phosphate, sucralose, mono- and diglycerides, silicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color. [Contains milk and soy.]<br /><br />(I always hate seeing artificial coloring in "dark" chocolate products.)<br /><br />If I had hot chocolate every day I would consider making it from scratch with more cocoa and fewer chemicals, but since I enjoy the convenience of having it nearly instantly from my Keurig on the occasional whim, I'll just keep a box of these K-cups on hand.  I highly recommend it for the taste, it isn't easy finding good hot chocolate.

review/summary: Not bad, but not good either
review/text: When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes.

It tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it.  I personally will go back to buying Swiss Miss in a can and just using the Keurig to give me Hot Water, cheaper and much better tasting.

review/text: I haven't actually tried drinking these just as hot cocoa but I know the peppermint flavor is great as a creamer for the Van Houtte Mexican coffee...I'm ordering another box as this adds just the right amount of chocolate to my coffee.  Been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better :-) I usually have 14 oz at a time so I run 4 oz through as hot chocolate and the other 10 as coffee. I did try another brand of kcup hot cocoa and it wasn't as good as this brand.

review/summary: Why, oh why, add fake sugar?
review/text: Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products.

review/text: I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct "plasticy" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way.

review/summary: Very acceptable K Cup Hot Chocolate
review/text: Unlike some others, this is actually IN a K Cup and not just an overpriced version of Swiss Miss.  While the flavor is not super premium like a Godiva or Ghiradhelli, it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak K Cup versions I've had.  The sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix, but it isn't unpleasant.<br /><br />I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste. The peppermint is my favorite, followed by the dark and then the light chocolate.  They are all very good.  My only wish is that I could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only.

When I purchased my Keurig it came with a box of 16 hot chocolate K-Cups (name not used to protect the guilty), that have the most indescribable, particularly unpleasant after taste, all due to the "fake" sugar that seems to comprise most if not all of the product.<br /><br />This manufacturer does use some sucralose, but no where near the amount that "other" uses.  In fact, it actually tastes like hot chocolate during and after the sipping.  WhooHoo!!!!<br /><br />Will be ordering more - Thank You for my Kuerig hot chocolate reaffirmation.

review/summary: Excellent Hot Chocholate
review/text: Was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a K cup but Grove Square is amazing.  It is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss.  The milk chocolate is mild, the dark has enough bite to make it interesting and the peppermint is perfect for after dinner.

review/text: we have bought several types, brands of hot cocoa k cups. These our definitely one of the best! They have a great flavor and everyone in my house liked them, even my 9 year old who only likes some hot cocoa loved this. It is creamy, it actually tasted like a melted candy bar, very good taste, not watered down like some of them. Of course the price is amazing, but don't let that fool you! This is one of those products that is actually good even though it isn't very expensive.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Wow, I did a lot of reading trying to make a good decision on a K-cup hot chocolate, and of course taste is something that is very subjective.  If you read all the reviews on every product you'll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation.  So I decided that even with some bad reviews I'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  I'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  Some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  All I can tell you is I must have under-achieving taste buds because all I can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  My family burned through the first box and I just ordered two more.  If you don't like this I feel sorry for you. Better to have numb taste buds I guess.  Enjoy.

review/text: When I got my Keurig brewer last month, I bought two different types of hot chocolate.  The Grove Square Hot Chocolate is far superior.  I have so far brewed it on 6oz and 8oz with good flavor at both sizes.  The flavor is rich and it leaves no residue in the bottom of the kcup (the other brand does, maybe I got a bad batch?).  Overall, I will happily buy this one again.

review/summary: Best K-cup cocoa
review/text: I've tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the Keurig, and this is the only one I keep buying more of when I run out. Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some.

But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a "hot plastic-y" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste.

review/text: As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone.

review/summary: Nice tasting cocoa
review/text: The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like.

review/text: If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.This has artificial sweetener (sucorse)  just like the other hot chocolates out there.

review/summary: Good taste, bad product
review/text: I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.

review/summary: Very good hot cocoa.
review/text: I'm really baffled by the great differences of opinion on this product. I've tried a couple of different brands and the Grove Square was without doubt the best. I recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local Joe Muggs (in a local BAM store) that was over $2  for the smallest size and really couldn't tell much difference. Obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product? Oh well, I like it.<br />p.s. 11-27  I like this cocoa well enough that I have subscribed to momthly delivery with free shipping and reduced cost!

review/summary: Tastes like hot sugar water
review/text: This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.

review/text: I bought these crackers from Whole Foods because I was doing a wheat-free cleanse.  I thought they were going to be boring and cardboardish compared to some other crackers that I knew and loved.  Much to my surprise they turned out to be absolutely yummy.  They're super crunchy and have loads of sesame seeds and other flavors.  I only had the original but I can't wait to try the rest of them.

review/summary: I'm GF but still wanted rye bread
review/text: Finding this on Amazon was very helpful.  Even though this brand is sold in some health food store, the caraway flavor is not.<br />Since going gluten-free (GF), I have been missing rye bread and these crackers solve that problem easily.  I can have some of these crackers, with a little butter, for breakfast and this will fool my taste buds into thinking I just had rye bread.<br /><br />They are good for a light lunch, topped with ham & cheese, tuna salad etc.<br />And for you folks that don't need GF food, these crackers taste good and just happen to be good for you too - LOTS of fiber.  These crackers are very dense and firm - they are not light and flaky.  They also come in other flavors.<br /><br />The only concern I have is the amount of time it took to receive it.  Even though the shipping was free, I don't like having food sitting around in possibly less than ideal environments.  The order was coming from 1 state away, but took more than a week.  Amazon is usually quicker than this.  But the price per case was good.

review/summary: OK, bit disappointing. Certainly nothing to get so flibbertigibbet over.
review/text: I have to give these crackers *some* credit for being wheat free. That being said, I don't think they are very good to eat by themselves; they have an off.. almost burnt taste. They're decent with cheese though, or even just lick n' dip in a little salt / seasoning. I wouldn't exactly call them crunchy either, more crisp verging on hard (also extremely loud when your teeth shatter them - not a good office munchie). The texture is a little bit like those hard thin Japanese rice crackers, but a little harder and loads of seeds. (Don't get me wrong, I like the seeds aspect).<br /><br />Another recent reviewer had a similar opinion about the off/burnt taste. I wondered if we just got a bad batch and contacted the company. They seemed willing to send a new box but I suggested I go buy a single box at the store to compare first and they told me some local stores. But the crackers from the store tasted just the same. It's really just something I should have done in the first place, ordered this big box of crackers just for a healthy snack to keep in my desk.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd give 'em 3 1/2 stars if I could, but not 4 or 5.

review/summary: Mary's Gone Crackers
review/text: Buyer beware! I purchased a big box of Mary's Gone Crackers, crackers, at Costco and though they were tasty, they are also extremely hard (to say the least). About a week or two after I started eating them every day, I began to experience tooth pain on one side of my mouth. The pain became so uncomfortable that I made an appointment with my dentist.<br /><br />Long story short, my dentist asked me if I'd been grinding my teeth recently (which I never to) because he said that I had two cracked/broken - fillings. Because of the depth of each filling, I could not have them replaced but instead, needed to have two crowns put on them. In the process of preparing the two teeth for their crowns, one of those two teeth needed root canal.<br /><br />My dental bills totaled $3, 545.00 and the company said it would not reimburse me for any of that because I didn't save the left over crackers (that I tossed because they are hard as rocks)!!

review/summary: Benriach Tawny is a keeper: rich and tasty
review/text: BenRiach is a wonderful story. Founded in the late 19th century it produced malts for decades that were blended into other products. Owned by Chivas Bros., Benriach labored in obscurity until it was closed in the 90s. Reopened with a new consortium, BenRiach has become innovative and interesting - producing peated Speyside malts, interesting secondary cask agings, and other creative experiments. BenRiach 15 Tawny Port wood finished was in the 2006 group of releases. It is a success. Amber gold in the glass, aroma is restrained at first - with only faint iodine showing in the nose. With extended air notes of apricot, citrus, vanilla, and wood rise up. Entry on the palate is honeyed sweet with a big mid palate expansion of oak vanilla, vinuous resin, and nutmeg. Finish is long with wood tannins producing a bitter orange or dark chocolate like sensation at the back of the throat and fading apricot spice perfume. This is rich yummy malt with a light silky mouthfeel.

review/summary: Not bad, but not good either
review/text: I've been eating Knorr (Lipton) noodles for about 15 years now. They are simple to make, inexpensive, and tasty. This particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department. As far as all the Knorr varieties go, this is near the bottom of my list. I will probably not be buying this one again. This flavor, along with the other two new flavors (Bacon Cheddar and Scampi) are rather disappointing. I would have expected more from Knorr. The discontinued Beef Lo Mein Asian side from Knorr was much, much better than this.
