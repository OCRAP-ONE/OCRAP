review/text: I love these snacks, I've bought them loose whenever I found them for a ridiculous price because I love them. Then I found them to order on Amazon for a bit of a discount (being bulk).... and I am actually quite disappointed, both boxes I bought are pretty stale, even thought the expiration date is 2013. I can only guess the storage is not good where they are kept through Amazon.<br /><br />The flavor is great still, and they are edible, but this is the last time I purchase them through here.

review/text: I love molasses and use it mainly in baking. This is very good. I was expecting a little bit of a stronger flavor, because of the "Dark and Zesty" name. It reminds me of Grandma's brand molasses, maybe just a tad stronger. It's not too thick so it's easy to pour or spoon out of the bottle. The price is right too; less than I pay at the grocery store. Do be aware that this comes in plastic, not glass bottles.

review/summary: Now I REALLY like molasses!
review/text: Wow, I thought I knew molasses before. Now I know molasses! I add it to my mud-like tea concoction every morning (pepper, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, cloves, turmeric, milk, and various teas). It also goes in my cooked cereals. So now I've increased the amount of molasses in those creations, because I love the flavor this adds. It might be more "zesty", as they call it, than some people prefer, but it's exactly what I was looking for - not so much a search for sweetness, but flavor! I could write an ad for the "Slow As" company. Oh, I just did. Where's my check? Actually, I'm already addicted to the flavors this gives to my morning rituals, I mean, routines. So you can take my comments as honest, not commercial... or is it the addiction talking??

Yes, it IS very Dark and Very Zesty and that is what makes it so darn good!  I've never made better Pumpernickel!  The price of retail makes a case of this on Amazon VERY advantageous!!

review/summary: All natural, rich colors
review/text: ***Updated Dec 8, 2011******<br />From reading recent comments it sounds like this product has changed from when I reviewed it.  My package lists the ingredients as Blue: Deionized water, glycerin, red cabbage.  Red: Beet juice, citric acid.  Yellow: Deionized water, glycerin, curcumin.  More recent customers claim it now has chemicals.  If you are interested in natural food coloring, this doesn't sound like the product for you.  Hopefully Amazon will get the listing straightened out.<br />****************************<br /><br />We avoid artificial ingredients, so after attempting to color icing for Chirstmas cookies with fruit juice and beet juice last year, I bought this food coloring to try out this year.  After reading the other reviews, I didn't have high expectations and was only hoping that it would be easier than making my own (and it was).<br /><br />But I was able to get rich, vibrant colors, not simply pastels.  Certainly they weren't the bright artificial colors you get with petrochemicals, but they were far from the pale pink and yellows I was expecting.<br /><br />My first experimentation was with small batches of icing - only using a few tablespoons of powdered sugar and milk and 2-5 drops of coloring.  The red came out a magenta, not Barbie pink, but definitely not red, either.  The blue was kind of a greyish blue.  The yellow was the most like you would expect.  I had also thought that the colors wouldn't mix well but I made green by mixing the blue and yellow and a nice purple by mixing blue and red.<br /><br />As one reviewer noted, they don't have as long as a shelf life as non-natural colors.  I bought mine in October and they are dated 5/2011.  But I put them in the refrigerator immediately (not waiting until after they were opened) and I have read on another site that carries them that this can extend their life up to a year.  The yellow separates so I shook it well before using.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the results and would definitely use them again. I'll try to post a photo of our Christmas cookies with the product.

review/summary: Clumpy
review/text: It is fabulous that there is an all natural food dye safe to use for my child allergic to anything chemical and artificial in his food. However, the dye is thick and goopy and makes the frosting much thicker and pastier than it should be, not smooth at all. Also, you can not get a rich deep color with this stuff so plan for everything to be pastel if you need anything darker rather than lighter in color. Still, over all, because it is one of the fewest choices I have to color my candy and desserts for my child on the Feingold diet, I recommend it to at least try. The price is much too steep though for the quality the product doesn't give.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I'm disappointed and I haven't even used it yet.  When I checked the ingredients list on line everything was ok.  A little curious on why they used sodium hydroxide in the yellow, but everything was natural.  That is what I wanted.  When they arrived I read the ingredients on the box and to my surprise the yellow is listed: Glycerin, polysorbate, propylene glycol, filtered deionized water, curcumin.  Polysorbate and propylene glycol, which is used in anti-freeze, aren't natural.  I now can not use the yellow at all.  I have had to order yellow from another company that has all natural colorings.  I am hoping it arrives before Friday so I can use it the frosting of the cake I'm making for my niece's 1st birthday.  I am very disappointed and will not be purchasing this in the future.

review/text: I really wanted to like these. I bought the double pack so I would have one for home and one for school. The school used traditional food dyes and my daughter broke out in hives. Not good. But we just tried to make playdough with these colors and were unable to make blue or green or yellow. Shades of reddish-pink to purply colors were ok. Perhaps it would help if I used bleached flour . As is, I can only endorse this half-heartedly for those who aren't trying to achieve a very specific color. It's a lot of money to spend for a product that only works moderately. I wish I had just experimented with juices instead (spinach, beet, and carrot) as someone else had recommended. I still would pick these over standard food dyes since those are linked to causing cancer and no amount of fun with food dye is worth that!

review/summary: PLEASE READ!  DANGER!
review/text: If you have allergies, DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!!  Or if you care about false advertising of the most egregious kind, DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!<br /><br />I ordered this because my son has severe allergies to all chemicals.  If it weren't a serious matter for him, I would not be spending this kind of money.  I carefully read the ingredient list on the product page and for the most part, all of the colors were listed as containing deionized water, glycerin, and depending on the color, a type of vegetable color.  Sounds safe enough.  Imagine my horror today when I opened the package and read the ingredients on there.  The yellow, in particular, has Polysorbate and PROPYLENE GLYCOL!!!!!  This is an ingredients in antifreeze and paint and is derived from petroleum!  This is no better than regular food dyes you can buy anywhere.  This could have been very serious for my son if I had just took the ingredient list on the product page at face value and just used these.  Now, I have to scramble to find another truly all natural set of colors before his birthday party.  I also wanted to use these for cookies for Halloween, but who knows if I'll get new ones by then.  Amazon's site says this is not a returnable item too!  However, I called them and explained the situation, and indicative of the fact that they realize how serious this could be, they told me to just keep the item and they refunded my money.  This is the worst case of false advertising I think I've ever seen considering what I said above, that most people willing to spend this much for all natural coloring have the potential to be seriously, and adversely affected by these chemicals!<br /><br />By the way, you might want to check out the organic and all natural colors at seelectteas.com instead.  I haven't called to verify that their ingredient list is indeed as it appears on the site, but if it is, they just contain water and vegetable juices.  The blue is made from gardenias.  Someone else who sells colors, who may have been trying to get me to order their product instead, said the seelectteas colors are of a lesser quality and that some of the ingredients are sourced from China and that gardenias have not been approved for this use by the FDA.  I left them a message but they were already closed.  Maybe I'll leave another post here after I talk to them to see if this is all true.  As far as the color goes, I don't care if it's not as bright if there are no chemicals.

review/summary: Great Natural Product; Takes a Little Practice
review/text: The number one thing to know about this item is that it is not made with petrochemicals or with any chemicals linked to cancer or to hyperactivity. That makes it the only food coloring that we use in my house. Having said that, I'll agree with the other reviewers who noted that the colors are not as vibrant as artificial, carcinogenic, hyperactivity-inducing dyes. Nothing makes a rainbow on pavement as pretty as anti-freeze leaking out of a car--it doesn't mean that I'll put it in my food!<br /><br />My advice for getting brighter colors in baking is to keep your pre-colored item as clear as possible. This means using agave nectar, honey, or rice syrup, for example, instead of Sucanat. I don't use any refined sugar in my house, so when I want to color something with India Tree, I use a light-colored natural sweetener like one of the aforementioned items. Rice syrup doesn't interfere too much with the India Tree food colors; in fact, I was able to make a beautiful mint-green ice cream with rice syrup as the sweetener and India Tree yellow and blue as the coloring agents. You have to practice to get it perfect, but if your kid isn't used to the chemical food dyes, then anything you do with these India Tree dyes will be a bright difference from plain brown or tan baked goods.

review/summary: India Tree DOES NOT contain toxic chemicals.
review/text: I spoke to a woman at India Tree at length about their ingredients. She said that for a short run of the product, they used a formulation that included propylene glycol and polysorbate to help preserve them and keep them from separating. They have since changed their formula BACK to the original with just vegetable color, water and citric acid. What you see on the ingredients label is CORRECT.<br /><br />That said, these colors are not nearly as vibrant as I hoped they would be, but given they are not chemical colors I can't complain too much. My food allergic daughter gets to enjoy fun colors now, so I am happy.

review/summary: Too expensive for the shelf life
review/text: I bought this product for my son who is on the Feingold diet and has very bad reactions to artificial colors.  I used it in May to make his birthday cake, luckily he wanted a "stealth bomber that blended with the sky" (he's very particular with his demands, I try to please) which required most of the cake to be sky blue.  These colors will give you nice pastels, but if you are looking for a very rich color, you will not get it from this product, no matter how much color you use.  The cake came out great, and I used the red to do the lettering which came out a nice darkish magenta, and was pleased with the kit in general.  I justified the expense since it was really the only option I could find, the cake came out beautiful, and it worked for my purposes.  Here I am 6 months later, trying to do Halloween cookies (wanted to make orange) and the red is now an ugly brown...the colors are expired.  (Shaking my head, well...they are natural, things in nature do go bad! duh)  So unless you own a natural bakery and are cranking out baked goods weekly and going through this product pretty quickly, its not worth the price.

review/summary: Not great but better than the alternative I guess...
review/text: I have been looking for natural food coloring-  mainly use it once a year to make green mac and cheese and other items for st paddy's day...Of course, I had to use the blue and yellow to make green and was not very successful.  I comforted myself about the ridiculously high price by telling myself you only use a drop or two at a time.  Not so- kept adding more and more and the best I could get was a light yellowish, green...Tried coloring soda bread with it and no color showed up at all after baking.  I also figured I could use it for a while but it expires in 6 months so it's not something you can keep around forever although it is something I rarely use. I would have to use it in frosting to really decide if it has any value as a colorant...this is the only reason I gave it 3 stars- because I think coloring frosting is probably it's best usage and I haven't tried that yet.  Otherwise I would have given it one star for such a poor value and results.

Sure, there are variations- but usually red means red of some sort.  So imagine my surprise when a few hours before my son's birthday party, I added the "red" dye to the cake frosting only to discover that it is Barbie, Victoria's Secret, cotton candy pink.<br /><br />If you are making a princess themed cake or plan on pastel colors, this would be awesome.  I wouldn't reccommend it for a 7 year old boy's birthday cake though!

The red usually comes out a rust-blood color and the blue is either purplish or grey, even if you put half the bottle in.

I knew that there was no variety, except in that which you can make yourself with the given primary colors. What I didn't expect was that it would take a half bottle of coloring and I still wouldn't have any noticeable color in a cornstarch and water "slime" I was making for my toddler. I only used one cup of cornstarch...and it was barely off white after adding a half bottle of color. The yellow also separated so much that after several minutes of shaking, it still hadn't even remotely mixed back together. I am seriously disappointing and back on the hunt for a food coloring that will work and give me the opportunity to make my son the fun colored projects and baked goods I'd like, without poisoning him with artificial food dyes.

review/summary: Great if you aren't heating it...
review/text: These colors make a bunch of beautiful colors, but if you are baking - BEWARE. The heat plus the baking soda will fade out most of these colors and your creation will be barely distinguishable from a non-colored cake. you can combat this somewhat by adding lemon juice to the batter. Your best bet with these is to use them in icing or for coloring liquids or anything else that is not heated...

review/summary: There has got to be better
review/text: I'm surprised that this is the best we can do in the area of chemical free food coloring.  I could not get the red to be red, bright magenta is the best I could do no matter how much I added.  The blue was green at go in both of the two packages I ordered. The yellow was yellow.  Unfortunately I did not need yellow. My mother is a lifelong oil painter and a self described expert at mixing colors and she called it at the first drop. "That will never be red."  Over 1/2 a bottle later, still magenta. A very expensive waste of money.  And that color table that you see everywhere with their products is definitely false advertising. There is no way you could make a 1/3 of those colors with this stuff. Don't by this unless you want camo green, magenta, yellow, prayish purple and the colors you can make from those.

review/summary: yeah natural but....not for eggs, pale, short shelf life, etc...
review/text: I bought mine at Whole Foods, and was excited at first, but no where on the package does it say that these colors do not work on eggs.  Okay, so reading their website it says these are not for eggs, fine, no more easter eggs, but what about coloring hard boiled eggs for kids' bentos?  Nope, the colors do not stick to a peeled egg either.  And it did not matter how much vinegar I used either.  Okay, so, moving on to frosting, no matter how much you add the frosting is always pastel, okay, fine, no real biggie, but the red comes out like a brick red color, really quite orangish, and I couldn't get a good a pink or purple because of it.  I guess I should have put the stuff in the fridge because it does not last well either.  I will definitely be looking for an alternative naturally colored food coloring, until then I am relegated to nothing more than using the blue to make the kids' scrambled eggs green a la Seuss.

review/summary: Overall, good experience using this food coloring
review/text: I used this food coloring in some frosting for cupcakes, and it worked out pretty well.  The colors do tend to be more of a pastel, but it worked really well for what I used it for.  Once the bottles are shaken up, the drops came out just fine and mixed in fine as well.  I would recommend this for someone who uses food coloring from time to time, but if you use it constantly, and need really dark colors, you may want to look elsewhere.

review/summary: I wanted to love this food coloring but it was just ok
review/text: I wanted a non-toxic food coloring for my daughter's birthday cake frosting. This was the only thing on the market for me to chose from.<br /><br />While the price was a bit steep for me, I didn't have a local option to buy from.<br /><br />This food coloring produces a bright yellow, rich magenta, decent purple and decent blue. However, I found no way to get a true red or green. I was able to make peach and orange as well as pink and magenta. I was also able to make what I would call a 1970's bathroom "green".<br /><br />I used this to make a Chuck E. Cheese's butter cream transfer design. The mouse came out good but the whole cake took on a faded look. It wasn't a bright, vibrant kid's cake.<br /><br />With that said, I think the health benefits of using this type of coloring out weight the disappointment in the lack of true green or red. So I give it 4 stars instead of 3.

review/text: My child cannot have artificial food coloring and this product works well for coloring icing.  Just keep in mind that you will get pastel, natural tones and not the bright vivid colors you get from artificial food coloring.  I have had mixed results with mixing colors - I have better luck just using varying shades of the 3 colors.  This is a liquid color so you will have to reduce the liquid in your frosting so it doesn't get to runny.  Great product and will continue to use it.  Keep refrigerated after opening so it does not go bad.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5BXA">India Tree Natural Decorating Colors Set,  3-Count Packages  2.25  ounces  (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: Delicious alternative tea
review/text: Runa is a brand new tea that I drink everyday. I love the balanced, energizing feel I get from it. Apparently guayusa has been drunk for thousands of years in the rain forests of Ecuador and is now making its way to market in the US for the first time. Runa also seems to have a great back story of environmental conservation and social empowerment of indigenous groups. In fact I just heard a story covered on NPR's Marketplace about the partnership between Runa, the socialist Ecuadorian government and the farmers.<br /><br />The Amazon Spice has a nice cinnamon undertone with high notes from the lemongrass, the Ginger Citrus is also really good and slightly spicier from the ginger with clean citrus zest flavor, the traditional is good to see what guayusa by itself tastes like- smooth and naturally, subtly sweet with no tannin. I've never had the spearmint but I bet its good for people who like mint tea.

Guayusa tea, on the other hand, is a different story, full of pleasure only. Drinking one or two cups of guayusa in the morning gives me energy all day long, without any buzz or jittery feeling. The flavor of this tea is also smooth and sweet, with perfectly balanced hints of cinnamon and lemongrass. It tastes nice hot but I find that I like it best cold.

review/text: I bought this bouillon because it was gluten free but because I wasn't able to read the ingredient list I didn't find out that it had dairy in it. Additionally it is not possible to return the product even though it was never opened so it was a complete waste of money. Many people that have a problem with gluten also have a problem with dairy so I don't think it makes much sense to make a gluten free product that has dairy in it. Other common allergens that are in the product are corn and soy.<br /><br />After contacting the manufacturer I found out that the sodium free version of this seasoning is gluten (wheat) and casein (dairy) free so if you have these allergies buy the sodium free version.

review/summary: GREAT IF YOU'RE STARVING
review/text: I had never heard of these, and when I came across the product listing I thought these were going to be more like "around the house snacks" given the description and comments.<br /><br />These are only really enjoyable to eat in the same way whey protein shakes or powerbars or other "good for you" meal replacement or snack-like food units are enjoyable:  they stop the hunger with a minimum of fuss.<br /><br />The balls are fairly dense.. prepare to "gnaw" on them.  Taking a bite is a commitment.  The texture with all the exterior seeds is coarse.  The peanut butter flavor is, well, faint.  Using the words "great tasting" in the marketing is stretching the truth a bit, IMHO.  (I would not buy these for taste alone.)<br /><br />On the plus side, they work.  I was running out of the house without having had breakfast, so I threw two balls in my pocket and ate them in the first 10 minutes of driving.  My hunger reacted the same way it would to any other 400-calorie breakfast -- it went away, and stayed away until lunch.  There was no negative aftertaste or other unpleasantness, and it made me feel like I had eaten food rather than some sort of snacky candy thing.<br /><br />I don't have a particular allergy related need for this product, although I like the fact that it doesn't use refined sugar.  I'm not sure how much of this product I will order in the future, but I can foresee finishing this pack.

review/text: I bought these because I have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the LA Weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient.  I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty! My favorites are actually the Fudgie Filberts that taste similar to a Little Debbie brownie if Little Debbie's were diet. Following that I would say Almond and Coconut are tied for second. Third is the Peanut Butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others. My husband didn't like any of them but could tolerate the one I liked least, Peanut Butter.  Over all I think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. I think I would have picked a different name than Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls.  Nut Butter Balls doesn't sound as appetizing as what they actually are!! Nut Butter Balls.....Mmmmmm!

review/summary: Good pick me up!
review/text: I bought these on sale recently from Vitamin Shoppe and am pleasantly surprised, given their mixed reviews.  They're not overly sweet, no, but then I find many of the protein bars and shakes on the market overly sweet-tasting (and I'm a sweets lover), and they have a chewier texture than other Betty Lou nut butter balls (try kneading them a bit).  I'm enjoying them when I'm in between lunch or dinner or even as a meal replacement.  Very filling and a decent protein count (15 g) with fairly low sugars (11g).  I was a tad disappointed that they didn't have a stronger peanut butter taste as I could live on peanut butter, but give these overall high marks.

review/summary: Artificial tasting
review/text: Thought I'd give these a try because I was looking for an afternoon slightly sweet snack bar that's high in protein, low-fat and great tasting.  Well these are high in protein(which I like), are low in fat(which I like), but I think in their processing to make it low-fat they compromised on the flavor. I was expecting a more natural peanut butter taste but was disappointed with the texture and taste. Artificial!!  I will not buy these again.  I'm stuck now with the whole box. My hunt continues for that great snack bar.

review/text: These peanut butter balls are great, full of protein and very satisfying.  There is only one caveat.  Keep them off of the counter if you have a tall dog.  My basset got the box down while I was out and enjoyed about 12-14 of these balls.  He was very satisfied, however he had a severe case of diarrhea for 3 days.  He, however, was very happy.  LOL

review/summary: Mediocre
review/text: Barely sweet.  Could not distinguish the flavor of peanuts over any other nut.  Just a rich fatty taste with a hint of alcohol in the background.  The packaging led me to believe that these were going to be a wholesome treat both in nutritional value and taste.  At the end of the day there are much better protein and health bar solutions.

review/text: Yum! These peanut butter treats are so filling!  One kept me satisfied for five hours.  Perfect to keep in my desk at work, my car, my purse...anywhere I might be when I'm hungry but don't want to end up eating something unhealthy.  As for the taste...you need to be a fan of peanut butter to like these, which I definitely am.  There is a slightly odd aftertaste to them, but it's minor and minimal and I don't mind it.  The texture is a much denser, peanuty, heavy rice krispy treat in my opinion.  I've tried the almond flavor, too, and they are great, but peanut butter is my favorite flavor in anything.  The fact that these are high in protein, filling and gluten free is fabulous. I'll buy these again for sure!

This is a problem with me My alergy is so bad the least bit of contamination by wheat could cause me to have a relaps. Now so saying the chance of contamination may be slight. I can't risk it and and anyone with a Gluton alergy should be made aware of the chance no matter how slight.  Other than that the product is good.

The flavor is pure deep natural lemon, tart and bright, with a sweet creamy finish--nothing like any other lemon-flavored cookie I've ever bought.  Honestly, these are just terrific little cookies.<br /><br />And when we thought it couldn't get better, we tried the chocolate.  Natural, dense, delicious, dark chocolate taste.<br /><br />We plowed through both bags just going back and forth: lemon, chocolate, lemon, chocolate....<br /><br />No gross artificial taste.  No waxy texture to the cream.  No meek, bland flavors.  Just all-natural goodness that will blow your socks off.<br /><br />Time for another bag.

While I ordered only one box of them the first time, I will be ordering two boxes the next time--I have a friend and her husband who also enjoy puckering up!  Try them, you will love them!

review/text: These wafers need to come with a big warning "Addictive"! It takes a lot of self control to stop eating them.  If I did not exercise a lot of self control I would eat a whole bag. Wafers come in a resealable bag, and in theory can last a long time... but in my house the longest one bag lasted was 2 days!<br /><br />I bought the lemon flavor of Loacker's Quadratini wafers. They have a nice strong lemon flavor - nicely tart with a sweet creamy finish, crunchy and pleasant on your tongue. You can chew a wafer to get the pleasant crunch on just hold it in your mouth and let it melt slowly.  Either way you will get an extra ordinary taste experience!<br /><br />I am attaching a photo and two cookies shown from different angles.  Each cookie is 1 inch square. Each consists of 74% lemon cream and 26% wafer.<br /><br />Wafers have no artificial flavors or colorants, and no preservatives.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Unbleached wheat flour, pressed coconut oil, glucose syrup, sugar, whey powder (milk), dextrose, soy flour, barley malt extract, lemon juice powder 2%, salt, leavening agents (sodium hydrogen cargonate, disodium diphosphate), emulsifier soy lecithin, natural vanilla pods, lemon-peel-oil, spices.<br /><br />Loacker wafers are made in Austria and Loackers company had been known for their wafers since 1925.<br /><br />Ohhhh, so good!

review/text: I opened the box when I had two friends visiting!  They went home with at least two packages each as they were having weekend guests.  I still have a bunch.  They were a hit. They are so fresh and so satisfying. I just ordered the chocolate ones for next time.  I plan never to be without them.  I want them on the tea table always.  Trust me.  Read the label - they are great.<br /><br />So, I am adding to the review!  The two friends who were here when the cookies arrived,  I had shared some of the cookies with them  raved about the cookies, wanted to know where I got them and are ordering them.  One had a house full of guests and I had given her 2 sacks, knowing she was having Pumpkin Festival guests - she said they all want these cookies.  I think they are all natural products so that helps.  I have the chocolate ones in my shopping cart but am holding off as I am eating too many,  I ate - alone - one sack on the weekend.  I dare not open more this week.  You have to try these.  I am sure I did not dream about them.  They are not too sweet.  I think you can read the ingredients.  Great for people with braces.  Sigh!<br /><br />OKAY, OKAY, OKAY - I AM BACK TO ADD ON . . . I just bought the dark Chocolate - I don't even like dark Chocolate so I chose that as friends will like them for dessert and I won't be tempted (fat chance) to eat them.  I know I will.  These are the best cookies ever and my lemon ones went so fast.  You will love these cookies!

review/summary: Yummo!
review/text: These wafers are PHENOMENAL! They are creamy, not too sweet (I had the regular chocolate ones) and perfect for whether you want just a few or a bunch. They are light and have a lovely texture. I bought these at World Market.

review/summary: Super delectable!
review/text: These little Loacker Quadratinis are delicious - in ANY flavor!!  Some flavors are hard to find (or to nab on Amazon, since they sell so quickly!) but you will never be disappointed by these perfectly bite-sized pieces of chocolate, or lemon, or tiramisu, or (my fave) hazelnut!!  You will be hooked on them!!  The only trouble you will have is knowing WHEN to STOP eating them!!  I LOVE THEM!! And I keep coming back to Amazon for more, as they have the very best price for the Loacker offerings!!

review/summary: Simply the best wafers ever!!!!
review/text: These are the best wafers I have EVER tasted. I have a sweet tooth and traveled the world (so I have tried many sweets) but nothing compares to these wafers.<br />Also there is one other flavour Amazon does not seem to sell and that is the coconut wafers. Absolutely unbelievable taste and this is an understatement. It has the perfect combination of sweetness, flavor, size and once you start eating it you cannot stop.<br /><br />My favorite are Tiramisu, Lemon, Hazelnut and Coconut. The rest are fantastic too but I have my own I like the best. Italian products - cannot improve on perfect.<br /><br />Watch your waist line though  :P

review/summary: love this flavor
review/text: I fell in love with the lemon flavor immediately I put it in my mouth. it's a perfect combination of sour taste with cream and sugar. I always eat chocolate, tiramisu, coffee..flavor, this is the first time I tred lemon, absolutely great. And if you put it in milk with cold cereal together with banana slices, perfect!

review/text: I love these little wafer cookies. They are wonderful. Great flavor, delicate crunch, and knowing that it's natural and nothing in it is genetically modified makes snacking feel better.

review/summary: Best cookies ever!
review/text: I love these cookies and they are difficult to find in most groceries stores. I was so thrilled when I discovered that I could order eight bags at a time through Amazon.com. They arrived quickly and in good shape! None were crushed. Now I can have my cookies and eat them whenever. I often give a bag as a thank you gift to friends. Then they become addicted too.

review/summary: WOW GREAT!!!
review/text: I actually was in San Francisco when I first tried these wafers. I fell in love with them instantly. When I got home I tried hopelessly  to find them in my area, with no luck at all. Thank goodness for AMAZON I now can enjoy them without having to drive almost 5 hours to San Francisco. And if I may add very reasonally priced. They are not overpowering with the amount of sugar other wafers have but yet are so delicious. I can't wait to try them once again.

review/text: These little wafers are yummy! My kids love them and they're a good treat to have around the house for something small. Pour them into a bowl when you have company-- you won't have any left! I like them with tea. As another reviewer stated, they're not quite as sweet as what I'm used to, but they're creamier. Yum!

review/text: i grew up in italy and loved these wafer cookies... i had almost forgot how good they were. then i decided to order some just to refresh my memories and ended up eating 4 out of the 8 bags in less than a 24 hour period (i did have some help). everybody that tried them asked me where i got them.i bought the hazelnut ones and i think that hazelnut is such a better choice to combine with chocolate and cookies than peanuts like they do here in the states. i wanted my friends to try different flavors so i ordered tiramisu, vanilla and lemon.....i see they have an option to deliver them ever month or two but i think they should deliver them weekly. lol.

review/summary: Loacker Quadratini Hazelnut Wafers
review/text: I have to say I was looking forward to getting my favorite cookie, without paying the local $4.89 per package.  I always buy from Amazon whenever the price is right, and they have what I want.  The packages of wafers came as expected, however when I got them, one package had it's seam split and wafers throughout the box and they were less then fresh.  The other packages appeared to have gotten excessively warm as the wafers had slid off of each other, causing a "slanted' wafer.  Not the upright wafer cookie I expected.  All in all, I will take a second look before I buy eatable items from Amazon.
