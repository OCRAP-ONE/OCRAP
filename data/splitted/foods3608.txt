review/summary: This makes a great sprouting bag, too.
review/text: I ordered a sprout bag made of hemp and this nut milk bag. I received this bag first, and not paying much attention, I sprouted soft wheat berries in it. AWESOME! I sprouted in the hemp bad as well but the sprouting went more than a day faster in this bag. I am ordering another one so I can use it to make nut milk!

review/summary: May be new, but not improved.
review/text: The bags were advertised as New & Improved... they are new (different from previous), but not improved at all. The material seems thinner, which would not be a problem except that these bags allow pulp to squeeze through. This happened from the start, with pulp coming through any part of the bag (loose weaving?), and has gotten worse as the bag's seams began to fray or separate. The earlier bag we bought went through much use before having any leak problems, and only at the seams. Very disappointed.

review/text: This bag has made making almond milk so easy.  I was going to try other methods until I found this bag and I'm so glad I took the chance.  I just let it hang down from one of my cupboard handles, set a container below it and pour the milk in.  Then just let it sit to all the milk has drained through.  Easy to clean too!

review/text: I use this nut milk bag to make almond milk and it works very well. I strain the blended mixture though the nut bag and it is very smooth leaving all the impurities in the bag. I am sure you can use this milk bag as a cheesecloth as well. It was very easy to clean although the top part where the string is attached is a bit weak. If used correctly this nut bag can last awhile.

review/text: After I first used this bag I wondered how I ever bothered making nut milk before. The process is so much easier and effective now! Through this bag I am able to squeeze out more "nut" which results in a much richer tasting milk. Furthermore I am done in about 3 minutes, as opposed to approx. 10 minutes it used to take me to hand press through a regular kitchen sieve.<br /><br />So, yep, very happy I bought this!

review/summary: Best bag out there!!
review/text: I purchased this bag over a year ago to strain the foamy pulp that was too large to strain through the initial strainer placed over my juicing receptacle bowl. I simply place that strainer in this bag and with a spoon scoop out the foamy sediment into the bag.I twist and wring the bag and pour the resulting juice in with my other filtered juice. It works wonderfully, you'd be surprised to see how, much juice is left in that foamy residue, often time as much as a half of a cup! This bag has very fine mesh holes so you get pure filtered juice.  It is not hard to clean if you dab a small bit of washing detergent on the bag and clean it immediately. Being lazy one day I let some vegetable pulp sit in the bag for a few days and needless to say I forever stained the bag and it also had an odd smell, so I threw the bag away.The bag is tough, dries easily and has very fine holes, BUY IT!! The bag is perfect, Im buying two more!!

I first tried a cheese cloth which was messy and took quite a long time for the juice to flow to the bottom.  I used the bag for the first time today and it took no time at all for the juice to flow.  I was simply mazed at how easy it was to clean the bag.<br /><br />Also, I was quite pleased with the speed in which RawFoods mailed the product.  Very fast.

review/text: I love almond milk. I hate straining it through cheesecloth. Cheesecloth is expensive, not reusable, most of the time not big enough to handle the amount of milk i want to make at one time, and because of those things, I stopped having fun making milk!<br /><br />This nut bag had changed my milk-making life.  Its so easy to use and strains out even tiny solids.  Starting to use it for my juices as well. Amazing.

review/text: I do have to say that I have a vitamix, too.  So, I am able to blend my almonds/coconut really well before pouring it into the nut milk bag.  It takes awhile to squeeze all the milk through (6-8 minutes), but it is worth it when it is done! The only thing is there is no instruction sheet that comes with the bag - or at least to my knowledge (maybe I unknowingly tossed it?).  So, search online for a recipe for nut milks.

review/text: Good grief, I love this nut milk bag. It works infinitely better than any other product I've used for making nut milks, straining "cheese", etc. Before, I had to struggle with the cheesecloth and it never worked very well. With the cheesecloth the nut pulp or whatever I was trying to strain would always squirt out the sides and lead to a mess on my countertop and frustration. But this nut milk bag strains everything so easily and without the mess. It also cleans up so easily by just rinsing with water. 5 stars! This product is well worth the cost and I think it will last me forever.

review/text: As the mom of a 7 year old daughter who is GFCF I know how hard it is to find good cookies!  These are great- we both love them!  They have a great texture- more like a butter cookie almost and taste wonderful!  No off taste from the flours, no gritty texture, and not sicky sweet- just right.  We tried these last summer on vacation and couldn't find them at home- then we found them on Amazon- try them- you won't be sorry!

review/summary: Tasty Satisfying Little Morsels
review/text: Have to eat GF?  Miss the nice crunch of a good cookie?  Buy these.  They are tasty.  Not too sweet.  Not bland.  Great with coffee.  Good texture.  You can bite into them and the whole cookie does not crumble.  And strangely enough they are quite satisfying.  I can eat 4 and stop, having no need to finish the entire box.<br /><br />I've purchased the "pack of 6" boxes and find that the cookies store quite well.  The last box tasted just as good as the first  box.

review/summary: Tasty!!
review/text: Both my husband and 3 year old have a gluten allergy. We have tried other products and found that these taste the best for animal crackers. It's not grainy or taste funny. Like another reviewer stated, it taste more like a butter cookie. Yummy! Not sure why anyone would rate it one star. I understand personal preference to taste and texture like one reviewer but the other reviewer just seemed to be on a rant. We have been pleased with this product and highly recommend it to others who are looking for a tasty gluten free snack.

review/summary: The only ones that My Darling will eat
review/text: My daughter is autistic and allergic to wheat. Texture is VERY important to her. These are crispy, sweet, and only a tiny bit chalky. This is the ONLY gluten-free cookie that she will eat. There's one brand in our health food store (don't know the brand, but it has a Danish crown logo on it) which she chewed and spit out. Kinnikinnick chocolate chip cookies are good, too.<br /><br />And these are about 2/3 the price of the health food store. BONUS!<br /><br />(But best of all is the brownies made with Gluten-Free Mama's Almond Blend flour. Mmm!)

review/summary: Scaly rash
review/text: My toddler has a known allergy to wheat, but not to rice or potato.  I would have thought from glancing over the ingredients that he would be fine with these cookies, but instead he was covered in a dry, scaly rash within 24 hours.  Sad because he loved them, but they're practically pure sugar, so what toddler wouldn't?  Gluten-free treats are often considered to be safe for kids with food allergies, but the truth is that if they're allergic to one thing, they're probably allergic to something else you don't even know about.  Maybe it's the potato because it's a nightshade, maybe it's the soy lecithin.  I don't know, but I wouldn't feed these to a child with known food allergies without keeping a watchful eye on them.  And why they would put soy in a food for those who are allergic to something else is beyond me, given that it's a top 8 allergen and I'm certain that ingredient is genetically modified.

review/summary: You'd never know they were allergy-free
review/text: I bought a box of these for my son from my local health food store, since he has multiple food allergies. I was really pleased to have found an animal cookie that he was able to eat. What I didn't expect was that they were going to be so good. Like other reviewers have mentioned, they taste like a shortbread cookie, and are really nice and crisp, but not grainy. We have started using them as a reward for potty-training, so the first box went pretty fast. I was glad to see Amazon carry them, so I quickly ordered a pack of 6 boxes. It seems like a lot of cookies, but I know we'll go through them. (Especially now, since I have started to steal a few!)

review/summary: great cookies
review/text: I bought these because we have chosen to put our son on a Gluten Free/ Casein Free diet. Animal Crackers are his favorite treat and these hit the spot.  He absolutely loves these cookies.  I find them to be a bit sweet, but I also don't eat a lot of sweet foods, so this could just be a personal taste issue.  As with any sweet item moderation is the key.  These cookies have helped to make the transition from a regular diet to a special diet easier for my child as they're something he really enjoys. I highly recommend these for those who need a special diet.

review/summary: Best for Gluten Free Rum Balls
review/text: When my husband was diagnosed gluten intolerant after years of misery, we thought that a holiday staple was gone forever.  He was thrilled when I made the first batch of GF rum balls he could eat after a two year dry spell.  Being adults, we don't eat them plain but if you want a perfect replacement for vanilla wafers in your rum balls these are just the ticket!<br /><br />Update - Well, now I'm on Gluten Free diet too and these are a life saver.  I dip one end of them in dark chocolate for a quick tea biscuit when I have company and they are a great nibble.  I discovered that the rum balls are just oh, so good too!

review/summary: not the best but a good value
review/text: I go through about a pound and a half of phoenix pearls a year.  I've purchased through local stores and over the net.  This is the only tea I've ever bought called "dragon phoenix pearls" that didn't have a jasmine flower in the center of the pearl.  I may be wrong but I thought the whole jasmine flower was necessary to be called a "dragon phoenix pearl".  Usually I get five or more infusions from each fresh load of tea.  This tea is washed out after three infusions.  That being said at the price this is a good jasmine tea.  The first couple of infusions are very flavorful.  And it was about the freshest tea I've ever purchased. It's up to you this may or may not technically be true "dragon phoenix pearls", but it is a very good jasmine tea for the price.

review/text: The item arrived very quickly, looks the way its supposed to, great packaging, but I was kind of hoping it'd taste like banana and it really doesn't. It tastes like some kind of "fruity" flavoring covered in sugar with a slight sourness to it but no banana, just banana "coloring". It was still gummy which is an improvement from the usual gummy candy sellers who sell you hard gummy candy, but like I said, I was expecting banana flavored gummy candy.

review/summary: A Visit to the Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/summary: Taste great but just don't drink it everyday
review/text: I recommend mixing these stix in a water bottle that is not empty. If you mix it in an empty water bottle with a little water left at the bottom the powder will clump up. As you fill it to the top it will be a little difficult to dissolve the remaining clumps at the bottom. It may take you a few minutes to shake the clumps and get it dissolved. It's better if you just fill the water bottle up first and then drop in your mix stick. Other than that the flavor taste almost as good as the canned version with the exception of the splenda taste. Some people can get used to the splenda taste but my taste buds get tired of the taste after a while. I prefer real sugar over a substitute. My brother complained that it tasted awful because of the splenda. It takes a while to get used to the splenda so I suggest you not buy it if you hate splenda. I think the splenda is the killer part of this mix drink.

review/summary: Delicious & Great for Dieters!
review/text: I found this for my husband who, as a Health Coach, was endeavoring to find a product that he could recommend to his clients to help them drink more water as part of the program of losing weight through Take Shape for Life ([...]).  Water, in all its glory and beauty, can become hum-drum after awhile, especially if you're used to drinking flavored drinks.  Unless you really enjoy the taste of water (like I do), it's nice to "spice" it up after awhile, right?  We stay away from products that have high fructose corn syrup in it, and that's what I like so much about the Arizona brand.  They use sucralose instead.  The taste of the Lemon Iced Tea is really good, especially if the water is chilled, and all his clients, especially the ones with a sweet tooth, think it's great.  My husband liked it so much that we do the Subscribe & Save program that Amazon offers!  So, that should tell you something about the product...it rocks!

But it was hard to find replacements for the foods I enjoyed. Coming from the South and being raised on sweet iced tea, I was delighted to discover Super-Free Arizona Lemon Iced-Tea packets. I take them everywhere I go (even overseas) and thoroughly enjoy the taste. I've tried other brands but don't want to use Aspartame and Stevia seems to have an aftertaste. Unlike others, I don't tire of the taste. Thanks AZ Teas!

review/summary: LOVE THIS TEA
review/text: I hate plain water and I hate powders that contain aspartame....those particular mixes leave a really bad aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />WELL...this particular iced tea is sweetened with SPLENDA, leaves no bad aftertaste, and is really sweet!  I loved it so much, I purchased with subscribe and save and it's cheaper than buying it in stores (if you can find it in stores).  I've stopped subscribe and save on this product though because I've switched to Mio, which lasts longer so saves me more money in the long run....either way, if you are like me and you don't like to drink plain water, or you like adding flavor to your water, this is a great product.

review/summary: Really good ICED tea
review/text: I have tried nearly every inced tea drink mix out there, sugar free and not sugar free. (Crystal Light, Lipton, 4C, and store brands such as Target)<br />Most sugared iced tea drink mixes are too sweet for my tastes as I do not drink brewed teas with any sweetener.<br />I prefer the splenda sweetened inced tea mixes over the aspartame, as it does not mess with my body as much and I refuse to drink anything with High Fructose Corn syrup any more.<br /><br />I started out with the 4C iced tea mix several years ago because I found it at a local Walmart, but they stopped carrying it. Then my local Target had their Market Pantry version of iced tea with splenda, it was good but did not dissolve well and they stopped carrying it. I tried going back to 4C purchasing it through their website, but it is almost cost prohibitive for someone who wants to drink iced tea daily.<br /><br />I tried the Lipton and it just tasted odd to me, more chemically contrived than tea flavored. I was not impressed. Yet I will drink the sugar sweetened Pure Leaf version in the glass bottles.<br /><br />After scouring the internet for a less expensive alternative, I found the Arizona brand. Since I was skeptic I read about it on the Arizona website, read product reviews here and I ordered it. Since I am a Prime customer I had it in two days, and much to my delight, it tastes great. I suspect it would be even better if I had access to ice in my house because I like my tea, slightly more diluted, but it tastes great as it is. I am impressed.<br />Both the stix and the cups dissolve well. The stix to not leave a sticky mess at the top of a bottle when you put the mix in 16.9oz bottle like so many mixes do. With the cups, I pour water in half way a bottle, put in the mix, shake it then add more water and shake again.<br /><br />I like this product and will buy it again as it does not break the budget and tastes great.

There was enough to feed a few people, and the arrival on July 3 - very prompt delivery - ended up being part of the holiday picnic.  Every single item was very much enjoyed, and I got a lot of heartfelt thank yous for the gift.  On my list to get again (I think I need one now).

review/summary: Excellent Gum!
review/text: The flavor is excellent and it last a long time, longer than most gums.  I am a huge fan of the Trident Splash gum, but the only flavor sold in stores in my area is the Strawberry with Lime, so it's nice to have a different flavor.  Yes, the price is high for gum considering it only cost me around $2 for a 3-pack of the Strawberry with Lime gum in local stores, but I was willing to pay a higher price to get something I desired and it was worth the cost.

review/summary: Beef Straganoff
review/text: January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.

review/summary: Man.... I Love Frazzles. Bacon-Flavored (But Suitable for Vegetarians!)
review/text: Frazzles are little crispy-bacon-flavored bites of crunchy corn goodness that must be laced with, I don't know, crack or something. I don't know how else to explain how addictive they are. I mean... bacon! And... NOT ONLY bacon, but they are actually entirely suitable for vegetarians (not that I am one), thus providing a useful public service in that they enable non-meat-eaters who secretly crave bacon every minute of every waking (and even sleeping) hour to get a harmless pork-fix without going near a single meat product. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />Silliness aside, these really are very, very good and are one of those rare childhood staples that honestly taste every bit as good when eaten as an adult as you remember them tasting when scarfed down in the playground in the eighties. For anyone who's never tried Frazzles, I'd describe them as being a bit like Sun Chips if Sun Chips came in crispy bacon flavor... only less healthy-grainy and a bit lighter-textured.<br /><br />Of course, if you're buying on Amazon from British Corner Shop, you may need to order enough of these (and other British goodies) to stock your OWN corner shop just to avoid the shipping costs being prohibitively expensive, but if you can overcome that hurdle, you really can't go wrong in ordering a caseload of Frazzles and stocking up for the next year or several. Just be prepared to find you eat them MUCH faster than you anticipated, because, as I mentioned above, they have definite addictive properties!

review/summary: good gluten free product for my daughter
review/text: My 7 year old has to maintain a gluten free diet due to celiac disease. Before we discovered she had Celiac, she frequently ate boxed mac and cheese products.  She has really missed this type of product since going gluten free.  We tried several gluten free mac and cheese products and she hasn't really liked most of them.  we gave this one a try and really likes it.  The pasta is a potato pasta, which seems much better than the corn pastas we have tried.  She has had this several times and enjoys it.  Simple to make - just cook the pasta and add milk and butter, similar to 'standard' boxed mac and cheese.  Will continue to buy these for her.

review/summary: The missing ABBA-ZABA
review/text: This is a candy bar from my childhood.  I haven't seen it in a store for 30 yrs; though, every road trip I went on, I would always check the candy rack at every gas station we visited. Don't quite remember how I found it on Amazon, but I had to order some.<br /><br />I found an updated way of enjoying them.  If you put it in the microwave for 10 sec, you can eat it w/o pulling your fillings out. This box seemed a little harder than I remember so I was looking for a way to freshen them up.<br /><br />I grudgingly shared my stash w/ my sister and my mom since they too have been deprived for the last 30 yrs.  However, I have the rest of them hidden in my closet. I figure if my husband has never known what they are he doesn't need to be introduced to this allusive candy.  That way the rest are mine.<br /><br />They were delivered very quickly. I can't rule out that they may be a little old b/c they were so hard but this good be my inacurate memory from how they were when I was a child. Regardless, it is fixed by 10 sec in the microwave.  I just wonder where they are distributed b/c it sure isn't in the South.  No matter!! I can now find them on Amazon!!

review/summary: Perfect Popcorn
review/text: The Pop Secret Homestyle microwave popcorn is my absolute favorite.  When I think of popcorn, this is the standard against which I measure all other popcorn. Very buttery tasting without tasting fake or weighing down the fluffy goodness of the popped corn, with just enough salt.  For anyone who wants a rich popcorn-butter flavor, for movie watching or just a quick snack, buy Pop Secret Homestyle. I've tried their other flavors, and some other brands and this is the most to my liking.  (If you're going for sweet like kettlecorn, this is not that flavor.)<br /><br />The 1.75oz snack size size is just right for 1-2 people.  It pops in my microwave in 1:55, and only if I let the packs get old do I get more than  4-6 unpopped kernels.  I almost never bought the "regular" sized bags because they were too huge for anything but a party.  I almost always keep the snack sized packs on hand.  I'm hoping they know how much I love this and keep making it, and sizing it right, for a good long time.

review/summary: A Tisket, A Tasket, Gift A Gourmet Basket
review/text: Art of Appreciation Gift Basket service truly has their art mastered. The basket I ordered and had sent to friends - several states away - was received with quite some delight. I was told it was beautifully created and carefully packaged. All the items described on the sales page were included and were an excellent quality as well as "alot of stuff" as my friend said. As I spoke with her on the phone - and she was sampling the goods - I could hear many "mmms" and was assured there were some delicious treats. The note card that I was able to fill out at the time I placed my ordered was included as well.<br /><br />I ordered this on 11/22 and it was delivered on 12/3.It shipped on 11/24. Taking into consideration the Thanksgiving weekend in between, I thought that was pretty good. Through my order page I was able to track the package. I think this would make a fabulous and thoughtful gift for the holidays, birthdays, thank-you's or just to add a little cheer for good friends and family far away.There are many selections of gift baskets so you can choose the one that would be most personal to your recipients. Be sure to order in plenty of time; I would give at least 10 days(with the standard shipping),probably more during this season.<br /><br />I thought the price was very reasonable for what is included in this gourmet basket prepared and wrapped, and this one was eligible on it's own for the "free super-saving" shipping at this time(although there are options for faster delivery methods.) So I was able to include it in the rest of my Amazon order even though it was going to a different address. With that option it was delivered through US Postal Service.<br /><br />The basket I sent was the "Fruitful Harvest Gourmet Food and Snacks Gift Basket" and included:crunch Smoked Almonds, Marrianna's Dried Fruit Medley, Foccacia Crisp Crackers, Cheddar Cheese Spread, Spiced Apple Cidar Mix, warming Ahmed English Tea, creamy Caramels and Cashew Crunch Snack Mix.<br /><br />Sure beats standing on line at the Post Office at this time of year.<br />Happy Holidays to all....Laurie
