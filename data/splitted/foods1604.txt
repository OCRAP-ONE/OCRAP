review/summary: Good, healthy option, but my cat does not like them
review/text: I bought these as a healthier option for my cat's treats, but she won't even touch them. She does however like the chicken flavor of the same brand. If you have a finicky cat, you might want to try the other flavor.

review/summary: Even the pickiest cats will like these!
review/text: My cat does not like any cat treats.  We have tried every single one!  We purchased these treats at an SPCA benefit and tried them.  The cat LOVES them.  She will chase them around the house and savor them.  They seem siliar in consistency (and smell) to the Bil-Jac treats for dogs (although they aren't the same thing).  I think the meatiness of the treat is what my cat likes ... not a lot of fluff.

review/summary: Human interpretation of cat behavior or yummy in my cat tummy
review/text: How does one know what exactly the cat thinks of these?  I can only go by observation and 2 out of 3 cats go nuts for them, i.e. begging, meowing, jumping, meowing, circling, meowing.  I was worried they were too hard as I can hardly break one in half, but that doesn't slow them down - even my 11-year-old tabby.  The taste must outweigh the gnawing and smacking necessary.  More proof: a side-by-side taste test revealed both cats will choose these first before Whisker Lickin's brand treats.  But of course they will hog down the 2nd place treats in a blink too.  I gave a 4 star since I do think they are rather hard.  I also appreciate the free shipping. I will order again.

review/summary: **Real** Macaroni Just Like Grandma's!
review/text: Are you hankering for your mom's or grandmother's macaroni and cheese but need to eat gluten-free?  If so, this is the pasta for you.  It's been a staple in my GF kitchen for YEARS. It cooks up like a dream and tastes like the "real thing".  You won't be able to tell it from "regular" elbow macaroni.  Just make sure not to cook it much past "al dente" -- add a drop of oil to the boiling water (I use olive oil) -- and give your pasta a cold water rinse when you've reached perfect done-ness.

review/summary: Best price for DeBoles corn elbows
review/text: Corn pasta is great in some dishes, especially macaroni and cheese. (It does have its own flavor.) Cook elbows,but not too long or they will get mushy. Add some type of "Velveeta"-tpye cheese and sharp white shredded cheddar. You'll never taste any better, with or without gluten! Mac & cheese is the whole reason we buy the corn pasta at all. It works great with cheddar. We usually use rice pastas, but the price on Amazon was even lower than what we pay for Tinkyada pastas. For us the 12-pack will never go to waste. We both can eat all the mac & cheese we want now, instead of saving it for only special occaisions because of price (and I'm not celiac).<br />It is GF, has no MSG or related products, no aspartates.

review/summary: Great product for the gluten free diet
review/text: We have purchased many gluten free products for my husband, who suffers from gluten alergies.  Most have tasted like sand, being very gritty and bland.  Deboles is one of the best!  All of their corn products have a great consistency and taste.  Purchasing through Amazon is the best deal around.  Yes, you have to purchase in packs of 12, but the price makes it worth it.  Our son has a 15% chance of developing the same allergy.  Therefore, we cut out as much gluten from his diet as possible.  This is an inexpensive way to get him on the right course.

review/text: I use Deboles Corn Elbows in all the recipes I liked before I discovered I was gluten-intolerant and I can hardly tell the difference.  Cook six minutes, no more, to retain just the right degree of firmness.  One of our favorite dishes is a casserole made with Deboles Corn Elbows.  It contains ground beef, chopped onion, chopped green pepper, whole tomatoes and tomato sauce, cheese, oregano and garlic salt.  I was pleased to find Deboles Corn Elbows retains its firmness if there's any left over for the next meal.  We like it so well we subscribed to regular shipments in bulk.

review/summary: It tastes like corn.  It's also not gluten free, as of this writing.
review/text: This has a really good texture; whether you like it or not will depend on how sensitive you are to how things taste--this tastes like corn.  If you're cooking something like beef stroganoff, it's a plus that this tastes like corn. However, with tomato sauce, it's not a good combination.<br /><br />The other thing about this, is if you're eating it because you have celiac, you should be aware that there may be cross-contamination issues.  Deboles' pasta is made in a factory that also processes wheat pastas.  (And there are those with celiac who are convinced this pasta makes them sick.)  So, if avoiding gluten is really important, get Tinkyada rice pasta instead.<br /><br />Edit:  I did a challenge on this, meaning I ate only this pasta for a day.  It's not gluten free.  Note that this is a subsidiary of Hain Food Group, which, when the new FDA standard on gluten free labeling came in--20ppm or less--stopped labeling its foods with small amounts of barley and slapped on a gluten-free label--and then just waited for celiacs to get sick and get mad at them.  FDA, are you listening?

I was underwhelmed by the results of using this oil; a little goes a long way but it basically coats your hair.<br /><br />I don't consider mineral oil a "nourishing" property. This oil only gave my hair some sheen. I csn't say it contributed to the overall health of my hair any and it definitely didn't diminish the winter breakage. I feel better adding a little extra virgin olive oil to my hair conditioner. That yields far better results.

review/text: Dabur Vatika Olive Enriched Hair Oil contains Virgin Olive Oil and nourishing extracts of Almonds, Cactus & Lemon. Vatika's unique formulation ensures deeper oil penetration to give your hair and scalp complete natural nourishment for problem free, beautiful hair.<br /><br />I love using Olive Oil on my hair since I started going natural. Olive Oil keep my hair and scalp moisturized. It's great for pre shampoo treatment overnight or at least an hour before washing. Add the olive oil to your hair then cover with a plastic cap or plastic bag, the longer you leave the oil in the more moisture your hair with have especially if your washing with shampoo and not co-washing. It's also great as an added ingredient for a protein treatment. A can of coconut milk and 3 cap fulls of olive oil, mix, distribute to hair, leave in for an hour, then wash out. Try not to deep condition with heat after the protein treatment, it will cause breakage... sitting out for an hour doing chores or under the sun will help the conditioner.<br /><br />Olive oil is very beneficial and you will love how your hair look and feel after every use of this product. I use it so much that I purchase 3 or more at once, I can't see myself with it. While waiting when I'm out I also use GOYA cooking olive oil... it's all the same.<br /><br />Will definitely recommend this product!

review/summary: Flavorful, but not the same as in restaurants
review/text: My wife bought this in the hopes of recreating one of our favorite dishes at home since making butter chicken from scratch seems to be a very involved process.  While this product has a good taste, it is not a substitute for restaurant style butter chicken.  Also, the preparation was not as easy as the package instructions elude to.  The product is a spice/ oil mix that is to be wisked with water until it is smooth.  This never turned into a smooth paste for us; it did not dissolve in the water and pressing the product against the sides of the bowl was the only way for it to eventually mix with the water.  She even had to strain the water mixture to make sure there weren't clumps of spice mix in the sauce before adding the mixture to the browned chicken.<br /><br />We will not be buying this again mostly because it is not to our taste.  But, if you like flavorful chicken with a little bit of work, this is a quick meal preparation.

review/summary: Yummy - indian cooking simplified
review/text: This paste is wonderful - bought at our local Inidan grocer for $4.99 so this is a good deal on Amazon for anyone not in a Indian grocery store area.  You can save tons of time not having to get out all your spices, morter and pestle, etc.  We find that if we just stir-fry with a little extra oil, some onions, maybe a little slice of fresh ginger, then mix in vegetables and meat (chicken needs to be cooked/browned separately however), some water if necessary for veges, and you soon have a dish you swear someone from India prepared for you.  Tonight we had this sauce cooked with beef, mixed in cauliflower, diced up idaho potatoes, carrots slices, onions, and it was delicous.  Served with some frozen naan from Trader Joes that heats up in toaster oven in just a few minutes, along with basmati rice - browned first then add 3 cups of water to 1 cup of basmati rice and cover for 25 minutes or until scattered holes.  What a great meal and this paste is an amazing time saver.  This is the way to go.  I was just thinking of how I wished I had discovered this paste when I first discovered that I loved Indian food when I lived in NYC in my early 20's in grad school.  If only I had know the tricks such as using a paste like this, I would be making indian food at my apartment all the time.  Back then I lived in the east village and walked over (just 4 blocks away) to the famous 6th street Indian restaurants of the several times per week.  When I moved to SF, I lived luckily just a block from Shalimar for many years and was a regular customer.  Now, I'm in suburbs with kids so for indian cooking, I now use 1,000 Indian Recipes by Neelam Batra - which I call my "Joy of Cooking for Indian Food" - it has everything.  Buy this paste, along with the Vindaloo and Biryani sauce, and you'll be glad you did.  My 3 year old girl just looked at me, eating some of the cut up beef cooked in this sauce, announcing "This is good"!  Now that's a winner.

review/summary: Some like it hot
review/text: Yes, if you like Indian food, you will likely find this very good.  There is a distinct cinnamon aroma and taste to the curry, and it's quite spicy.<br /><br />Preparation is fairly simple--just throw some onions, chicken, and chopped tomatoes in a pan, and add only THREE tablespoons plus some water.  Simple and fast, although if you want the curry to thicken properly you may want to cook it a little longer.<br /><br />Since you use only a few tablespoons this jar will last quite a long time.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: Another way to cook with the paste is to make it like a paella. Using a large skillet with a cover, you can saute veggies (e.g., onions, garlic, red pepper, celery, carrots or any combo thereof), add in some boneless chicken breast (or fish) cut bite-size. Then add in the paste and stir to spread it, and possibly some canned diced tomatoes. Add rice with enough water to cook it. Basmati works well. Stir occasionally to spread the mixture evenly and so the rice doesn't stick and you'll have a wonderful dish!

review/summary: SO MUCH EXPECTATION, SO LITTLE STOCK
review/text: ~ I got this after hearing how someone else liked it so much, then when I got it I realized I had gotten duuped again. Having previously vowed to never eat canned products from old favorite brands, like Campbells that changed their traditional recipes, & this was one.<br />~ I opened the can & saw how watery, salty, & unordinarily yellow it was, which eventually turned out to be the exorbitant amount of MSG.<br />~ After measuring the amount of stock & dumplings, by the frequency in spoonfuls, I found them lacking, whereas every spoonful was not with a chicken chunk or a dumpling. The so called chicken chunks were like little taste sizes & coming up only after maybe 5 spoonfuls of strong watery MSG, as well as the dumplings which were at largest the size of a pinkie digitalis and only coming up less frequently than the chicken bits.<br />~ HOW I GOT OVER IT:<br />~ When it comes to MSG I know my chemistry & I also know that sugar beet juice will neutralize it, as well as it's carcinogenic effects. (So I added enough for no more salty MSG taste or it's after effects).<br />~ I also add a can of mixed vegetables to make up for the lack there of, then add some mayonaisse for creaminess<br />~ Yes, you may also add more chicken & dumplings. LOL<br /><br />~ Campbell has permanently lost a loyal customer in me by joining the long list of food makers that cheat on taste & quality when it comes to traditional food products.

review/summary: delicious
review/text: I love (nearly) all things coconut and this tea is no exception. First, the scent of this tea is phenomenal. When I received it, I opened the box and just kept sniffing the tea. It is heavenly. When I was finally able to pull my nose out of the bag, I made a cup and the earth stopped moving, all my troubles melted away and I was filled with a coconut induced happiness.<br /><br />The flavor is incredibly smooth. Each day, after drinking this tea, I look at my other teas and say "maybe I will resume drinking them tomorrow." I cannot resume drinking them because I enjoy this tea so much and the other teas pale in comparison. I occasionally add a little agave but I find the coconut flakes add a natural touch of sweetness to this brew.<br /><br />All of the packaging for this tea is eco-friendly.  So you get a deliciously crafted tea from a company that is earth friendly.  Highly recommended.

review/text: Where to start?  This tea leaves are beautifully fragrant- but not overwhelmingly so.  Whenever you open the bag, you get a good waft of coconut, but it's not enough to make you separate it from your other teas.  The tea itself tastes very nice.  I'm usually horrible about sugar in my tea and add too much of it, but this tea was beautiful on its own.  It's a little strong, but then black tea is, and the coconut flavor was definitely present.<br /><br />I would buy this tea again, and I WILL as soon as I run out, which will be soon.  All of my friends have been stopping by for a cup!

When i opened the box i could immediately smell the coconut. I made a cup within the first 30 mins, some soy milk and a little agave nectar and i was in heaven. This tea is a real treat. After i finish this batch i plan on trying many many different blends from this company. It says it is best to transfer this tea to a tin box which i will invest in one now, that's the only draw back. I would recommend this to anyone.

That said, I might consider giving them these every once in a while, but they came crunchy and hard, not "soft-baked". My guess is that this is because they sat in a hot truck for who knows how long, so it's not the company's fault I guess. I wish delivery trucks were better insulated as this ruins a lot of food items I order that really should be refrigerated if they can't stand up to high heat.<br /><br />My dogs did like the cookies.

review/summary: Not bad for a canned mushroom
review/text: I've never had a canned mushroom that comes close to what a fresh `shroom tastes. The canning process really does a number on the texture, and dials down the taste big time. But, when time is tight and pizza is on the agenda, canned is the quickest option.<br /><br />I've been buying this brand at Sam's Club for a few months and have been pleased with them. The texture, like all canned mushrooms, is very soft, but this brand seems to taste a bit better than other canned brands I've tried. Plus, the pieces are mostly large.<br /><br />They won't hold a candle to fresh, and also take a back seat to a good quality dried mushroom, but for dishes where the mushroom is not the star (such as a pizza topping), these are not bad.

review/text: When I moved to the UK I was surprised to learn that Indian food (curries in particular) are the most popular foods in the country! I always assumed that British cuisine was all white and flavorless. I soon learned to make curries our family "leftovers" dinners! Patak's was the best and most popular brand of curry paste but I find it difficult to find in most American grocery stores. If you like curries, it's so much better to use Patak's pastes and sauces than it is to use powdered spices. You use the amount you like to make it as spicy as you like and the rest keeps in the refrigerator for a long, long time! I'm so glad to be able to get this via Amazon!

review/summary: Review of Patak's at Stuffed Ashes
review/text: A friend of ours served us  a chicken feast the other night and we were instantly impressed. It was incredibly tasty.<br />Upon inquiring how she marinated her chicken she said it was the easiest thing in the world.<br /><br />A few Tbsps of Patak's Tandoori Curry Paste and some plain yogurt was all it took.  A week later at the grocery store, I proceeded to find the paste for myself. I've seen the Patak's line many times, but never ventured to buy anything until now....<br />To read the full review please visit Stuffed Ashes :)

review/summary: Yummy Onions
review/text: I found these in my local market and thought I would try them. I have tried French's Onions before and they were disappointing. These however were just what I was looking for. I eat them straight from the container or use them as a garnish for soup. The only reason why I gave them four stars and not five is because they leave a layer of grease on the roof of your mouth. You don't notice if you eat them with something but as I said, I sneak some from the container from time to time.

review/summary: Beats the stink!
review/text: Having cats for most of my life (as in I remember litter that didn't clump being the only option that and actually letting your cat go where ever the cat went when you "gasp" let it outside) I am familiar with the woe of the litter box. However for something that literally gets defecated on and thrown out, litter is pretty pricey. Yet no one wants their house to have that "crazy cat lady" odor. I only have one cat but in my single days I had a LOT more (working at a vet will do that for you) and what type of litter to use, what was safest for your cat, what covered the smell, etc. has been an ongoing conundrum.<br />Also lugging the containers home is just such a pain. Unless you want to buy it once a week you have to carry at least 20 pounds from the car to the house.<br />Luckily Amazon and their wonderful Subscribe and Save program have simplified my life! Someone else does the lugging, I get the price break of buying the larger container so with the savings I can buy  the Arm & Hammer brand which is WAY better than cheaper or store brand litter. It's a win/win all around. As I write this I am less than 20 feet away from the litter boxes and I can't smell a thing!

review/summary: Product is great but new packaging by A&H is not
review/text: This cat litter is the best I have found.  I am a foreign service officer and use to purchase it while at my previous post.  I had extra boxes shipped to my next post and while that shipment arrived (6 months till I got settle at the next post) I purchased more cat litter for my cats.<br /><br />Now that I have settled at my new post and can look at the previous boxes and the new, I noticed two differences:  1) The new packaging no longer places the litter in a plastic bag inside the litter box; and 2) the box top now has a handle.  While the handle may make it easier to transport the box, not having a plastic bag holding the litter inside the box lets the litter spill out from the seams very easily.<br /><br />I love the product, but I will no longer purchase it while in this packaging because all five boxes I have purchased to arrive at my new post have arrived with the litter spilling out of the seams, making a mess of the mailroom as well as losing some of the product.  To clarify, this has nothing to do with the packaging Amazon does, it is from the manufacturer.

review/summary: Works
review/text: I've used about 3 boxes of this brand and find it works well. I've had no problems -it clumps well. Tracking isn't too bad and it does a great job at containing odors. That being said, the scent of this litter is quite over powering. Although the scent itself isn't bad, it might be a problem for those with a sensitive nose or are picky.<br /><br />I look forward to trying the unscented version if I can ever find it in-store. I really do like the packaging of this brand. There is a pour spout at one edge that makes things a lot easier.<br /><br />Arm & Hammer is worth a try and tends to be cheaper than brands such as Tidy Cats.

review/text: I bought this as a Subscribe and Save item. Even though it's more expensive here than at stores like Walmart, I was looking save the time and effort of buying and carrying around a 40 lb. box of cat litter. But when I opened the packaging, the Arm and Hammer box itself wasn't properly put together - there was a big gap where the bottom was glued together. A lot of the product had spilled out. Unless Arm and Hammer inproves its packaging, I won't be buying this item again.

review/summary: Low tracking litter; scoops easily
review/text: Can't go wrong with Arm & Hammer clumping cat litter products if that is what you are seeking.  This size box is a nice size, and works great for multiple cat households.  The product's smell is a bit strong initially, but it works well to cover the scents associated with urine, etc, and it works great at masking those types of odors before you can scoop it.  For the price offered on Amazon, it is a good deal.  Tracking for this is low although there will be some, but that is to be expected with any smaller clumping-type litter.

review/summary: Very convenient
review/text: Before I order anything online, I try to research as much as possible.  There were so many comments complaining about the packaging, stating that the litter was spilling out of the box when it arrived.  I was under the assumption that the Arm & Hammer box was shipped alone.  And that may be the case if shipped from another supplier, but I have a monthly subscription from Amazon. The 40lb litter box is placed in a different Amazon box before it ships.  Some of my litter spilled out too, but I just simply poured the 2 tablespoons back into the original box.  The subscription saves money and makes things so convenient, since it's delivered right to the door each month.  Then the shipping is free on top of all that.  Lifting 40lbs is no prob for me, but my girlfriend sure does appreciate the free delivery.<br />  Pertaining to the effectiveness of the litter......  I am a dog person, so being around cats is new to me.  I made my girlfriend try at least 10-12 different types of litter, and found that none of them work perfectly.  Arm & Hammer works for us since it meets most requirements better than others.  (masks odor better than any other I've tried, clumps well, inexpensive)  Then the subscription makes it so convenient.  This is a real unsolicited review....the type that I look for when I scan other reviews to help me make a decision.  I hope this helps someone.

I've tried every type of Arm & Hammer litter and while this type is good, I think I'm going to stick with the "Double Duty" (no pun intended) brand here:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U8Z436">Arm & Hammer Double Duty Clumping Litter, 40-Pound</a><br /><br />The Double Duty remains my favorite as far as longer-term odor control is concerned (as needed with any automatic litter box.)<br /><br />Average price without the hassle of lugging it around the store. Very satisfied with the manufacturer and Amazon's delivery options.

review/summary: Overpowering smell
review/text: I should have paid attention to the other reviews! I bought it because it is Arm & Hammer. But, this litter has such an overpowering smell. It's too much. Also, it makes so much dust that I choke when I am scooping litter. Every surface in my office (where I keep the litterbox) is covered with fine dust. I can't keep up with it. You have to wonder about the long-term affects of breathing that in, for both me & my cat.<br /><br />On the plus side, it does scoop well. It stays clean - no particles that have broken away, no slime on the edges from urinating at the side of the box. So, it lasts much longer than other brands.

review/summary: Arm&Hammer Multi-Cat Clumping Litter - the best I've seen on-line
review/text: Recently, our local supermarket closed.  The thing that bothered me most was that that supermarket had always carried the 40lb A&H Cat Litter for a highly reasonable price (it was under $15.00).  The other stores around here only sell small packages, which end up costing much much more.<br /><br />I went on-line and priced the Arm & Hammer Cat Litter - there were very low prices which had amazingly high shipping costs, and then, I remembered that I have Amazon Prime, so I went back to Amazon, and found my litter for a good bit more than what I was paying at my supermarket, but much less than any other place locally was charging, and, if we factor in that, with Amazon Prime, there are no shipping charges, the price was lower than any Internet source.<br /><br />I got the box in 2 days (just in time -- I couldn't get the cats to stop going while we waited for it)<br /><br />In short, we were very satisfied with the service from Amazon on this product which we like (unless we find a better price locally, we'll probably continue to buy from Amazon)

We have a relatively small dog who is still in his puppy stage, and the kibbles are the right size.  It is a bit pricier than the supermarket brands of dog foods, but we think our dog's health is worth the extra minor investment.

review/text: I have been using canidae for 5 years now along with nuvet vitamins  and it has been a wonderful product. After the ingredients change I have not noticed any sort of change in my siberian huskies what so ever. They still have high energy, very lush coats,white teeth and great done density. I am very happy with this product i have had no problems!

review/summary: My girl oves this food!
review/text: I am surprised at  a lot of the negative comments on Canidae. I have a 2 year old German Shepherd who is a picky eater and has sensitive skin.  I tired 4 other brands of food: Innova, Natural Balance, Taste of the Wild and Evo....all of which she scratches and bites herself constant.  With Canidae, she has a beautiful shinny coat, doesn't itch and she loves it!  It's amazing the difference.  Her stools sometimes are loose, but nothing to complain about or worry.  I'm not putting down those other foods, I'm just saying that this Canidae food has down wonders for her!  I've gotten wuite a few comments on her shinny coat.  Every dog is different and you just need to find a perfect dog food like I did for her.  We use the Chicken version on her.  If you on dog food analysis, you will notice it has a 5 star rating.  Jetta and I are both very happy with Candiae!!
