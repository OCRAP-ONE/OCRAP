review/summary: AMAZING and my dogs love it!
review/text: I raise red toy poodles. My first one was a boy who will be six next month and is the pickiest eater EVER!! The first 4 years, we tried at least 50 different kinds and I could NOT keep the weight on his little bones. Since switching to Halo, he's gained 2 pounds and is super healthy!! I feed my pregnant momma's and our 3-week old puppies Halo and again, they are super healthy! I love that I can pronounce every ingredient in the list! When I feed the canned, I can actually see peas and carrots and meat!  AMAZING!! even as a first food, puppy tummies digest it easily with no complications! I doubt I will ever feed anything else!

review/text: I ordered these for a themed birthday party for 6 year olds. I contacted the seller the same day I ordered them, because the arrival date did not look like it would be in time for my daughter's birthday party. Not only did the company personally call me back, but they shipped the product the same morning. The Bobas arrived a day early, and were absolutely the biggest hit at my daughter's party. They are delicious and kids just love them. I would highly, highly recommend this product and this company. I also found out that these do not need to be refrigerated until they are opened, so next time I will order them much earlier. Thanks!

review/text: This is a good product, but Amazon can't seem to figure out how to ship it.  In two shipments, I had four leaky milks.  On one hand, it may not be Silk Milk's fault--may be an Amazon shipping issue--but I still wouldn't recommend ordering this product because it may get to you leaking and unusable.  Also, the price keeps going up making it less worth it to order online.

review/summary: Very tasty, but not healthy or nutritious
review/text: Think of this as a candy/snack bar rather than a granola bar and you will not be disappointed. It's very sweet and tasty, but there's little or no nutritional value in here, despite being made from oats. The product is heavily processed and definitely what anyone would call healthy. Made with natural and artificial flavors, the ingredients list is very long (see bottom of review). It's loaded with sugar and not something you want to give yourself or your kids on a regular basis. Note how many times sugar or its variants appear in the list (glucose, fructose).<br /><br />Each bar is 1.23 oz. Daily value: Fiber 1g (5%), Vitamin A (0%), Vitamin C (0%), Calcium (10%), Iron (2%). 150 calories per bar (40 from fat), 11g of sugar. I'm giving the product 4 stars based on taste and texture. It's chewy, but not hard like Nature Valley granola bars.<br /><br />Ingredients: granola (whole grain rolled oats, whole grain rolled wheat, brown sugar, sunflower oil, high fructose corn syrup, dried coconut, honey, sodium bicarbonate, natural flavor, whey and whey protein concentrate), yogurt flavored coating (sugar, palm kernel and palm oil, whey protein concentrate, yogurt flavored powder, soy lecithin, natural flavor, artificial color, citric acid, salt), corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, brown rice crisp (whole grain brown rice, sugar, malted barley flour, salt), brown sugar, glycerin, vegetable shortening (canola oil, palm and palm kernel oils), corn flakes (milled corn, sugar, salt, malted barley extract), whey mineral concentrate, oat flour, rice flour, sweetened dried strawberries (glucose syrup, strawberries, high fructose corn syrup, modified potato starch, sodium alginate), corn syrup solids, sorbitol, salt, sugar, modified food starch, soy lecithin, natural flavor, malted barley flour, sodium bicarbonate, BHT (a preservative), citric acid, water.<br /><br />Made in Canada.

Not only do they look like the real thing, but you can actually snap them together and they taste great! They taste just like sweet tarts. I only ordered 1 lb bag of them, because it was my first time ordering them. I would suggest going for the 3 lb bag, because they went over so well. :) I definitely give these 5 stars!!

review/summary: Perfect Gift for a Gallbladder Patient!
review/text: My boyfriend had gallbladder surgery a month or so ago, and I knew he would be severely limited in what kind of food he could have post-op.  He's also been a fan of Legos since childhood.  I ordered a pound and hoped for the best.  The pieces are standard two by one pegs, two by twos, and two by threes.  Very few even showed mild chips, and all snap together for building.<br /><br />There are four flavors in the box:  Blue raspberry, green apple, cherry, and banana.  The flavors are on par with Sweet Tarts, as someone else mentioned.  Unfortunately, the banana kind of perfumes all the other blocks, so if you're really not into banana, this may not be the best candy.  Surprisingly, these are not excessively gritty like many Sweet Tart knockoffs.<br /><br />In this size bag, there's just enough for two people to play with and enjoy over a week. If you had a couple children, I'd recommend buying Ziplocs and dividing them that way.  A pound of this candy is roughly a filled quart-sized bag.<br /><br />Nutritionally, of course, the only thing this candy really has going for it is the fact is that it's low fat, which was one of the reasons I purchased it.  The chalky texture also insures you're not going to let it lie against your teeth to rot like a slicker, harder lollipop.<br /><br />I would absolutely buy this product again, though in this case for a child who has everything and whose mother doesn't want to have to put away another toy. ;)

review/summary: great tasting candy for Lego lovers!
review/text: We had a Lego party for my 7 year old and these candy blocks were a big hit with the children and adults.  Sometimes you need to sacrifice taste for 'cuteness' although not with this candy.  Not only did it taste close to 'Sweetarts' neither being excessively sweet or sour, it was very appealing visually and the kids loved playing/eating these candies.  I wish I had bought a larger amount as I only bought 1 bag not knowing how they tasted or their quality.

review/text: I bought this item as a stocking-stuffer for my daughters at Christmas. They came packaged in small plastic bags that looked like they had spent some time in a hobo's sock. There wasn't even a label on the bags, and they had a variety of small, obviously not designed, holes in them. Unfortunately I didn't open all my Amazon boxes until Christmas eve, so by the time I discovered their condition, I was forced to either not use them or put them in small plastic containers. I chose the small plastic containers, but Santa's credibility took a hit.<br /><br />The candies themselves are a bit stale, but otherwise OK. I decided to feed them to the girls to prepare their immune systems for any coming apocalypse.  Neat concept, but they obviously don't care about packaging.

review/summary: Best Dark Chocolate Chips
review/text: I love these chocolate chips.  They are the highest cocoa content chips that you can buy at a regular store.  Most other chips are in the 40-50% range.  They taste amazing whether you eat them plain or use them for cookies.  The only thing better is criollo chocolate which is significantly more expensive.<br /><br />The only downside is that they put a small amount of milk fat in them (1-2% of the content according to my telephone call to Ghirardelli), so they are not vegan. Otherwise they are a significant upgrade over the old Ghirardelli double chocolate chips which were around 54% cocoa.<br /><br />Occasionally a bag of chocolate chips will get grainy and taste bad.  I'm not sure if this is due to shipping or storing it in a place that is too warm (or too cold). Fortunately, in my experience this is rare.  This has happened when I tried ordering 3.5 pound bags of these chips. That is unfortunate as buying the 3.5 pound bags can be 30% cheaper.<br /><br />In supermarkets, as of 2010, these retail for around $3.50 per bag.

Companies will do this until we consumers step up and refuse to do business with companies that cheat.  Shame on you Ghirardelli!

I would like to commend Ghirardelli for being the first chocolate company to offer a beautiful fruity, tangy, yet richly rounded chocolate flavor at it's deserved bittersweet cocoa content to the average consumer using the average grocery store. I can even find these at some Targets! I was so impressed and relieved to finally find a useful size of chocolate, with an all-around excellent profile in a truly affordable package! (note to bakers- why pay 4 dollars for a 4 oz baking bar when you can pay 4 dollars for an 11.5 oz bag of the SAME CHOCOLATE)What's more, this chocolate is MUCH better than any expensive Callebaut, Cacao Barry, or Scharffen Berger chocolate at equivalent cacao mass.<br />HOWEVER, Ghirardelli has really disapointed me as of late. I used to use these almost exclusively for the NY Times Jacques Torres Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe, the BEST out there, which requires a specifically large and flat shape in the chocolate chip used (feve). Ghirardelli USED to offer this shape, WITHOUT milk fat, and it was the PERFECT size and shape, and melted beautifully into my ideal chocolate chip cookies. NOW they've made an ugly, NORMAL chip shape that is stiffer when melting and totally RUINS my perfect Jacques Torres cookie dreams.<br />GHIRARDELLI!! WHY ON EARTH DID YOU CHANGE YOUR CHOCOLATE CHIPS???????

review/summary: i wish it came out of the tap like this
review/text: This water has pretty much spoiled me for any other. It's a little too expensive for me to drink it exclusively but I've been trying in vain to get my day to day drinking water to taste just like this. I've tried other more expensive brands like Fiji which just tastes flat, and cheaper brands which are just "meh"; I've also gone through several home filtration systems and still no luck getting anywhere near the clean, refreshing taste that Dasani has. I had heard/read that Dasani is actually super-purified municipal(=city) water, not from a mountain spring or similar natural source but it's the taste that people buy it for and IMO there isn't any other brand sourced from anywhere that has a better taste.<br /><br />Maybe it's that there is a slight addition of salt in this water?<br /><br />Minus one star for expensive. This is likely available locally for less.

I still think Nestle is better. But I can not always find that in single servings. And sometimes I need an extra bottle & can usually find this in seperate bottles.

I gave them to my Dad for Christmas, and he generously shared them, and where I had assumed they'd be rather irresistable, (they were quite expensive, so I figured a splurge, plus a captivating product name, would mean they'd be utterly delicious), they were decidedly so-so.

I liked these almonds better, even though the TJ ones are really good. These almonds have been roasted and it makes the almonds more flavorful. The chocolate is dark so they are really chocolaty, and not too sweet. I also found it helpful that the product is labeled gluten free since my daughter has problems with gluten. I hope these go on sale again, because they were a treat!

review/text: I purchased this flavor from Baronet as I enjoyed their Nutty Irishman flavor. Cinnamon Stick smells nice, but I found the flavor lacking. I can drink Nutty Irishman black, however Cinnamon Stick black tasted similar to gas station coffee. Not particularly strong or full-bodied, and even after adding my own ground cinnamon and tasty creamer it still didn't make much of an impression.<br /><br />To be fair, I would not consider myself a Cinnamon aficionado. Perhaps I would enjoy this flavor from Baronet more if I were.

review/text: I was expecting a wonderful cinnamon aroma while brewing, and a nice bit of cinnamon taste while drinking it.  With this and the other flavors I purchased, I am extremely disappointed.  With a single pod I did not get any cinnamon aroma or flavor.  With two pods it is barely detectable for me, yet there is some type of odd flavor I can't quite describe.  Drinkable, but definately not the "to die for" cup of coffee I was hoping for.  I'll probably add a dash of cinnamon to each brew, so that I can use these up.  But, I won't be purchasing any more of them.

I use the single pod holder and I use the double cup button on my machine but turn it off before it finishes filling up the cup. This way I get about 1.5 cups of water in my cup and with ONE Pod its very strong coffee.<br />I like the Baronet brand coffee better than any I have tried and its far superior to the Senseo pods and much stronger coffee.<br />I have had the cinnamon, hazelnut, french vanilla and so far love them all.<br />I did try the Almond and did not like it, it was a strange taste, too overpowering.<br />This is a great value for people who love their Senseo machine but hate the price of the pods...<br />great coffee!

This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!

In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!

review/text: The 21 ounce Pro-Treat Beef Liver Treats are a great value and my dog loves them.  I just need to reach for the tub and she will sit and put up her paw.  I even cut them into tiny pieces sometimes and sprinkle them onto her food.  She gobbles up her food when I do that.  This size will last a while.

review/text: New puppy loves this, only treat he will pay attention to while walking and training. One note, pieces are quite large so I cut them up into smaller pieces so their recommended daily amount goes further.<br /><br />All the dogs in the dog park can't resist my pocket when I have these treats. Usually surrounded by a crowd of dogs all poking at my pocket.

review/summary: Dogs, Cats, Ferrets all love this
review/text: I wanted a treat that was accepted and well liked for my rescue animals.<br />This is the only treat that is healthy and loved by all 4 legged beings in my home!<br />It does not contain sugar or grains or silly vegetables which virtually all treats contain. Dogs, cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables, and WHYYYY do companies add sugar,beet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods? It is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetes.<br />It is pretty easy to break into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amounts.<br />I like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogs.<br />NO minus to this product other then the price,I can not afford to use it as much as I would like.

review/summary: My Alaskan Malamute Loves Them!!
review/text: These liver treas are phenomenal. When i received the 14oz. bucket by amazon i began training my 3month old Alaskan malamute. Now that a month has passed by, she now knows: Sit, Stay, Down, Paw, & SPEAK! My bucket is almost empty as it only lasted for about a month but was worth every penny as ive read malamutes are very stubborn quite dogs. I gave some to my 2 poodles where they gobbled it down and were begging for more. These treats are highly recommended, plus the liver cubes can be further broken down into quadrants. A+++ product

review/summary: dogs LOVE it--  best treat for rewards and training
review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%

review/text: When you first give them out, be careful, you might just draw back a nub! Our oldest dog was very nonchalant about her treats. We just about had to beg her to eat them. NOT THESE. She went nuts over these and looked forward to them every night. The vet said I should give her liver to build her red blood cells up. It helped buy us a little longer with her I think. Now the other 2 dogs are addicted to them also! It is a HEALTHY treat that they love. They would eat the whole tub in one sitting if I would let them! It has no awful liver smell either!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: These liver treats are great for training. We adopted a German Shepherd puppy and have been using these to teach her basic commands. She goes bananas for these and learned very quickly even though she's a VERY stubborn pup. Since she's still small I cut the large cubes into thirds or quarters(she doesn't know and doesn't mind)to make our training sessions go further since it's recommended that you give only a few treats a day to avoid digestion problems. Also, compared to other liver treats on the market, this brand only uses 100% beef liver, no preservatives, fillers, or other stuff your dog doesn't need. The treats also keep indefinitely in the container if kept in a cool, dry place. The 21 oz. bucket is the most economical buy. We've had our pup 2+ months and the bucket is still mostly full. (Psst! - KV Pet Supply has the best online price- $24.99 for a 21oz. container) Highly recommended!

They are expensive, relative to other biscuits, but I find they are a good addition to their diet.  The treats are easy on the teeth.  Since they are protein treat, be careful not to overindulge your pet on a regular basis.  They are great treats to take on walks as you can stuff them in your pocket easily.  I have found prices can vary from vendor to vendor, so shop around.

review/text: I use these as a training treat when I am working with my two dogs. My dogs were getting bored of the same ol' treats even though I tried to give them a wide variety. This one BY FAR is their favorite, and I like it because its all natural with no preservatives. Some of the pieces are pretty big, but easily broken with your finger nail. If you carry some around in your pocket like I do when I'm working with them, watch out - you will have the neighborhood dogs wanting a treat too.  :) The price here is quite good also. It is definitly worth a try!
