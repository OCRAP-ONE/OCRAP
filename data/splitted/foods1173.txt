review/summary: Love the product - question the price
review/text: I love the tender bites as do my senior cats (17 & 18 yrs old). But I do question the price, which is a unusual.  I get the 24 count variety pack for $9.49 at my local Food Lion grocery store.  I would expect a 48 count pack to be no more than double that price (18.98) so $28.11 would seem a bit high.  Unless of course  48 means 48 - 12 pack boxes.  Then the description needs  a little work.

review/summary: My fave of wheat-free cookies!
review/text: Summary:<br /><br />Peanut butter, plain: A bit "rubbery". I cooked them a little longer in microwave and added chips. ;^)<br /><br />Peanut butter, choc. chip: Crispy, crunchy, crumbly, rich and VERY addictive! (Yes, they always arrive broken up somewhat, but you won't care.)(Like other chip one, only 5 oz. box)<br /><br />Swirl shortbread: Too heavy and buttery for me. Nice texture.<br /><br />Choc. Chip shortbread: If you like shortbread, this will taste decadent! Rich choc. chips. Crispy and yes, also addictive! (Note: only 5 oz instead of 7 oz. box)<br /><br />Butter shortbread: Couldn't really eat these. Too heavy and buttery. Least favorite.<br /><br />Haven't tried others yet.<br /><br />I have a wheat allergy and never tasted shortbread again until I found these wonderful delights at the store in the health-food section! The shortbread choc chip I tried first has not only the unique taste of shortbread, but has chocolate chunks also! They are crunchy and light.<br /><br />In comparison, they weigh less than some other Pamela products. They are not as "buttery" as the Butter Shortbread or Swirl (a good thing in my opinion). I love the pecans also!<br /><br />Recommend to any wheat-allergy sufferer, or gluten intolerant person. :^)

review/summary: Too much aftertaste
review/text: We eat mostly gluten free as one of my kids has a sensitivity to it. While I try to bake all the goods myself, these looked like a good thing to carry as a snack when we travel. My daughter didn't like the cookie part much. SHe kept trying to pick out just the chocolate chips.<br /><br />For myself, it was OK. Sometimes gluten free baked goods can have a grainy aftertaste and that was the case with these. The upshot was they make an excellent cookie crumb pie crust when you toss them in the food processor and grind them up.

review/text: I am normally not a cookie person-- I usually find them too sweet and too oily-- but these are just perfect!! They have a texture that reminds me of those Chinese almond cookies (crispy and a bit crumbly rather than chewy). I don't have a wheat or gluten intolerance but these are definitely some of the best cookies I have ever tasted. Best of all, the ingredients are 95% organic.<br /><br />Note: There are 9 cookies in the box. I've eaten 7 in the last couple hours, they're that good!

review/summary: Very Good Organic Gluten-Free Cookies
review/text: I got sent a sample of these organic cookies from the manufacturer and really enjoyed them, so I signed up to get an ongoing monthly delivery of 6 boxes. The problem is, I eat them all within a week so I think I need a second delivery for two weeks later. :) The cookies are crumbly and taste a bit like Mexican Wedding cookies. One thing though, the cookies can come crumbled a bit at times from shipping and the size and amount of chocolate chunks vary greatly from one cookie to the next. I found that is okay though, because they are so tasty. I like dipping them in organic rice milk.

review/summary: Best Product in my pantry
review/text: This is one of the most delicious cookies I have every had! The shortbread is indistinguishable in texture and taste from its regular gluten counterpart. The pecans add a nice crunch in the cookie and the chocolate keeps the whole thing from being too dry.<br />My only wish is that the chocolate was not in there in such big chunks, maybe broken down more to a chip size. So that you get more chocolate through out the cookie and less chocolate in one bite. But that's just a matter of preference. As far as taste the chocolate is excellent, moist and high quality.<br />I love the packaging just as much as the taste. The individual packages are just perfect to pop in my purse to have later as light snack.<br />If you have celiacs, or even if you dont, I highly recommend getting this cookie. It makes a delicious treat.<br /><br />Pros: Taste. Handy packages of 2.<br />Cons: Addictive.

Why in the world she passes the plain ones off as shortbread, when they are at best a bland biscuit, and the base dough for these is as close to shortbread as I've ever had, gluten-free.  They have a great flavor, balance of sweet/savory that makes shortbread so good, nice crisp texture.  I would purchase these again.

review/summary: Fenugreek Aids in Breast Milk Production
review/text: Daughter is breastfeeding but felt she wasn't producing enough milk. We decided to incorporate Fenugreek into her diet via various ways. Since she is a sprout lover, I agreed to grow these organic sprouts for her. I used about a tablespoon or so initially and was elated how well the seeds sprouted. There were very few seeds that didn't take. I did prewash and soak overnight in a hot rinse bath because the seeds are harder than some. What an incredible aroma from these sprouts. After 5 days in the mini Sprout Master, they crisped up in the fridge and are now a healthy addiction to daughter's diet. Fenugreek is known to help increase milk production and these seeds can also be ground and added to many Indian or African dishes for an unusual almost maple syrup taste. Very worth the extra time to sprout our own seeds without a fear of salmonella as many sprouts have been contaminated in the grocery stores. Always buy organic sprouting seeds.

review/summary: Good Tasting and Long Lasting Sugarless Gum - Recommended
review/text: Trident Greenapple + Goldenpineapple Layers sugarless gum has a somewhat subtle but distinctive flavor that lasts a fairly long time. The Apple and Pineapple flavors go well together and there isn't a noticeable aftertaste from the artificial sweetener.  Each pack contains 14 individually wrapped pieces.<br /><br />Recommended

review/summary: work well
review/text: These pops have a slightly odd flavor but not offensive.  They work well and my kids have no problem using them.  I've even given them to my husband and myself.  I used to use a cherry flavored anti-nausea liquid from the drug store that is very popular.  I find this works better and contains no artificial color or flavor.  If your kid gets tired of it half way through, they usually feel better by then anyway.  I highly recommend them and always keep them on hand.

review/text: I believe that these were a great idea, however the flavors were not all that great, I couldn't even get my picky 3 year old to try them, my older daughter tried them and said that they were not that bad at first but started to taste icky after a while. I think if these were in regular flavors that it might have been an easier sell to my child.

review/summary: Great product, but over priced.
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers that kelp noodles are definitely a delicious and nutritious noodle substitute. But $10.95 is absolute ridiculously over priced. I live in Manhattan and buy the same product in H market in Korea Town for $2.99. I recommend this product, but not for this price. If you live in a metropolitan city I would suggest purchasing kelp noodles at any major Asian market for a fraction of the price listed here.

review/summary: Great as a Topping Raw or as Noodles Cooked
review/text: In our home we strive to eat as many healthy raw foods as possible.  We encounter common challenges like eating out, school lunch, weight loss, etc.  We currently try to eat about 50% raw.<br /><br />  I got these kelp noodles because I am not really crazy for raw squash noodles for a pasta substitute(we loved them steamed with garlic though). These are super squeaky and crunchy when you eat them raw.<br /><br />  They are great raw to add crunch into stir-frys after you have finished cooking them.(This is a great trick to get more raw veggies into your diet.  Leave a few of you veggies like shredded cabbage, green onions, and shredded carrots out while cooking and then add them back in after the dish is cooked.)<br /><br />They are great cooked for a noodles substitute. Cooked, I find them like rice or bean curd noodles you would find in the asian section of the grocery store or asian market.<br /><br />  They are very mild tasting so they take on what ever flavor you would like.  Kelp or any sea vegetables are super healthy for you.  These are a great way to get them into your diet, if you don't normally like the strong flavors of nori or any of the other sea veggies.  Oh and these are TRUELY RAW.  No false labeling here!  Yeah!

The best are the unusual green tea flavored ones. All they need is a good peanut sauce, fresh fruits and vegetables, and it's a filling feast. Kelp noodles, on the surface, sound icky and gross. They have the same texture as regular noodles; they're also good for people with gluten free diets. Kelp noodles are a taste delight from the sea!

review/text: I use this instead of noodles for stir-fry.  It is an excellent substitute--cook for about a minute and it is better than any rice or wheat noodles.  I also eat it raw in salads.  But why is this so expensive?  I bought this at the store for around $3.  You can also buy this directly from the manufacturer for around $2.95 per package.  $10.99 is an absurd price.  Check out your local Asian market, food coop, or check on-line for the manufacturer.

review/summary: Wow!  Adding this as a regular item to my diet
review/text: Rave Rave Rave!  I've been doing some research on raw foods and health foods and I know of all the benifits of kelp and other seaweeds.  I live in central WI which has a pretty big Hmong population (as well as other asian influence).  I stopped at 5 different asian markets and stores in the area asking for kelp noodles... every place lead me to nori seaweed.  No kelp noodles.  I read the other reviews that said the price was high.  However with my limitations I couldn't be picky and thought I would go ahead and try.  The worst case senerio, I was out $15.  No biggie.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did!!!  I split the package in half (two servings each).  One portion I threw in with some shrimp and herbs last night.  Tonight I just made a chicken and veggie stir fry and threw the kelp noodles in towards the end.<br /><br />I can't believe how filling these are!  And they take on all of the flavors you are cooking with.<br /><br />So here is the nutrition facts break down.  I'm going to compare this with a package of Hokkien noodles.<br /><br />4 oz of kelp noodles vs 3.5 oz of Hokkin noodles<br /><br />Calories : 6 kelp (170 hokkin)<br />Total fat: 0 kelp (2 g hokkin)<br />saturated fat: 0 (1g)<br />Trans Fat: 0 (0)<br />Cholesterol: 0 (0)<br />Sodium: 35 mg - 1% dv  (170 mg - 7% dv)<br />Carbs: 1 g (32g)<br />Fiber: 1g (2g)<br />Sugars: 0 (1g)<br />Protein: 0 (5g)<br /><br />Vitamin A: 0 (0)<br />Calcium: 15%  (0%)<br />Vitamin c: 0 (0)<br />Iron: 4% (2%)<br /><br />I won't by these from Amazon again.  I'm going to buy directly from [...](website on the package).  Where I can get 12-12 oz. packages per case for [...] + shipping.<br /><br />Another great aspect, made in the USA!  San Diego to be exact.  They have two other products, green tea kelp noodles and sea vegtables that I'm also very interested in trying.<br /><br />So all in all: Awesome product, iffy price on amazon.  However I think amazon is a great way to test out if you would like to try the kelp noodles without buying in bulk, and if you don't have access to kelp noodles where you live.  (BTW, on [...] they also have a list of where you can find these products).<br /><br />I can't wait until I get more so I can try these in other pasta dishes, soups and salads!<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful.

review/summary: Interesting Noodles
review/text: I am accustomed to noodles being soft when cooked; which this noodle definitely does not become.  I have tried many different noodles and this is the first I tried Kelp noodles.  The taste out of the bag is similar to the kelp flakes, which I do not like too much; but it is very subtle and once you add your seasoning or cook it, you cannot taste it.  The noodles should be rinsed and then cut to the size you want.  I got mine from sea tangles company because it is cheaper that way.  I find this product perfect for my salads raw.  However by itself with braggs amino, chili paste and ginger, I just cannot get over the crunchiness.  Eventhough, I cooked it, it was crunchy.  This is definitely a great bulk item for my salad but I doubt I can eat it any other way.  With only 18 cal for 12 oz (6cal/4oz) this is a great low calorie addition.

review/text: So my partner and I started a Paleo way of eating a week and a half ago and I was a little sad that I wouldn't be able to have pasta again.  Well, let me tell you this... these "noodles" were AMAZING!  I took them out of the package and washed them.. even tried one and it was a little crunchy raw.  I put some sauce in the pot and added the noodles, mushrooms, green peppers and some awesome seasoning and POOF!  20 minutes later I had a delicious meal and the noodles were soft just like angel hair pasta.  They had no taste and a GREAT texture.  If you're on the fence about buying these, don't be... just try them.  Your taste buds and your waistline will thank you.

review/text: We lived in the Middle East for several years, while my children were toddlers/milkdrinkers. Our milk choices were canned, reconstituted, dry nonfat, and several with indecipherable labels. Then we tried Nido (Europe). I had to experiment a little but finally came up with the best-tasting method. Mix it up in the blender - I think aerating it helps it taste fresher. Next, refrigerate it overnight before use. It becomes delicious! The family liked drinking milk again, and my tea stopped tasting strange.

review/summary: Nestle Nido from Chile best powder milk in 48 years of milk drinking
review/text: Nestle Nido made in Chile Ingredients, Whole milk, soy Lecithin ( emulsification properties ), Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin D3. I did a three milk blind taste test. I mixed nonfat milk from a large country wide grocery store chain by the directions, Mixed Nestle Nido from Chile by the directions, and bought a pint of whole milk from a country wide dairy. I left the milks in the fridge over night in uncoverd identical marked glasses . This was to give them time to rest. The next day a friend blindfolded me and the test began. First a whole milk that was very good. Washed mouth and the second milk was nonfat. Easy pick taste like most nonfat powderd milk. Washed mouth. Tried third glass and was stumped. I sipped both whole milks and could tell one was fresher. I picked the fresher as the store bought and was wrong. The best was Nido from Chile. I have had two years chef prep and years cooking in the field. It is my assumption that the store bought had picked up flavor from the carton. I will keep Nestle Nido from chile as a back up and for emergency stock. I also boiled both whole milks and found the Nido performs as well as store bought. One thing to remember is to make sure the country Nido comes from does not add sugers or other flavorings to cover a bad product. Pricey but good for emergency or every day use if you through out spoiled milk.

review/summary: Instant WHOLE milk!
review/text: This NIDO instant whole milk has been a staple in our pantry for years. It makes delicious milk, when needed, but my favorite use is in cooking and baking. I add it to creamy hot cereals as they cook, like Farina <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040Z4GVU">Farina Creamy Hot Wheat Cereal (28 Oz.)</a> or Cream of Wheat <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032JVXUM">Cream Of Wheat Original Stove Top 10 minutes, 28-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> for added flavor and nutritional punch. Also, our littlest guy, who is 3 yrs old, "doesn't like milk" but he gobbles it up with this method. I also add it to mashed potatoes to make them thick and smooth and we add it to hot chocolate making a really good, luxury smooth flavored hot drink. Like ALL dry milk, NIDO is not cheap, but the price on Subscribe & Save is less than any store, even WalMart, and we can have milk at any time, anywhere. NIDO requires no special treatment - just stick it in a cupboard and its there when you need it!

review/summary: Makes great frothed milk for lattes and capps!
review/text: I got this to make milk froth for my Nespresso Pixie. I was using a Dolce Gusto machine for my coffee milk drinks with the powdered milk capsule, but this is better. Since I don't use milk much for other things, this works better with less waste. It also froths better too, with just a hand held frother to rinse. I just use the Nespresso to pour some hot water into a cup with the milk powder and a packet of sweetener, and hit it with the frother. The Black & Decker one works great. Then I do a shot or two of espresso, and an instant capp or latte with no fuss! Tastes as good to me as frothed milk from a fancy machine.

review/summary: Even most critics of powdered milk will like this stuff!
review/text: Nestle Nido tastes nothing like most of the dry milk powders.  You know how most powdered milks are really only okay for baking or for emergencies?  That's not true for this stuff.  It tastes great - even when it's used alone.  It is rich and creamy.  It completely and easily dissolves in cold water - which isn't something that can be said about most powdered milk.  The best part is that it doesn't really taste processed and doesn't have any odd aftertaste.  I know what farm-fresh milk tastes like (my grandfather had a dairy farm) and even though I'm picky about my milk - even I still like this.<br /><br />My main reason for purchasing this is because I like to add it to hot cereals.  I can make grits, oatmeal, cream of rice, etc with water and then simply mix this in once I'm finished.  It is also perfect for adding to coffee, making homemade hot cocoa recipes, making yogurt, adding to recipes, etc.<br /><br />This has become a staple in my home.  I love the convenience and taste of this.  I do prefer the cans from Chile more than the ones from Mexico - but both are still good.

review/summary: Kids love it
review/text: Our kids drink 3 or more gallons of milk per week and it was taking up a disproportionate amount of space in our refrigerator compared to other things. My wife remembered Nido from when she was a kid so we tried it out. Our experience is very positive. It tastes great and the kids love it. Now we make a gallon of milk when we run out -- no need to run to the store. The canister is giant; I haven't figured out exactly how much milk it makes, but its quite a bit -- off hand it seems like a better bang for the buck than liquid milk. We're now going to be using this exclusively because it fits our lifestyle better.

review/summary: Tastes like real whole milk!
review/text: I grew up on powdered milk - the nasty watery skim kind.  This is NOT that kind of powdered milk.  4 TBS and a bit of warm water transform this powder into a lovely and delicious 1 cup of whole milk.  The powder mixes very well and easily (no nasty clumps), and has the proper consistency and color of milk.  We don't use a lot of milk typically, so if we need or want it we would buy a small container, use some, and wind up throwing most of it out when it went bad.  Buy this stuff and problem solved.  Best of all, it tastes great, and works equally well for cooking.

review/summary: Delicious Replacement for Toddler Formula
review/text: My two-year-old LOVES Nido! She is beyond formula but doesn't seem to like milk (2% or whole), so this is the perfect alternative. Toddler formulas are so expensive. Nido gives her the extra vitamins and nutrients she needs, and I get way more value for my money. I used to buy the Nido 1+ Probiotic until it became too pricey for me. The Nido 1+ is a bit sweeter than this regular Nido, so I was a bit anxious my daughter wouldn't like this. She didn't seem to notice one bit--good thing, too, because the price is awesome (esp. if you do Subscribe & Save). One can lasts me about 2-3 weeks. The one minor drawback I notice is that without the probiotic added (there seems to be more iron in this one), she gets 'bound up' more. However, as long as she eats her yogurt every day, it's not a big issue but something I thought I would mention for your little ones who may not eat live cultures/yogurt products (if so, then the Probiotic Nido is the one you would want). I hope this helps other moms and dads (I hear adults like it, too, but I'm not a milk drinker so I wouldn't know [the powder itself tastes yummy though]). It's a fantastic product in my opinion. Thanks!!!

review/summary: Oh My!
review/text: I've drank powdered milk and canned milk for years, all different brands, but this NIDO milk has them all beat.  It taste as close to store bought milk as anything I've ever tasted.  I travel a lot in my RV and trying to keep milk in the fridge can be difficult, so I usually buy powdered, canned, or shelf ready milk.  The can milk takes up too much room as is also the case with shelf ready type.  The "regular" powder milk I've purchased before either didn't  taste that fabulous or lumped up severely.  I have to say this NIDO milk mixes very well, and the good thing is the fact if you don't want to use at full strength (whole milk), you can dilute it to your liking. This stuff taste great and this will be on hand from now on out.  I agree with the one reviewer who related  that non-powder milk drinkers may just change their mind when they try this out.  I agree!

review/summary: If you need powdered milk, this is the best
review/text: Most supermarkets in the US don't seem to carry anything but nonfat powdered milk. Maybe it keeps longer than whole; I don't know. So if you need whole powdered milk for any reason, you're likely to end up ordering it, and this is a good choice for that. We use it to travel with our toddler, who has outgrown formula but still drinks a lot of whole milk -- kids aren't supposed to drink lowfat or skim at his age -- and he seems to like it just fine. We parents have also tried it ourselves and not hated it, and have adopted it as our household standard.<br /><br />Powdered milk, including this stuff, does not taste like regular milk. If you're using it in baking or most recipes, it doesn't matter much, and you can use whatever kind you find at your local grocery. However, if you or anyone you care about is going to drink it or pour it on cereal or otherwise have to taste it straight, this is the best option I've found. Personal taste varies, of course, and you might not agree, so try one can before you get a whole case.

review/summary: Excellent milk taste
review/text: Nido is about 100x better than any of the powdered non-fat milks I've tried.  It has a really great, creamy taste.  We're overseas where you either buy milk from a dirty bucket at the market (fresh from the cow, but not so safe) or you get the tasteless aseptic packages of milk.<br /><br />That's all you can find, so having this milk is a really nice change of pace.  I mix with warm water and chill overnight and it's absolutely delicious.  It actually tastes like MILK, something you can't say about the aseptic junk.  I've never once had an issue with lumps and I've whisked it into cool water with no trouble.<br /><br />For those that want to know, it makes up a really nice, creamy farmers cheese (or ricotta, or yogurt for that matter) but isn't suitable for mozzarella without the addition of some cream to the mix.<br /><br />With subscribe and save pricing, it's not a terrible deal, either.

review/text: We bought this specifically to add body to homemade yogurt. We'd seen only good comments about it. Using less than half a cup of Nido to  42 oz of fresh whole milk resulted in the worst tasting yogurt we'd ever made. We couldn't believe it was the Nido, so tried again, this time with a scant 1/3 cup. Still horrid. Went back to the store brand, not great but certainly edible, until we were able to pick up some Saco, which worked well. I'm not sure whether the Nido was rancid or just didn't fit our taste. It *shouldn't* have been rancid, being in a sealed can just purchased, and not beyond expiration...

review/text: Instant Dry Whole Milk.  According to the label, this 3.52 lb can makes about 13 quarts.  Rather expensive per quart, compared to fresh milk from the grocery store, but cheaper than a trip to the store when I run out of milk and need some quickly.  Ingredients: Whole Milk, Soy Lecithin, Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin D3 (per label).  Imported from Chile.  Instructions say to add 3 heaping tablespoons of NIDO to 1 cup of WARM water -- I guess you can chill it after it's mixed.<br /><br />Haven't tried it yet, so can't comment on flavor.

review/summary: From milk to kefir cheese, this powder does it all
review/text: Bottom Line:<br />This milk can feed kefir, make cheese, or simply be a great, convenient solution for milk.  Makes 3 and 1/3 gallons so try to purchase when around $10 to make ~$3 a gallon.<br /><br />Pros:<br />When mixed properly can create a very convincing and fresh whole milk<br />When coupled with local skim milk powder (I use walmart) can make a convincing 1% or 2%<br />Can be used to feed kefir grains thereby saving fresh milk for drinking<br />Economical when you wait for prices to go down<br /><br />Cons:<br />When NOT blended thoroughly or carefully can taste rancid<br />May still have an aftertaste regardless<br /><br />Review:<br />Final edit of my review but in short, this is a very versatile milk that has saved me fridge space and countless hours running back and forth to the grocer's.  But not only that, it has opened the doors to making kefir that would formerly be impossible as I live in a small dorm like room.<br /><br />It is worthy to note that the milk powder has to be blended properly and eaten out of glass bowls.  Plastics just will not do and I use pyrex to shake it up.  If not blended properly it WILL taste off and potentially cheezy, as others have stated in the reviews.  Also oddly enough when I refrigerate the milk it can taste worse than when I just mix it fresh.  I have yet to discover why.  Regardless use glass or ceramic.<br /><br />Secondly, whether or not it can compare with fresh milk when mixed, you can use this to make kefir.  This is a huge find as you can even make kefir cheese, yes a rennet free cheese, and save your more expensive fresh milk for drinking.  When making kefir from grains take care to use purified water to avoid the chlorine that will kill them (I use pur filters though ymmv).  As for the source go online to find people who gives away free kefir (I bought mine on amazon before I discovered this).<br /><br />Lastly, if you're worried about the quality, first and foremost the powder should smell sweet not cheezy or rancid (if it smells at all like that, yours likely has gone bad so get a refund quick).  Remember that powdered milk is just not the same as fresh but at least for us kefirers, it can save us from using expensive organic milks.

I thought he was wrong and was just some bitter man with time on his hands.<br /><br />Boy I was wrong.<br /><br />I never tried this product when it was made in Chile, but I can tell you that it now tastes horrible and nothing like regular milk.  It tastes like cheese, really old rotting cheese.  It smells terrible, and all my buddies who I had try it agree with me.  I have a friend who picked up powdered milk from Albertsons and his is substantially better.  It's a store brand I believe, but I can't order that on Amazon.<br /><br />I want to request my money back from Nestle.  This is probably the worst product I ever ordered during my time here at Amazon and on prime.

review/text: I have tasted Bali's Best Iced Tea candy and found the flavors spot on (just like a cup of a sweet tea) and very tasty. Since they did such a good job on that candy, I decided to try their Green Tea Latte candy since I enjoy green tea as well.<br /><br />It's difficult to describe the taste of this candy, the milk flavor adds a creaminess that's reminiscent of butterscotch, but instead of a cloying butter flavor, there's a fresh green tea flavor that has a little tannic edge and aftertaste. Natural sugars add just the right amount of sweetness. They may have created a perfect green tea candy. Every flavor is well-balanced. The ingredient list is short and all natural. This is a candy you can enjoy for a long time without over-indulging or getting sick of it. A pack of 12 will last a long time. A great bargain.

The flavor is excellent, not too sweet, with just the right amount of steamed milk flavor. I was thrilled to find them on amazon, and even more so with the price. It's less than half (per bag) of what I paid originally. Also check out the coffee latte candies from the same company. Those are also excellent.

review/text: this is a good product for people who like gum but have dental work to which most gum sticks.<br /><br />I've ordered from Amazon because they have the best price for bulk purchases; I save almost 40% off per-pack retail prices.<br /><br />There is potential for a problem; Wrigley dates each of its bulk packages with a best by date. Generally, Wrigley gum is 'fresh' if the best by date is 6 months or more in the future. Current shipments from Amazon are dated 5/9/09; this is only 2 months away. There is potential to receive stale product; Amazon would most likely accept a return but we don't buy things with the expectation we will return them.
