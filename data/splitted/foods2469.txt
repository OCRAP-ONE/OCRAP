review/summary: The Wife and I have an agreement....
review/text: ...she yells at me for buying too much cereal, like all straight men, and she eats it when she doesn't want to have a real dessert.  One of our favorites for taste combined with reasonable nutrition is Quaker Oatmeal Squares.  Sweet enough for a snack, but filling enough and healthy enough for a meal.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy - what else can you say!
review/text: I love Quaker Oatmeal Squares in general, and "Hint of Brown Sugar" is my favorite variety. While tasting quite good, which is almost a prerequisite, this cereal is also relatively healthy. It is high (higher than most any other cereal) in soluble fiber, a key for reducing cholesterol, plaque buildup in arteries, etc. Most cereals have little or no soluble fiber, containing insoluble fiber (the main ingredient in many laxatives) instead.

review/summary: Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal With Just the Right Sweetness
review/text: Quaker's Oatmeal Squares provides 46 grams of heart-healthy whole grains in a cereal that tastes bold with just the right amount of sweetness.  I don't like overly sweet cereals, and Quaker's Oatmeal Squares fit my taste perfectly.  My kids, who typically do like sweet cereals, even liked Quaker Oatmeal Squares.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about this cereal is the way it made me feel full in a lasting way so I didn't eat too much of it, or snack on other things between breakfast and lunch.  This was quite helpful in my dietary goals.<br /><br />Quaker Oatmeal Squares come in four flavors, all of which are good.  If you like cereal and are looking for one that is both healthy and has a great taste, this cereal might be what you're looking for.

review/summary: A good breakfast choice
review/text: This cereal is faintly sweet, it suits an adult palate- not like the sugar blasted types that come in brightly colored boxes. The squares are a good size, not too big, and they hold milk nicely. The overall taste was rather bland, I really did not notice any brown sugar. I did like the fact that they are made of oatmeal for the cholesterol lowering properties. I did feel fuller than I do after having a breakfast of the flake cereal variety. It's a satisfying good, basic, cereal.

review/summary: Crunchy and lightly sweetened, good for snacking or with milk
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares cereal consists of pillow-shaped dense nuggets of oaty cereal.  There's a light sweetness, more of a brown sugar taste, that comes in the bite.  The nuggets stay pleasantly crunchy in milk, but I found that I enjoyed them most of all as a snack.  The cereal feels like a grown-up version of Life; the differences are that it is less sweet than Life cereal) and has a much heartier texture and flavor.  I do think that fans of Life that are beginning to find it too crumbly or sweet will enjoy this cereal as an alternative for snacking or breakfast.<br /><br />Nutritionally, I like that it has a fairly high amount of protein for a cereal (6g per serving, without milk, vs. only 4g for Life cereal).  Surprisingly, though, it has slightly (1g per cup) more sugar than Life cereal, despite being less sweet generally.  It's also higher in calories at 210 per cup vs. 160 for a cup of Life.  (If you do these comparison's directly on Quaker's website, note that Life has a serving size of 3/4 cup whereas this has a serving size of 1 cup.  So, you have to adjust the nutritional info accordingly.)  Even with this though, I think Oatmeal Squares are more filling in the same amount and possibly more satisfying.  That may be due to the higher fiber content (5g per cup vs. &lt;3g per cup for Life).<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed it and would certainly buy it if the price were right and the mood struck me.

review/summary: Great snack, mediocre in milk
review/text: A handful of these Quaker Oatmeal Squares make a great snack. They are reasonably healthy and have a great taste of brown sugar with a big crunch.<br /><br />Unfortuanetly, they don't do so well in milk. Although they hold their crunch very well, they quickly lose their flavor in milk. I guess that the "hint of brown sugar" isn't enough to stand up to the milk. So, they becaome a somewhat flavorless crunchy breakfast. Not bad, but not so great.

review/text: I found this particular cereal, with brown sugar, to be on the bland side, especially in comparison to the other type I tried, the Quaker Oatmeal Squares with Cinnamon.  I couldn't really taste the brown sugar at all - I don't really need cereals to be overly sugary, but this one tasted particularly bland. That said, it was reasonably filling and got me through the morning.  I would definitely take the one with cinnamon over this one though.

review/summary: Crunchy and satisfying!
review/text: This is one of my favorite cereals. It is crunchy and satisfying, and has a pleasant taste. I didn't rate it 5 stars because of the following: 1. I think the squares could be a little bigger, which would add more crunch and have a better mouth feel. 2. It seems like this product would have more fiber than it does. 3. The hint of brown sugar is VERY slight - if you're looking for a sweeter cereal, this isn't it. Otherwise, I like this cereal and am glad I tried it again after a few years!

review/summary: Crunchy, Hearty Cereal
review/text: I have been eating this cereal on and off for quite a while.  As my title says, it's both crunchy, and hearty.  It's also lightly sweetened but I usually add a bit of sugar.  You don't get hungry very fast after eating this, and it doesn't get soggy in milk.  It does have quite a bit of fiber, so even though I am often tempted to eat it for breakfast, lunch AND evening snack, I have to control myself, and just have it once a day.

review/summary: A Worthwhile Purchase From The Quaker People
review/text: As someone who was raised on Quaker oatmeal, I had the usual reservations about the product.  You know the list: bland, doesn't taste good, too runny, too thick.  But then, oatmeal tends to vary with preparation style.  That said, there was a bit of negative bias on my part going into trying the product.<br /><br />After eating a bowl of this product every day for a week (there's that much in the box, with a bit left over), I can honestly say that this product handily exceeded my low expectations.  Somehow, someway, the good people from Quaker actually found a way to make oatmeal consumption enjoyable, with just the right amount of additional ingredients to make it sweet, flavorful and filling.<br /><br />Specifically, the product works well with warm, hot or cold milk.  I tried the product a couple of times after pre-heating it in the microwave (high power for 15-20 seconds) and letting it sit for two to three minutes, and it was quite tasty, almost like having a bowl of actual oatmeal.  Like good, steel-cut Irish oatmeal, the product pairs well with a number of fruits, and I personally was very pleased with the combination of fresh blueberries and soft, ripe (but not overly-ripe) bananas that I added to it after I the let squares sit in warm milk for a few minutes.<br /><br />As for the product itself, it looks a lot like Nabisco's shredded wheat squares or General Mill's Cinnamon Toast Crunch (no small coincidence I suspect- a new competitive entrant, perhaps?).  It has a good texture and color, but I did notice that it took a bit of time for the squares to soften in milk (I personally do not like hard, crunchy cereal), especially if the milk is cold.  The product was sweet but not overly so, and a bit on the chewy side.  As an added plus, the product by itself is quite filling (and fosters good regularity.  That said, I do have one piece of strong advice (or perhaps a warning) for those like me who like to have their cup of French roast coffee with their cereal: expect to visit the bathroom shortly after having your meal and don't be too surprised if you feel magically five pounds lighter!<br /><br />Overall, I liked the product, and I think I will look for it in the stores.

review/text: This is a good cereal that has a good flavor and crunch. The real problem for me is that is it is not really all that different from many other cereals as far as taste and texture goes. Perhaps the fact that it is made out of oatmeal does make it a little more healthier for you, but for my taste buds it's not any better than shredded wheat.

review/summary: Bland
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste.  A hint of brown sugar coats each square, and it is exactly that - just a hint.  According to the label, this cereal has 210 calories per 1 cup serving without milk and 250 with skim milk. It boasts 5g dietary fiber and 2g soluble fiber.  For 210 or 250 calories, I think it should have more flavor, but for those who don't like any sugar in cereal, this works out well, especially if they prefer a high-fiber one.  Personally, I wouldn't purchase these oatmeal squares and would opt for a nutritious cereal with more taste.

review/summary: Crunchy, tasty, hearty cereal
review/text: The Quaker Oatmeal Squares Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal makes for a very tasty and satisfying breakfast. Taste is overall good as is the ability to remain crunchy while drenched in milk. In other words, it doesn't turn soggy that easily which is a very good thing. By the same token, it's not as hard as some granolas so it's easy to eat and digest. I tried this with soy milk -- but I assume the taste experience would be similar with regular milk. I would not hesitate to buy this in the future.<br /><br />The only caveat I have is a very minor one and more of a preference rather than any real issue. I also tried the Cinnamon version at the same time and slightly prefer the taste of that. This version -- "Hint of Brown Sugar" -- tastes a little like maple syrup. Now if you like maple syrup this would be a plus for you. But I don't and prefer the cinnamon flavor.

(The Trader Joe's mix has dried cranberries, raisins, blueberries and raspberries + a variety of nuts.) I'm anxious to wake up tomorrow for my next breakfast. It's that good!

review/summary: Great tasting, but a bit high in calories
review/text: Overall, this is one of the better tasting cereals I've had in a longtime. Very crunchy, stays crunchy in milk for a while, and while there is a distinct brown sugar flavor, it is not overly sweet.<br /><br />The main downside is that the cereal is fairly high in calories: 1 cup (dry) is 210. When you figure that the average bowl is 1.5 to 2 cups, and factor in milk, you're approaching 500 calories. That's a lot for breakfast.<br /><br />So while Quaker Oatmeal Squares passes the taste test, you may want to use a measuring cup when eating.

review/summary: Does Double Duty
review/text: It seems, having a look at other Voices' reviews, that I'm not alone in discovering that Quaker Oatmeal Squares make an excellent snack all on their own (and in fact, with the exception of one bowl with milk, this is how I consumed my box within a very few days). However, that's not to say that they're not good with milk.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of oats (in fact, I cook oats in broth and have them as a side dish) so I was happy to have the opportunity to sample this for review. First, those who aren't all that familiar with oats should be aware that they not only contain a fair amount of "roughage," but that they're also high in soluble fiber as well--this is why they're considered heart-healthful (that's literate-speak for "heart-healthy"). It's this fiber that's responsible for oats' "slippery" quality when they meet liquids and why colloidal oatmeal is so effective as a natural soothing agent for inflamed skin and, when cooked, rolled oats tend to be gummy. I personally don't find this off-putting and found it to be minimal in this case. But I digress.<br /><br />Quaker Oatmeal Squares are quite lovely. They're not too sweet and I found they held their crunch quite well when combined with milk (but then I tend not to linger over a bowl of dry cereal for that very reason--if I want mush, I'll cook my grains). However, I don't keep a lot of milk in the house, especially over the summer (it just doesn't taste good then), so I found myself snacking when I was in need of a nosh (my day just isn't complete without something sweet). And y'know, they really hit the spot. I felt that at least I wasn't eating total junk and was ingesting some fiber as well.<br /><br />My only complaint is the addition of white sugar and artificial colors. I'm aware that brown sugar is only marginally more healthful than white sugar but even so, why include white sugar in a brown sugar-flavored product? If you think it needs to be sweeter, just up the brown sugar (or use dehydrated cane juice or Sucanat). And why add colors? If you're targeting health-conscious customers, do so all the way--it can be used as a marketing tool ("free from artificial colors, flavors, ..."). It never fails to astonish me just how dim corporate America is, and it's especially painful where food is concerned (the irony here is that Quaker Oats really ARE a healthful product). Get with it, guys.<br /><br />All in all, if you're not a health purist and want an at least somewhat healthful cold cereal, you could do a lot worse than Quaker Oatmeal Squares, especially given their "snackability." I've reviewed several cereals for Vine; this one is undoubtedly my favorite.

review/text: I'm usually a cereal man when it comes to breakfast. That is, unless of course, there's donuts or pancakes. But most of the time I try to stick with a healthy type of cereal rather than Lucky Charms or something of that nature. My two favorites are usually raisin bran or frosted mini wheats but this has worked its way into my regular rotation. They are nice and cruncy with just enough brown sugar sweetness to be tasty without overpowering your taste buds. Sometimes I mix them 50-50 with the cinnamon flavored and have a nice brown sugar & cinnamon flavor. Also, it's nice and hearty so it doesn't leave me hungry after only 30 minutes. Definitely recommended.

review/summary: Tastes Good, and Good for You
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares with a Hint of Brown Sugar come out of the box quite sweet enough for me, and that's something, considering how attached I have become to that Southern favorite, sweet iced tea.  They've also got a nice crunch to them, and I've found them tasty for breakfast, or as a snack. The soluble oatmeal is a good way to help satisfy the federal dietary guidelines suggested daily whole grain consumption.  And, of course, this cereal is a useful baby step towards keeping your heart healthy.<br /><br />The Quaker product contains 46 grams of whole grain per one cup (56 grams) serving, of which there are about eleven in the box.  This is 96% of the guidelines' suggested minimum whole grain requirement per serving.  There are 210 calories per serving, 6  grams of protein per serving, 0.5% saturated fat, 2% of the daily suggested intake of that element.  190 mg of sodium, 8% of the daily suggested.  9 g of sugars; 5 g of fiber, which is 19% of the daily suggested. There is no trans fat, only 1 g each of polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat per serving. As I look through the ingredients, I actually see nothing that I'm trying to avoid, no high-fructose corn syrup, etc.<br /><br />The federal guidelines say that diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods may help reduce the risk of heart disease.  This product offers 3 g of soluble fiber a serving, a handy keystone to a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Diet experts recommend eating at least three one-ounce servings of whole grains, or 48 grams, daily, based on a 2,000 calorie daily diet.  So here you have 46 grams of whole grains per serving.  Handy, right?<br /><br />So it tastes good, and it's good for you, a winning combo.  A good food to try.

review/summary: Great taste, addictive, snack or cereal - it's all good!
review/text: This cereal is a fave at our house. It can be a snack or a cereal. It has a nice appealing texture which does stay crispy with milk longer than flake type or other shredded grain type products. It is sweet but not sugary. We find it very satisfying. Not sure I notice any brown sugar taste - but as noted it is sweeter than plain grain cereal.<br /><br />Oats seem like a heart healthy concept - I'm not entirely sure that the processing of said oats into this cereal makes it healthy but then we alternate it with real oatmeal so it is not a daily meal for us. It does seem to go quickly as it is easy to eat a bigger bowl than the serving so we have to watch that.<br /><br />We also (contrary to the cover) do not like this with fruit unless the fruit is slightly tart. It makes it too sweet. So for those strawberries or other berries that have a more sour than sweet taste this is ideal. For fruits like banana's or sweet blueberries it was just too much sweet for us.

Looking at the marketing on the box, I tried to pretend I was someone who actually cared enough about their health to appreciate the lack of sweetness in their brand of cereal. When I did, this cereal immediately came across as tasty and healthy. There is a hint of brown sugar, but nothing more. Just enough to keep you from wanting to ask someone else for a packet of sugar if you were eating it at work, for example. I happen to be eating it at home, so once I tried it without sugar, I put my daily dose of sugar back in there, so I could judge the taste of the actual product both ways. I think both the health nut and the sugar-adventurous type will appreciate the taste of this cereal. My rating takes my bias in favor of sugar into account, and judges the actual product by how I would take it in my natural environment. Especially since the user can always add a sweetener later, but you can't add taste so easily.<br /><br />If you're kids are already 'trained' to eat healthy, they could theoretically munch on these as a snack-in addition to having them with milk-without complaining. If you're kids are the 'frosted flakes' type, then they may glance you a 'why are you doing this to me?' look. They'll be getting their whole grains, a good amount of protein (6g/cup)and fiber (5g/cup). If you glanced a 'this is all we have, so take it or leave it' look, then I think they'd continue to munch on it, but not without giving that 'fine...but I'm not thrilled about this, just so you know' pouty-face look.<br /><br />On the front, it says the cereal has 1 gram per serving of soluble fiber and that 3 grams of soluble fiber from oatmeal daily in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease, but in the nutritional facts section, it states the product as having 2 grams of soluble fiber (with a total fiber content of 5 grams). I guess if you were looking out for that kind of thing, you might take the lowest figure of 1 gram per serving, to be safe.<br /><br />In sum, it's pretty good-tasting and healthy,too.

review/summary: Oatmeal Squares
review/text: Now, here's a solid, great product.<br /><br />These were delicious.  I felt "addicted" during the two days or so that the box lasted.<br /><br />They're perfect.  The cereal pieces are small and very crunchy; they're very lightly sweetened; they're fun and satisfying to eat.  Unfortunately, any other information you're seeking will have to come off the box.<br /><br />I only "fear" that some people insistent upon a sweet taste will add sugar to this.  Maybe that's my only warning to those with dietary restrictions, those in charge of those with them, or parents with kids.<br /><br />Kudos to Quaker, though.  I say this product couldn't have been better.

review/summary: A wonderful cereal or snack treat
review/text: The Quaker line is one that has many wonderful products, and this cereal is another one. These Oatmeal Squares with brown sugar make a great breakfast or afternoon meal, but my husband and I also like them also as a snack.<br /><br />The cereal is shaped like little squares, very firm and crispy. It has a wonderful, light sweet - with a little hint of cinnamon - taste.  The squares don't get soggy or fall apart too quickly in milk. Also, it is great dry and right out of the box for a snack, or over yogurt or ice cream.<br /><br />One serving is 1 cup and it is 210 calories with only 190 mg sodium and 9g sugar. It has 6g protein.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product!

review/summary: Delicious, but not quite as nutritious as the real thing
review/text: My family thought Quaker Oatmeal squares were a delicious cereal.  They are lightly sweet, crunchy nuggets that don't get too soggy in milk.  They are also delicious to snack on right out of the box.  The calories are a bit high compared to many breakfast cereals (210 per serving) but I do feel like this cereal fills me up more, so it's okay.  However, I would be wary of replacing my normal bowl of oatmeal with this cereal, simply because I thought the sugar was a bit high for me.

review/summary: 20 years later, it's still a favorite
review/text: It must have been around 20 years ago when I was shopping for groceries with my mother, when one of those nice little sample carts was giving out cups of a brand new cereal.  I accepted a cup, and munched as we walked down the next aisle.  Mom asked how I liked it.  I told her that it was different, in a good way, and I really liked it.  Due to my picky tastes when it comes to cereal, she let me go back and pick up a box, and the rest is history.<br /><br />This cereal has been one of my favorites from that day on.  The taste and texture are unlike anything else on the market.  Not to sweet, doesn't get soggy quickly, and I stay full after eating it.<br /><br />The calorie count is a bit high, but thanks to the fiber/protein content, I stay full much better than many other choices.  One serving plus 1/2 cup of skim milk is about 250 calories, so I still have room in a 300 calorie breakfast for some fruit.<br /><br />I'll eat this as a snack sometimes, dry and in smaller quantity, because the crunch is satisfying and the sweet is just enough.<br /><br />The other varieties are also tasty, but the original blue box is still my favorite!

review/summary: Quite Good
review/text: Yes, I got my box for free. I probably wouldn't have bought it. There are too many cereals I like to bother with one I might or might not like, right?<br /><br />My concerns were two-fold. First, would they be sweet enough. I don't need sugar-coated cereal, but I don't want to eat cardboard, either. And second, tight-woven cereals like this tend to suck-up all the milk, so they'll start off too dry, but end up too soggy. Could this cereal overcome those concerns?<br /><br />In a word, yes.<br /><br />The flavor was sweet. The squares started-off crunchy, but not too rough, and they did not suck-up the milk like a sponge, so they weren't too soggy at the end, either.<br /><br />I still have other cereals that I like better, but I'll likely occasionally buy this one, too.

Imagine Life with a bigger crunch, and less propensity to go soggy after a few minutes in the milk. The Brown Sugar flavoring is not overwhelming at all; it's just subtle enough to add sweetness.

review/text: Getting up there in age, I am told that I should eat more fiber because it helps reduce cholesterol. Eating a steaming bowl of oatmeal a day may not be in my future, but Quaker Oatmeal squares are a good way to eat your daily bowl of oatmeal.<br /><br />These are small squares of lightly sweetened goodness. They are slightly sweetened with a hint of brown sugar. My favorite way to eat them is right out of the box, they are a great snack for a mid morning pick me up. But they do a hold to milk quite well and make a filling tasty breakfast.

review/text: This cereal has a pretty good taste for a healthy cereal.  The subtle hint of brown sugar is really good.  I also like how easy these are to eat as finger food instead of not so healthy munchies.  The nutritional information is impressive--low fat, lots of whole grains, low sugar.  It is still healthy cereal and won't curb my cravings for sweeter, not so healthy cereals, but it's not bad tasting at all.  Health-conscious people will enjoy this cereal.

review/summary: Good taste, crunchy in milk
review/text: Oatmeal Squares by Quaker is a good tasting cereal, although I personally don't think it tastes anything like Quaker oatmeal with brown sugar (I am a fan of the instant, hot cereal packs), which is what I was expecting.  The squares themselves are only tiny, about 1/2" so several fit on a spoonful at a time.  They are crunchy in milk, but the brown sugar is so subtle I didn't really notice it at first.<br /><br />I actually preferred the taste of these as a dry snack food (without milk) and then you get a better hint of brown sugar (although I still don't think they taste like oatmeal I was expecting!).  I still prefer my Quaker oatmeal as the instant, hot kind that you just tear open pack, add to a bowl, and pour hot water over.  Regardless, these Oatmeal Squares are just as filling as the hot oatmeal by Quaker, and a good way to start the morning.

review/text: My kid loves this stuff.  Not only do you get the awesome crunch but the hint of brown sugar makes you feel like you're eating something very naughty.  I would recommend this cereal as a nice snack in the car for a kid.  (seeing how my kid just loves this stuff).  Also buying in bulk from Amazon is not a bad way to go with their subscribe and save.  Assuming you don't mind getting 4 boxes of cereal at a time, the price is generally better than the supermarket.  It's definitely worth checking out.  Plus you get 4 at a time and don't have to leave the house which is never a bad thing.

review/summary: Addictive, and somewhat healthful
review/text: I love this cereal. It has a softly crunchy texture that softens up just so in milk, but is also fine to eat dry--you won't cut up your mouth on it. It's got 9 grams of sugar per serving, which is about three times what nutritionists recommend, but the first two ingredients are whole grain oats and whole grain wheat (sorry, not gluten-free)--sugar is third. A recent study suggested that eating a sweet treat at breakfast or early in the day seemed to stave off eating a lot more treat stuff later on. This is a fine, filling treat, with whole grains thrown in to boot.

review/text: This little squares combine the subtle flavor or oats with a hint of brown sugar.  The flavor is subtle and not too sweet.  Made with whole grains, the cereal provides five grams of fiber .  The little squares hold up well to soy ilk but are also good as a snack right out of the box.  I also used them as an ingredient in trail mix where they provided a welcome crunch.  I also used them  as training treats for my young German shepherd.  She loves them and they seem to be healthier than the usual.<br /><br />This is a nice cereal.  What you lack in gimmicks. excess sugar and fake flavor, you gain in in wholesome goodness.

review/summary: Very Crunchy Good Tasting Cereal
review/text: The Quaker Oatmeal Squares are great tasting in milk or right out of the box. Made with whole oat and wheat flours they are exceptionally crunchy wet or dry. Unlike other cereal squares, the Quaker Squares are more dense (higher fiber) and are ribbed and have a solid oat taste that seems only lightly sweetened. I like them in milk but routinely eat the squares dry for dessert.<br /><br />For a serving size of one cup, there are 210 calories, 2.5g of fat (.5g saturated), 190 mg of sodium, 9g of sugars (brown sugar and sugar), 5g of fiber, and 6g of protein.  Although this list may not be the best for some people, the Oatmeal Squares may be a good substitute for  the high fat and sugar cereals that children (and adults) like. I think the solid crunch of the squares that holds up in milk will appeal to children, and they will not miss the super sweet taste of their current favorites.<br /><br />The price of food world wide is increasing, so you can expect a substantial price point per 21g box. But, unlike other cereals in comparable box sizes, you can feel the higher weight of the Quaker Oatmeal Squares. The density of the cereal in milk gives you a long-lasting full feeling, and when eaten dry makes for a great dessert substitute for cookies.

Still, the  Quaker Oatmeal Squares floated in the milk -- and, didn't get mushy.  I can't stand mushy breakfast cereal.<br /><br />*  Quaker Oatmeal Squares didn't give me that bogged down, bloated feeling.  a "plus", if ya know what I mean.<br /><br />*  Easy to handle, the product also makes for a wonderful take anywhere sort of snack, like hiking, car trips, the zoo etc... as Quaker Oatmeal Squares didn't leave my fingers feeling extraordinarily sticky.  Makes for a different kind-of-snack at a Party or get together. Just pour dry Quaker Oatmeal Squares into a bowl and let your guests decide. :)<br /><br />*  Tastes Great -- even Dad loves it -- and, He thinks you will, as well.

review/summary: Awesome, pretty healthy, very tasty, not too sweet cereal
review/text: I've always loved this cereal, but it hasn't always been available in the various places I have lived.  From a texture standpoint, it's crunchy and robust, holding up well in milk without getting soggy.  But it's also not so crunchy or robust that it's unpalatable, like the straw- or raw-twine-like texture of some high fiber cereals.  It has a decent amount of fiber per serving (5 grams, which is kind of the cutoff for "healthy" cereals, in my opinion), and a pretty good slug of protein (6 grams, which is enough to make it fairly filling), and it has a good amount of whole grain oats.  And it is just perfect for my taste in terms of sweetness, having enough sugar that I don't need to add any, but not so much that I feel like I'm having dessert for breakfast.  Great stuff.

The pieces are small and crunchy but not hard.  The cereal holds up pretty well in milk but not so well in the box ~ the last 25% of the cereal was shredded vs. squares.

review/summary: Crunchy, Not Hard
review/text: Usually I eat Special K with Red Berries.  It's tasty, but it gets soggy in milk pretty fast, which I don't like much.  These Quaker Oatmeal Squares are firm but not hard.  They soften a bit, but do not get soggy by the time I finish eating them.  They are not overly sweet, despite the mention of brown sugar. They're good as an out-of-hand snack too.<br /><br />Getting down to the boring stuff, Quaker Oatmeal Squares have 210 calories per one cup serving, with 25 of the calories from fat.  This is considerably more calories than a one cup serving of Special K, but it's deceiving.  Due to the density of the product, you get a lot more actual cereal (and less air) in a cup of the Quaker Squares.  Measuring the two cereals by weight instead of volume would probably bring them much closer in calorie content.<br /><br />Although this breakfast cereal isn't my usual brand or type, I liked it a lot.  My husband, who does like his cereal to get soggy, liked it too.

review/text: I love cereal. I eat a lot of it. And, while these Oatmeal Squares are good, they won't be replacing my usual brands on my shopping list.<br /><br />The good: It's sweet enough but not too sweet. The squares are crunchy and they stayed crunchy in milk long enough for me to finish my bowl.<br /><br />The mediocre: There isn't much that is distinctive or special about this cereal. The flavor is quite bland.<br /><br />The not so good: This is marketed as a healthy cereal, but when I compared the nutritional information on the box to that on the other boxes of cereal in my cupboard, it didn't stand out on that front, either. It has about the same amount of sugar as a serving of my guilty pleasure sugary childhood favorite, not as much fiber as a serving of my grown-up favorite store brand raisin bran, and is higher in calories than either.<br /><br />With respect to whether or not I would recommend this cereal, I'm sort of neutral on that. As I said, I like it fine, I just don't love it. If you have had other Quaker brand cereals and liked them or if you like other oat-based cereals, then you might want to try this one.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: As another reviewer pointed out, these are great alone by the handful as a quick snack but also great for a morning cereal.  (or any other time you may want to eat a bowl of cereal, or course!)<br /><br />The squares are smaller than I had expected, but actually a prefect size - not too big and not too small.  They soften while sitting in milk, of course, but stay crunchy enough so that they are not all mushy by the time I get to the end of the bowl.  They also are not too sweet.  "hint of brown sugar" is a very accurate description.  You really don't need to add any sugar to these, they are great on their own and with milk.  (I actually eat them with vanilla almond milk rather than dairy).<br /><br />The fact that they have whole grains in them, 6 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber make them even more appealing to me.  One cup (serving size) of Quaker Oatmeal Squares with 1/2 cup of almond milk is just 255 calories.  this is a great way to start the day and fills me up as well.  I may try adding strawberries or bananas into the bowl for additional goodness!<br /><br />And yes, I plan to try the other flavors as well.  yum!

I love the taste, the crunchy texture, and the big bonus of excellent nutrition to start the day.<br /><br />This cereal has 90% of your RDA for Iron, 100% RDA of Folic Acid and 25% RDA of B6, Zinc and more. There are 46 grams of whole grains per serving, 6 grams of protein (not including milk), and 5 grams of dietary fiber.<br /><br />My kids even eat this cereal, and that says a lot for the deliciousness factor!<br /><br />You will find this cereal in our cabinets every single week.

review/summary: ~~perfect on-the-go snack~~
review/text: I had these sent to me at work so I shared and got some input from my coworkers as well.  The all around consensus was that this is a fantastic treat.  Granted, none of us ate this as it was marketed.  We all ate it dry and couldn't get enough.  Some of the comments included:<br /><br />1)  I don't care for a sweet cereal and this has just the right amount of brown sugar!<br />2)  Another coworker said, "I do like sweet cereal and think this is very good.  Can you get in the store yet?"<br />3)  A full cup per serving!  That's fantastic!<br />4)  These are more like a treat than a breakfast cereal.<br />5)  I can put these in a baggie in my purse for an on the go snack.  Awesome!<br /><br />We all agreed that this is something we'll look for the next time we go grocery shopping!

review/summary: Crunchy, but tasteless
review/text: I tried these squares this morning, but even with the addition of more brown sugar than what was in the product, they were tasteless!  I agree that they are crunchy, but I expected much more from the product, more on the order of Kellogg's Little Bites which even kids seem to eat with relish.  I don't know what I'm going to do with the remainder of the box as I can't recommend this product, but I hate to throw food away, even when I don't like it.

review/summary: Tastes like sweetened graham crackers
review/text: I eat my cereal with soymilk and I eat it any time of the day when I need a quick meal.  I am a cereal lover.  However, I am not impressed this Quaker Oatmeal Squares Oatmeal cereal.  It doesn't have the favors of grains I expect in a cereal.  Instead, it tastes like sweetened graham crackers, which I don't care for on the first place. The only good things I can say is that the cereal stays crunchy in soymilk and its small size fits the spoon well.  The manufacturer Quaker claims that the fiber in it will lower my cholesterol, but many cereals makers make that claim these days. This cereal is not for me.

review/summary: Fulfilling, not too sweet
review/text: Healthy is the first word that comes to mind when I think of this product.<br /><br />I've always loved oat products over corn or rice. It has, I think, more fiber, and the texture is simply more fulfilling for me personally. I love the oatmeal squares because it stays crunchy longer than most other cereals, and it's not super sweet. I eat this often not only for breakfast, but mostly for snacks. It's good on its own or with a bowl of milk.<br /><br />You can add fruits and it tastes great as well. My favorite is small pieces (not slices) of strawberries.<br /><br />Overall, it's super crunchy, very filling, and has great, light flavors. Highly recommended! Much much better than the other "health" cereals that can taste really bland, and this is tasty for both kids and adults, too.

review/summary: Can stop eating it!
review/text: I love this cereal, I buy it all the time to snack on. So, when I was given the opportunity to have it vine I took it. Normally, I get into work so early, that I don't have time to eat breakfast beforehand. So, I will bring in a box of cereal and munch on it. This cereal is one of my favorites. It is a great cereal to just munch on because of the size of the cereal.<br /><br />It is very crunchy, has a touch of sweetness, and tastes real good. It is pretty addicting for me, I am continuously popping one of these in my mouth.<br /><br />I am not much of a milk and cereal type of gal, so I haven't had this cereal in a bowl with milk so I can't tell you about the consistency it has with milk or anything like that. But I can tell you as a stand alone cereal just to snack on, this is one of the best!<br /><br />I mostly go for taste then health benefits. But, one of my healthy coworkers saw me eating this one day and was very surprise at how healthy this cereal is for you and taste good too. Lets see, on the box it says 46 grams of whole grains, 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of fiber. A cup of cereal has 210 calories, 2.5g fat, 190mg sodium, 44g carbohydrates which 9g of that is sugar. I don't know much about those numbers, I just know it tastes really good :)

review/summary: Good with or without milk!
review/text: My entire family loves these! They are very crunchy and just a little sweet. My boys like them as a dry cereal snack and I like them with milk. They don't get soggy to the point of not wanting to finish the bowl. I have also tried the Honey Nut flavor and found that I prefer the Brown Sugar.<br /><br />I put them in a box of things for snacks (portioned out into the smallest zip top bags) and my boys always eat these before anything else in the box. (It includes cereals, fruits, rice cereal treats, cookies and pretzels.)<br /><br />They're packed with lots of good things, too. Whole grains, fiber, protein, iron (hard to get into my boys diets) and not a lot of sugar make this a pretty great nutritious snack or breakfast cereal. We stay full longer after eating these too.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd pay the Amazon price though. It seems really high for cereal. Even with Subscribe and Save, it's over $5 a box and I'm pretty sure it's less than that at WalMart. Of course, if you're like me and have to drive 30 minutes to the closest grocery store, the delivery convenience may be worth it with the way gas prices are around here.

review/summary: One of the best tasting cereals on the market
review/text: I was hesitant to try Quaker Oatmeal Squares because they resembled Mini Wheats cereal which I am not a fan of. But because it was from Quaker I gave it a shot and I am glad I did. I was shocked how much I liked this cereal.  The taste is great and the hint of brown sugar gives it just the right amount of sweetness. The first time I tried it I had finished my first bowl and poured another one. This is a really good cereal and I highly recommend trying it out.

review/text: My family is pretty picky when it comes to cereal, so we were a little skeptical in trying Quaker Oatmeal Squares. Luckily, we were pleasantly surprised. Even the pickiest of eaters gobbled them up. They have a nice, slightly sweet flavor and a great crunch to them. As a mom, I love that they are whole grain & nutritional. I will be adding them to our cereal rotation. Thanks, Quaker for making something nutritious and delicious!

review/summary: Cold Oatmeal?
review/text: This breakfast cereal by Quaker is really good.  The cereal is squared shaped oatmeal that is prepared with milk and eaten cold.  This is a fresh twist on an old classic because when I think of Quaker oatmeal I imagine it warm, not cold.  The cereal is promoted by saying it has a hint of brown sugar and it is true.  The taste of brown sugar is very, very subtle, but there.<br /><br />This cereal also is a heart healthy product and provides more fiber than an average bowl of cereal.  Another nice perk is it doesn't become soggy as soon as the milk hits it.  This might be a good way to have kids eat a healthier breakfast cereal.  I know that I enjoyed it and would purchase it again.

review/summary: A Nice Alternative to Spoon Size Shredded Wheat
review/text: One of the things I appreciated about this product is no sorbitol included; all of the sweetness comes from natural sources including brown sugar and sugar. The grains are all whole grain and include a broad spectrum of vitamins. The size of the individual squares is smaller than one typically gets with a shredded wheat product and they maintained their crispiness much longer. The sodium content is reasonably low at 190 mg and the dietary fiber is respectable at 5 grams as is the protein at 6 grams.<br /><br />The taste is pleasant and that, along with the sustained crispiness makes for a nice change from shredded wheat and raisin bran. This one is worth a try.

review/text: I have to give the stuff a good rating because I have liked it enough to say, make it my breakfast for the past 15 years. BUT it has become inordinately expensive here in early 2012.  Recently Quaker reduced the weight from 16 oz. to 14.5 oz. and at the same time the price went from about $3/box to $4.75/box! WTF?!  Sad to say I'm still eating it--it's good.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is a very tasty protein drink but a little high in calories for me, although absolutely fine for any males out there. I'd compare it to Muscle Milk in taste, which means it tastes very very good. It has 360 calories (about 160 calories too high for me), 20 grams of protein, and about 50 grams of carbs (also too high for me, but not too high as a recovery drink or for someone who can consume more carbs than I can).<br /><br />I tasted this and thought it was delicious, but since it doesn't fit my diet, I gave it to my 11 year old son who loved it and could definitely use the extra calories (we often get him supplemental shakes because he's kind of thin and can eat and eat yet has trouble gaining weight).<br /><br />Recommended for taste and if its makeup fits your eating /exercise plan.

review/text: I'm a Soldier currently stationed in Baghdad and, unlike the majority of my brethren, I live on an isolated Iraqi base without access to the US quality dining facilities provided by KBR.  Thus, I have to rely on pre-packaged, shelf-stable, commercial foods for sustenance, most of which are bland and generally bad for morale.  In this sea of carbohydrate mediocrity, however, I have found a diamond in the rough: the Gatorade series of nutrition shakes!<br /><br />I've drunk protein shakes before and most of them taste like medicine to a lesser or greater extent, but you force them down because of the perceived benefit.  These Gatorade shakes are genuinely tasty and what's more, they fill you up for a good three or four hours after you've drunk one.  While they all taste good, the chocolate is by far the best, with the vanilla and strawberry close behind depending on your taste.  I recommend these shakes as either a post-recovery drink or as a meal replacement and best of all, you don't have to go to Iraq to get one.

review/summary: Sports Drink
review/text: I do recommend you follow the labeling on the can, which is to serve this product very cold. I followed this advice and the taste is creamy chocolate, but it left an oily after taste in my mouth. I would avoid drinking this warm. I have had a smaller drink from another company that had better taste, more filling and no aftertaste.<br /><br />For its intended purpose, keeping athletes bodies fueled for training or competition, it is probably a good product. But I do not agree with Gatorade that it would be an item to be used as a "bridge between meals". If you were not working out, this would not be a good meal substitute since for the calorie count vs. feeling satisfied that you have eaten is just not there.<br /><br />I would only purchase this product for use when you actually need fuel for working out or competing and not any sort of meal replacement. But even then, it would not be my first choice.

review/summary: Be aware of ALL the nutrition in Gatorade's Nutrition Shake
review/text: First of all, I really enjoyed the flavor of the chocolate Nutrition shake in the Gatorade Performance Series.  Delicious, really, maybe not quite ice cream frappe-calibre, but I was very impressed, enjoyed it fully, and it would certainly satisfy any desert craving.<br /><br />That out of the way, I am simply not the athlete qualified to ever drink one of these shakes.  I felt almost as guilty drinking this shake as I would if I was eating a pint of Ben & Jerry's.  Well, at least a half-pint;  Eight grams of fat (1.5g saturated) is maybe not the worst, but after running four or five miles to lose the fat, I don't want to take them back in with a beverage.  I'd rather have them in a big steak.<br /><br />The carbs are what get me; 54 grams.  That is a LOT of energy, 34 of them from sugar(s).  This is a 10K-supply of carbohydrate replenishment in my book!  If you're trying to bulk up, this is probably a great drink for you.  The 270mg of sodium is high, and I was surprised to see that there's 5% of your daily intake of cholesterol in there as well.  The 20g of protien was nice.<br /><br />In short, it seems to me that this drink is good for those with rapid metabolisms who are looking to gain wieght.  There certainly is a lot of nutrition in each can, probably ideal for wightlifters, but for those who are trying to slim down, I would not advise popping any of these open unless you're looking for dessert.

review/text: Not bad for a nutrition drink. I was actually suprised that it tasted as good as it did.  Very rich and choclately.  I drank it very cold and well shaken, so didn't notice things some of the other reviewers have.<br /><br />If you are very active, short on time, and need a blast of nutrients, you could do worse than this.  Be sure to read the ingredients though.  While it has some good vitamins and minerals, it is also loaded with sugar and other indecipherable ingredients.  Personally, I'd rather make my own smoothie and know what I'm puting in it.  360 calories is a lot, so be sure that this is combined with excercise.<br /><br />It tastes good, but is not for me.  I would recommend it to active individuals with limited options and sweet tooth however.

The taste was excellent and it makes for a good meal replacement.<br /><br />What I didn't like about it was the high sugar content - 34 grams. Also, there seems to be a lot of chemicals in it, which makes me wonder about the nutritional value. The nutrition label lists items like 25% iodine and I'm not sure that I need that much iodine (or riboflavin for that matter).<br /><br />The Chocolate Gatorade Nutrition Shake tasted good and I might use is as an occasional meal replacement, but I wouldn't drink it on a regular basis.

review/summary: Pretty tasty, good for the active individual.
review/text: Well, I was a bit curious what a "Gatorade" brand milkshake would be like.  As I've found out with the Chocolate flavor, it tastes quite good, just like a good chocolate milkshake.<br />Now, the caloric content for 11 ounces is 360 calories, including 8g of fat (12% daily value) 15 mg cholesterol, 270 mg sodium, 54g of carbs, and so it's recommended that you be rather active, or else drinking these too much will just help you put on weight.  (They base their percentages on a 2000 calorie diet).<br /><br />I could see these also being a suitable substitute for the occasional lunch or breakfast if you're in a hurry.  And as far as milkshakes go, it's just as tasty as your average chocolate milkshake, but you also get a lot of added vitamins, including 100% of your daily vitamin C, 30% of your calcium and 40% of your vitamin E, in addition to a good selection of other essential vitamins.  So, it would seem a bit healthier in that regard than your average milkshake.<br /><br />So all in all, I'd say I'm pretty pleased.  They recommend it as a protein boost after workouts, or as a bridge between meals for the active person.

review/text: I don't suppose there is any reason that this shake should not be delicious.  Gatorade used generous amounts of sugar, fat and protein (along with natural and artificial flavors).  The total calorie count here is 360 which is probably about right as a "bridge between meals" which is how it is intended to be used.<br /><br />Bottom line--it is pretty much what you would expect from a chocolate shake (with some added protein).

All the consumer gets is inferior (possibly even mildly toxic) ingredients in snazzy packaging.

review/summary: tasty but high-calorie
review/text: This is gatorade?  It tastes like somebody combined the sweetness of children's Quik chocolate milk and the richness  of the more adult Horizon chocolate milk.  I never even noticed the load of vitamins and electrolytes that are present.  No chalky aftertaste or weird textures like old-time nutrition shakes, either, at least when served cold as recommended.<br /><br />Diet-watchers should be aware of its high calorie load (54g of carbs, 360 calories total).<br /><br />Other thoughts: The can is a lot heavier than it needs to be (it took both hands for me to crumple it in from the center and I'm far from weak), it would be more eco-friendly to make the can lighter-weight.

review/summary: Decent, but nothing special
review/text: First, I echo other reviewers' comments that this really should be very cold before you even consider drinking it. I made the mistake of taking a luke warm sip, and it tasted like putty.<br /><br />Assuming that it's chilled, this actually has a pretty good chocolate flavor. The calorie content is high, so it's really best for larger men, or those who workout. To be fair, Gatorade has printed very clearly on the bottle that it's intended for athletes, so I'm confused by some of the reviewers to criticize the high calorie content. It's not meant to be a simple meal replacement for the average person, and shouldn't be reviewed as such.<br /><br />That being said, this is the sort of product that I would grab in a pinch, but wouldn't go out of my way to buy.

review/summary: Tastes great, but is less filling
review/text: I really liked the chocolate taste - similar to Slim-fast - but as is printed on the can it tastes better cold.  I didn't find it filling enough as a replacement for a breakfast meal (for men), but feel it would be perfect as a between-meal drink.  Women may be able to use it as a meal-replacement, however.  I asked a body-builder/personal trainer friend what he thought of it, and based only on the can he thought it would be fine as explained above.  His only comment was that 8 fat grams was a bit higher than he'd prefer, but otherwise looked good.

review/text: I have tasted a few nutrition/weight loss shakes in my time, and this was pretty much like the others.  I liked the chocolate taste.  To me, it actually tasted a lot like Slimfast or some generic grocery store versions I've tasted.  After only one serving, I can't really rate the product on the nutrition aspect.  I may buy more cans and drink them for breakfast.  It's low fat and lo cal, so it's something I can drink quickly and better than skipping breakfast altogether.  Also, I highly recommend that you drink this very cold.  The taste is definitely better cold.

review/text: Both my husband and I LOVED the Taco Bell Chipotle sauce, so I was excited to try this one as well.  Boy were we disappointed! It has a creamy base, but tastes awful! It has an oniony, over-seasoned flavor and leaves a fake cheese-like aftertaste (like eating old stadium nachos).  I would HIGHLY recommend the Chipotle sauce (it's more of a spicy ranch flavor) and COMPLETELY PASS on this one!!

review/summary: Good sauces...
review/text: I tried two of the Taco Bell sauces: the Spicy Ranchero and the Chipotle. Both are tasty and reminiscent of the Southwest Sauce served in Subway stores. (A personal favorite.)<br /><br />I tried the Chipotle in a beef taco and the Ranchero with chicken. In neither case was the flavor overpowering. They were just nice flavor additions, a little extra zing, to an otherwise good meal.<br /><br />Of the two sauces, though, I gotta say I like the Chipotle best. The spiciness lingers longer. But not in a "get me some water now!" way. Just a nice added zing.<br />Overall, I think they are both flavorful. Worth having around for the occasional Mexican treat.

review/summary: Used as a condiment, these sauces offer a lot of flavor.
review/text: I had the opportunity to sample and evaluate 3 different flavors of Taco Bell's bottled sauces. These were the Jalapeno, Chipotle and Spicey Ranchero flavors. Of the 3, I personally liked the Jalapeno flavor the most with the Spicey Ranchero coming in a close second. The flavors are bold so a little sauce goes a long way.<br /><br />I approached this evaluation from the standpoint that these sauces are condiments, like ketchup or mustard, and not just sauces that you might put on your tacos and burritos. That said, I tasted each flavor on fish sticks with pleasant results. The only sauce I did NOT like on them was the Chipotle sauce, which I feel might be better suited to dishes that include beef. The Jalapeno and Spicy Ranchero both work really well with fish (and would be great for fish tacos) as well as chicken. Used as a condiment, these sauces can add a new flavor experience to everything from deli sandwiches to casseroles. I added about 2 tbsp of the Spicey Ranchero to a batch of left over rice along with some cheese and a bit of sour cream to make a great side dish. A lot of recipes that call for mayo might be livened up or rejuvenated with a measure of your favorite sauce.

review/summary: A bit too strong a flavor for salads
review/text: I like spice, so I was eager to try this product.  Generally, I like basic bottled Seven Seas or Kraft Italian dressing, but the name Taco Bell intrigued me.  I tried some on salad.  First of all, the dressing is extremely thick.  I didn't like its texture.  Flavor-wise, I found the dressing far overpowered the salad, made up of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers.  The dressing is far too heavy, both in flavor and texture, for folks who enjoy fresh salads.<br /><br />What I tend to do with bottled Italian dressing is add black pepper.  This gives the dressing a nice kick but doesn't smother the gentle flavor of the vegetables.  The dressing might work as a dip for tortilla chips or crackers, but as a topping for salad, it gets a low score.<br /><br />Taco Bell is an immediately recognizable brand name in the fast food world, and the company is evidently using that popularity to have its name appear on items in the supermarket.  As far as Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce is concerned, I'd pass.

review/summary: My "Special" Treat I Add To Healthy Foods
review/text: I have just bought the book by Dr Ornish as well as the book by Dr Esselstyn. Watched forks over knives DVD, and especially loved the DVD called FAT, SICK & NEARLY DEAD....Had a heart attack a year ago so really trying to clean up my act. I want to go the way of Dr Esselsyn but I keep back sliding since my health is not yet near any life & death situation. Yet, at age 62 I see why NOW is the time to change! I never had any cholesterol issues either until AFTER they put me on Statins and other beta blockers etc. It DOUBLED in 4 months. SO MUCH FOR Doctors and their medicine on MY old self....<br /><br />  I went back to my juicing and using my VitaMix and in the past 60 days lost over 40 pounds. My wife makes me Vegan wraps and this is where my TACO Bell "treats come into the picture. I just add 6 (yes exactly 6) DROPS to these wraps that each contain less than 90 calories. Along with a dinner salad, that is all I have for diner so the assorted Taco Bell sauces are my TREAT. Now they are not what most ANY doctor I have read would say is a good choice. But I am not using them as most would. I use them as an accent flavor enhancer to add some darn flavor to my very limited diet. And it works great! I have now kept my weight off over 4 months and continue to lose a couple pounds per week since I went back to Cheerios & skim milk for breakfast along with my juicing part time. I (so far) like this and the Taco Bell Jalepno sauce the best. So I have to give this 4 full stars for how it helps ME....If I used it as you are supposed to I would lower it to 2 stars as I do not feel it is a healthy choice. but used in moderation I can feel like I am eating that good old junk food and yet keeping my cholesterol down below 175. How can I not love this stuff?

review/summary: Bad combo: mediocre taste and high in calories.
review/text: I'm a big fan of Taco Bell, and was eager to try their new Bold and Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce.  I ate it with some homemade Mexican food.  To be honest, I probably will not be using it again due to a few issues:<br /><br />- Poor taste.  It appears they are going for a combination of Ranch and Chipotle flavor.  It just didn't go well at all with my nachos.  While I still ate it, it's definitely not a flavor you'll be rushing to have on your food.<br /><br />- Not Spicy.  While it claims to be spicy, it is certainly not.  I would compare it to "medium" level Taco Bell sauce.<br /><br />- High in calories.  Two tablespoons have 110 calories and 100 fat calories.  You are better off using some spicy flavorful picante sauce (which is much lower in calories).<br /><br />I would not recommend this product, even to Taco Bell fans.

review/summary: Hot Sauce Meets Salad Dressing
review/text: This creamy sauce is pretty good. Is it a culinary masterpiece? No, but as with most things at the grocery that come in a plastic bottle, it's good enough for the day-to-day meal. This ranchero sauce has a lot of flavor. It's not super hot; the creamy factor keeps it in check. It has a noticeable garlic taste, but it's good.<br /><br />I've tried this sauce on just about everything, and it has been a nice change of pace. Naturally, this sauce spices up Mexican dishes nicely, especially ones with lots of fresh tomatoes. However, I have also enjoyed it on hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, and chicken. The best way I can describe this item is "spicy salad dressing." If you like to dump creamy salad dressing on random foods, which I do, then this sauce will add some fun to your dinners. And caloriewise, it's about what you'd expect from creamy dressing, 110 calories per 2 tablespoons.

I didn't have any interest in the ranchero sauce so put it off for a while but now that I have finally tried it I am pleasantly surprised. It's an interesting mix of a ranch sauce with a chipotle sauce, a little of each, not too strong, just enough to have you wondering what the flavors are in the sauce. I've used it on sandwiches and tacos so far and I can see it going with a lot of things. Of the three Taco Bell sauces this is my favorite, recommended.

review/summary: Delicious at home Taco Bell
review/text: After trying both the Chipotle as well as the Spicy Ranchero sauces I was very happy that Taco Bell decided to branch out their at home selection.<br /><br />When using this sauce with the Taco Belle taco seasoning you get a taco that is pretty close to the flavor that you would get if you went to the restaurant but it's not quite there.<br /><br />Honestly this can be much better though for a few reasons. First you can use your own fresh ingrediants, you don't have to leave the house (just order it here or get during your normal grocery shopping), and lastly, you don't have to deal with the fast food experience; lines, rude cashiers, people that don't wash their hands, and you can save a little money.<br /><br />All in all this is a great way to get a Taco Bell fix in your own kitchen. And if I had to choose one over the other I would easily pick the Chipotle sauce, Mmmm.

The serving size is the aforementioned two tablespoons. It taste good just be aware of its high fat content and calories. When serving size is measured by the spoon full you know the calories are high. But a single spoonful goes a long way. I would consider purchasing this as my second choice of the three sauces. Does give some of that Taco Bell flavoring.
