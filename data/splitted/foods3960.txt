review/summary: It's o.k. -- but quite bland in my opinion
review/text: I am a huge chocolate addict. At times this presents a problem as I not only try to eat a low fat/low sodium diet but a more natural one with organic foods. There are many chocolate items I grew up with that I love but that are not necessarily natural or organic. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y5M">Nutella Hazelnut Spread, 13-Ounce Plastic Jar (Pack of 5)</a> is one of those products. Try as I might I just cannot stop buying it!<br /><br />When I found this spread at a local organic store I had to try it. I was eagerly anticipating that it would replace that "other" product for me. While it has the same type of creamy consistency it just lacked in the flavor department. It was not very chocolatey or nutty - in fact it was so mild that I didn't even notice any sort of nutty flavor much. In addition when you put this on toast that is hot/warm it melts VERY quickly which means unless you spread it very thin it is runny and drippy. I probably don't need to go much further since you get the picture (runny/drippy spread + trying to grab a quick breakfat + business attire = disaster). I do not have the same problem with the other spread I like -- it may get a little less firm but it does not run and drip everywhere. Of course if you only want a very *thin* spread this one would do nicely if you can compromise a bit on the taste which is blander than I prefer.<br /><br />In the end, for the cost and the issues, I just didn't think this was a winner. I would have done 2 stars BUT if you really want natural/organic and will spread this thin and watch the drippies it is better than some of the rest that is out there.

review/summary: Make your own unless price is no object
review/text: This is one of the top makers in the world.  They also have premium herbs.  You see the white crocks in Williams-Sonoma and here at Amazon.  They make some of the best mustards in the world as well.  The problem is the import cost.  For the delivered price of this one SMALL ceramic cup, serving two people at most, I buy a half a case in Paris. The ceramic cups are nice and reusable.<br /><br />This is also their "everyday" mix.  Fine stuff without a doubt, but it is not their signature recette.  If cost matters to you, get a good double boiler, top grade melting chocolate and whatever flavorings.  I have to give all five stars for flavor, ease of use and for quality, but the price will drive most of us off. BUT...It is easy to reach for and will impress for a special occasion!

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: Living in New York City, most people know Jacques Torres as a premium chocolatier. However my recent experience ordering Valentine's day chocolate has shown me otherwise. I ordered three boxes of chocolates for my sweetheart. The order cost nearly [...] which included [...] for 2nd day shipping. I recieved the chocolates promptly within two days of placing the order. When my girlfriend opened the box the contents were scrambled around inside the box. A couple of chocolates were broken (something you wouldn't expect for a truffle which has a soft center). This was my first alert that something was wrong. Biting into the chocolate the truffle was stiff, flavorless and had a moldy taste. This isn't the worst of it. I promptly called Mr. Chocolates (the Jacques Torres Website) and explained my dissatisfaction with the order I've recieved. Stephanie, at the phone number I called, said I need to send an email explaining my dissatifisfaction with the order. She said she would check with her superiors and let me know what they are going to do about it. I never got a response to my email so I sent a follow up email two days later. Her response at that time was that she still didn't know what they can do about replacing my order but that she would notify me when they decide what to do. Well now it's been a week and still no response. I'm extremely dissapointed with the lack of their customer response, the quality of the chocolates and their inability to promptly handle my complaint. Truly not worth ordering chocolates from Jacque Torres! Don't waste your time or money on these guys. BTW I wouldn't even give them one star except I wasn't able to post a review unless I gave them at least one.

The mustard is the vinegar-heavy yellow mustard, but unlike the Beach Cliff mustard fish completely dominated by vinegar, I could actually taste these Brunswick fish. The mustard/dill gives a pleasant tangy zip. I don't think mustard sardines are going to replace my standby sardines in tomato sauce, but these guys are good for a change.

review/text: I order this food to try as it was grain free and I liked the ingredients listed on the site with the reviews. I opened the bag and the smell was incredible. It almost made me hungry lol. The dog loves it and is doing well on it.<br />  I start doing more research on the food and was very impressed. The owners of this food make sure ethoxyquin, BHA and BHT (which are knowing to cause cancer) are NOT used at all in the food. They make sure that the slaughter and processing plants do not use them either. That is great and it show that they care as well.<br />  I have communicated with the Petcurean and have been very impressed with them as well. I am really happy with this food. It has very good ingredients. he company is great. I highly recommended this good and I have tired several different grain free dog foods.  Plus my dog loves it.<br />  Thank you amazon. i would have never found it without amazon.

review/summary: Lucy loves it!
review/text: I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I am so happy with this food that I felt it was necessary! I was nearly at my wits end before I purchased this. When we adopted our Basset Hound, Lucy, a few months ago we started feeding her Innova from the get go. She had loose stools, but we figured it was just because it was a different food than what she ate at the rescue. We fed her pumpkin with the food, and she did great, but she also would not eat from then on without the pumpkin. We weened her off of the pumpkin, and as soon as we did she had loose stools/diarrhea again. Kept trying for a few weeks. It never let up, and she still had no real interest in eating the food at all. She would not eat for a day until she was starving. We nearly took her to the costly vet to see if she had some sort of digestive issue.<br /><br />We did some further research, and discovered that Innova was bought by P&G, and that there were many people that had been feeding for 10 years and suddenly started having loose stools so we decided it might just be the food. We immediately switched her to Petcurean Now!, and immediately her stool turned normal even though we did not phase it in. Lucy *loves* the taste of this food. We put it down, and she eats every last morsel without having to coax her. She is excited for meal time finally!<br /><br />I am so very content with this purchase. It is worth the slightly higher price tag if you want a happy, healthy dog.

review/text: My dog is prone to allergies requiring treatment with steroids and antihistamines at least twice a year.  Since beginning this food his allergies have all but gone away.  I switched him directly to this food without gradually introducing it with no problems.  The food produces well formed compact stools which is a plus if he has an accident in the house.  Not that much more expensive than other "high quality" dog foods that contain grains and meal.

Nine days after the order, it had not even shipped. And while it was shipped via Fedex, the Fedex tracking says the order will take about 6 to 7 days to deliver.

review/text: Like many pet owners, our 7-month-old Lhasa pup suddenly is getting picky, picky about her food.  The Now Dry Puppy Food is the eighth brand (wet and dry) I have tried and I am holding my breath because she actually ate a helping of it and why I gave it a 4 star rating.  It is also wonderful to be able to buy it in smaller quantities than 6, 10 or 15 pound bags only to find out she will not eat it and we donate bag after bag of dog food to our neighbors. I don't believe she is allergic to any of the brands but I think she is holding out for a human food menu.  I have high hopes for the Now Puppy Formula and will update this review when there is a change-positive or negative.<br /><br />Update:  Once again I thought our picky eater pup was going to turn her nose up at NOW on the third day but when I laid some kibble on the floor, she gobbled it up.  She likes wet food and pieces of meat in her bowl and dry food on the floor.  This is our third Lhasa and this adorable pup provides us with so many first experiences. The hunt for the perfect food for our picky eater is over.  I feed her Redbarn Premium Variety Pack Food Rolls cut up in treat-size pieces for all day treats and lay NOW dry food and extra supplement cubes (all combined to equal her daily allowance) on the floor in her exercise pen for her to eat at her leisure until just after her last meal of the day and what is left is taken away and all food and treats are suspended until breakfast the next morning.

review/text: My dog and foster dogs have done well on this food. It is the best priced quality grain free food there is to my knowledge. Amazon's price beats my local stores (including Petco when you factor in the sales tax I pay when I buy in the store). As an Amazon prime customer I was thrilled to see this included in free 2 day shipping- absolutely can't beat this deal!<br />Amazon shipped it in a cardboard box about the same size as the bag and it arrived with the box looking quite the worse for wear. Since Wellness comes in a Mylar bag the bag itself was fine and I was home so brought it right in. If you were  not going to be home when this was delivered and your deliveries are left outside I would be concerned about other animals getting to it. Even with the Mylar bag my dog can rip into this in no time flat and racoons and rats (I live next to a wooded area!) love dog food! Probably not a big deal mid-day but just something to consider. I would not buy food that ships in a paper bag from Amazon- at least not a larger bag (>15lbs) but that is just my experience/opinion. I am thrilled that amazon offers this and would order again from them but will make sure I am home when it is to be delivered.

review/summary: Wellness, Indeed!
review/text: Upon researching dog health I was appalled to discover that most dog foods (especially the most popular brands) use grains (as their main ingredients) and fillers. I then found a few lists of "five-star" dog foods, compared them, and chose to give Wellness CORE a try.<br /><br />Admittedly it is much more expensive than the popular commercial brand we had been using but,"according to the web site of one of the most popular brands of dog food sold in the U.S., the feeding instructions tell you that a thirty pound dog would need to eat around three cups of food per day. The cost of this pet food breaks down to being about $.67 per cup. So that means Fido would eat $2.01 worth of dog food each day according to the recommended feeding instructions on the label.<br /><br />But on the other hand, from a web site of a high end, all human grade ingredients, all U.S. ingredients dog food -- the feeding instructions tell you that a thirty pound dog would need to eat around 1 � cups of food per day. The cost of this food is about $1.16 per cup. This food seems to be about twice as expensive as the popular brand. However, according to the recommended feeding amount, Fido would eat $1.74 worth of dog food each day. That's a savings of $.27 per day to feed your dog a high quality, human grade ingredients, no risky imports dog food." [[....]]<br /><br />It's true! My dogs eat half of what they used to and their bowel movements have also decreased by half. (I read that because the good foods contain the true nutritional needs of a dog as opposed to the bad foods that are relatively low in delivering their nutritional needs that dogs would "go" less frequently by feeding them a good food. This is because dogs would expel the unneeded grains and fillers in the bad food more often). I walk and feed my dogs in the morning and in the evening and both dogs would "go" 2-4 times between both walks and both meals. Now my 60 lb pit mix "goes" just once daily and my 20 lb terrier/lab mix "goes" just twice.<br /><br />I also read that bad foods contributed to a dogs allergies and bloating. My pit mix would have these huge disgusting "eye boogers" all day long no matter how often I'd wipe his face and my terrier mix had these dark (his coat is a sandy color) tear stains from his constantly watering eyes. Not anymore! The "eye boogies" have disappeared and the tear stains are gone! Although I never noticed any bloating in my little dog I did notice that my muscular pit mix had a "fat" stomach. Needless to say that is gone as well!<br /><br />Lastly, I noticed that both dogs have been shedding less and that their coats are so much softer and shinier. What pleasant surprises! Having a skeptical demeanor it's actually VERY surprising to me that there have been so many benefits to purchasing a quality food. I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase! Thumbs up Wellness Core!

review/text: I have 2 allergy-prone French Bulldogs & it took many many years of experimentation with every type of dog food.  Finally a year ago... I came upon this product: WELLNESS CORE OCEANFISH & it was the absolute best food they ever had.  I am 100% pleased with this product & their health, as a result.  My bulldogs are fed this product 2x per day; I mix a little dry with the WELLNESS Oceanfish wet + a little water.  Their allergies have improved & they haven't been bored eating this everyday... They have now been on this food for over 1 year & I highly recommend it!  Great for bulldogs in particular!

review/summary: Best Dog food ever.
review/text: We switched from wellness puppy to wellness core and our boxers just love the taste.  It not only has great taste, but the ingredients are pure and so healthy for dogs.  We noticed a signifiant decrease to their flatulance and their coats are so shiny!  Definately recommend to anyone who considers their dogs health above a bargain priced dog food at the supermarket.<br /><br />Update 3 August 2011<br />** Although the food is still fantastic, the last three orders I've purchased through Amazon have resulted in bags that were partially sliced open and leaking kibble all throughout the inside of the shipping box.  The first two times I thought it was just a coincidence, no big deal.  But this has become a recurring problem and it poses health concerns for my dogs now.  Since I love amazon, I'm willing to try it one more time however if it happens again, I'll be searching for my food elsewhere.

review/text: I have a 2 year old wheaten terrier that's been on Wellness Core for about 6 months.  Very happy with the results, he's a very fit and and active dog.  Wheatens are supposedly not good with wheat oddly enough.  This is one of the highest rated foods by dogfoodanalysis.com and it's pretty easy to find locally now.  I haven't found this through a Prime vendor yet but I keep hoping.<br /><br />***Update -coming up on 4 years soon and this formula is hard to find at local stores. I like giving him the variety of the different flavors...

review/summary: Great Substitute for the Expensive RX Hill's brand
review/text: To those of you spending way too much on prescription food; give this a try. My dog is highly allergic to just about everything. Prior to feeding her Wellness Core; I tried every other brand out there no matter how expensive (Nutro, Blue Buffalo), you name it! Nothing has worked as well as this. Even the slightest change in her diet would cause yeast problems in her ears, reddness and irritation of the skin, chewing her feet, and itchy gums. I have been feeding it for almost a year and have seen total improvement. Not too sure about the mold problem the other person has mentioned. I buy this religiously and have not had any problems with the quality of the food. The only negative I have is that my dog seems a bit more gassy than usual but I'll deal with that as long as all those other syptoms have gone away.

review/summary: Excellent food, and my dog LOVES it
review/text: What can I say? This dog food is one of the best, among the relatively short list of dog foods on dogfoodanalysis.com receiving their maximum rating of 6 stars. The ingredients are top tier and carefully chosen with your dog's well-being in mind. And apparently it's also delicious, because my dog LOVES it! When I set her food bowl down, she drools on the floor if I wait even just a few seconds to tell her she can eat. She had never ever done this before, and she started doing it the day I started mixing it into her food and has done it since.<br /><br />Plus, it's great for her. I'm not even halfway through this bag and already her coat is improving! I transitioned slowly from her old food and she has had no negative reactions to it whatsoever. If your dog tolerates this food (all dogs are different of course), you can be confident they will thrive on it. Oh and lastly, Wellness is more readily available than most other holistic grain-free foods, which is very convenient--I buy mine at Petco.

review/summary: Great dog food. Palatable & good ingredients!
review/text: Few things good about this product:<br />1. Made by Wellness. No recalls of any kind thus far. I am really paranoid about having a sick pet with a 3-4 figured vet bill, so that is something I look out for a lot.<br />2. Ingredients is a lot better than most foods.<br />3. Palatable. My dog kinda hates Wellness but would eat down Wellness Core products literally right away.<br />4. High Fiber. 7% if I am not wrong. What made me try this food was that my dog had constantly soft stools at one point in time. So I saw the high fiber percentage, and I decided to try this out. My dog had really solid poop after that! It helped a lot for me so hopefully will be the same for you.<br />5. Relatively reasonably priced. About $1.80/pound.<br />6. No ethoxyquin preservative used.<br /><br />Way(s) this product is "sub-par" compared to the "very top" products. (This is really no biggie at all, but I just decided to write this because for some it might be an issue)<br />1. Dried varieties of certain products as opposed to fresh ones, such as dried ground potato instead of fresh ones.<br />2. Canola oil used instead of salmon oil which is a cost cutting measure used by the company. Dogs can't digest canola oil so the omega levels provided by it are pretty much just for marketing purposes only.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't really be concerned with the "cons" of the product if you even consider it as a con to start with.<br />This is a really good product that is priced pretty reasonable for its quality.<br />I would feel safe about feeding my dog this based upon the manufacturer's reputation of not having any recalls in its history.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: This food rocks for our pooches!
review/text: We've been using Wellness CORE Grain-free (original) dry dog food for several years and it really shows! We began a grain free diet with one of our dogs about 15 years ago due to seasonal allergies (the vet had actually recommended going grain free). There are other really great brands of grain free out there, however, we've just stayed with Wellness CORE because it works. We get so many compliments one how our dogs have super soft, shiny coats and their eyes are clear and bright. They love their CORE and we only feed them dry. It is so worth the extra cost to feed a high quality dog food ~ grain free or not. Their bellies are full with great food ~ no additives, by products, etc. Both dogs that we originally started on CORE have since passed...but lived to the ripe old age of 17 and 19. Hopefully, our two current dogs (7 years and 9 months) will do the same! Highly recommend this food.

review/summary: A True Five Star Dog Food
review/text: I tried everything with my female Border Collie before I found Wellness.  She came to my family from a rescue where she was fed Innova.  She wasn't doing well on the Innova, so we switched her to Solid Gold.  That didn't work out, as she was having an excess of bowel movements after six months of being on the food.  From Solid Gold, we switched to Orijen, which was fantastic but very expensive and didn't have the same result as Wellness Core.  This is the only food I use now- I swear by it.  After taking in thirty foster dogs, I have fed exclusively Wellness Core and have never had a complaint about the high quality of the food.<br /><br />It is true that not all dogs have the same nutritional requirements, so I am sure there are plenty of dogs who do well on Innova, Solid Gold, or Orijen and do not do well on Wellness Core.  However, this is one of the few companies I trust to deliver consistant quality and high standards of healthy dog food for my pets.<br /><br />Well done Wellness!!

review/summary: Food Great - Handling Crap
review/text: The food is awesome. Even though it is just for my 14 year old that has weight issues, all my dogs love it.<br /><br />The problem I had was the bag arrived with a huge tear in it that had been taped shut. The box was undamaged so it was clearly shipped this way. The tear was a good 8 inches long, down the front of the bottom half of the bag. I was wary about using it, but we were running out of our previous bag.<br /><br />Now I am 1/3 of the way through (the bottom 1/3 of the bag because we dump the bags into airtight containers) and I find this huge wad of molded kibble clumped together. Clearly it got wet while it was ripped open! Where are they storing these bags?! And clearly whoever taped it shut either ripped it and knew it got water in it, or was not the one that ripped it and taped it at a later time not knowing what could have possibly happened to the food in the time between. Both are unacceptable practices. Are they so stupid they don't realize they could kill dogs doing stupid stuff like that?<br /><br />So now I have 2/3 of a bag of kibble I cannot feed without risking making my dog sick, and I have nothing here to feed him. I'll have to buy something else local and switch him cold turkey which is going to upset his digestive system. Wasting my money isn't cool. Making my dog sick isn't cool.<br /><br />Having seen another review that said their bag arrived ripped on another brand, and now having gotten a ripped bag with moldy food in it, I am INCREDIBLY wary about ordering food from Amazon ever again. Which sucks because that puts me back to seeking affordable shipping or buying local which is very limited.

review/summary: Well, That Was Easy!
review/text: I've been a horrible Dad to my two-year-old minpin.<br /><br />I inherited him from the breakup of a friend's household, and knew next to nothing about the breed.  Since he and I joined company, I've kept up the habit of feeding him moist chunky meals from pouches, just because he liked them so, and turned up his nose at everything from a "premium" can that I tried.<br /><br />My co-workers and my vet finally  convinced me that, next to scraps from the table, I was employing the worst possible strategy for keeping him fit and healthy.  So, based on the reviews, I ordered a small bag of this as a test.<br /><br />Frankly, I'd been dreading the switchover. A highly-experienced dog owner at work warned me that I was probably headed for a war of the wills, and that I should prepare to tough out a day or two...or maybe three...of Max practicing his best Oliver Twist looks, trying to get me to relent.<br /><br />I poured out the first helping of this yesterday morning, Max ambled over to sniff around and take one test bite...and then practically swan-dove into the bowl.<br /><br /> If it's this good for him and he's this happy with it, I have zero qualms with the price.<br /><br />I am a very happy new customer.  And let it be trumpeted throughout the realm:  Maximus the Mighty is pleased.

review/summary: Finally! A dog food for MY dog.
review/text: My one year old Westie has almost never had solid stool.  It was always semi-watery (sorry if this is TMI) and he had THE WORST gas.  I must have gone through about 10 different foods, always gradually changing between brands: Chicken Soup, Solid Gold, Wellness (not Core), Nature's Recipe, By Nature, just to list a couple.  I thought they were all high-end foods, but he still seemed to have an upset stomach after each one.  He also didn't seem too eager to eat his meals.  I switched to Wellness Core about a month ago and my puppy has been thriving ever since.  He enjoys eating, always has solid stool, and I can't remember the last time he passed gas.  His coat is looking better than ever, and almost everyone who pets him shrieks, "He's sooooo soft!" - It's great to hear considering Westies are notorious for skin problems.  I'm still not sure if it was the chicken that was giving him problems, or the grain, so I'm going to try Wellness CORE original and see how that goes since it's less expensive.  Two cons: Price (kind of lofty for a grad student...) and smell.  Has a strong shrimpy/fishy odor - he seems to like it though.  I will try to update on the Wellness CORE original.

I was cooking his food for a while but the smell of the liver cooking was too much for me, so I started looking for a dry food that was low carb high protein. He eats it - he isn't in love with it, but who would be after having home cooked meals for months! I still give him home cooked meat and cooked green veggies for breakfast, and the dry food for dinner. His fur has grown back and although he still gets itchy sometimes, his condition has improved 95%.

So I found this one and I haven't looked back!  Granted my dog will eat anything, but his coat looks brighter, shinier, and his poop doesn't even really smell, which I find unusual (Can't complain with that though).<br /><br />Cheapest to buy on Amazon, especially with Free Shipping.<br /><br />A must have purchase for me!

He had a bit of an itchy dry skin problem so I tried adding fish oil to his previous dog food but he hated it.  So, I needed to find a better dog food.  As soon as the bag arrived he was after it.  He loves the food.  He is healthy and happy and I just can't say enough about how this dog food does wonders for the skin and coat!  He has long fur and on the Wellness One it stays smoother and softer longer and is easier to maintain with a brush.  His coat is also thicker and stronger.  He looks amazing and it's due to Wellness Core.  I recommend it to anyone who loves their pet but especially if you have a long-haired breed.  He has fewer stools and is less gassy as well.  I'm sure this food is a lot easier for him to digest and I know it tastes better because he can't get enough of it.  Try it, you'll love it.

review/summary: Extremely satisified with this food
review/text: After careful research on the best dry food for my dog's diet, I chose Wellness Core Reduced Fat. My mixed breed dog is low energy and has a tendency to put weight on easily. It was very difficult to find a dog food that does not compromise quality ingredients to make a food low fat. Since my dog is low energy (by no means a sled dog), her diet does not require her to have extreme protein intake. This food is the prefect balance of protein, quality meat sources, fat content, as well as important sources of fruits and vegetables and fish oils. Her eyes are bright and coat is shiny. While she hasn't lost any weight, she hasn't gained any either, which is a good thing!<br /><br />You get what you pay for when it comes to dog food. When purchasing this brand, one is paying for high quality food (meat content, veggies, fruits) without fillers or extreme levels of protein.

review/text: In short, our experience has been that this is awesome food for adult years.<br />Two dogs:<br />Male GSD on Core from five years old to 10-1/2 years old.<br />Female Rottie, On a mix of 1ea 26lbs bag Core and 1ea 35lbs bag Canidae All Life Stages formula  at five years old, still on it at seven years old.<br /><br />All dogs are different, so your results may vary.<br /><br />Took a bit more than 9 days for a smooth transition for the GSD, with a bit of loose stool during the transition (off Purina One).<br />The Rottie, had no problems, and made the switch in an easy 7 days.<br />For the GSD senior years, it is too much protein.<br />GSD eats about 2.5 cups a day.<br />Rottie eats over 4 cups a day.<br /><br />Fed Super-Mutt (the GSD) on this for about 7 years, until he was 10-1/2.  He did great on it for all that time.  Great coat, firm stool, easy to maintain weight, and great blood tests at his yearly check-ups.  We were extremely active, with daily runs and walks, play at the park, etc. But digestibility was always a bit on the low side. If I cut the volume of food down, he would loose weight before any noticeable decrease in stool size.<br />I could also use the kibble for training, as he really liked the flavor.<br /><br />My Girl Friend's Rottie is on a mix of this with Canidae All Life Stages.  She is a high drive, work-aholic! Honest, you would be hard pressed to find a more active dog.  She does amazingly well on this.  Stunningly beautiful coat, great digestibility, easily maintained weight.  She has been on this mix for about 2 years now, and she is seven.  No kidney issues with high protein, but we will watch as she ages. Her focus, and attention seems more rock solid too on this mix...<br /><br />At Super-Mutts yearly check-up (when he was 10-1/2) we noticed kidney functions were out of whack.  So as a test I switched him to a senior food (Chicken Soup for the Soul), this is much lower protein.  This change brought his kidney functions back to normal, and digestibility is better.  So he is enjoying his senior years on "senior food".<br />Hth,

review/summary: Excellent food -from a pet professional
review/text: I started using Wellness Core Ocean about 3 months ago. I have English Bulldogs, and work very hard to make sure they eat the best food available. Even though a number of my co-workers at a veterinary hospital were skeptical, I was told to report back and let my colleagues know of my results. I am very impressed with this food. My dogs who are confined in the house for most of our brutal Arizona summers are heavy all summer long... not this year. Their coats are spectacular, no swollen tail folds and face wrinkles... shedding is down to a minimum. I have not bought the food from Amazon, but I will try it next month... at this price, why not?<br />  As for the recall, it has nothing to do with diamond foods, Core is separate. The only food effected by the recall will never be made with that partnership again. It's best not to get hysterical about something that simply is not going to effect you. Some people love to frighten others.<br />  In my almost 30 years of looking at skin and coats, I've never seen results like this. I can buy a large selection of foods at a deep discount, a perk at our veterinary hospital, but will not choose that road.<br />I will report back on my shipment quality when I get it.<br />Andrea

review/summary: Liked it until they changed the formula!
review/text: This was one of the best dog foods on the market, hands down. First four ingredients were meat, only two were "meal" and absolutely no grain. I've been feeding it to my dog for probably a year and he has the most beautiful coat, healthy disposition, and good weight. Plus as a finnicky eater, he downed it no problem!<br /><br />BUT!<br /><br />The most recent bag I bought seemed... off. My dog didn't want to eat it (he did eventually) and he started to have loose stools. It smelled different. I realized, after some sleuthing and, more obviously, checking the back of the bag, that Wellness changed the ingredients! No notice, just changed them. They got rid of some of the meat, there is more fat, and slightly different percentages of nutrients. I'll grant that my dog's stomach probably got upset because of a rapid food change (unbeknownst to me, obviously), but I'm still very disappointed that they changed the formula.

review/summary: Great change from Science Diet
review/text: We used to feed my dog Science Diet Nature's Best but it is being discontinued and we had to find something new. After much research we decided to go with Wellness CORE. I have a 2.5 year old Golden Retriever and immediately we noticed a huge change in her appetite. We always assumed she was a finicky eater before because she seemed disinterested in her food and wouldn't eat her full meal. As soon as we switched her food to CORE she started eating her entire meal and shows way more eagerness while waiting to be served. I'm glad we made the switch to CORE and my only regret is that we didn't do it sooner.

review/text: My husband and I have a 3 year old chihuahua/ Mexican Hairless mix. Like many hairless dogs, he's prone to skin problems like dryness, irritation, and pimples. Our vet recommended that we try switching him from Eagle Pack to a grain-free dog food and adding a fish oil supplement. We swiched to Wellness Core (Poultry) a few months ago, and his skin has definitely improved. Best of all, he loves it!

review/summary: Excellent dry dog food
review/text: We started our rescue dog on this food a few months after getting him. He was on a lower-quality food prior to that, and we also tried one other high-quality, grain-free food. The other high quality food seemed to have too many ingredients for him, his stools were not consistent. However, as soon as we got him on Wellness he did extremely well, his stools have been perfect since then, his constant tearing and tear stains have disappeared, and we get lots of compliments on his gorgeous coat. He never leaves any food on his plate, and he is a very healthy, happy dog on Wellness Core!

review/summary: Amazing product! A+++++
review/text: This is great food for dogs! My dogs usually weren't too enthusiastic about dry food, but they eat this stuff without any problems. I love that it is very healthy for them and grain-free with no undesirable ingredients. I supplement their food with salmon oil, so I'm happy to feed them this product, which has a reduced amount of fat. I also mix this dry food with other premium dry food or premium can food sometimes. I really enjoy providing my dogs with a variety of highly-palatable food that is good for them. One of my dogs had skin/allergy problems, and the healthy diet with reduced grains and increased omega oils has completely healed her skin and made her coat softer. This Wellness CORE Grain-free Dry Dog Food, Reduced Fat Recipe, is the one premium dry dog food that I mix with everything my dogs eat (with added salmon oil most of the time, although I did test them to see if they would eat it without the salmon oil, and they did). I highly recommend this wonderful product. A+++++

review/summary: NOT Produced at Diamond - Do Not be "Conned" by Other Reviewers
review/text: This is a great dog food and our dogs do very well on it.  Particularly, no gassiness as with some other brands.  Another reviewer mistakenly said that this food was made by Diamond Pet Foods, who have been experiencing product recalls.  I took the time to email Wellness and asked them if this Core Dry dog food is produced at Diamond Pet Foods.  Here is their official response: "CORE was never made at Diamond. We have spent the last 2 years expanding production at our Mishawaka, Indiana facility to bring the majority of our production into our own WellPet facilities.  Our facility includes a state-of-the-art onsite quality and safety laboratory and advanced extrusion systems all designed to produce the most nutritious, high-quality natural pet food possible, with a focus on food safety and compliance with regulations.  Our goal is to have all of our dry food made in Mishawaka buy the end of 2012. If the CORE is not made at Mishawaka it is made at American Nutrition or Vitaline."<br /><br />So do not be duped by ignorant reviewers who are quick to spread misinformation and do not take the time to back up what they are saying.  I hope everyone who has second thoughts now has them dispelled.

When I switched to this food vs a cheaper food, she shed a lot less and her coat is much smoother.  But, I get the product about $8 cheaper ordering through petcarerx.  I love Amazon and shop here frequently, but they are not competitively priced for this product.

review/summary: The right stuff
review/text: When we got our dog (rescue mutt) I did a lot of research about dog food, which helped me tremendously with how to analyze the ingredient list to find the right food.  But doing that research still leaves you with a pretty decent-sized list of high-quality foods.  I've tried several and our dog definitely has her own opinions.  She was fine with some for awhile, but then got tired of them, Blue Buffalo being one example.  Others she just turned her nose up at right from the start--surprisingly including Taste of the Wild, which most dogs seem to be crazy about.  But the Wellness CORE original recipe has been something she's liked consistently for a long time now.<br /><br />She's never had any allergy issues with this product, her eyes and coat look great, she has tons of energy and, thank heavens, no gas.  In the fall and winter she eats windfall apples and the stench is beyond belief, so I'm grateful that the rest of the year the Wellness CORE keeps her gas-free!<br /><br />If you're looking for a high-quality, grain-free dry food for your dog, give Wellness CORE a try.

review/summary: confused by reviews
review/text: I am confused by the reviews for the different types of food from Wellness Core because they are all the same. When reviewing the Ocean Blend, it is the exact same review for the Reduced Fat and Original. I have had my 6 year old golden retriever on the Ocean Blend for 6 months and she has gained 10 pounds! Nothing else has changed in her life and I was even feeding her a reduced amount because I feel the recommended feeding is always too much (duh! buy more!). In researching the Reduced Fat option, I found no difference in the reviews. Seems odd. I will be going back to a Raw diet as she never had a weight problem while she was on it. I switched her because I honestly hate dealing with the Raw food.....but it obviously was a better choice.

review/text: I have been feeding this to my dogs for about six months. One year ago my female greyhound was dealing with a rash on her stomach and infections on her feet. I thought I was feeding her a quality dog food. But I was taking her to the vet almost every month. She took antibiotics for almost four months to get rid of the infections. This made her lose her appetite. Then I started her on Wellness Core. She loves it and so does my other greyhound and shephard mix. After six months my female greyhound has no infections of any kind and my male greyhound has a black, shiney coat. My shephard mix is happy and calm. All the dogs love this food. None have skipped a meal since I started using it. I am happy because I am going to the vet only for yearly shots. This dog food is great.

review/summary: So Far This Dog Food Is A Winner
review/text: My husband researched dog foods as we looked for one to transition our puppy => dog.  Our vet encouraged us to go off the puppy food and because our rough-and-tumble aussie has a sensitive digestive tract we only wanted to do this once.  He likes the food and amnz has a great price.  We used a website that analyzes dog food on nutritional properties and we wanted to be sure the local "big box" pet supplier carried it in case we didn't get our order in time.  It does smell fishy and that can be a bit rough for the morning scoping but that is really the only down side so far.

review/summary: Wellness Core Puppy Dry Food
review/text: I spent HOURS researching dog food.  I had it down to Wolf Pup, Taste of Wild, and this Wellness Core.  WC was my last choice as I researched that some dogs can be allergic to chicken.  I asked the vet, and she said it's true, but she wouldn't say it's common.  She said to go with chicken and save the lamb and bison as alternatives IF she would become allergic.  So then WC became my #1 choice.  It's grain free which I liked.  So we picked up the food, picked up our new puppy and started the half and half with the dog food the breeder was giving.  After all the research I almost cried as I poured in the "other brand" (knowing how bad all the fillers/corn/garbage was in the other stuff).  So we only went two days with the mixing, then I went to straight WCore.  She did great (7 and half weeks at this point)!  Never had any digestion problems, never had any loose stools.  I am hoping for the miracle food that everyone is claiming that it will produce much better fur and low dander.  We've bathed her 3 times in one week (I know, a bit compulsive) and she has no skin problems.  She is a little over 8 lbs. now, and just moved up to about a cup a day.  So they do eat less than the typical dog food.  The "other brand" was recommending almost 2 cups while WC was right on track with what she was eating at 1 cup/ day (divided into thirds or fourths throughout the day).  So I feel a little better spending the extra money knowing that it's lasting me longer than the typical bag of "other brand" dog food.  Love that the ingredients are healthy!  The only hangup I had was a comment I had read that their dog didn't like it.  I wasn't spending sixty dollars to find out she didn't like it.  I called customer service and she explained I would have a money back guarantee.  So that sealed the deal.  Our lab mix loves it, and we haven't looked back.<br />Update:  She is now 9 weeks old and only needing a bath once a week.  She no longer has that "dog smell".  It has to be the food. :)

review/summary: A difference I can see.
review/text: I recently switched to this food for my three dogs, an eight year old chocolate Lab, a ten year old miniature Dachshund and a one year old miniature Chihuahua. They all like it. The lab has actually left food in her bowl, but just because she is satisfied with less. She goes to her feeding eagerly but doesn't finish it all. The doxie has always been greedy, but now leaves the leftovers alone if I keep an eye on her. The littlest has been a free feeder from the start and may actually be eating a little more than before. The most important difference I see is their energy levels, the older ones are acting like puppies again. Their coats are shiny and thick, even the Chihuahua has thick fur now! I had hoped they would do well on a grain free diet, and this is even better than I expected. I have put this food on a subscribe and save basis so I will never run out!

review/summary: Love at first bite for my girl
review/text: Well, after several different tries at different foods, I finally did some research this morning and decided to try Wellness Core. I bought the Ocean one since my dog (a 10 year old smooth coat collie) loves fish.  I really think that is why she has always loved to get into the cat's kibble... she likes fish!<br /><br />She has allergies to corn and wheat I think. Her skin was always a problem for years. I finally started giving her fish oil and later olive oil on her food.<br /><br />She has never liked any dry kibble I've given her, and I admit I've given her some poor quality foods not knowing it (Beneful, Pedigree, Nutrish...etc.)<br /><br />Well, I went and bought the Wellness Core this morning, walked in at lunch and she FOLLOWED me, sniffing the bag (can she really smell it through that bag?)<br /><br />I dumped out the Rachael Ray Nutrish that had been sitting in her bowl since YESTERDAY, and put 1 cup of this Wellness Core Ocean in her bowl.  She went right up to it, took one piece out, put it on the floor and ate it... took another piece out, put it on the floor and ate it.. and then proceeded to put her head in the bowl and eat it all up!  She then drank some water, went and lay down, and did NOT BOTHER ME while I was eating a turkey sandwich!  Wow.<br /><br />I am so hopeful that this food is the answer for her.

No amount of pumpkin, yogurt, oil, or fiber was changing things, and the vet was happy we came in for not infrequent Ova/parasite checks which were all negative.<br /><br />After trying all of the Wellness brand combos we tried Core Fish and our dog loves the taste, and for once isn't the poop-ing-est dog at the dog park. It's not cheap and absolutely I'm sure there are other options for most dogs, but if you have a Boxer or sensitive stomached dog and are used to being the person with 5 poop bags all the time give it a try if you have the budget.

Lately however, with the onset of old age, she has gotten weak and listless and had to be coaxed into eating. One day I decided to try a new brand of food to see if it would at least help her appetite.  I did my research and Wellness Grain-Free CORE food always came out with 10 stars.  I bought a bag and immediately our dog began to eat again. I can't say enough good about the results of this food with our dog. She has energy again, and even though her endurance is what you'd expect from an old dog, she is happy and eager to go on short walks.  The ingredients are top of the line, and it even has a pleasant odor. It was a lifesaver for our old pooch.

review/summary: Grain-free for low-activity dogs
review/text: This is a great choice if your schedule/budget/dog's appetite doesn't allow for raw food or a freeze-dried solution. If you're on this page, chances are you've read about feeding your dog a natural, grain-free diet to combat issues with your dog's health, most commonly skin-related. Many dogs have a grain "allergy," causing itchiness and rash, which is often wiped out by switching to a grain-free diet.<br /><br />My dog doesn't do the raw thing, being an old man and set in his ways, and so he prefers kibble. I've personally never fed him anything but grain-free food, and hardly ever notice him scratching or biting at his skin. He absolutely loves this food, and being old and lazy having a low-fat alternative is great for his activity level. There are many grain-free choices out there, so I would personally highly recommend trying different kinds to see what your dog likes - I have to admit that I haven't seen many low-fat grain-free kibble products, so this is the one I went with. Couldn't be happier, especially with Prime shipping!

review/summary: Wellness Core Dog Food
review/text: I am frim believer in feeding my pets premium dog food. I have been through a few different kind, and Wellness Core is fantasic. I have a high energy Cardigan Welsh Corgi,and she loves the food. I love that it is not grained based, she has a very shiny, healthy coat. eats less, and has less stool. It is well worth the money. Amazon by far has the best prices on all dog and cat food, and most of it will qualify for free shipping.

review/summary: Glossy coat, indeed!
review/text: I have been feeding my pup this food for the last 6 months (after she turned 1), and the glossiness and softness of her coat is amazing. On our walks and at the dog park, people regularly comment on how pretty and shiny her coat is. She is an energetic, playful pup who is constantly coming back from the dog park with a healthy layer of slobber, and after about 30 minutes, her coat is glossy again, no need to brush it or anything.<br /><br />An added bonus is she LOVES the food. I've even used some kibbles as treats and she does all her tricks for just a bite of it. Great stuff, she'll be a wellness pup for life!

review/text: I couldn't be happier with Wellness Core! My dogs love it and I'm happy that they are getting all the nutrients they need without all the added grains. I also had a tad of the Wellness food topper/mixer which they drool over! The topper/mixer is also grain free. Gotta love it!

review/text: My miniature schnauzer not only was putting on a little weight with the lamb/rice, it was making his stomach upset for a while.<br /><br />On the vet's recommendation, I switched to this food and it has been great for him for over a year now.  He also gets way more excited about this food than the previous one.  Highly recommend it.

review/text: My Dog has G.I. issues and I thought this food would be better for him with a suggestion from another pet owner...<br />However, My dog still prefers "ROYAL CANIN" for boxers...<br />I think for a boxer, it is harder for them to get a hold of the little chunks of food as opposed to the "custom" shaped nuggets Royal Canin provides in their product...<br />I will stick with Royal Canin...<br />Its not about what is better for them, its what THEY like in the end...

review/summary: It's working and they love it!
review/text: I switched to Wellness about 2 months ago.  I buy the low cal one for my "bigger" girls and the regular Core food for my other dogs.  Best change I ever made.  It's not cheap -- I have 7 dogs, but their health is more important.  I mix either Wellness Core canned or Paul Newman's Organic canned food in in the am and the dry kibble in the pm.  All the dogs love it.  No gastric problems -- I've a bulldog and they have sensitive tummys and she loves this and has much less gas.  Before this i tried Royal Canin, which they also liked, but I decided to go totally grain free.  Again, pricy, but worth it if you can save on vet bills and have healthym happy animals.  Every one of my dogs love it -- and a few of them are fussy eaters.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a healthy alternative for their pets.  I change up the flavors every now and then to keep them from getting bored.  I know I wouldn't want to eat the same thing every night - hence the addition of the canned mix.<br />My Golden, who's over weight, has lost 5 pounds eating the lo cal version -- I couldn't be happier with this product.

review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: I purchased this food for my finicky chihuahua. I noticed that I was throwing away more of her Royal Canin Chihuahua food than she was eating, so I knew I needed to make a switch, and I wanted to try high-quality, grain-free foods.  At the recommendation of several friends, I decided to try Wellness Core and am so glad I did! The first day I mixed it with her previous food (Royal Canin Chihuahua) and she actually spit out the old food and only ate the Wellness Core!  She didn't have any stomach issues with it.  The next day she again gobbled down the Wellness Core.  My only complaint is that the pieces are a little big for her (a little smaller than a dime). She can still manage, but I wish there was a small dog version.  When I decided to make the switch to Wellness Core, I calculated how much it would cost in comparison to the Royal Canin Chihuahua I had been buying.  I was actually paying $14 for 2.5 lbs of Royal Canin at Petsmart, but got 12 lbs of Wellness Core, a higher-quality food for $29.99 with free shipping on Amazon- quite a savings!  I would recommend that anyone looking to go grain-free, or even just wanting a higher quality food try Wellness Core!

review/summary: Wellness Core
review/text: I have 2 dogs, ages 5 and 10, and we have tried numerous foods. My dogs had been on Blue Buffalo and my vet recently told me to switch because he had read some negative things about it. He wanted me to switch to Science Diet, Eukanuba or Iams and I knew I did not want to put my dogs on any of them. I started with Wellness Super Mix and then switched over the the Grain Free as I noticed my bassett hounds eyes were tearing up a lot and had a friend put her dogs on grain free food for the same reason. They tolerated both foods very well, however; I am going to try the Wellness for allergies as I still notice her eyes to be tearing up. Both of my dogs have a loooong history of bladder infections and have both been to the vet twice in the last 6 months to have their urine checked and have remained infection free. I feel that it's because of the switch to Wellness.

review/text: My vet has long recommended I switch to a brand like Wellness, and despite the fact that it's a bit pricey, I decided my dogs' health is worth it. The ingredients are much better than Purina One, which they'd been eating for years, and I feel good that I'm giving them one of the best foods out there. It's a plus that I can get it shipped in two days using Amazon Prime.

review/summary: High quality food for dog with allergies
review/text: Our french bulldog has food allergies to the vegetarian dry dog food her brother and sister eat, but she does very well on this food. We're not sure what she's allergic to, but this grain-free meat-based food is excellent for her. She loves it (of course, she eats ANYTHING!), has shiny soft fur, nice stools, and is happy and full of energy. Strongly recommended for dogs with food allergies.

review/summary: Great food - cheaper from Petsmart, though
review/text: I love this product.  My dog does extremely well on it, and his itching has lessened since starting it.  He eats it without any need for additives - wet food, etc.  Even my cat tries to shove him out of the way for his food.<br /><br />The only con is cost.  It's several $$ more expensive on this website than it is in store.  Once the price falls a bit, I'll be more than happy to purchase it online.

review/text: I spent many hours on the internet studying and reviewing dog foods before I decided to start using this "premium" brand. They had this video of their state of the art facility where everything was hospital clean and everyone wore gloves and masks. Now I just found out via a salmonella recall notice that Wellness doesn't even make their own dog food! They outsource it to Diamond foods where several other brands are also produced in the same facility! It's the same food in a different fancy looking bag. I have just switched to a new company called "Life's Abundance". This food is produced and sold directly from the manufacturer to you with no middleman.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED
review/text: Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/summary: The Outstanding Legacy of Aunt Jemima's Syrup
review/text: Aunt Jemima Original Syrup is a beautiful golden-brown, delicious, artificially-flavored vestige article of Jim Crow South.  It continues to elevate the unrivaled privilege of its white owners' progeny, while conversely, it's success in the 19th century was achieved with successes in marketing which centered on the exploitation of the image of a playfully ignorant African American woman otherwise aptly described as the quintessential "mammy" archetype. Revel in nostalgia for the good ol' days as you lather your pancakes in Jemima's sweet forbidden nectar and taste the spirit of the 1800s!

review/text: Nothing wrong with the syrup. Just a heads up that these are 12 ounce bottle, not the usually bigger bottles (24 oz I believe). So each bottle's content is equivalent to a can of soda. So even though this is a 6 pack, it ends up being pretty expensive. I got it because I'm an Amazon Prime member (free shipping) and am too lazy to go to the supermarket.
