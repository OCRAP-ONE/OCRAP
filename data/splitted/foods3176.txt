review/summary: Smokey Offnote cannot recommend for baking extract
review/text: Had ordered 1 LB Extract Grade Madagascar Vanilla Beans ... they had a very smoky off flavoring , I use to make my own vanilla extract and vanilla rum.. thankfully did not use in my 2 yr old master batch of vanilla extract.. I initially used to put up a bottle of vanilla rum.. while very good sippping cold is not good for baking. Not sure if were smoke dried or how it picked up the smoke off note but was way too overwhelming for baking purposes.. in all fairness have not contacted the supplier, will email today, will follow-up on that. But at this time cannot recommend... best I can use them for is drinking spirits, savory dishes (yes do put vanilla bean in various rubs) and simmering liquid to freshen house. Was too expensive for that use.

review/summary: FANTASTIC!!!
review/text: Never have I used vanilla beans until in the last two weeks.  I found a recipe for Vanilla Pear Jam and wanted to try it out.  After going to the grocery store and having sticker shock at the $15.00 for two beans price I did some research.  I learned that the main difference between grade A and grade B beans is the color of the husk of the bean and that the interior quality isn't really affected by the outer color.  The length of the bean can also be a determinant for grade B vs gourmet or grade A beans.<br /><br />Being skeptical and not wanting to spend money on a ton of beans before I found out if I even liked using vanilla beans I sucked up the $15.00 per two bean price and bought the two beans at the grocery store.  The jam was delicious!  The two store beans were a little dry but still pliable.  But they were not much longer than the six inches advertised for the B grade beans sold by Vanilla Products USA. I wanted to be able to make more jam and give it to friends but not at the price the grocery store was charging.<br /><br />Placed my order on a Wednesday night and had the beans arrive that Saturday.  Impressive shipping time.<br /><br />I then took one of the B grade beans and one of the near gourmet beans (included free as a bonus), slit both and removed the "caviar" from the center of each of the two beans.  The quantity of seeds between the two grades was basically equal.  The only reall aesthetic difference I saw was that the near gourmet beans were darker in color and seemed a little more pliable than the grade B beans which were distinctly more brown.<br /><br />I found a website (VanillaReview dot com) which seems to have some great information about vanilla beans to see just why, if the interior of the bean is basically the same, would you pay more for grade A or gourmet beans.  The only thing I found was that they look better in your cooking if your using the whole bean.  I can see and agree with that, if your someone familiar with vanilla beans. But in the small town I live in, I'm not going to be going to a fancy restaurant and my friends that come over thought it was great I was cooking with vanilla beans.<br /><br />We made a small ice cream freezer of vanilla bean ice cream tonight, using the two beans, one gourmet and one B grade that I had split earlier this morning.  The vanilla flavor was incredible.  We compared it to store brand vanilla bean ice cream we had in the freezer and there was no comparison, we like the home made vanilla bean version hands down.  The one thing we all noticed in using the newly delivered vanilla beans for the ice cream was that the vanilla seeds could be felt in your mouth when you let the ice cream melt there.  They gave the ice cream a different textural feeling but if you brushed them against your teeth they popped very much like I have heard that real caviar should.  Delicious.<br /><br />Would I make this purchase again.  ABSOLUTELY!!!  I am completely thrilled with the product that I recieved, the amount of time it took to recieve it in, and the quality of what was delivered.  I'm now looking to see just what other items I can use vanilla beans in.

review/summary: Best way to buy vanilla beans
review/text: After a local store (where I used to buy five beans for around $10) closed, I thought "why not check online" since I am buying more and more things that way. I found this place through Amazon and took a chance at getting a pound of beans. They arrived quickly and are absolutely beautiful! I may have underestimated how many vanilla beans are in a "pound," as this is more than I need for now. So I've repackaged and sealed them to save for later. (You can separate them into smaller amounts and double-bag them in those Ziploc vacuum bags. They'll last forever. Even when they are no longer at their peak, you can still use them for flavoring.) I'm very happy with the purchase and the quality of the beans and will probably only buy from this place from now on. Good job, Vanilla Products USA!

review/summary: Madagascar Vanilla Beans
review/text: After research online and speaking to friends, I decided to order vanilla beans on Amazon from Vanilla Products USA.  The beans arrived shortly therafter and I immediately began preparing the beans for my extract.  Although it will be a few more months before I can bottle up my special brew, I look forward to using it in my own kitchen and giving samples to our family this Christmas.  These beans were just perfect for my extract.  I'm using the bonus 1/8 pound gourmet planifolia vanilla beans in my desserts.  I will be reordering.  Karen F

review/text: I LOVE vanilla.  I seriously could open the bag and just smell the beans over and over every day.  These were purchased so I could make homemade vanilla and I LOVE them.  Have barely made a dent in the bag and have made about 1k ml's of vanilla or more.  Such rich flavor/scent hands smelled like vanilla after splitting the beans open and washing hands with soap and water repeatedly.  Received a nice sample size free with my order too.  Have shared with my sister and she also loves them.  Will order these again.

review/summary: Awesome, great for vanilla extract!
review/text: I ordered a variety of beans because I wasn't sure what would work better for vanilla extract.  I used these for the bulk of what I made after doing research and am so happy that I did!  I also got some tahitian ones (not as much "caviar" inside, skin was too tough to work with)and some grade A Madagascar Bourbon (just to see the difference, made one small jar of that).  These grade B Madagascar Bourbon ones were the easiest to work with by far, and had the most amount of "caviar" and smelled amazing.  The packaging was as described, vacuum sealed, and was delivered sooner than expected.  Very happy with this purchase, will be ordering more soon.

review/text: I was a little hesitant ordering these since they were so much cheaper than other sites, but like the other reviewers said, they did not disappoint.  I just started 8 bottles of vanilla extract and that hardly put a dent in the bag of beans.  I estimate there are over 100 beans in the 1lb. bag.  They were vacuumed sealed, beans are moist, and they smell great.  I am now looking on the internet for more uses for them since I have so many now!  And they threw in an extra bag of another kind to try as well.  Very happy with this purchase.

review/text: The 1 Pound LB Madagascar Bourbon Planifolia Extract was not received vacuum sealed as shown and described. This has considerably undermined the quality of the product and its freshness. After contacting the supplier, he gave inadequate and irrelevant reasons as why the item was not vacuum sealed! I guess the supplier since he knew the item has been shipped outside the US, he did not care much about quality and customer rights and satisfaction.

review/text: I love this product from Quaker and I'm certainly not a fan of grits. These, however, are really delicious just with salt, pepper and butter or margarine. The small ham bits taste authentic and add a quite different taste and consistency to normally bland grits. They're instant so it only takes a minute or two to prepare and they go well as a side dish with eggs and biscuits or toast, or just served alone. I like the small individual packets, especially, as I can even take them to work. Ordering them in bulk from Amazon is even better as I always know I have plenty on hand as these are the only grits I eat.

review/summary: Best Instant Grits, Difficult to Find
review/text: My first grits experience was at college and I became an immediate fan. These are the BEST flavored instant grits and are now so difficult to find locally. It's great to find them on Amazon for a decent price. They're easy to make with boiling hot water or in the microwave in a flash. I usually eat 2 packets at a time, yummy. When my dog smells them cooking he makes sure his pleading eyes get him a spoonful on his kibble.<br /><br />However, these are NOT for everyone... 1 packet/serving contains 21% of daily sodium requirement, other allergy and dietary concerns...CONTAINS SOY, WHEAT AND MILK INGREDIENTS...Dr Oz probably wouldn't approve because there are more than 5 ingredients on the label, most of which have long unpronounceable names. I took off a star for that, BUT they're still YUMMY!

review/text: Sunkist makes two different variety packs of these fruit gems.  One of them (the one I received) uses the typical artificial colorings such as yellow #5 & #6, red #40, and blue #1.  The other (the one I ordered) uses all-natural colors from vegetable sources, and the package says they are all-natural on the front.<br /><br />The all-natural version flavors are orange, lemon, pink grapefruit, raspberry, and blueberry.  The artificial ones have the same flavors with the exception of bright green lime instead of the natural blueberry.  We eat no synthetic dyes, so I will be returning these.<br /><br />If you order them, I wonder if it might help to specify in the special instructions that you want the all-natural kind, so they will pay close attention when they pack up the order.

review/text: I ordered this assorted bag as a birthday gift for my father, along with Ghirardelli's giant 5 pound milk chocolate bar.  The box arrived incredibly fast (in only two days with regular shipping option) and was well protected from the summer heat by ice packs.  My dad said the box weighed a ton and he almost hurt his back trying to lift it, so if I had any suggestion, it would be to ease up on the extra ice packs!  That said, I'm grateful for the fast delivery and added coolant to keep the items from melting into a wasted mess.<br /><br />If you like Ghirardelli chocolate (and you should), don't hesitate to order these for yourself or as gifts.

review/summary: Not easy on our dog's digestion
review/text: Based on our experience I would give this product 1 star, but I concede that our dog's reaction may not be typical.<br /><br />We gave our dog one of these early in the evening.  He's a mid-sized dog at about 35 lbs, but he's also a strong chewer.  Based on what I could tell from the package, though, I had no reason to believe I should buy the larger size.  We were in the room and casually observed him as he chewed on it.  Our dog had the whole thing eaten within an hour.<br /><br />He seemed fine and the next morning his bathroom routine was completely normal.  However, when we got home from work, it was clear that the poor guy had been struggling not to have an accident.  When we got him outside, he had multiple explosive bowel movements.  A little further examination showed us that, despite his best efforts, his butt had been leaking during the day.  He had also given himself a hemorrhoid.  The poor guy.<br /><br />We double checked the package and found no directions, advice, or warnings that would have helped us foresee this issue.  I never want my dog to go through that again and thus we will never buy these again (and the extras have gone in the trash).

review/summary: Doggie chews
review/text: My pug loves these chews. When I accidentally leave the door open where I keep them, she has her nose in there looking for them. They are her final treat of the day and she can hardly wait for them. After eating her food she jumps up on the chair and stares at me or if I don't see her she barks at me until she gets my attention so I can look and see she ate her food. Then she runs over to the closet waiting for me to give her one. I wish I could be so  easily placated and satisfied.

review/text: I bought the Med size for my Mini Dachshund to keep her happy when i go out for a few hours and she is in her crate. I know she loves somthing when she does the little dance and bolts to her crate waiting for the nutrident. Other chew leave gooey messes on the carpet and come apart easily however this one i have never found any evidence that she ever even had one. Highly recomend the vet says her teeth are in tip top shape because she gets one a day

review/summary: Bad breath in dogs
review/text: Our Schnauzer has some really horrible breath and we don't know exactly why. I tried several of the "dental dog chews" testing to qualify their claims. All failed my test. I saw these at Wal-Mart and decided to give them a try. SUCCESS! Honestly, though, her mouth doesn't smell like a rose garden, but what an improvement. I don't feel like shooshing her away. We can play at close quarters now My only problem with W-M is they carry only small bags. So, I am going to buy at Amazon.com since I can get the large size bags.

review/summary: Expensive!  Huge increase in price.
review/text: My dogs are absolutely crazy about these; they're like crack for dogs.  I last purchased some in Fall 2010 for $14 for 24; then we decided to take a break from them for awhile to ease the addiction.  Feeling soft, I thought to purchase some again.  Now, less than a year later in June 2011, they are almost $20 for 24.  That's an outrageous price increase in a short amount of time.  Yes, those of us who have dogs love our dogs, but I feel like our love for them is being taken advantage of.  I can only imagine what the profit margin is...

review/summary: Gave my dog horrible diarrhea twice...
review/text: We have a tiny little 8 lb maltese, and we got him the mini size bag of these.  Each time we give it to him, he seems to love it, but he had HORRIBLE diarrhea that led to multiple vet visits (it was awful, pretty much the worse diarrhea he's ever had at age 3).  I noticed about 8 hours after he ate the nutrident, the diarrhea started and it had turned blackish green.  Fast forward 2 months, and our dog was nursed back to health and happy...I didn't think that the nutrident was the cause of the diarrhea earlier, I thought it just made it worse so I gave him another one.  Wrong.  About 6-8 hours after, I noticed his normally firm stools were extremely soft and once again, they were blackish green.  I promptly threw the entire bag in the trash.  Terrible product and I will never be buying these again.  As a side note, my little guy tolerates and loves Greenies just fine.  I'll pay the extra few bucks for the Greenies to make sure he isn't food poisoned by these ever again.

review/text: My dogs love these chews. I have 5 dogs - all various sizes and temperments. I have found they are similar to Greenies but much less expensive. In addition you can often find coupons and sales on these. It is so good for their teeth to let them chew, and even my Yorkie at 11 years old has wonderful teeth because I have been giving her things to chew on since she was a puppy. As always, I do not let my dogs chew on any brand of treats without supervision.

review/text: You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog.

review/summary: My cats love these so much...
review/text: My cats love these so much that one of them stole an entire bag off the kitchen counter, tore out the bottom, and ate most of it while I was away one morning. That said, I'm not terribly happy with these treats. The 2nd, 4th, and 6th main ingredients in the treats are ground corn, rice, and wheat flour -- starches I'm not stoked about giving my cats. The ingredient list is also very long. These were the best I could find at my local grocery store, and the cats definitely like them, but I'm hoping to find better ones through Amazon. I'm looking for a poultry-based treat with few additives; I picked these out because, despite the 'real salmon and garden greens flavor,' the ingredient list begins with chicken by-product meal; for reference, salmon meal is the 17th ingredient and the first green comes much later.

Those cats went into a tastebud frenzy! The call of one of their names AND everybody comes running! Even my Dog asks for the treats and they are just tiny, weeny in size, but she loves them as well; and will sit until she gets one as well! This treat was vet recommended and cat approved! The Seller's price point was better than every 'Google' search...Even with Petco and Petsmart!!! Go figure! The delivery time was equally good. Would not only recommend this product but would recommend this Seller. Would purchase from this Seller in the future as well.

review/text: I've tried a lot of KCups, looking for the fresh, dark, really rich espresso-roast flavor that I love; all of them seemed weak and/or flatly bitter compared to my dark beans-by-the-pound favorites. I'm almost a coffee snob and only bought the Keurig because my mornings are just too rushed, sort of a shocking decision. I love the convenience of the machine, but it was like grabbing a cup at the convenience store taste-wise - just the required morning medication, eh.<br /><br />So I was really, really surprised and delighted when I discovered this one. I hear they pack the Barista blends with more coffee - that does seem to be the case, they're plump little cuppies.<br />And wow, a real espresso taste, zero acidity, darkly fruity and full-bodied, and for once not tasting watered down. If you don't like espresso you won't like it, especially neat. But with half and half and sugar this one's really wonderful, too.  Love it, love it.

review/text: I have to say the new offerings are great. the french roast and the Italian roast have a nice strong coffee flavor. I would say remember your first cup out of a keurig, the reason you bought a machine, these two flavors remind me of that.<br />Those first few lines are from my review for the Italian roast, they are both excellent.

review/summary: Bold But Not Rocket Fuel Bold.  Nice, Smooth Flavor.
review/text: This Barista Prima kcup is my favorite of the four Barista Prima varieties that I've tried (House Blend, Columbian, Italian Rost & French Roast).  It has a nice dark, moderately bold flavor that creates a smooth wake-me-up in the morning.  There is no kick to it - just a even, enjoyable experience.<br /><br />My coffee preferences are medium-bold blends.  I brew a 10oz cup & this coffee maintains its flavor in this size cup.<br /><br />This is a kcup that I would put on my shelves.  Recommended.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received this kcup in a sample variety pack sent our by Keurig to its customers.

review/text: I love a high quality French roast. Since I was in college, coming home to visit my parents and drinking my mom's amazing coffee has never been beat by my Keurig.  Until now.  I love it.  It's super rich and flavorful.  It's not overly dark and there is no burnt taste like "other" coffees (you know who I'm talking about).  This is truly a lovely coffee.

review/summary: Definitely My New Favorite
review/text: I've been a Timothy's Rainforest Espresso fan for a couple of years now but this coffee is giving it a run for the money (well not really because it's overpriced).<br /><br />I delayed purchasing it (I have a $.50/cup limit and Barista runs twice that) until I found it on sale. Having used Keurig pots since they first came out a decade ago and having tried about 80 flavors, I find myself choosing this one over the Rainforest for my first cup each morning.  It's flavor is bolder and clearer than Rainforest and seems more satisfying.  We have a house full of guests now and the carousel has dozens of different coffees on it but the Barista coffees are the ones I keep having to refill.<br /><br />Still I ding it one star because of price.<br /><br />8/12 - found them for $.60 a k-cup (box of 96).  Bought two boxes which will last me two months.  Love this coffee.<br /><br />10/12 - Been drinking Barista Italian for 10 months now and have tried over a dozen new options in the interim.  None came close to the robustness of this coffee.

review/summary: Best dark roast k-cup by far
review/text: I am pretty picky when it comes to my coffee.  Tried just about everything.  Can not stand the weak blends and only like dark roasts (extra bold).  Used to drink Timothy's Parisian Nights, Midnight Magic and Green Mountains Dark Magic on medium water selection to get a strong enough brew, but now Barista Prima French Roast ONLY, on the large water setting.  Even with extra water it is perfect.  Little pricier than some of the others, but it is worth it, plus I get a full cup of coffee now when I brew on the large water setting.  I should also mention I only use filtered water when I brew my coffee, makes a huge difference.  Filtered water and a Barista Prima French Roast K-cup and it will by far blow everything else out of the water.  Nothing else compares.  If you like a really dark, smooth, flavorful coffee, you must try this.  You will not be disappointed.  But keep in mind, this is only for people who truly like the darkest roast (i.e. I think it curls my hair). Serious coffee drinkers only!

review/summary: Good Coffee for a Designer Coffee
review/text: I have gradually come to realize good coffee doesn't have to bite your head off. People have been convinced that the more your socks curl, the better it is. This is a pretty mellow but substantial brew. It doesn't have the hardcore after taste and isn't bitter. No fruity or whatever else descriptors. It's just a good basic cup of coffee for the average person. Basic is what I'm looking for in the morning.

Coffee was great and the price was very good too.  Super saver shipping took FOREVER.  They sat on the order for a week before even shipping it and then it was another 4 days to get to us.  I actually had to go out and buy a box before this arrived which was what I was trying to avoid by ordering it online.  Used to order all my coffee online from Amazon before they dumbed down the free shipping.  Now, not so much.

review/summary: Italian Roast very nice
review/text: Amazon seems to have combined the reviews for three different products here, Italian, French, and Columbian. I picked up a box of the Italian Roast at the grocery, and I really like it. It is strong and full flavored without bitterness. For hot coffee, I make the larger size cup, and the smaller for iced coffee. I checked Amazon to see if I could save money, but it looks like the same price I paid at the store ($9.99 for a box of 12).

review/text: At first I thought I had wasted my money. I hated this coffee. It is very bitter. Then I had a great idea...use it for iced coffee.  I brew it for a medium cup. Fill a tall glass with ice. Fill glass 1/3 full with milk. Add your favorite creamer. Add coffee and stir. So if you hate this coffee hot, try it cold.

Also like the Italian roast, but is a bit stronger and, I think, harsher flavor.  Where ever you end up buying Prima French Roast, you'll come back for more!

All the coffee was good but just was not "it" until we ordered this coffee. Finally a coffee dark, bold enough yet smooth and not bitter. She even runs it thru the machine twice and still gets a good cup of coffee. May cost a little more than others we have purchased but well worth it. Now when re-ordering I can just go to my last coffe order and re-order same. Simple, quick and satisfing. Plus it has a cool picture of the Eifle Tower on the box.

review/text: This Columbia Blend leans more to the medium side than the bold side of coffee.  However, there is a slight kick to it, so solid medium coffee drinkers may want to take a pass.<br /><br />The blend is also slightly bitter, but not so bitter that it would be considered a harsh taste.  The bitter can be toned down by milk, which would leave no significant aftertaste.<br /><br />I would put this kcup in the same category as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>, although I would choose this Barista Prima Columbia blend over the Caribou Blend.<br /><br />This is an OK blend, but there are better coffee blends on the market.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers.

review/text: I have been using Ume Vinegar as a liquid salt for over 20 years now.  I love this stuff, but it's hard to find.  I use it in my salad dressings and when I make guacamole.  People always ask about my dressings and why they taste so good.  I think it adds a distinctive sweet/salty flavor that blends so quickly you serve immediately.  Before finding this source for purchasing it, I could only get it at the health food stores like Whole Foods, Sunflower, etc.  I used this price to get Whole Foods to give me a discount if I order through them instead.  I only saved a couple of dollars though and sometimes I would rather not give Whole Foods my money - that place is such a rip-off.  Try the Umeboshi Vinegar; you will like it and this vendor's free shipping cannot be beat.

review/text: This was a big disappointment for me. I had long wanted to once again enjoy the "energy sticks" I remembered from my childhood, so I added one of these on to an order. Not only was it not the same format I had as a child (we had something about the diameter of a regular tootsie roll, and about 6" long, whereas this was about 3 to 4 times that diameter and could be broken into 4 sections), but it did NOT have the same taste at all. I know we sometimes inflate the wonderfulness of things in our memories, but this was definitely not the same thing we had as children. I'm not sure if this is just a different thing altogether, or if this is a poor remake of that, but I was very disappointed. It didn't taste horrible, but it sort of tasted like it had had itself been around since the 70s and was similar to any high-protein bar around -- definitely NOT worth the price!

review/text: I was nervous to order a sampler after reading dozens of negative reviews (of other samplers), but I LOVE THIS ONE!  I got 20 different flavors of coffees I have been wanting to sample without the commitment of buying an entire box of one flavor.  I can't wait to try them all!

review/summary: Nice presentation
review/text: The packaging lends itself very well for gift giving.  The selection is great, without duplicates.  My one complaint is the expiration date of the product, since the whole idea behind this Keurig coffee craze is convenience and freshness.  Two months until the coffee expires is not very fresh in my book.  I would not purchase coffee off the shelf with such a date.  Another box of coffee I purchased at the same time had six months until expiration, which I consider to be reasonable.  Twenty dollars is a pretty steep price for 20 cups of coffee that aren't very fresh.
