review/summary: Pralus Pyramid Review
review/text: High-end dark chocolate that is best eaten in moderation. When you eat chocolate of this nature, it is all about the quality and not the quantity. My only issue with this is the individual packaging. Due to the strength of the chocolate, the flavors tended to blend together due to the lack of quality wrapping needed to separate such strong flavors of chocolate. Besides that, this is a unique gift that will make someone feel very special!!!

review/summary: Works well for chocolate tastings with friends and family
review/text: This chocolate sampler is very useful for creating a fun event with 5-15 friends and family. Here's what you can do: Make sure each person has something to write with. One-by-one, without indicating what country the sample comes from, give each person a small piece of one of the chocolates. Have them write down their own descriptive words for what they see, taste, feel, and smell about the piece. Remind them that there might be a different experience at the beginning, middle, and end of the sampling. Do this for each type of chocolate in the pack. Then, read through the "official" descriptions that come with the sampler pack, and ask the group to match their own written descriptions with the official ones. Have an atlas on hand, since there will probably be questions about where the countries are in the world. The group will be amazed at the differences in the chocolates, and will begin to appreciate the variety of soils, selection and processes that are underneath these wonderful treats.

review/summary: Similar to Trader Joe's?
review/text: Trader Joe's carried an identical product over the holidays and sold it for just $9.95. The $49.95 price is quite excessive for just 1 pound of chocolate. I was terribly disappointed with the TJ product because most of the flavors left a horrible finish (after taste) in my mouth. You should not have to pay an incredible $50 for a pound of chocolate, even if each package is single-origin. Buy some 100g bars of Valrhona at $3-5 each as the experience is much better.

review/summary: Very Good, But Has Preservatives...
review/text: This coconut cream is a brand we buy locally.  It is a brand we very much prefer, as we find it to be very good.  It contains 70% coconut milk versus the usual 55% most of the other brands contain (and many brands do not even list this fact), so you are getting more coconut flavor in each can.  The one big thing we DO NOT like is that it contains preservatives.  This brand does not seem to be available without it; we checked their website.  So, even though we like it, we are trying other brands without preservatives.  This contains coconut milk--70%, water and potassium metabisulphite (E224).  As yet, we have not been able to find another brand of coconut cream similar to this.  We DO like that there are clear, easy to decipher, production and expiration dates on each can.  Many brands do not do this.  Hope this info is helpful!

review/summary: Nice product, but not *that* nice
review/text: One day I bought a can of coconut cream at the supermarket, just to see what it was. One day, I got around to opening the can. It was thick n creamy, very yummy, excellent in my morning cup of cocoa chai, perfect for baked goods when moistness was needed. It went fast. Too fast. Now I can't find it on a store shelf anywhere in my town. Not even sure it was Savoy brand. But I was glad to find it here at Amazon. For $1.62 it's worth it to try and see if it's the same product that I liked so well. But $6.75 for shipping?! Not if I never eat coconut cream again. Even if I had a million dollars, I wouldn't pay $6.75 shipping for a $1.62 item of any sort. It's the principle of the thing.

review/summary: By far the best ginger ale I've ever had
review/text: I found this at my local Hong Kong Supermarket of all places! It was $2/bottle, which is reasonable for gourmet soda. This stuff is delicious! It's by far the best ginger ale I've ever had. The ingredients are all natural and high quality. The ginger has a real kick to it and leaves a lingering bite for several minutes after drinking.<br /><br />I'm not sure what hibiscus tastes like on its own, but maybe not much. Refreshing, bubbling, with a nice bite, I love this stuff! The cap is twist off. Calorie content is comparable to a can of soda, at 160 calories per bottle.<br /><br />It's made in New York (I believe Brooklyn), with their main office in the Lower East Side/Chinatown, next to a funeral home. :|

review/text: I am really picky about snack bars. I was anxious to try this one especially since its gluten-free. The bars are really good. They don't have that weird chemically sweet taste that some bars do. I think this is from the short list of ingredients.<br />The only reason I didn't give these 5 stars is that some times they are a little hard. It varies from just the right consistency to "I am glad I have strong teeth" but the taste is consistent and always excellent.

review/summary: my entire family loves these bars - super high protein
review/text: We just discovered these and can't live without them as an emergency snack for the car, purse and in backpacks - the protein is what fills you up when you're starving, and will keep you full, vs. another snack that isn't worth the calories. 200 calories, 9 grams protein, 27 grams carbs and 6 grams fat - carbs are high but worth it. Super high protein and they are very light. I found them cheaper at a local store ($6 for 6), but they sell out quickly so I've had to order from amazon. The other Oskri bars are tasty, but low in protein, so we only get the ones labelled protein bars. Happy to finally find a bar that everyone likes, with a light texture - other protein bars we've tried have been chemical tasting or gross flavors.

Wish the bar had more cashews.

review/summary: grain-free best way to go
review/text: We adopted 2 shelter kittens this past June & switched them both over to Felidae Grain-Free kibble. I did a lot of research & going grain and gluten-free is important to us. My kittens have soft, silky coats with a wonderful sheen - most likely due to this food.<br /><br />While it's frustrating not to be able to purchase this at PetSmart or Petco when buying litter and canned food, I'm thrilled that Amazon is selling this & offers free shipping (I buy 2 at a time). So free shipping and delivered to my door is a no-brainer!<br /><br />Our 8 yr old formerly feral cat doesn't care for this dry food, but that's because he was eating a grocery store bought dry food that was full of all the bad stuff that tastes yummy. (Purina Naturals) We've gone grain-free so this poor guy has to suck it up & eat Felidae when he wants to munch on something crunchy, otherwise he just eats his canned food.<br /><br />I believe in offering both canned and dry food to cats.<br /><br />BTW- if you want grain-free canned, you might be surprised to learn that all "Classic" Fancy Feast flavors are grain-free (& most are gluten-free too). Cats don't eat fruits and vegetables in the wild, so I'm not falling for the Wellness Grain-free hype & switched back to Fancy Feast when I found out the pate-type Classic is grain-free/gluten-free & also approved for diabetic kitties! (don't have that problem however) Fancy Feast does use meat by-products, but the company assured me (& followed up in writing!) that their by-products are clean & only contain organ meats. And the by-products are not the first few ingredients which is also important to check when purchasing cat food.<br /><br />UPDATE OCT 5 2011: There is a brand new totally toxin-free, grain-free cat kibble on the market: It's called "CATWELL" and can be purchased online at RedMoon. They make other formulas, but the CATWELL is a new formula, developed by an expert in cat nutrition. It also has no fruits and vegetables both of which harm a cat's kidney and liver & cause crystals/stones! My cats enjoying this switch.

The foster home I picked my cat up from was using Felidae Grain-Free so I decided to continue using the brand and see how things went.  I am very pleased with the results so far, as my cat's coat is very silky and I have not detected any odors from the urine or feces (which I did from other premium brands I fed to my past cats).<br /><br />The best part is getting the food delivered to my doorstep for less than the cost of purchasing from (and driving to) a local merchant!

This not only funks up the house, but one of the cats won't use his litterbox when his stool smells this bad, so there are accidents in the house. Anyway, if it works for your kitties, great.

review/summary: Super soft and healthy cat!
review/text: I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will of course eat anything I give him :-)).<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. I have to blame at least SOME of this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or 2 of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!

When I took the kittens for their vet checkup 6 months later, my own vet also agreed that this is the best food available and was so pleased with the health of the kittens. My older cats have also seen a huge improvement in their coats -- much more silky and shiny, shedding is reduced and their weight is easily maintained on this food. I recommend trying this food if you have finicky cats or they have health problems.<br /><br />My cats absolutely LOVE all the Avoderm Select Cuts (chunky-style) flavors AND all the flavors of this pate-style food. The seafood flavors seem to be the most popular among the cats, but many vets recommend avoiding too much seafood for male cats due to the urine crystals it can cause. I started feeding the beef and chicken exclusively and they eat every last drop.<br /><br />Bottom line: It costs more than your average food, but it's worth every penny (buying it by the case can give you a pretty good discount from most vendors). If you consider that it keeps them healthier, which can save you from expensive vet bills in the long run, then it's worth it. Plus, think of the time you'll save not having to clean up after their shedding! Also, I've noticed that this brand does not result in the runny, smelly poo that some other, cheaper brands do. Try this food out on your cats -- you'll be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Smelly but cats like it
review/text: Pros:<br />-All of my cats seem to like it<br />-Relatively low ash content<br />-Cheaper than many canned foods of equivalent quality<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Very smelly, both before and after cats eat it :-P<br />-Despite being called "chicken formula" it contains fish, which is bad news for cats with urinary problems<br /><br />Since my cats like it so well I think I will stick with it for a while to see if the stinky litterbox issue continues or if their digestive systems adjust.

review/summary: Excellent cat food.
review/text: AvoDerm wet is one of the few brands I'll feed my cat although he has no preference.  I am extremely picky about the ingredients put into cat food; I will not feed him anything that has grain/wheat, high fructose corn syrup, sugars, and fillers such as vague and unspecified animal parts.<br /><br />For now, I exclusively feed him AvoDerm Natural Chicken, a 5.5 ounce can a day according to my cat vet.  My cat has such a beautiful, soft sleek coat that many people comment on when they see him.  I truly believe that this is a result of feeding him a higher-quality cat food.<br /><br />I've purchased other cat foods that were similar in ingredients and content breakdown (especially when I was on tough times), but when times got better, I always went back to purchasing AvoDerm.  I find that AvoDerm doesn't have a weird, lingering after smell that the other cat foods tend to have.<br /><br />Aside from getting a fantastic cat food, I don't have to go to the pet store to purchase it.  With Prime shipping, I get it in two days!  Moreover, Amazon's price is lower, so I save money buying it here, even when it's rarely on sale at the store.

review/summary: My cats' favorite food
review/text: My cats absolutely go nuts for Avoderm's plain chicken food. This has been their favorite long-standing food since we switched to Avoderm. I love the brand and am very pleased that they include natural, wholesome real food in their pet foods, not "chicken meal" or something that isn't even food. My cats are so healthy and their coat is extremely soft and shiny and I absolutely attribute that to the Avoderm food that they eat.

review/summary: We Wanted to Like It!
review/text: I really wanted my kittens to like Avoderm canned foods but sadly none were a hit. This formula was the first to be shunned. It has a nice pate texture to it but the color was seemingly odd, like an orange. I've since plated two other Advo formulas, purchased from two different vendors and got the same poor results. This brand is usually in the top 5 best cat foods out there if you feed grain free and or human grade. I'm really bummed this food isn't being accepted. Maybe when they're older they'll have more of a palate for it.<br /><br />I'm giving this review only 1 star only due to my own experience. I'm sure others are very happy with it.

review/summary: Definitely Chocolate
review/text: I first tried the double chocolate brownie cookies before they improved them, and they would've earned more like a 3 or 4 star rating.  I decided to give them another try after I noticed the new packaging proclaiming "Now even tastier!"  They are beyond delicious.  You don't have to go looking for flavor - it's right there.  It's a great treat for anyone, let alone those of us cutting out or cutting back on gluten.  They're the right density, moistness, and chewiness, just like the perfect brownie.  It is true that you only get 12 in a box and they are kind of small.  I ration them so I only go through a box a week.  It's not the box to reach for if you're really hungry.  They make a great quick-fix, though.

They're on the small side and fairly expensive, but so is most gluten and diary free food. They're incredibly good for you, made with date paste (which you can't taste), and sweetened with juice concentrates. Lower in sugar, and they have fiber! But they're oh so chocolaty and hit the spot. I highly recommend.

review/summary: Great cookie and best price!
review/text: My son is on a gluten free and casein free diet for 3 years now, and also allergic to soy, and these cookies have been a welcome fun addition to his diet. They're his favorite with the chocolate chips one. They are very chocolatey, not overly sweet, and have a chewy texture (not chalky). They are not really like brownies but taste more like a regular soft chocolate cookie. The cookies are great (like most of Enjoy Life products) but a little pricey, there are only 12 in the box. We go through a lot of those since my 14 months old baby started eating them too!...<br />I am thrilled (and editing my previous review accordingly) to see that Amazon now sells those directly! (it used to be through an outside seller with outstanding shipping charges). Let alone the convenience of getting them on my doorstep, this is the better price I have found anywhere! :-)

review/summary: Edible, But Not as Good As Hoped For
review/text: I must start off by saying that I really really love the Enjoy Life gluten-free Snickerdoodle cookies...even if they don't taste exactly like snickerdoodles.  So I thought I would try this flavor and ended up being disappointed.<br /><br />These Double Chocolate Brownie Cookies are a bit dry and don't really have much chocolate flavor when it comes right down to it.  Certainly, they don't taste like brownies, not even a good gluten-free brownie.  If you do buy them, eat them right away, because they get even more dry by the next day.<br /><br />Instead, I'd recommend French Meadow's gluten-free brownies which actually have a lot of chocolate flavor, are soft, and taste good whether you eat them right out of the freezer or heat them up in the microwave.

review/text: These don't taste like brownies or cookies, more like grainy cookie dough. They are tiny too, more like brownie "bits." To be fair, they are chocolatey, but the chocolate chips are pathetic and clash with the texture of the cookie. These are similar to Nana's gluten free cookies, which I don't care for either. Pamela's cookies are much better (http://www.amazon.com/Pamelas-Products-Chocolate-Chocolate-Cookies-5-29-Ounce/dp/B000DZH19U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1335229020&sr=8-1).

They have a rich cocoa flavor, with real chocolate chips that crunch pleasantly between the teeth, and a soft but not squishy texture reminiscent of Mom's home-baked brownies.  Even our household's gluten eaters love them.  This is the dessert we've been looking for ever since my household went gluten-free.

review/summary: Not the best, but pretty good for SF and GF
review/text: I can't have soy or gluten, so my choices of cookies are very limited unless I make my own. And making your own isn't something you will always have time to do. So when I wanted a quick fix I tried these and thought they were "good enough" for being one of the only SF and GF cookies I can eat.<br />I like the texture, chewy in a brownie type way, not overly dry or moist. Easy to pop in your mouth<br />I feel like they could be chocolaty-er though. I was eating them thinking they tasted "chocolate-ish" and then looked at the ingredients and it said 'date paste' near the top, which is totally what I was tasting. Those of you who eat dates know they can have a rich taste, similar to chocolate. Overall, they are good enough I think. I ate the whole box, which is a sign that they weren't bad enough to throw them away. Which is what usually happens when I try different GF cookies. They kind of taste like a healthier version of a chocolate brownie cookie.

review/summary: I don't like tossing food.
review/text: Yeah, these are pretty inedible.<br /><br />First, there's the texture.  I could forgive that if there were other positive points about these so-called cookies.  They basically taste like dates, not chocolate.  There are chocolate chips in them, but they were very underwhelming.  I could get over the date-ness and texture of the snickerdoodles, but those at least had some cinnamon to balance it all out.  The supposed chocolate content of these cookies gets overpowered by the fruitier components and lost to the ages.  I'm going to throw out the rest of the box.  Even if I knew someone who wanted them, I wouldn't want to subject anyone else to the vile flavor unless I told them beforehand that they were eating DATE cookies and not BROWNIE cookies.  These are not brownies, never have been, and never will be.  The end.<br /><br />Go into it thinking they're date cookies and maybe you won't be disappointed or disgusted.  Me, I hate dates.<br /><br />And, as others have mentioned, they are REALLY small.  They were migrating all over the place in the package when I first opened the box and having a party at one end of the tray.  Probably celebrating how awful they all taste.

review/text: I've been sampling different gluten free cookies. These ones have a certain taste that reminds me of ones that I got at Wholefoods. It's not exactly tasty--a little... something. I suppose you could get used to these and enjoy them--they are free of "most things" and so it might be a good option for some people. They are soft on the inside, which is nice. There is a "je ne sais quoi" missing from these, though.<br /><br />I think the Pamela's cookies are much better, although they have egg in them. I'd say the Mi-del are also better, although they have more stuff too.

review/summary: NUTRITION FACTS LISTED HERE ARE WRONG! 130 calories . .
review/text: My big problem with this product has more to do w/ incorrect nutritional information than any comments I can/will make about flavor. The cookie serving on the box reads 130 calories not 120, 5g of fat and 110mg or 5% sodium which is high considering this is only for TWO small (1 inch?) cookies. Sodium is actually a concern for many people so I'm a little disappointed by this irresponsible post. I would have chosen another variety if I had known the actual figures.<br /><br />Update: Apparently the erroneous information is Enjoy Life's fault not Amazon's. I find it very bad that a business of this size cannot be bothered to check what they have listed on their website. For that, I am downgrading my review to a 2. How can I be sure that they haven't inadvertently neglected to list an item in their ingredient list that I may be allergic to because they couldn't be bothered w/ details?

Pretty much the closest substitute I've been able to find for club crackers/butter crackers.<br /><br />On the down-side, I ordered the 6 pack of boxes and sadly every box was full of broken crackers. Not just one or two, but almost every cracker. I ended up saving the cracker crumbs to use instead of breadcrumbs in my meatloaf recipe, but it was so frustrating to not have intact full size crackers. Hopefully the company & Amazon will get better at packaging/shipping.<br /><br />All told, I'll try ordering them again because I can't find this brand locally.

review/summary: Best gluten free cracker ever!
review/text: Bought these for Passover since two family members are gluten intolerant. Turns out everyone thought these were better than the regular and all the gluten free ones disappeared leaving the regular type untouched. The supermarkets are sold out. I'm glad to find them here on Amazon as we want these year round. These are the best gluten free crackers we've ever tried. The toasted onion crackers are especially wonderful.

review/text: This is the best tasting matzoh I've had, especially the onion version.  No way to tell its gluten free other than it crumbles slightly more easily.  I currently eat it year round and take it when I travel (in a hard rubbermaid case) just to be sure I have gluten-free alternative when faced with buffets filled with buns & cakes.<br />Only issue:  VERY expensive when ordered on line.  Cheaper in stores, when they have it.

review/summary: FANTASTIC Green Tea
review/text: I love loose tea and for the most part, I've always gotten Adagio loose green, oolong, and white teas.  They are all very good.  A lot of green tea can have a bitter taste (particularly if it is steeped to long) or taste kind of grassy, both of which can be good depending on your taste.<br /><br />This Green Snail Spring Green tea is neither bitter, nor very grassy, it just has a nice smooth mellow green tea taste.  It's not bitter at all and has just the slightest grassy taste to it.<br /><br />It comes in a cool package but you need to be really careful when you open it or you will lose half of it on the floor.  The inside part of the aluminum container does not go all the way up inside the container but the tea inside it does.  If you open it up by simply taking the top off you've got tea all over your feet all of a sudden.<br /><br />If you like a nice mellow green tea, give this a try but be careful when you open the container!

I have to say I am pleased with the flavor, but fall back to the original feeling that the price with shipping was much too high and I will not be purchasing any more in the future.<br /><br />I will update this review when the candy actually arrives. The low review is for the shipping cost, which was a jolt to me. The cost of the candy was $6.50, but the cost of the shipping was $8.00!! This brings the price up to over $14 per pound! I am hoping these are amazing candies so I can improve my review, but at this point I am not sure if I would have purchased them knowing the true cost. Still, it is an item I was looking for for a considerable time.

Furthermore, while it's not labeled when it arrives, it appears to Missouri Meerschaum's cheapest model, the Missouri Pride. It's basically a disposable pipe which is why a package of them makes some sense.  Save your money.  Go elsewhere and get one of Missouri Meerschaum's better pipes for half of what you'll spend here. Or, for that matter, go elsewhere and buy 4 of these for the same money.

review/summary: Fantastic Green Tea, the Best of Tazo
review/text: *****<br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br />*****

review/summary: Tazo China Green Tips Green Tea
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for about a year, on and off. It is the best green tea that I have tasted. I brew it overnight at room temperature, and I find that it has a full, smooth, and mild flavor.<br /><br />Another writer stated that the fluoride levels associated with this tea are 8 mg/L - that is, indeed, pretty high. Unfortunately, the writer did not quote a source or describe how the levels were measured, so we don't know how realistic this number is, and how it relates to the number of cups consumed. Unfortunately, too, it seems that many other sites have picked up all these Amazon reviews verbatim, and copied them to their own sites, so this information is spread across the net. I have heard (from other sources) of Chinese product fluoride levels and would like to know the truth - in real numbers - about the fluoride levels in China Green Tips tea. So I contacted Starbucks. They replied...<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Starbucks Coffee Company. Unfortunately, the information you are requesting is proprietary information, which we are unable to divulge. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause." One wonders if by "proprietary," do they mean that the fluoride levels are part of the "secret" ingredients from which they make China Green Tips tea (and here I was thinking that the tea was, well, you know, tea leaves...) OR are the fluoride levels really so high that they are afraid to let folks know for fear that tea sales will suffer? One can only speculate...<br /><br />~R~<br /><br />Update: 2010-12-02: I contacted the FDA to get their informal (non-binding) opinion. They replied that Starbucks answer is accurate under federal law. The FDA does not currently have authority over food service and the regulations for labeling do not apply. Foods imported into the U.S. must comply with FDA regulations so no excess of fluoride or other contaminants would be permitted.<br /><br />So I did further research and found this report "http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/Fluoride/F02.pdf", which has entries showing green tea<br />Tea, green, brewed - 1.15 ppm<br />Tea, green, decaffeinated, brewed - 2.72 ppm<br />In water, at low concentrations, the approximation 1ppm = 1 mg/L holds up pretty good because the density of the solution is approximately 1 g/mL or 1 kg/L If you start getting in the range greater than 1000 mg/L, this starts breaking down.<br /><br />So we still don't know why Starbucks doesn't want to give a range for fluoride for their green teas. I /did/ discover that green tea has much less fluoride, on average, than black tea. (See the report.)<br /><br />These folks "http://www.traditionalmedicinals.com/FAQs_ingredients" state (2010.12.02) "We have had our organic green tea products tested for fluoride at an independent laboratory and the test results have shown none detected." (I neither recommend for nor recommend against this company.)<br /><br />"The American Journal of Medicine, Volume 118, Issue 1 , January 2005, Pages 78-82, Skeletal fluorosis and instant tea" may be of some interest.<br /><br />~R~

review/summary: Very good flavor, more like a Japanese-style green
review/text: I really enjoy the distinct flavor of this Tazo. I prefer the straight green teas, rather than those with other flavorings added (except for the delicious Genmai Cha with toasted rice).  I've been trying a variety of Japanese green teas, including Sencha, and some brands have been high in quality and flavor.  But they have been weaker-tasting than this one, too, which has disappointed me.  I find that most Chinese green teas tend to have a smokier or not as bright flavor, and are sometimes not even green in color.  Although labeled "China", this Tazo looks and tastes more like a grassier Japanese-style green tea.  I've read that fluoride levels in green teas, particularly those from China, can be pretty high, and I don't think this Tazo green is organic either.  Some teas labeled "Japanese" are actually harvested in China.  I noticed many green teas advertised here do not mention where the tea comes from.  It's a concern, though not a deal-breaker, and I'm still looking for a real Japanese green tea that matches the flavor strength of this one, as well as the reasonable price.

review/text: I buy a lot of coffee on Amazon. I was drinking Millstone ground hazelnut decaf. This time I decided to go with something different, as I like to grind the beans fresh. This coffee is quite good. I brew a half of a pot at a time, as I like to keep the standing time on the burner to a minimum. The longer coffee sits on the burner, it gathers a bitter taste. Now, I've read comments on how decaf coffee tastes bitter... Well my first pot of the day is 'Kick Ass' dark roast, caffenated. The rest of the day, it's decaf. Quite honestly, I wouldn't know if decaf is naturally more bitter or not. I just know what tastes good and what is worth buying.  I will def. be ordering this again, I love it! I hope this helped.

review/summary: Sorry to give these up -- afraid of cancer recurrence
review/text: The flavor of these bars is very, very good.  They are filling and have many good nutritive qualities.<br /><br />That being said, we have to stop buying these bars.  They are using soy protein isolate, which probably met two of the manufacturer's goals:<br /><br />1) Vegetarian/non dairy<br />2) Save money -- that is one cheap-o source of protein<br /><br />Although we all know that an alternative -- WHEY protein from cross-microfiltration -- is the highest form of protein available right now, it is expensive.  It is more easily assimilated than soy, causes fewer GI issues (gas, indigestion, etc.), and has a better amino acid profile, etc., plus has little to no lactose remaining.<br /><br />"Instead of using destructive chemicals, cross-flow microfiltration uses filters to separate protein from undesirable fat, cholesterol and lactose, based on molecular size and shape.(18) The low-temperature process isolates the native protein of whey at its biologically natural pH, carefully preserving its biological activity. GMPs and other immune-boosting components remain intact."<br /><br />informational reference:  www &lt;dot> sportswhey &lt;dot> com/science_ion_exchange.htm<br /><br />Aside from the problem we have with the grossly inferior form of protein they are using, our main reason for stopping with this product is this:<br /><br />>>>>> We don't want our cancer to return. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />We have had breast cancer, and it was estrogen positive.  Our oncologist has indicated that while foods containing soy are ok in reasonable amounts, SOY ISOLATES ARE NOT SAFE FOR THESE TYPES OF CANCERS.<br /><br />Research backs this up.<br /><br />These bars are possibly cancer-promoting in the sense that they have estrogenic-effects.<br /><br />Women who are at risk for breast cancer (and who knows how much of the population this includes -- we don't know until after we have gotten it most of the time) SHOULD NOT BE EATING THESE BARS.<br /><br />Maybe they can put a warning label on them to say women should check with their doctors before consuming them.<br /><br />The research on this is readily available on the Internet, and my oncologist has studied this issue extensively.<br /><br />We are sad to give these bars up because they were our favorite in terms of flavor.

review/text: My dog is 1 year 7 months old. She has had minor digestive issues when changing food in the past. I tried the other Rachael Ray foods and they were good, but after feeding Just 6 to my dog, I noticed she started to grow hair under her belly (it had been almost bare) and her breed is known to react through their hair and skin to foods. When we adopted her, her parents both had hardly any hair because of a food change. Seeing her coat get thicker and shine makes me really happy that we switched to just 6- no corn, no allergens, etc. However, I only wish it wasn't only "lamb meal". Other than that, I trust it and am glad to see such positive changes!

review/summary: Eats only when starving
review/text: We rescued a mini schnauzer and I wanted to feed her the best of the best as she looked malnourished and too bony.  Not knowing her usual appetite, I proudly served her this food and she would eat at it here and there.  I thought maybe she was adjusting to us and maybe overwhelmed with all of us.  She was very lazy, sleeping all day, barely moving.  Her bowl was lasting about 2 1/2 days.  She's only 8 lbs since I was thinking she probably didn't eat much.  I decided to try another food, she devours her new food, with the first bowl gone in 5 minutes! I couldn't believe it because the bowl had been lasting over two days!! She has so much energy and is a little jumping bean who just wants to play! This food did nothing for my dog and left her thin and out of energy. I threw the rest of this food away.

review/summary: Great Stuff for a Better Price
review/text: Just got back from walmart with this bag because we were running low on our Blue Buffalo that we can only get from the pet store 30 pound bag at $35. Well we all absolutely love walmart with it's people and lines and screaming kids. I had a headache was ready to go home and we thought let's check out the commercial dog food to see if anything has changed. Our dog cannot have any grains because he's allergic to everything his hair did so well with the blue so we kept him on it. Until today, we see Just 6 everything he needs and like I said I was ready to go home and not deal with anymore stores after dealing with walmart so we took the plunge well it past my test on being $15 for a 30 pound bag and the first ingredient being a meat and not a by-product and no grains and wheat. It also passed the ultimate test. Our dog loves it. We still use Alaskan Salmon oil and adding a little warm water for extra skin care and joint health, fish oil rocks. (Like you other amazon addicts I check on here, sorry, walmart is better in price) So I had to comment on this. Pretty soon commercial products will get better I feel and Just 6 is a great start.

review/summary: Fiona the puggle eats this
review/text: My puggle eats this and seems to like it ok. She has never been into hard food so it is hard to judge her feelings about it but I like it because she has almost no gas anymore compaired to when she was on puppy food.

review/summary: My two dogs LOVE this food!!!
review/text: I requested a sample in the mail and my dogs liked it. I got some coupons online and bought it at my local W-mart. It's less than the grocery store. My dogs transfered quickly and no tummy problems, I can't believe they like it so much what a great surprise, they are very picky eaters. I don't have to go as far to get the food and coupons/on sale too.  Thank You Rachel Ray for such a good food!!!

review/summary: The Most Delicious Lobsters In The World
review/text: In my humble opinion, Maine lobsters taste better and have more meat than any other lobsters in the world. The title "Alive Maine Lobsters" is not quite accurate, because catches can be in the coastal area from North Carolina to Nova Scotia. My father placed an order with Hancock Gourmet Lobster Company for me and they were delivered at 6:18 am on Dec. 24th.  The lobsters were alive, healthy, and ready to cook.  I got a pot of water boiling and my wife walked into the kitchen to see what I was doing.  She got mad and wouldn't let me put them in the pot.  I had to buy a salt water aquarium for them and now they are my new pets.

review/summary: Not all that
review/text: I bought a quart ($50 + shipping) direct from the vendor, expecting to be amazed based on AMZN reviews and reviews on the vendor's site.  I wasn't amazed.  Yes, it is delicious, something like a lobster bisque with a few chunks of claw meat added.  Very rich and flavorful, but not noticeably better than any premium lobster bisque in your grocery.  Did I enjoy it?  Absolutely!  Would I buy it again?  At $50 a quart plus shipping, no way.  A can of good quality lobster bisque plus a few big shrimp will satisfy your craving for the flavor and leave a lot more money in your pocket.

review/summary: Super . Definately worth it.
review/text: I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my father n law  from my children. He loved it. He said it was close to if not the best lobster stew he had ever eaten. He said it had lots of lobster in it and was very very tastey.<br />It was definately a hit with him as far as Christmas gifts go.

review/summary: Thin, Watery, and Lacking in Flavor. Unimpressed.
review/text: I purchased this with the expectation that, like most lobster bisques I've had at high-end restaurants, it would be creamy, thick, and filling.  Instead, it was watery, thin, bland, and not at all worth the price I paid.  Yes, there is a decent amount of lobster meat included in each serving, but it does not compensate for the lack of flavor and texture in the soup.  I would strongly advise against spending your money on this.<br /><br />That being said, Hancock's lobster mac and cheese is fantastic and worth every penny.

review/summary: Tasty, But Really Hard
review/text: I wasn't sure what I was going to think about a combination like cocoa, cranberry, and walnut (AND granola), but this stuff isn't bad for munching. Though the cranberry flavor isn't as good as the other flavor I tried (almond cinnamon).<br /><br />One note: it's a very HARD granola, to be sure, and so too much continued snacking will lead to sore jaws! I mean, harder than granola usually is. I'm sorely tempted to treat it like a granola breakfast serial once and pour some cold, softening milk over it ...

review/summary: Large cocoa smothered clumps
review/text: I'm trying to judge these for what they are, which is a semi- healthy candy/snack, rather than for what I want them to be, simple granola clusters than can be a snack or cereal, so they get 3 stars instead of the 1-2  my general disappointment favors.<br /><br />With most granola clusters, you can also break them up a bit to eat as cereal or as a yogurt topping. But these are large, cohesive,  chunks held together with cocoa coating, more like ting-tings or other homemade no-bake cookies (but not as yummy because it's cocoa instead of actual chocolate). They're distinct, large clumps (most an inch or more) completely coated and glued together with a bittersweet (more bitter than sweet) cocoa coating.<br /><br />My main problem with this product (aside from the fact that it's in flavor limbo) is that the packaging/product page downplay the cocoa element, which is absolutely the defining flavor here, completely neutralizing the "cranberry walnut" flavor listed on the package. The picture just looks like it could be extra-toasty granola, and the label says CRANBERRY WALNUT GRANOLA CLUSTERS in large letters with "the natural antioxidant power of cocoa" in a little bubble off to the side. The description mentions cocoa but doesn't say the clusters are completely smothered in it, so you'd expect the stated flavor (cranberry walnut) to have at least an equal footing. Since cocoa really is the dominant flavor, the packaging or at least the Amazon title should have cocoa in the name.<br /><br />As a snack, it is nice that the clumps stay together, since crumbly clusters are always an issue with granola snacks.<br /><br />If you want kind of a hippy candy, not chocolately enough to actually taste like a treat (unless maybe you're on a low carb diet), but way too cocoa-y to make a good cereal or fruit/granola topping, then this is for you.

review/summary: Eat. Think. New name please...
review/text: Title says it all!  They need to come up with a better name.  Now onto the good things...  My kids LOVE it.  We originally received 4 heavy 12 ounce resealable pouches and they were gone within 7 days.  The bad thing is that because of the chocolate/cocoa flavor the kids like it way too much!  It becomes rather unhealthy if you eat half a bag in one sitting.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Deep dark chocolate/cocoa flavor.  I personally prefer dark to milk chocolate so the smokey deep flavor had me reaching for more.<br />Pieces are sized right to hold with fingers, opposed to reaching for tiny granola bits.<br />Small subtleties can be tasted the longer you are snacking on them.  At first you will be overtaken by the cocoa but eventually it mellows where the cranberries will stand out a bit.<br />Travels well... in a BIG purse, diaper bag, car or hiking backpack.<br />Considerable amount given where you don't feel as if you purchased just air.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very hard and toothsome.  If you have dentures or teeth maladies then these are not for you.<br />I wish that the other flavors were a bit more pronounced at times; especially the cranberries.<br />When you reach the bottom of the bag you are left with granola crumbs :(<br />So sweet that you can possibly sit in front of the television snacking half a day.  TRUE STORY<br />Choking hazard for small children.<br />They go too quick when everyone in the house likes them.... not a true con!<br /><br />Highly recommend to any individual that enjoys dark chocolate and cocoa flavors.  If you have any teeth issues, including severe TMJ then I suggest looking for another company's offerings.  I suffer from TMJ and having chewed for a while cause me a bit of pain.

review/summary: Cranberry not my favorite, but this works!
review/text: Given a choice between this version and the dark chocolate version, well, chocolate beats just about everything.  But for the interested muncher with concerns about urinary tract health, cranberry has to be appealing, and I love the walnuts, so yeah, thumbs up!

review/summary: Very good snack food...just don't eat too much
review/text: I really like the Eat. Think. Smile. snack line (the Cranberry Walnut granola clusters in particular). The flavor is distinctive and appealing, and the quality is first-rate. As with any granola-style treat, the challenge is moderating your consumption of these high-calorie products. Good luck with that!

review/summary: HUGE tasty success . . .
review/text: . . . in my household!<br /><br />As I've indicated in another food review, my eldest daughter came home from college and put the family on a diet.  Um "Lifestyle Change"!  NOT always much fun!  And let's be honest here.  Not all foods that are "good for you" are "good"!<br /><br />These granola clusters are certainly both good for you AND GOOD!  They were extremely well received by the entire household -- even by some who don't care for walnuts!<br /><br />No downside; would purchase again!
