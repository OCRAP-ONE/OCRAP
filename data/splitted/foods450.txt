review/text: We use k-cups almost daily, and more and more often we are finding this coffee to be the flavor of choice when we are in the mood for flavored coffee. It is not necessarily the best cup of coffee (which applies to k-cups in general), but an excellent vanilla flavored coffee, nonetheless.

review/summary: My Standard Coffee Choice
review/text: I first had these k-cups at work. I discovered that although we had a variety to choose from, I always went for the Van Houtte french vanilla. I recently ordered a ton of these for my home and still wake up each morning to a cup of french vanilla. I love the flavor and always seem to revert back to this brand and flavor after trying something new. It's a great choice all around!

review/summary: I really wanted to like this, but I can't
review/text: I love raspberry and chocolate.  I could live on Sees Raspberry chocolate truffles.  But this coffee, ugh.  Brewing it smells pretty nice, a bit fruity, not much chocolate.  In the mug- awful chemical processed cleaner/air freshener flavor (not that I am in the habit of eating those) but hot it just tastes artificial. It does have some sweet taste to it, but even adding milk and sugar do not make it drinkable.<br /><br />If I let it sit around (and really, I bought the Keurig so I could have coffee NOW when I wanted it, not in 10 minutes) and it cools, it becomes passable.  But only barely.  The chemical flavor dissipates and it is drinkable, but only because after spending that much on coffee, I feel obligated to.<br /><br />Spare yourself the torture, skip this coffee, unless you like the taste of lysol, then it might be for you!

review/text: I purchased this product after reading great reviews on here.  I really like chocolate / mocha flavors, and was interested to try the raspberry.  Got the two boxes, checked the dates (sometimes an issue with K-cups I have found), and eagerly popped one into my brewer.  Smell was amazing and I was excited.  But when I tasted it, I was so disappointed.  Not strong on either the chocolate or raspberry fronts, and the coffee flavor was weak as well.  Now I am stuck with 47 cups I don't want.  I wish I could recommend these, but I must dissent against the popular reviews.  I realize everyone's tastebuds are a bit different, but these are not for me!

review/text: I've been trying to duplicate Baskin Robbins Capuccino Blasts for years. So I have come close using this Keurig coffee cup, then add a little artificial sweetener, a tablespoon of Hillsbrothers English toffee mix and a little heavy whipping cream. Once the coffee is brewed I mixe everything together and let it cool off and then stick the freezer safe glass in the freezer for an hour or so until the mixture is almost frozen. Then add some crushed ice and have a delicious cold drink. I am not fond of hot coffee, but love this refreshing drink when I need a pick me up.

review/text: I am so excited to see Amazon offering the Van Houtte k cups. They are by far my favorites. This one is my husbands favorite. I am not big on the fruity flavored coffes, but I love the way this one makes the whole room smell. I was surprised that I like this one. These coffees are a great combination of flavor and a medium bodied coffee. I have tried five of their flavors and all of them taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like. The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors. If you like flavored coffee that is full of flavor and yet has a nice smooth medium bodied coffee taste, then these are a must try. I highly recommend the Van Houtte line of k cups.

Creme Brulee tastes just like having a Creme Brulee with a nice cup of coffee. I am impressed with how these k cups taste exactly like the name. This coffee is not over whelmingly sweet and has just a hint of flavor. It is a medium bodied, smooth coffee. If you like Creme Brulee and you like coffee, you have to try this. You will not be disapointed.

review/summary: My personal fave
review/text: My husband gave me a Keurig coffee maker, so we've been trying different flavors of coffee.  To me, I don't care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee.  On the top of my list are Gloria Jean's assorted flavors (Hazelnut, French Vanilla, White Chocolate -- I think).  That one also includes a Mudslide flavor, but we thought it had a slight coconut taste we didn't care for.  I like the Kahlua brand Kahlua coffee, but the flavor portion is a little strong. But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor.  It's just the right balance of "coffee" to "flavor" ratio.  You can taste it, but still taste the coffee.  And my kitchen smells heavenly!  But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences.  If you typically like this type of flavored coffee, you will love this flavor.  And I definitely recommend Subscribe and Save for K-cups if you have a Keurig.  It's the most economical way to get them.  You get a discount and free shipping.

review/text: As a longtime avid fan of vanilla flavored coffee, I was excited about trying this brand of 'French Vanilla' on our new Keurig machine. In short, I am VERY dissapointed with this one! At any setting on the Keurig, this coffee tastes terrible. There is next to no vanilla flavor or notes (and the little there is tastes totally artificial and way off on accuracy for vanilla), and the coffee itself tastes very cheap and low quality. I wouldn't even give away these remaining French Vanilla K-cups, so I just tossed them in the garbage.

review/text: Well, I really wanted to like these but can't. The coffee itself was just ok. Faint smell of vanilla was there as was the taste. My biggest problem with these was the fact that about 1 in 4 plugged up my brewer. I had to take out the K-Cup carriage and stick a paperclip through the hole in the probe that pierces the bottom of the cup due to coffee grounds plugging it up. It seems that the built-in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K-Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that.

review/summary: Raspberry yes, chocolaty No
review/text: I was always a big fan Of Gloria Jeans Raspberry chocolate beans as they made a wonderful cup of coffee and the house smelled so good just from having the beans around.  When I saw the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry I ordered it hopping to have the same great flavor and aroma.  I opened the box and no aroma, thought ok they are packed so well the aroma can't excape.  I brewed 2 cups 2 different sizes.  Smelled good while brewing.  This coffee is not strong and is very smoothe but all I could taste was the raspberry, no chocolate at all.  The next cup I actually added some chocolate milk to hoping for the chocolate to come through.  No go, that didn't even help.  If you want a raspberry flavored coffee this is good for that, but don't expect any chocolate flavor.  I have had my Keurig about 4 years and have gone through some coffee so I know what I enjoy and this isn't it and now I have 4 boxes to go through.  Maybe Van Houtte brand isn't for me.  I love Emeril's the best and maybe down the road they will get Gloria Jean's Rasberry Chocolate?

It smells fantastic when it's brewing and the taste is spot on. Obviously to bring out the flavor you need to add sweeteners because both the main flavors in this are sweet. But whether I use cream and sugar or White Chocolate Raspberry creamer (my favorite way) it's a good cup of coffee. I have had this in the morning as well as for a dessert coffee. If you like flavored coffees that aren't either watery or overwhelmingly strong, you'll like this one.

review/summary: Rich aroma evokes a confectionery; light roast is delicious
review/text: Be prepared for visitors. The decadent aroma of Chocolate Raspberry Truffle imbues your kitchen (or office) as you brew this light roast from Van Houtte. We brewed a couple cups at the office (in a cubicle) and the rich aroma carried through the office air vents, attracting droopy-eyed co-workers in search of chocolate.<br /><br />Delicate for a flavored coffee, this blend made a delicious afternoon treat. And, amazingly, the artificial flavoring doesn't leave a strong chemical aftertaste. The smell of rich chocolate and raspberries lingers after the last sip, giving the impression that a team of chocolatiers just departed. Honestly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a> is heady stuff.<br /><br />We tested and enjoyed Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle both on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) and small mug (7.25 oz) settings. According to the Van Houtte website, "The 8-oz size makes the ideal cup of coffee, but you can vary the cup size if you want to change the coffee's strength (for example, choose a larger cup size to get a less intense cup of coffee)."<br /><br />If you are concerned about freshness, our box of 24K cups came with an expiration date of July 10, 2011, or more than six months from our purchase date.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/text: Very chocolately, raspberry taste unlike some of the Van Houette k-cups (Spicy Mayan Chocolate, for example, which (to me) has little or no flavor and smells like wet, sweaty socks.)  Well, the chocolate raspberry truffle definitely does have plenty of flavor and smells as amazing as it tastes. Definitely worth the purchase! Also, the 24-count boxes are great for host/hostess/party gifts and much better than the ubiquitous bottle of wine that everyone brings, assuming, of course, that your host has a Keurig coffee machine.  Great product!

review/text: I never drink flavored coffee, but this one is amazingly good.  I do love the combination of raspberry and chocolate in general, so I took the plunge.  This is delicious coffee. The raspberry flavor is so natural, not too jammy or sweet - and it mixes well with the subtle chocolate and rich coffee. Not for my morning brew, but a nice afternoon blend.

review/text: I just love this coffee. It is very complex in tastes. I got a few through a trade and kept putting off ordering it. I would say it is a light/medium roast. I really hate dark chocolate but in this coffee it is amazing. The raspberry and dark chocolate are "true" in taste. I use sugar and cream/creamer and it is like a dessert without the calories. I don't want to be without it in my cupboard. Which is why I wish it were on subscribe and save program here on Amazon (hint).

It reminds me so much of one my all time favorites, Gevalia Chocolate Raspberry. I never thought I would say this, but I find it better. When I am in the mood for a flavored coffee, I now use Van Houtte's Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Its so decadent in a good kind of way.

review/summary: One of the best flavored K-cups I've tried
review/text: Often with coffee in general, and especially k-cups in my experience, flavors don't work too well. I was ordering a book and needing to get to over $25 for free shipping when I spotted these in my Quick Picks section and went ahead and added them to my order. One of my favorite coffees from when I was a college student was a pump of raspberry syrup into my coffee. This is surprisingly very similar and very good. It's now the third Van Houtte k-cup I've tried and I've been pleased with every choice, but most pleased with this one. I added a packet of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevia Supreme-50pkts - 1.8 oz - Packet</a> and some half and half and it's a wonderful dessert coffee.<br /><br />I feel this is a much better option than those sugar laden artificially flavored non-dairy coffee creamers. My top two flavored k-cups are now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WRHQRA">Green Mountain 15535 Pumpkin Spice K-Cups, Light, 18 pods</a> and this one.<br /><br />I hope this winter that they come out with a peppermint k-cup!

review/summary: Raspebrry Chocolate. NOT Chocolate Raspberry.
review/text: There IS a difference! I was under the impression this was a chocolate flavored coffee with raspberry undertones. It's the opposite. I hate the raspberry flavor because it makes it taste like cough medicine. I tried mixing it a hot chocolate mix but it didn't work. That raspberry flavor is very overpowering. Also, it's only one star because I have a tendency to like medium roasts but this is less than a light roast. Watery raspberry coffee truffles with a suggestion of chocolate is a more accurate description. They smell good, though.

This coffee was not bad, just not my favorite flavor combination.  I'm not sure why because how can you beat chocolate and raspberry.  This is just a personal preference issue.  The product was received in a timely manner and arrived in good shape.  So far my favorite flavored coffee is Timothy's Sugar Bush maple. This flavor may work well for you.  Enjoy

review/summary: Incredibly disappointing
review/text: The idea of creme brulee coffee sounded so delicious.  It took a week and a half to get here so we were REALLY looking forward to trying it for the first time.  How disappointed we were.  There's absolutely nothing that indicates a creme brulee flavor or even anything with a slightly sweet (or sweet smell).  This is a smokey coffee and I think that makes a difference.  There's a somewhat nice aftertaste but it's nothing like we'd expected.  Now I'm pouring sugar and cream, or flavored cream, in it just so it's not wasted.  We have the vanilla flavored coffee in this brand so we really thought this would be amazing.  What's not amazing is that I'll never see my $33 again.  I can't wait until we drink it all up just so we can forget it ever happened.

review/text: I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla. It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!<br /><br />Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either. It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.

The smell of it brewing alone is probably enough reason to want to get more, but it tastes just as good as it smells.

I find myself sniffing other flavors while they're brewing to see if there is any smell at all and I'm generally disappointed. This is my favorite flavor thus far!

review/summary: Decadence without the guilt!
review/text: I am happy to find that Amazon carries the Van Houtte k-cups, as the pricing is far better than other resources for k-cups.  This k-cup flavor strikes a nice balance between coffee and the chocolate and raspberry flavors, and you can feel like you're enjoying a nice truffle candy without the calories or guilt.<br /><br />The two box packaging is a plus if you're like me and have a Keurig at home and another at work.  This way, a box can go to work and the other stay home.  NOTE: these are the 24 count boxes, too, not the 12 or 14 that seem to fill the shelves of the local supermarkets, WalMart and department stores!<br /><br />If you're new to the K-cups and want a flavored coffee that delivers the flavor in the title, you can't go wrong with any of the Van Houtte varieties.  The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle and French Vanilla are my favorites, followed by Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee and Mudslide.

review/summary: Meh....
review/text: I would actually give this coffee 2-1/2 stars, as I don't hate it, it isn't awful, but very "meh" for me.  As others have said, nice raspberry aroma and noticeable raspberry taste, but that's it.  The only flavor I detected (close to overriding the coffee altogether, so you could almost be drinking flavored hot water) is the raspberry.  The coffee is WEAK, no buts about it.  If you like coffee with body/"legs", you won't be happy.  Very watery-tasting 'mouth feel.'  I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz "cup" I brewed *two* K-cups - one 6 oz. and one 8 oz. - likely smaller than most people would brew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had brewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder. Maybe try adding 4 oz. shots of it to a full-bodied coffee.

review/summary: Simply the Best
review/text: I like strong coffee and found that some of the other K Cups were too light tasting.  This is the best one yet.  This is all i drink now.  I like mochas and sweet coffee drinks from Starbucks and Coffee Bean, so that should give you an idea of how my taste is skewed.  I mix this coffee with International Delight "White Chocolate Mocha" creamer and it is the bomb!  Perfect hint of raspberry with the chocolate truffle flavor.  You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Terrible waste of chocolate and raspberry flavors
review/text: I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.  I drink a lot of flavored coffees and decided to try this one due to the rave reviews and being a combo of two of my favorite flavors.<br /><br />I've gone through one box, and am either giving the second one away (if I can find someone to take it) or just pitching it.  The quality control on the flavorings is HORRIBLE.  One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a "tinny" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.<br /><br />If the flavor/strength of the chocolate and raspberry were consistent throughout, it would be two and a half stars.  As it stands, it's more of a waste of water and electricity.

review/text: I have been lucky enough to taste the good stuff (10 year aged Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena) and I've been unlucky enough to taste a whole lot of the not-so-good stuff (supermarket balsamic vinegar), and a few of the ones in the middle (Condimento grade balsamic) and so I have a decently wide range of aceto balsamico experience and I can say that Villa Manodori is very good condimento grade and maybe as good as "real" aceto balsamico tradizionale.  It pours like good aceto balsamico - sort of like maple syrup - and it has a very nice color.  And the flavor is sweet and sour and the different flavors hit me like a wave as every time I struggle to separate all of the flavors.  But it's delicious and a special experience and I am very glad they have priced at the high side of what I'm willing to pay (as opposed to totally out of my reach).

Words are inadequate to describe this oral ecstasy ;-) One needs all their senses functioning properly to begin to appreciate what has gone over the lips onto the taste buds.

So, if your credit card will not melt, go ahead - "Make Your Day !" The flavors & dimensions are immense & INTENSE. Thank God, you can use this very sparingly.<br /><br />My stereotype of "vinegar" is irreparably damaged! This is like a 6oz bottle of very fine Ice Wine. It should be classified as a dessert! And any drops sliding down the exterior of the bottle, just lick it [you already paid for it], because no one is watching (hopefully). DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER TRYING TO CALCULATE THE COST / BITE!<br /><br />Thanks to the chef who said in an earlier review that this was his personal favorite. That sealed the deal for me. ENJOY! ;-)))

review/summary: Perfect balance between sweet and sour
review/text: The way I like to eat it is dip my finger in it. May be I'll use a bread once a while with some unfiltered olive oil. May be sometimes as a glaze on a venison tenderloin cooked rare. I think a great balsamico makes a huge difference. Try this one side by side with a $3 bottle of cheap vinegar and you'll know what I'm talking about. This balsamico is not at all acidic like the junk you buy from the supermarkets. Its mildly acidic, sweet, nutty and rich with a hint of oak. This is not labeled D.O.P and its not aged for 12 years. But don't let that fool you. You can find 15 year aged vinegar at Sam's club that tastes like sauerkraut juice. What I like most about this is the balance between the sweetness and acidity. Little more acidic and this will become a regular vinegar. Little less acidic this will taste like reduced grape juice. Its a perfect balance of thickness, sweet and sour and I was not able to give it any negatives on the taste. Is it the world's best balsamico ? Probably not. This vinegar is sufficiently aged but in order for it to be the best more aging is required. But do I care about 25 years aging on a vinegar and pay 100 dollar a bottle so that I can get a more prominent oak flavor ? Certainly not. So this is what I'll be buying from now on.

My husband loves it too though he refers to it as liquid gold because of the price.  It is the perfect balsamic, thick and slightly sweet, it's great on strawberries or a spinach salad.  It's great for plating too as it is thick enough to pool. It is dark and rich and worth every penny.  One bottle last us two for about 2-3 mos. and I'm sure to re-buy before it gets too low. If you took a high quality balsamic and let it reduce and mellow that's about the flavor you'd get in this balsamic.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Villa Manadora Balsamic Vinegar
review/text: About ten years ago I had the priviledge of going to Emilio Romano and enjoyed visiting the place where the famous Balsamic vinegar was brewed and stored and to see the way they aged it in all the wooden casks.  I brought home a b ottle of the real thing (over $100.)<br />and let a few friends have a tiny taste.  At their tasting room they served it on strawberries and even ice cream.  Amazing.<br /><br />Five years ago I was introduced to Villa Manadoro and was ecstatic with the quality and consisteny.  This past holiday season we splurged and ordered two bottles and have no regrets.<br /><br />If you travel I highly recommend a trip to Emilio Romano.  Parmesano Reggiano being processed and aged.  The cheese is  periodically lifted off of its four story rack by a robot which washes and dries it and puts it back in its nest.  There was more than one robot although I dont know how many.  It is a huge storage facility as you can imagine having to be aged for so long.  We were taken on a truffle hunt.  Olive oil comes out of a ceramic tile wall with what appears to be a gasoline hose and nozzle.  The natives would stick the nozzle into an empty gallon jug and out came olive oil.  Ingenious!  We got to visit farmhouses and made pasta several times.  The yolks on all the eggs were bright orange insted of pasty yellow.  And of course espresso machines in almost every building, even in the convent we stayed at.  It was coin operated but quite good.  The nuns were putting their quarters in.  Too cute!<br /><br />Bon voage!  Hope you get to go.
