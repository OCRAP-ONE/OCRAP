review/summary: Icon Mickey Sprinkles
review/text: I used these to decorate a Mickey themed baby shower.  They were so cute! Shaped exactly like what you see.  My family loved them! The size of the package is about the size of a small tube of sprinkles.  They go pretty far, one package for a 1/2 sheet cake and 30 cupcakes.  they weren't completely covered with mickeys but it was good coverage.  they were sweet and tasty too! I would gladly recommend using these for Icon Mickey themed pastries. BUT make sure you order them in plenty of time.  I had a last minute order and was sweating their arrival.  Thankfully they arrived just in time!

review/summary: Great value, great for your health
review/text: I'm not naturally drawn to any tea, but for health reasons I've been trying to pick it up for years, mostly trying green teas. I never could make a habit of it until I found a small box of this locally. In the past 5 months, I've averaged 4 cups a day and have officially developed a healthy habit. I'm still not in love with the taste, though I find white tea easier to stomach than some green teas that were grassier, but I do enjoy the experience of drinking white tea and I enjoy its effects. Rather than a caffeine buzz, teas have a balance of caffeine and l-theanine that provide mental clarity and aids focus, and the balance in white tea is just right for me.<br /><br />POP white tea brews darker than a more costly white tea I was given, and I do suspect that darker color means lower quality, but the price is right. The bags also brew more cups than an equivalent bag of black tea, furthering the value. I have no trouble getting 6 large cups of tea from a single bag, and arguably, the second cup is better than the first. I'm on my second box of 100 from Amazon, and having recently discovered this listing that offers subscribe and save, I'm likely to buy much more in the future.  Previously this was an $.08 per day, $.02 per cup habit, but now it could be a $.05 per day, $.01 per cup habit.  How many healthy habits are this affordable?

review/text: Perhaps "Capriefeuille" is a clue especially since I speak French but I have never had completely smooth goat cheese.  Usually it is grainy and I guess that was what i was expecting.  Thinking about it, on a trip to France we were in Lyon for lunch one day at a charming restaurant with some of the best food we had had on this trip.  They served a small portion of smooth goat cheese with herbs but it wasn't as "ripe" tasting as this one I am reviewing.  I will try another goat cheese as Amazon certainly offers plenty to choose from.

review/text: This is bad tuna, can't say it any better. It's flavor and smell tend to be very strong, not what you expect from the top of the line tuna they make. The chunk light they make is slightly better. 1 in 4 cans actually are solid albacore, the other 3 are made up of mush, I can't even call it chunk style. I don't eat tuna in salads or sandwiches, I eat it out of the can. When I buy solid albacore, I expect that, this brand can't be trusted to give quality time after time. DON'T BUY.

review/summary: Cats do not like it but will eat it if no alternative
review/text: My cats prefer one prescription cat food or certain grocery store cat food. I have given up trying to improve various illnesses with tailored cat foods until I have the time to feed three different types of food in three different locations or crates.<br /><br />Lesson learned - remove the cats' food bowl when the cat completes the measured meal (stops eating). This prevents obesity. I made this simple change for my large, male cat and he went from 24 pounds to 18 pounds in less than a year.<br /><br />Simply follow the feeding quantity instructions on the package label or what your vet says to feed the cat and remove the bowl when the cat stops eating. Cats on a modified diet will eat all their food at each meal. It's more complicated when you have more than one cat to feed.

I like feeling like I can have the same food as everyone else. Then there are those times that I hide these in my freezer from the rest of the family and when I want to be really naughty I take one out and and stick it in the microwave for 15 or 20 seconds and then squirt whipping cream on the top before I eat it.  :-)

review/summary: Ok, so they're not grown in Italy...
review/text: I've tried this brand as well as the "Cento" DOP certified 'grown in Italy" San Marzano, and I'm sorry to say, I do NOT see any difference in flavor. San Marzano is a type of tomato, it is not a locale of where they're grown.<br />Frankly, I almost prefer this brand over the Cento brand because these tomatoes come pre-crushed. This means I don't have to get my hands or a potato masher in there and start tearing up the tomatoes to make them blend in<br />with the sauce.<br /><br />Maybe if someone is a purist and can honestly distinguish these from San Marzano tomatoes that have been imported from Italy, then they can keep buying the more expensive 'imported' tomatoes.<br />But I just don't see the point in spending $1.50 or more per can to buy 'the real thing' when there's no discernible difference in flavor or taste.<br />Sorry, I just don't feel like belly-aching over something so trivial. I"m baking the pizza for myself and my family, not running a restaurant or trying to satisfy Italian quality laws.<br />I think the DOP designation is over-rated. I'm also not cooking my pizza in a wood-burning oven, so what difference does it make how 'authentic' the tomatoes are?!<br /><br />These tomatoes are just as good as any others. I didn't give them five stars because while I don't see them as being inferior to 'the real thing', I also feel that I can make my own tomato sauce that tastes every bit<br />as good as the san marzano canned tomatoes. So, while these tomatoes aren't bad, they're aren't perfect either. I've yet to find any that are.

review/summary: Wanachi Ferry Stir Fry
review/text: This one (sweet sour) and the Kung Pao are very good. Both are better than many Chinese resturants. In the case of the Sweet and Sour the chicken you put in is considerably than the heavily crusted stuff you get at many resturants. I personally stir in a small can of pineapple chunks plus the one that comes in the box and a cut up green pepper and some cut up onion shortly before removing the wok from the stove. Too early overcooks and too soon results in cold spots. I dump the seasoning powder in a large zip lock bag and then toss the chicken in the seasoning. It makes for very tasty chicken. I also go beyond what the box calls for with the Kung Pao. I add some celery, onion and 1" squares of green pepper. I also add a table spoon of red chili sauce to the mix for added spice. It is adequately spicey for most out of the box. I found the spicy garlic to be quite good. I was unimpressed with Cashew chicken.

I put the cut up chicken in a ziplock bag and added the seasoned flour mix. Zipped shut the bag and shook until all pieces were well coated. It's simplier and easier than the direction of placing the flour in a bowl and then stiring in the chicken or other meat pieces. Be sure to stir well after adding the sauce and other ingredients, while the skillet is simmering.<br />YUM, YUM, YUM, YUMMY YUM YUM.

review/text: I bought this product because of the excellent reviews that said it is as good or better than restaurant sweet and sour chicken. The meat turned out good (tried it with pork and chicken) but the sauce has too much vinegar. There is no sweet to this kit. Pineapple does nothing to counteract the sour. I poured the sauce down the drain. So if you like sweet don't buy this product but if you like vinegar then this product is for you.

Most take out restaurants now serve fried chicken pieces (akin to fast food places)  and a "sweet and sour" dipping sauce. So for many years we made our sweet and sour chicken from scratch.  Directions are simple, and you need only to provide the chicken. The kit is very creative and includes pineapple and water chestnuts,seasoned cornstarch, white rice, and the sweet and sour sauce.  It is nearly fool proof, most delicious and enables you to create an authentic dish at home.

review/summary: Very Good Any Way You Cook It
review/text: Well pretty much any way you cook it anyway. These Wanchai Ferry meals are excellent. They advertise that all you have to add is chicken but that's really just a start. You are free to throw in any additional veggies that you think might go well with the sauce. I usually add mushroom and onion chunks at a minimum. The sauce in this kit is very good. The flavor is respectable and very tasty.<br /><br />The rice also has a very good flavor to it. I rate all the Wanchai Ferry kits like this very high but the Sweet & Sour is one of my favorites. Another nice thing about this kit approach is that it allows you to add as much or as little meat to it as you like. You can also change the type of meat that you add or opt for tofu instead. I've also tried shrimp and pork with this version. Both were very good as well. It's hard to go wrong with it as just about any meat tastes good in sweet & sour sauce.

review/summary: no sugar added and tastes great
review/text: I recently purchased the Carnation no added sugar drinks, the "with sugar" version, a 4 pack of Kellogg's version as well.  Decided to test drive them all.  Label comparison puts Carnation's no sugar added breakfast drink on top.  A third the carbohydrates as all the others, fewer calories by far, same vitamin content basically, and Carnation's no sugar version came out nicely on protein.  And, here's the surprise, it tastes really good.  So why down 20g more carbs, less protein and a lot more calories with Kelloggs or Carnation's sugared version, when this is available.  Yum.

review/summary: Good compromise protein supplement
review/text: I am a very picky eater which seriously limits my protein intake.  My trainer, yoga instructor, and physician both recommend that I start drinking a protein nutrition drink.  Of course, being a purist perfectionist I set out on a quest to find the "best" drink on the market.  I literally tried everything, including every powder mix.  Oh, I also forgot to mention that I am a "super taster" (lucky me).  I have long since deduced that when looking for nutrition bars or meal replacements, go straight to the brands that have been making unhealthy options first.  They know what they are doing when it comes to making something taste good.  Take EAS nutrition bars versus Snickers nutrition bars.  Snickers is in the good taste business and they know how to engineer a tasty treat.  For them it is taste first then nutrition chemistry, whereas EAS is chemistry first and taste second.  EAS nutrition bars don't even need to be taken out of their packaging to be eaten, since there would be no noticeable difference in taste.  Same for this drink, Carnation has been making Instant B'fast forever (at least since the Stone Age when I was a kid) and they know what tastes good.  Regardless of the stats, what makes this drink the winner of my taste quest is that it really tastes like chocolate milk.  Just to mention a few items, it has "no sugar added" which means that it only has the natural milk sugars...it is NOT sugar free.  It is a reasonable 150 calories, whereas most protein drinks are well over 200 (which is a plus for those watching their calories).  The bonus is that it provides 13 grams of protein, which makes it competitive with the other drinks on the market.

review/summary: Wonderful Product without the Sugar and extra calories!
review/text: Purchased this because I fell in love with the regular (yellow bottle) version of this and was buying it in a convenient store at $3/bottle.  This version tastes almost the same with no noticeable "sweetener" flavor and saves many calories (due to the lack of sugar, but NOT sugar-free).  You may find cheaper in the store (locally was $5.99/4pack while amazon is $22.71/12pack), but the convenience cannot be beat.  And my last purchase (March 18, 2012) was good until Jan 2013.

review/summary: Tasty but not so chocolatey
review/text: Considering that this is made by Nestle's I was disappointed at the lack of chocolate taste. The sugar added (yellow) version tastes better but it's also 100 calories more per bottle. But Nestle's should have found a way to increase the chocolate taste without the extra sugar. Still, they're a generous size, not bad & as cheap with free shipping as I found them at Kroger. I just wish they were more chocolatey.

review/summary: BEWARE, NOT SUGAR FREE !! BUT....
review/text: I was looking for a sugar free breakfest drink which i thought this was. After i order it and the powder version i found a web site that showed the label. It has 12g of sugar so if your a diabetic BEWARE! haven't got it yet so can't say about the taste.<br /><br />Update: drank 2 packs of the three so far and i'm very pleased with this. The taste is rather good and after drinking this you can see we really do have to much sugar in our diets. It has a dark chocolate type flavor to me which i guess is do to it being low in sugar, regular version of this has 31g of sugar. Turns out the 12g of sugar is from the 11oz of milk which isn't a problem. I reordered 4 more 3 packs, at the price of $14.64 with free shipping it beats Walmarts price of $4.88 a 4 pack. Looks like it pays to report a lower price when you find it to Amazon, i did and their price dropped for this since my last order.

review/summary: Not a black bean substitute, but an interesting legume in its own right
review/text: If you think you're getting low-carb black beans: look elsewhere.  Actually, just stop looking, because they don't exist.<br /><br />However, if you have an adventurous palette and are looking for a side dish to accompany Mexican food, or an extra stuffer for your next burrito, give this a shot.  Add some fresh diced onion, garlic, cilantro, tomato or a green salsa and you've got a pretty tasty, high-protein addition to your meal.  If I doctor these up right I find they don't remind me of black beans.<br /><br />Also, my kids love them anyway we prepare them.

I've tried Glory Collard Greens and a few others, and these have to be the best for the price with subscribe and save.  Yes, they do contain sodium (under 1200mg for the entire can) but that's pretty much typical of canned foods anymore, especially if you're looking at pre-seasoned products.  Regardless, these greens are  D-licious, and compliment almost any meal without any effort.

I know in a week the family will be going away for a few days and I know longer have to think of taking the large container and worrying whether or not there is a refrigerator.<br /><br />Is this taste delicious?

review/summary: 8 oz boxes are great, but other rice beverages are healthier and tastier.
review/text: I used this product for many years. I favored Imagine for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. I prefer the vanilla flavor for everyday drinking, chocolate for treats, and original for cooking, but the original is closest to milk flavor. The 8 oz boxes are perfect for taking along for lunch or infrequent use, since once opened the product does not last a really long time.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In addition, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink, it tastes more like fresh whole milk straight out of the cow (if you have had that) than what is sold in cartons in the US. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as sugar) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants. Check out this small sample of government and peer-reviewed medical journal articles documenting my statements, available online. The claim that canola is not safe is controversial, and it is a multi-billion dollar industry. No controlled long-term longitudinal studies of human safety with respect to all these medical issues have been performed to my knowledge. If you have confidence in the US FDA safety standards after reading these references, it is a delicious drink!<br /><br />United States Legislation on Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil, Federal Department of Agriculture, 1985, article 184.1555, sections 3 and 4.<br />Growth Rate, Lipid Composition, Metabolism and Myocardial Lesions of Rats Fed Rapeseed Oils J.

Our favorites are the parmesian and sicilian blends and we not only use them with olive oil, but on salads, pasta and as a marinade for chicken, fish etc.<br /><br />I keep well stocked and give them to friends who come to dinner when they inquire.  A great plus in the kitchen.

review/summary: Use for more than dipping!
review/text: I love this for flavoring olive oil to dip bread into, but it's also great for cooking.  My favorite use is mixing with low-fat mayo to make herbed mayo for chicken salad.  Adds just the right flavor without being overpowering.

review/summary: VERY DELICIOUS!!!!!!
review/text: These seasonings (other flavors: Tuscany & Rosa Maria) there is also a Parmasan blend, but the first 3 are my personal favorites, are absolutely DELICIOUS!!! They are also very versatile, you can have them with olive oil for bread dipping or better yet, use them to cook chicken, ground turkey burgers, fish, just about anything you can think of. I've tried a few other seasonings at the supermarket but they are waste of money, you get a lot more seasoning and a TON more delicious flavor with the Dean Jacob's seasoning collection.

review/summary: Salt, and lots of it
review/text: I realize that in a society that has food for sale everywhere--so much of which is laden with salt--that public demand will be for more of the same.<br /><br />However, the very first ingredient listed on the back label of the Dean Jacob's Sicilian Blend Bread Dipping Seasoning is ... salt. In fact, the serving size recommended for dipping bread is: one teaspoon of this seasoning for every two tablespoons of olive oil. Now this stuff may work wonders in various recipes, or if used sparingly in other ways. But that very teaspoon of seasoning has 200mg of sodium in it. That might be fine for most people (and for purposes of comparison, a teaspoon of table salt will typically contain nearly ten times as much sodium).<br /><br />For me, however, this Sicilian Blend seasoning is far too salty to use in an oil for dipping bread, as the salt is just too overpowering. If I were to use more oil or less seasoning, the flavoring would be substantially lessened, defeating the purpose of the product. I recognize that this is a matter of personal taste, and I also, while searching here on Amazon, discovered that Dean Jacob's dipping seasonings come in low-salt versions:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DRG4">Dean Jacobs 4 Bread Dipping Seasonings, Low Salt  and No Salt, 3.71-Ounce Large Jars (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />I have not yet tried these low/no-salt versions, but I may.<br /><br />I very much like the concept of dipping seasoning since I usually consume the first serving of bread (that comes out of my bread machine) with high-quality olive oil. And since I now know there exists a low-salt version of this seasoning, I have given the product two stars instead of only one.

review/summary: Brought my older pup back to life!
review/text: After feeding my dogs what I THOUGHT was a "Premium Brand" food: (Iams Healthy Natural), and paying for that as well, I stumbled upon this website: [...]/ and found out how it was actually rated.  Much to my sadness, the Iams premium food that I had been paying so much for, was not only one of the WORST foods for my dogs, it was also probably contributing to the downfall of my older dogs health. She was slow and sluggish, and just didn't want to participate. At first, I thought that she was just old, and then I read about what I was feeding her, and her younger sibling. I was Horrified. Think of the movie "Super Size Me" -30 days and nothing but McD's for every meal) - Now compare this "movie diet" to a Dogs Diet. If that horrible Fast Food, did that much damage to the director, in a very short amount of time, then just imagine - what is a constant diet of poor grade dog food, doing to our furry family members?<br />That was when I figured out that, I was even paying more for the Iams as well! The Iams has a 17.5 pound bag for $21.87- that comes to $43.74 for 35 pounds! Premium Edge? Only $39.99 for a 35 pound bag, and, I don't have to go to a fancy food store either! Thanks to Amazon, it gets delivered for free, by my UPS guy, (he isn't too happy about it, but I remember this, at Christmas time, and really hot days when cold water and a snack is much needed).<br />Now, if you could actually SEE the difference in my dogs coat, her disposition and energy! Oh my goodness! It changed so much that, I even went so far as to order a book, on how to bake their doggie treats as well! From now on, they get nothing but REAL FOOD. My dogs are like my children, and I would NEVER feed my kids, all of that horrible  junk that some of those other foods are made from. In EVERY commercial, they (the dog food companies) spend millions to, lead you to believe that, you are buying the BEST - but in reality - some of the supermarket brands, are actually BETTER than the Iams food. I'm just upset that I was spending premium money on sub par food.<br />My advice: look up the brands on that website, look it over, and purchase the BEST food that YOU can afford, for YOUR dogs - my shelties don't eat much (some people can't afford premium food but at least get what you CAN afford, by the crude breakdown) - For Us,,, this works out to be a win win situation - I don't have to go to the store - my dogs are eating PHENOMENAL food, and they show it. All for the same price, (if not actually less) than the Iams Healthy Naturals.<br />I never thought that I would actually SEE the difference in my dogs, just from the food that they are being fed! All it took was, four weeks for my Older dog, to turn back the clock, and start acting like a younger dog - my other one that is only four - he was already acting like a pup, but at least I know now that, what he is eating, won't start aging him prematurely. I could not be happier, nor can I say enough about this incredible brand of food - Just look for "Premium Edge" (in ANY flavor).

review/summary: Dog Food Review
review/text: I have a 2.5 year old chocolate lab.  She had eaten Eukanuba her whole life.  After reading some dog food reviews (this is rated much higher) and finding this comparable price wise I decided to make the switch.  As with switching any food you should ween the dog off the old food by adding a mixture of the old and new or you will have a MESS.  She loves this food much more than the Eukanuba.  I would have rated the product 5 star but this food does give her awful gas (due to higher protein content, I think) and her breathe doesn't smell the best.  I've been able to combat the breath with "fresh breath" dog treats.  The gas can be helped, not solved, by an assortment of candles, sprays, etc.  I will continue to buy this food and have it delivered to my house via Amazon.  Loving this setup.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have since switched to Purina One Healthy Weight.  Lab ended up gaining weight during the time she ate this food.  Has since lost 4 pounds in 3 weeks eating Purina One.  Not loving this setup anymore.

review/summary: Best tasting high protein bar
review/text: I believe I've tried just about every bar in existence. I found this bar at my local REI and while expensive I figured I'd give it a try. from the first bite to the last this was the best tasting high protein bar I have ever had. Please note that I said best of high protein bars, I've had plenty of other fantastic bars, especially whole/organic food bars.. i.e. Probar, Think, Potent, etc... This bar is not a delivry of carb's, sugar, fat etc.. it's focus is protein and it does a very good job at it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this bar if you object to the poor sawdust taste of most protein bars (Cliff Builder, Myoplex, Think, Powerbar, etc...) I also find that most protein bars start off OK, then then when the tastebuds start to find the underlying protein and lack of sweetness it becomes teidious to finish... not the Stinger! I actually feel it gets better with taste and the coconut flavors are very subtle and build toward the finish of the bar.<br /><br />Melt factor is better then expected, far superior to Myoplex.<br /><br />It pack almost 400 calories via 20g of protein.

review/summary: Excellent tasting energy bar... if you like strong honey taste that is
review/text: I'd never heard of these bars before buying them but I can say without reservation they are delicious. Not only are they delicious, but they are quite wholesome and their "claim to fame" as it were, is that they have organic honey as a significant ingredient (25% honey according to the packaging.)<br /><br />Now, I happen to love the taste of honey. But I can imagine that some people may not care for that pronounced flavor of honey and if you are one of those people,  you might be best to stay away from these because the distinctive taste of honey is strongly present in these bars. For me, that's great because I love that taste.<br /><br />Overall the bar was of firm consistency but the chocolate coating, while being delicious, is not hot-weather friendly. You will have a melted chocolate mess in your hands if you attempt to eat these in hot conditions as I found out during a recent bike ride. But still, that's not a complaint, just an observation. I'll choose another type of bar if I know it's going to be really hot outside.<br /><br />These bars pack 20 grams of protein and I think they are awesome tasting. Better than just about all other bars I've ever had with the exception of Larabar <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ENWSBW">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Cherry Pie, 1.7-Ounce Bars, 16-Count</a> which are excellent in a completely different way.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like the taste of honey, you'll probably like these bars a lot. They have 25% organic honey in them and a good dollop of protein. Not the best choice for hot weather, but they're so good, you'll end up licking your fingers anyway, so have at it.

review/text: I thought I was getting the 200 count Ferrara Pan fireballs. However, there was no mention of Ferrara Pan on any of the packaging or candy wrappers. The package I got was 240 count and a bit smaller than I thought I had ordered. I compared to my daughter's package that she got directly from Ferrara Pan and the spicy lasted longer than the ones I got from Bice which give you some fire but it goes away very quickly and you're left with a bland tasting jawbreaker. We order these quite a bit through the year and this was my first with Bice and my last. Make sure you ordder the real thing and even though Bice markets on this site the Ferrara Pan name, the product makes no mention. All my other orders and my daughter's orders have Ferrara Pan clearly marked on the container and each individually wrapped candy. Very misleading.

review/summary: The hot stuff
review/text: I ordered these for my husband.  He loves them.  The candy was fine but I had really hoped for the container as it was advertised.  He's a truck driver and makes good use of those containers.

review/summary: Poor Packaging
review/text: These Fireballs are exactly what I remember from my misspent childhood, no complaints there. The shipping packaging is an issue. The outer box was half again as large as it needed to be and the only packing material was a small wadded up strip of brown paper. Both candy containers arrived busted up and can no longer be used to store the Fireballs. Had a great time rounding up 400 loose Fireballs from the outer box. If presentation is important to you, you may want to buy a jar. Do not count on these arriving unscathed.

review/summary: My Batch Is Great!
review/text: A colleague ordered this and his fire balls are smaller than mine. I'm not sure which size I prefer. They taste the same but the burn factor is a little different. His smaller ones don't seem as hot as my bigger ones. Oh well, they are still delicious!
