review/summary: popchips prices
review/text: I loved buying a case of popchips for $13.42.  I would buy them on a regular basis if they were that price.  The product was great, the service was great also.  altogether a 5 star experience.  But now they've gone up by 70%.  Any chance of selling them to me at the original price?  Thanks, Susanne

review/summary: shipping is horrible.....
review/text: I wish I could say that I've tried this and love it, however, I can't because I haven't received it yet.  It's been over 2 weeks since I made this purchase and it hasn't even shipped yet; and when I bought this it said it was in stock, so I don't know what's taking so long.  I don't think I'll buy this again because the wait is ridiculous.

review/summary: hated them
review/text: I understand many people love these things, but I bought the sea salt and vinegar popchips and I hated them. I LOVE regular  potato chips lay's and other brands. These popchips not only taste bad but they have a bad after taste to me.<br />I think these popchips must be for "heath" type people who try to convince themselves these taste good.<br />We like what we like and we all have different experiences about this type of thing.<br />After reading so many positive reviews I thought these would be good.<br />They taste "hallow", "empty", too artificial chemical taste.<br />With a regular potato chip I get the "that's it" sensation, satisfying, full flavor.

review/summary: Dissappointing
review/text: To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.<br /><br />Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6-flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call "salt and vinegar" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips.

Not a long list with things like Cane Sugar, Rice flour, maltodextrin......list of ingredients goes on and on.<br /><br />If you're looking for BAKED POTATO, salt and pepper chips don't bother with these!<br /><br />--VS

review/summary: Love the texture and the flavor
review/text: I'm a big fan of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, so my daughter decided to surprise me with these new Popchips.  I really like the different texture...light, tender, and crisp.  The salt and vinegar taste is strong and tangy but not overwhelming.  I like the individual packages, because I actually stop eating when I finish a bag.<br /><br />In each bag there are about 18 large chips, 3 grams of fat (not bad!), 100 calories, 15 g of carbohydrates, 140 mg of salt, and no cholesterol.  They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.  They use heat and pressure to "pop" the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.<br /><br />Finally, these packages have a "use by" date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips.

Costco really has the best price, when they are available there. Since we are a big fan of Jalapeno, we went ahead and ordered them here at Amazon,even though the price was high, and we regret that purchase, the Jalapeno flavor is just wrong. Awful would be the right description. We also tried the Cheddar and that on also failed badly for us. So, we will stick to the BBQ and the Orginals.

review/summary: I still like potato chips, but these are surprisingly delicious! Airy! Crispy!
review/text: These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring. I love the boldness of the chili and tartness of the lime! Each chip appears to me like two thin potato chips sealed together with air inside! That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one. They satisfy my taste buds and I get an extra jolt from the airiness and crunchiness.<br /><br />What else can I say, except: Yum! Yum! And, oh, yes, with all-natural ingredients and only 100 calories for the entire bag, my Dr. approves them too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 22, 2012<br />Author of "Dream Reachers" series of books (with Chase Von)

review/summary: Great crispy crunch and flavor
review/text: My family is addicted to crispy, salty snacks and I've tried a few different kinds of chips trying to find a healthier alternative to the junk food they all love.<br /><br />I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DZIL24">Terra Krinkle Cut Sweet Potato Sea Salt</a> chips for their high level of vitamin A. But they are also high fat, and the texture and flavor don't appeal to my daughter.<br /><br />These chips don't have any vitamin A according the to the label, but they are low calorie, low fat and low sodium. The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family, even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these "chips" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's "good" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.

The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues.

review/text: In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.

Best of all, no greasy fingers!  I like that they are a healthy alternative to other chips or crackers.  The information on the bag well represents the taste of the chips.  I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.  Overall, I would definitively buy these chips again and look forward to trying other flavors of Popchips.

review/summary: Satisfies a sweet potato tooth
review/text: Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth.

review/summary: A healthier snack
review/text: We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake "healthier" for "healthy."  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those "truth in advertising" points that annoys me so I mention it.

review/summary: Fabulous Taste - can't eat just one but small warning
review/text: These are absolutely delicious and irresistable. The taste is perfect - not heavy or overdone. It actually kind of sneaks up on you before you realize you've just finished the bag.<br /><br />They seem to melt in your mouth even as you are chewing them as opposed to some brands that make you feel like Mr. Ed (the horse). Yes,there is some salt, but it's not like someone just dumped a container of the stuff on them. This time it enhances the chip.<br /><br />Everything in them is terrific except for the inclusion of maltodextrin about 2/3 down the ingredient list. It can have a kind of laxative effect on a lot of people and I just thought you should know it's in there.<br /><br />Other than that - there is nothing about this product that would detract me from buying it for parties, picnics, events, or just enjoying by myself.<br /><br />Seriously, they are that good.

review/summary: Great Crunch. OK Flavor. 100 Calories.
review/text: Advertised as an all natural, gluten free,healthier snack, we tried the BBQ & Sour Cream & Onion flavors.  We have a slight preference for the BBQ over the Sour Cream & Onion because the BBQ has a little more flavor. However, both leave a slightly strange aftertaste shortly after consuming a single serving bag.<br /><br />The chip crunch is great and adds to the satisfaction of eating the chip.<br /><br />Overall, a nice snack.  For flavor; however, we prefer Veggie Chips.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041BSZGA">Sensible Portions Veggie Snacks Variety - 24 Bags</a> (especially the Rosemary flavored straws).

review/summary: Holy Cow!! These Are Scrumptious
review/text: I didn't realize I was getting 20 packets of these chips but I was happy to see them when they arrived.  I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything "popped" but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with "real" chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand.

review/summary: Once again, America's food scientists bring us a new snack!
review/text: POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.  I have no negative comments about the POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO product.

review/summary: Taste more like "Tomato and Basil" than "Chili and Lime"
review/text: NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're "probably" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a "tomato" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like "Tomato and Basil" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.

review/summary: Fantastic Crispy Airy Chips
review/text: Somewhere between a rice cake and a potato chip in texture, PopChips are an excellent low calorie snacking choice. I've tried all of the available flavors and here is my assessment of each:<br />Barbeque - A little too sweet for my taste but not bad overall<br />Jalapeno - High on Spice, not too salty, not much other flavor. I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.<br />Original - Not super flavorful but great for dipping<br />Cheddar - Yummy<br />Parmesan Garlic - So Garlicky. Good but make for stinky breath<br />Salt & Pepper - Good<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Hands down the BEST flavor

review/summary: Life-saver for chip lovers trying to eat healthier
review/text: I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.

I even prefer it to Starbucks' colombian coffee (which I find too dark and acidic). This one I can guarantee any colombian coffee connoisseur will approve.

review/summary: super fun 'typical' treat found in Japanese convenience stores
review/text: We moved about a year ago, and I found this treat was in stock with a third party Amazon seller and just had to buy some!  My kiddos used to get these on occasion in the various flavors (caramel, coffee I think, strawberry) but of course the chocolate was their favorite.  Hard to describe--little chunks of possibly rice based treat with the chocolate flavoring and coating.  I should know, but I don't.  Very typical treat and my kids love that they can get them once in awhile.<br /><br />As I mentioned, these are not from Amazon itself so if you are shopping do check the vendor out.  The vendor of today may not be the same as the one tomorrow.  In this case the price was reasonable and the shipping reasonable enough to justify the fun surprise when my sons get the mail.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those missing their Circle-K/7-11 treats!<br /><br />JTG

review/summary: BIg change
review/text: Been buying this product and was so happy to find a fairly healthy salad dressing that was actually very good!  In fact I even<br />told  our leader at WW about it.  Recently, I went to get more and they had none and said that it was a special order and could not get it any more and I couldn't find it any place so I ordered it on Amazon.  When it arrived I was showing someone the label ingredients and was amazed at the changes on the label.......very disappointed that I now had 6 bottles of a salad dressing I could not use since I am already on a low salt diet.  Had called the company and they said they had changed the recipe and no longer had that particular one......too bad!  It was very low fat, sodium and no sugar yet had an excellent taste.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTE680">Drews All Natural Roasted Garlic & Peppercorn Dressing 12 oz. (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Wonderful cat food
review/text: My old cat who died last year had diabetes because I didn't understand the basic principles of feline nutrition. After he was diagnosed, I switched him to a canned food diet with multiple small feedings per day, and that was actually enough to get him off insulin!<br /><br />Although I would have done anything to prevent his diabetes, I didn't appreciate how unfussy it made him until he died and I got another cat. The old cat would eat anything. The new cat would starve himself to death before he'd eat something that doesn't meet his standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's particularly fussy about canned food. He doesn't like pate-style or ground foods - if I even want there to be a prayer of him eating it, it has to have shredded meat. That's why I was so pleased to discover this brand.<br /><br />First of all, I love the ingredient list. The foods are balanced and grain-free (so important!) and don't contain unnecessary chemicals or preservatives. The only ingredient I'm less than thrilled about is the tapioca starch (used for thickening), but it's listed after the protein sources I really don't worry about it. When I was first considering this brand, I checked out reviews for it on other websites, and there were a lot of people upset that some of the flavors contain menadione. I looked into this, and it's a form of vitamin K which is an essential additive in fish-based foods because they don't contain enough natural vitamin K and it's required for health. The controversy appears to be based in that it was banned for humans...after a bunch of babies died when they were given great big whopping doses. Fortunately, the amount of menadione added is so minuscule that I'm totally comfortable with its inclusion. (And since it's not present in the chicken-based formulas, and since I think poultry is a better staple food for cats than fish, he gets that much less of it.)<br /><br />Actually, the chicken and pumpkin flavor seems to be his favorite. I was a little unsure of using pumpkin, since cats are carnivores and carbohydrates can have some bad effects, but it's apparently good for their digestion. Since I rotate the different flavors, the possible consequences are really reduced...and since cats seem to like to barf just to keep things interesting, I'm pleased about any possible stabilizing effect!<br /><br />Soulistic's website also promises to use human-grade ingredients. No by-products here! It even smells like regular people food, which, let me tell you, is a welcome relief.<br /><br />But the best part: the cat loves it. He doesn't refuse it, he's not even merely indifferent to it - he devours it. I've tried every single flavor of the "in gravy" flavors (I haven't tried the "in gelee" flavors) and every single one of them sends him into raptures.<br /><br />Seriously, it doesn't get any better than this. There's a canned grain-free cat food with a high moisture content and shreds or chunks of real meat and fish as the first ingredients, and the cat loves it. There are enough flavors to give him variety, both in taste and nutrition. I'm sold!

review/summary: Smells like chicken!,  not like cat food at all. :o)
review/text: I wish my cats would eat this. One cat will lick up all the liquid, eat some of the shredded chicken but not all. Bummer cause this is the cleanest canned cat food I've come across. From the smell you'd never think this was a cat food.<br /><br />Unfortunately Petco only had the Good Karma Chicken Dinner Adult Canned Cat Food in Gravy (.99 per can) or I would have gotten all of their offerings.<br /><br />I've recently taken in (or been taken in by) a stray and he will not eat anything but Safeway's Mom-to-Mom chicken baby food, and California Natural Chicken and brown rice dry. Weird and totally frustrating. Which is how I came across this Soulistic btw.<br /><br /> My other cat has been getting real finicky for the past couple of yrs.

review/summary: Excellent odor control and soft on the paws!
review/text: I bought one bag each of the micro crystals and the Pearl crystals by Ultra Pet.  Having used Fresh Step Crystals since my two cats joined the family over a year ago, I didn't want to shock them with the switch so I tried the Pearls first as they are larger crystals.  I layered the Pearls with a thin carpet of Fresh Step crystals and they seemed to take to it well enough.  The odor control was equivalent (superb) to Fresh Step which is a big thumbs up from me and the two "boys".<br /><br />After finishing that bag, I went to the Micro Crystals.  Before I could even start to put a layer of the Fresh Step on top, one of the cats leaped into the box and basically started dancing around in the litter.  I don't know if it's because of the sand-like quality compared to the hard, rough crystals but he was literally having a ball just spinning around in the box.  I guess it took his brother shoving him out to go do his business for the first one to figure out it's not to play in!<br /><br />All in all, both products I tried were superb quality and highly absorbent with long lasting odor control.  I'll be purchasing the Micro Crystals because it's easier on MY feet considering they do tend to throw this all over the floor before they "go".  It's unfortunate that there's a 3 week shipping delay and there's no subscribe & save option.  If not for those issues, I would make the full switch over to Ultra Pet litters.

review/summary: THE BEST - BUT MY GROCER-PUBLIX SELLS FROM 8.99/7.99 SALE
review/text: Having had a cat since 1986 (two cats in a row), I have tried everything out there.  A friend recommended this to me about 2 yrs ago and it is hte best litter, hands down.  I pay 8.99 regular price at Publix or $7.99 on sale.  I never see coupo buy in th paper offered by the vendor.  But, I am willing to pay the higher price.  Amazon's price is ridiculous.  Wish I could buy it in bulk.  But 8.99 for a full month is fine, too.  I change the box, and my air filter every month when I pay by mortgage.  This way , I never forget either.  Whether you buy the Pearls or the Micro is a matter of your cats' preference, as both work equally as well.

review/summary: Ultra Pearls--the easiness of this litter!
review/text: I consider this litter easy because it lasts about 2 weeks for two of my cats. I only have to rake it during those two weeks, then I clean the entire box with detergent, get out the new bag of litter, and I'm done!  The other important part of this litter is that I can flush the poop in the toliet.  Ultra Pearls cat litter is the only crystal, long lasting, litter out there where you can do that--vs. having to put it in a trashbag where it can get awfully stinky!  Anything that makes my life easier, and less smelly is a great thing!

Sadly, the fineness of the litter makes urine clump which causes it to jam the automatic box.<br /><br />It also seems that the litter became very wet and soupy 3 days after being put in the box.  Following the "1 cat - 1 bag - 1 month" formula, this litter should have lasted my 2 cats for 2 weeks, not just 3 days!

There can be a tracking issue, but that has not been a deal-breaker for me. I was paying anywhere from $7.99 to $9.99 per five-pound bag on any given week, which I thought was excessive but worth it. I feel I'm being punished for my loyalty by needing to order this now that my grocery store no longer stocks it. $16.89/5-lb. bag. Seriously? Why so much higher than a grocery store?

review/summary: Working great
review/text: After fighting with the clumps sticking to the bottom of my Littermaid so that it was constantly in need of scooping/scraping and re-starting, I thought I'd try this litter even though the Littermaid specifically says not to use it. Wonder why? Maybe because you will not need to keep buying their receptacles?<br /><br />Just like when using a clumping litter, you have to be careful to keep the level of the litter at 1-2", but it is a LOT easier with this stuff because you don't have to constantly replenish it. Just dump it once per month (for one cat) and replace it with new.<br /><br />It is odorlessly absorbing the urine and I haven't dad to deal with a single bit of solid waste as there are no more clumps preventing the rake from doing its work and the receptacle (lined with a plastic bag) does not need emptying every day.<br /><br />Every time I pass by the box it is clean and fresh for my kitty. I give it a stir once per day according to the directions, but no more sifting and scraping.

review/summary: Very good odor control, pleasant texture & appearance
review/text: PROS:  good odor control, little dust, pleasant appearance, tracking is decent and the smooth crystals don't hurt little paws or bare feet.<br /><br />CONS:  expensive, can't find this brand in any stores nearby if I run out and with two kitties (one with chronic diarrhea), I tend to use A LOT so it adds up in cost.<br /><br />Since getting my kitties a few months ago I've tried several different litters and am happiest with Ultra Pearls (smooth shape).  They are expensive, but that is the price I'm willing to pay for good odor control AND easier scooping, cleaner tracking.  The best odor control was with Fresh Step scoopable clay litter...but it nearly requires a jack-hammer to dislodge the clumps from the bottom of the litter box and from your scoop...plus it looks messy like dirt when it tracks outside.<br /><br />Even though Ultra Pearls are slightly less effective at odor control than Fresh Step, they are still a satisfactory "second place" in that department.  Regarding tracking, I want to add that I prefer the smooth crystals to the "jagged" because if you have ever stepped on a "jagged" crystal litter accidentally in your bare feet...well, you will understand why I prefer smooth crystals!<br /><br />I order with auto-refill for extra discount.

review/summary: The best cat litter ever!
review/text: I tried this cat litter on a whim while I was living in FL.  I purchased it on sale at Publix.  I can not say enough about how great it is.  I think the best part is the 'tracking'.  With all the other cat litters I have tried, both crystal and clay, it drove me crazy stepping on pieces of litter everywhere I went.  With the Ultra Pet Ultra Micro Crystals, there is minimal tracking...and when it is tracked out of the litter box, the crystals are so tiny!  No more stepping on big pieces of cat litter!<br /><br />I do only have one cat, and have closely monitored how long this cat litter lasts.  I also have the electronic cat litter box, so I do not need to 'stir it up', like I would if it wasn't electronic.  This cat litter definitely lasts for 1 month, and I have found at times, I can almost push it to 5 weeks.<br /><br />And now for the best part.....Amazon now has this on 'subscription' pricing!  I pick when I would like it shipped and I get it for a cheaper price than buying it in the store, AND it is FREE SHIPPING!  I set it up for a bag a month to be delivered (wow, I will never be running to the grocery store to get cat litter!) but can change it, if I find its not working.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAT LITTER!!!!  I can not say enough about it!

review/summary: Fantastic litter for sifting boxes!
review/text: I tried crystal litter years ago, and wasn't impressed. I ended up with a soupy wet mess with an awful urine odor. Either they've gotten a lot better since then, or this product is simply better than what I tried back then. Either way, I'm thrilled!<br /><br />I love the size of the bag. One bag of litter is just right for my sifting litter box, and lasts 2.5 weeks on average with my two cats. When it's time to change the litter, I can tell because it doesn't absorb as well, and I end up having to scrape wet litter off the bottom of the box while sifting. When the litter is fresh, sifting the box is super quick and effortless.<br /><br />The litter does a great job at controlling odors. As for tracking...if you're looking for a litter that doesn't track at all, good luck! Any litter you use is going to track a little bit. I use a mat about twice the size of the box, and that catches most of the spillage. I still end up with a little area around the mat that I have to vacuum or sweep regularly, but I don't ever find litter scattered through the rest of the house like I did with pine or clumping clay litters.

review/text: I have been an avid user of Ultra Pet Crystals. I tryed the Micro Crystals for s short time. I found that it threw too much dust and was all over the floor, and the cats carried the litter inbetween their paws.<br /><br />I will be sticking with the Ultra Pet Peal Crystals. They are by far the best.

review/summary: Great odor control and minimal tracking
review/text: I have found a litter that I can live with. I have a 12lb, 14 year old ragdoll. Not only is he a big boy but he refuses to walk out of his litter box, he jets out. His jetting out would cause a spray of litter to fly out with him. This product stays inside the litter box. He also has to most foul smelling urine you could imagine. The clay litter would keep the smell away for about a week. This stuff is amazing, I put in my first bag about 3 weeks ago and my house still does not smell like urine. I am very happy with this product and will continue to purchase it.

review/summary: Long-lasting!
review/text: I was hooked on another (#1) kitty litter but due to high customer demand (or poor planning) it is periodically unavailable just when I need another order. I don't like the store brands-- either Petsmart or Petco-- so tried two bags of the Ultra Pearls (free shipping!). Not only does my 6 year old Manx like it, 1-5 lb. bag lasts about 4-6 weeks using a small litter box (which my small kitty prefers). I have to have the box in the living room (behind some plants as camouflage) because she doesn't like going downstairs (as the surprises on the fireplace hearth attest). I have been pleasantly surprised that the smell is very well covered (a few minutes when it's fresh, occasionally one can smell); I pick up solid waste with a saved grocery baggie and throw away. No smell and the crystals seem to last forever! Although she's small she has very healthy movements.... although the other brand is less expensive, I definitely had to use the entire bag every 2 weeks (at most). For me, $35 for two bags of the Ultra is well worth it. No urine smell even after several weeks; the crystals become opaque so this indicates a change of litter is necessary. I bought and used the 1st 5-lb. bag around December 6th and just poured the last half of the bag yesterday into the box after throwing out the old litter. Additionally, there is very little tracking as opposed to the larger crystals which I am constantly sweeping up. For my small kitty (6 lbs) this is perfect. For larger cats or multiple cats this may not be as cost effective but may be worth a try.

review/summary: I've found the perfect cat litter!
review/text: I've finally found the perfect cat litter - at least as far as I'm concerned.  A bit high in price but cheaper in the long run as I've paid more for crystals which have only lasted 1 week per refill whereas I am already on week 3 and there's no odor and it looks as fresh as it did when I put it in the box.  There is some minor tracking of the litter but that could be Ms Clean, aka Casey, pulling the litter out the entry way when she cleans up.  It extends perhaps a foot outside the entry way.  She seems very happy with it.  The clean up is very easy and I've only added a small amount so far.  That means I am still on the bag used to fill up the box.  I have already placed my refill orders.

review/summary: Not stinky!
review/text: I am amazed! I admit, I don't clean the litter box daily.  I clean it about twice a week.  I was using world's best cat litter before, but this is WAY better!!  There really is no smell, no dust and I haven't yet noticed any tracking!  It does seem sort of expensive because it's a small bag, but the one bag has lasted me a month now, with no need to add any to the box.  I thought it would maybe be inconvenient because it isn't flushable.  It's not because you don't have to scoop the pee.  Just a few #2 pieces.  I highly recommend this litter.

review/summary: Worst kitty litter I ever used
review/text: This product is just horrible. I have never had litter track this bad. It gets stuck in her paws and she tracked it all the way to my bedroom which is far away from the box. That has never happened with any other litter. It is also ball shaped, so combined with the tracking problem, they are all over the kitchen floor and what a pain it is to sweep it up. They just roll all around. You couldn't pay me to use this product again. I used it for one week and through the rest of the bag in the garbage.

review/summary: Product is great, but too pricy
review/text: I bought this product when i used to live in CA and my cats loved it. I was glad to find in Amazon last month for a price of 8.99. I created a subscription and was really surprised to see that this month I paid double the price for the same product!I would have kept my subscription if they haven't changed the price on me.

review/summary: good litter but now too expensive so back to Just the Crystals
review/text: I bought a few bags of this when Amazon was out of Just the Crystals cat litter. It worked really well - no urine pooling under the crystals because it is so fine. It's much less scratchy on feet and the floor too. Unfortunately I will no longer be buying this litter as the price went from below $9 to $15.49 for a 5lb bag.  In comparison Just the Crystals is $17.89 for 8.8 lbs and is pretty decent for the price. If anyone knows of a store that has good prices in Northern California please leave a message in the comments. Thanks.

review/summary: dusty and too light
review/text: The advantage of the micro crystals (more absorptive surface) is also it's biggest disadvantage.  The crystals are so small and light that they get tracked all over.  They also invariably get stuck in the crevasses of the cats' paws.  I am not sure whether these crystals contributed to the irritation of the paws on one of my cats.  Odor control is good until, all of a sudden, the crystals get saturated and the ammonia smell is almost impossible to get rid of.  I must say I like a natural clumping litter (like Swheat Scoop) better.
