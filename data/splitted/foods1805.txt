review/summary: 100% Kona - not easy to find!
review/text: Many coffee brands that advertise their beans as &quot;Kona&quot; are blends, containing only ten percent beans from the highly desirable region, but these Aloha Island Gold beans are pure Kona, all from plants grown on the Big Island in the designated microclimate that produces some of the smoothest coffee beans in the world. While the Aloha brand may not be Hawaii's best, it is certainly one of the more available brands on the mainland.  Store in the freezer to maintain optimal freshness, and grind the beans immediately before brewing.<p>For coffee connoisseurs, two phrases light up their eyes, &quot;Jamaican Blue Mountain&quot; and &quot;Kona.&quot;  If you want to give a gift sure to impress a sophisticated coffee drinker, you've found your beans.

review/text: I absolutely love this coffee! It is extremely rich and smooth and without any of the bitterness that most other coffees have.<br /><br />Don't let the cost of this coffee scare you because you will actually use less of this coffee when you brew so it really ends up costing about the same as any other "regular" coffee. I highly recommend it.

review/text: It seems there is never a place where I can buy a good 100% Kona here in the States. At last I found it!  GOLD Estate Kona is the best Kona I have EVER had. I gave some to a co-worker down the hall and heard instant raves; this coming from a coffee gourmet. This brand is excellent.  The reviews were right.<br /><br />The directions in the package are just right.  Follow them and taste the best coffee you've ever had.

review/text: Sticker on invoice: "We care about your satisfaction with our products and service. If you have any concerns or questions about your shipment, please call us toll free at..."<br /><br />Who would think that getting coffee could be so difficult?! We had a problem and it had been arranged that the coffee would be exchanged. They sent a Fed Ex label and off it went. After 2 weeks, a call was placed to check status. Emma (Pres) relayed the shipment would go out immediately and apologized for the delay. Thought it was done...  A few moments later, Anna calls back and goes into some diatribe with my wife not knowing what coffee is.  If the president of the company resolved the issue, why is someone else from the company calling to stir it up?!<br /><br />Another call back to speak with Emma and she apologized for the actions of Anna. The coffee and a "for your trouble" gesture would be sent along that day. They are located cross town about 10 miles away and most shipment are next day...nothing came.<br /><br />A week passed and still nothing. Another call. Emma relays that it should have been taken care of and will call me back next day to confirm. Next day came, went...nothing. We are quite disappointed by this company. They got the $$ and we received empty words.

review/text: We bought this coffee based on all the hype (Food & Wine Magazine, "handcrafted" , "Estate" , etc)  but as serious coffee drinkers, we didn't feel this was worth the high price (especially when shipping is added). It had a pleasant, full bodied taste, but so do a lot of other, more easily available and less expensive coffees.<br /><br />Starbucks for example,  has enough different varieties of coffee where you'll find one blend very similar if not as good (or better) tasting than the much lauded Kona........just our $0.02

review/summary: Strong and Bold flavor
review/text: When I got to enjoy a cup of Kona on our vacation to Hawaii, I thought I was in Heaven.  The smooth flavor was something to enjoy at any time of day or night.  This Kona brand seemed very strong to me - I even tried not using to much coffee and more water and it still seemed too stong.  I missed the smoothness and flavor of the Kona I remembered in Hawaii.  For that reason, I do not think it's the same Kona I loved so much and would rate this coffee at a 3.

review/summary: Excellent choice for snacking - plenty of satisfying texture/crunch
review/text: I was rather suspicious at first, but quickly won over by the crackly crunch. Often when I want a snack, it is out of boredom, and the texture/crunch is what I truly want. This exactly fits the bill! The salt and oil is typical of any snack chip sort, but only 20 calories in the entire package. With 12 sheets to a package, this will occupy you for a while as it takes a while to chew once it plumps up with your saliva. I will say that if you don't care for a strong 'fish flavor' (Japanese style), you may not care for it. For me, it's a refreshing ocean/kale flavor. Worth a little additional price for the healthier snack.

review/text: If you like sushi you will like these.  These are made of little sheets of nori with added oil and salt. The package says its healthy and has vitamins and minerals.  This isn't true.  The package lists no vitamins and minerals and 27 of the 35 calories are from fat.  (3 grams of fat per 35 calories).  Even with all this its a very delicious snack but I'd put it in the category with chips - Good for an occasional treat

review/summary: Wonderful for the Skin!
review/text: I really love this product.  It came pretty fast and well packaged.  It's 100% pure Cocoa Butter so it has a wonderful faint chocolate smell, its hard, and a little waxy to the touch.  However, it works wonders for the skin if you know how to use it. I know some people had a hard time trying to figure out how to use it so I have provided some instructions if you want to try it.<br /><br />~First remove the chucks from the container and melt it down in a pot over a low flame.  Once the chucks of Cocoa Butter are completely melted turn the flame off to avoid the oil becoming too hot and popping.  Infuse with your favorite oil, just make sure it's all natural like i.e. "grape seed oil", "emu oil", or an "olive oil".  Pure in about 3/4 to 1/2 a cup of the oil with the melted Cocoa Butter.  Mix it in then put the mixture into a plastic container with a lid and put it in freezer over night.  In the morning you will have a softer more usable product the melts when you rub it in your hands.  Use it for your heals, knees, elbows, or all over for soft conditioned skin.  It absorbs fast and leaves your skin completely moisturized it's great for blending or fading dark spot and healing of stretch marks.  Enjoy!

review/summary: RAW Cocoa Butter
review/text: I love this RAW COCOA BUTTER!!!  Once it is melted down and mixed with a little extra virgin olive oil, it's second to none! It's GREAT for any type of skin repair and/or maintenance.  It feels so-ooOh smooth and silky and best of all, after only a few applications my skin felt and looked like a baby's too.  I would recommend this brand of cocoa butter to anyone who has dark spots or scars that need clearing up.  I think it's especially good for darker skin tones, which tend to be more sensitive and should avoid chemically enhanced products.  There is nothing like "purity" for the more melanated skin types.<br /><br />C.A, Los Angeles

review/summary: Cocoa butter is great, but not animal hair
review/text: The cocoa butter arrived as described, in large chunks with some smaller broken up pieces at the bottom of the container. It was obvious that this was home packaged for several reasons. First, the container was taped with packing tape, not factory sealed. That was not an issue, sometimes you can get the best deals this way.<br /><br />However, when I got 1/2 way through the cocoa butter I started finding cat or dog hairs; I found probably 5 long animal hairs.<br /><br />The butter itself was great quality, but very disappointed about the animal hairs, I had to throw the rest away. Will not be ordering from this company again, that is certain.

review/summary: Is This COCOA BUTTER "Edible"?
review/text: I have bought this product many times, and love it. But I am concerned now, because they no longer say its "Edible", which is important to me. I have been using it for Cookies and Chocolates that I make, because it's one of the most reasonable Raw Cocoa Butters on the Market. I have tried writing directly to the company to find if this is still "Edible" Cocoa Butter, but have not receieved an answer yet. So, my quess is that it's not "Edible" So, until they start marketing this Raw Cocoa Butter as "Ediable" and safe to use in Cooking and Baking. I will have to stop Using it. :-( I hope things will change soon. In the past this was a great product for Brownies and other Chocolate type desserts that I have made. NO I AM NOT SCARED OF SATURATED FAT. . . . . .SATURATED FAT IS NOT WHAT CAUSES HEART DESEASE. Anyway, I hope this Company will look into selling it again as a Butter that can be used in foods.

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: I am very happy with the quality of this cocoa butter. As it is raw, it is in chunks, some bigger, some smaller. It does not melt or soften at room temperature. To apply it on my skin, I melt it in my hands or briefly over the gas burner in a spoon. The butter has a strong and pleasant cocoa powder aroma which disappears after application on the skin. The texture of the butter is thick and smooth. This is great for skin, especially thin facial skin. I usually apply it after shower on warm and wet skin and rub it in energetically so that moisture is sealed in. The butter gets absorbed by the skin very well and does not leave greasy residue at all. My mom and I both have very sensitive skins and cannot use any artificial products. I'm glad to say that the cocoa butter does not irritate even if it gets in the eyes. So all in all, this seems to be an all natural product of great quality. And the price is very affordable as well. Where I live, cocoa butter costs over 3 times more.

review/text: At first I was a bit surprised that it came in large chunks and wasn't quite sure how to apply it.  Don't try to break it down.  Just grab a chunk and start rubbing into your skin. That is the best way to apply this product.  It is great in the summer because it is a bit thinner in application and absorbs quicker into the skin then the shea butter.  This is really good stuff!  Love it!  The smell of cocoa is great too!  I will never buy over the counter skin lotions again.

review/summary: Don't Order in the Summer!
review/text: I just received my order yesterday, from a very unhappy UPS driver. As I discovered, the jar does not come with a film seal or shrink-wrap or anything. Just the lid screwed on. Which probably contains the butter just fine in lower temperatures. But with the 100 degree heat we've been experiencing the last few days, the butter melted and oozed out of the jar all over the package, through the cardboard box and apparently onto other packages in the delivery truck. I don't know how much butter I lost in the process, but it's certainly not worth the mess to attempt getting more right now. It smelled nice, and based on other reviews, I'm sure it will work just fine for the projects I have in mind. But I will certainly keep in mind to order it during cooler months, and never try it in July again!

review/summary: Cocoa Butter
review/text: This is great stuff. When my Cocoa Butter arrived, I found that I had a lot of small pieces in my batch. Not a problem at all! I just heated up some water, put the chucks in a plastic sandwich bag, put the bag in the water for a few minutes until the cocoa butter melted, then put the bags in the freezer until it harden up again. Once that happens, take the chucks out of the bag and put it back into the container. Now when I need to moisture my skin, I just pick up a chuck and start rubbing it on my skin! Just note that you can't put this stuff on your skin in it's liquid state, or else it will leave a grainy feeling on your skin which is unpleasant. Other than that, I love using this stuff and I've notice the dark areas on my face (I had bad acne as a kid) has started to lighten up. It also leaves a chocolate smell on your skin which is lovely. Can't wait to get some more.

review/summary: Great for lotion!
review/text: I use both raw cocoa butter and shea butter for my eczema prone skin.  Both work great but cocoa butter smells way better!  Only problem is the higher melting temperature so I have to microwave it before use but it only takes a couple minutes.  I'd highly recommend!

review/summary: Not for white chocolate, but delicious in homemade chocolate!
review/text: So disappointed to throw a whole batch of white chocolate out when the whole thing tasted flowery/soapy....gross!<br /><br />If you are new to cocoa butter like I was was, and founds several dairy free/sugar free recipes for white chocolate with cocoa butter as the start ingredient, you'll be disappointed! Cocoa Butter has a very rich, dark chocolate flavor, and is heavenly in CHOCOLATE!  You live and you learn.  I also made a lovely skin cream with this too!

review/summary: OMG!!!  Prevents stretch marks during pregnancy!  REALLY!
review/text: Okay... I know what you're thinking.  Stretch marks are genetic and there's nothing you can do to prevent them.  You're wrong.  I got stretch marks during puberty and I was worried that I would get more during pregnancy.  I SLATHERED my body in this daily during my second and third trimester.  Not one stretch mark.  My mother's stomach is covered in them - and I have them on my hips and thighs from a weight gain during my teenage years - YET I did not get one new stretch mark on my stomach during my pregnancy.  I gained 40 lbs. and had a HUGE belly too!  TRY IT!!!  I warmed the chunks of cocoa butter in a small pan on the stove to melt them.  Then I buttered myself up.  Yes, it gets everywhere.  Yes, you smell somewhat chocolatey.  Yes, your dogs will try to lick it off you.  Yes, you will feel greasy.  BUT OH IS IT WORTH IT IF YOU DON'T GET STRETCH MARKS!!!

review/summary: I'll Never Buy Lotion Again
review/text: Seeing what this has done for my skin in the short while I have been using it is amazing. I have an allergy to artificial fragrance so it is perfect for me. It takes a little getting used to because it isn't smooth and creamy until you rub it in your hands but I love it. I prepared mine like the top comment says by melting it down and putting in a 1/4 a cup of organic EVOO and poured it in a couple of old Chinese food containers and store it in the fridge. I break off a small piece at a time and keep it in a container in my bathroom.

This stuff showed up as rock hard lumps and you can mess with it for minutes and only end up with a small greasy coating on your hands. It would probably take you an hour to try to moisturize your whole body.<br />Really wish I'd stuck to Shea or just bought some Palmers.

review/text: I had been looking for an all natural moisturizer for a while so I ordered this.  First of all, it is very impractical.  You take a piece out of the bucket and then try to melt it between your hands as you rub them together.  It takes a while to get this to disintegrate.  Then your hands end up greasy feeling.  Back in the day, I use to use Palmers cocoa butter lotion and loved the smell, so I thought I'd like this product. Well, I personally didn't like the smell of this.  It was kind of a heavy annoying smell; to me anyway.

review/text: I was so glad to be able to have found this on-line. My daughters grew up in Iowa and I taught them to begin their day with a good breakfast before heading out for their day. On cold Iowa winters many times that meant a bowl of hot cereal. I'm proud to say they continue this good eating habit in their adult life. One daughter really enjoys Chocolate Malt-O-Meal (or Coco Wheats) She and I both now live iin California. Occasionaly I can find this cereal in a Walgreens or speciality grocery store, but lately have not been able to locate it. I was thrilled to find it on-line just in time to order for my daughter's birthday.

review/text: I was VERY disappointed when I received these pears.  They are not peeled and the seeds are not removed.  The peels alone I could probably forgive, but many pieces have seeds and/or core, which make for difficult eating, especially for children.  Even the taste is rather bland.  They are not sweet pears at all, and are leathery texture.  Definitely not a child-friendly snack!  Now I'm stuck with fifty bucks worth of seeded dried pears, because you can't return food.  Definitely would NOT recommend!

review/text: I bought these when I was looking for low point snacks as I have been doing Weight Watchers.  I eat the cinnamon apples when I want something crunchy.  When I want chewy and a little sweeter, I eat the dried pears.  While many times I do eat 2 packages for a snack, I still buy the .64 ounce bags since I have to get up and go get a second bag giving myself time to decide if I really still am hungry.  While it is true that some pieces have core and/or seed on them, I find it easy to cut that off or eat around it.  This is a great diet food and I like that it is organic.

review/text: *****<br />These dried D'Anjou pears are very sweet, very chewy and very yummy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, and they are gluten free. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />Many reviewers have reported not liking them, but my experience is different. (To be sure, I would try a smaller quantity first and make sure that these are for you.) These are a natural food and they may contain occasional seeds, stems, or core fragments. This doesn't sound good, but I didn't really notice much of anything at all that I couldn't eat or that was hard. These dried pears are very fibrous (like jerky), so you need to have healthy teeth to be able to chew them. I totally loved them--I think they are my favorite of all of the Bare Fruit snacks!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: Last week I bought a big jar of "Famous Dave's Signature Spicy Pickle Chips" at my nearby Costco Warehouse Store. Now, to be completely honest, the jar was 64 ounces, whereas the offer here is for a pack of three 24-ounce jars. However, it's exactly the same product. Only the container(s) is different.<br /><br />These pickles are just sensational! My, oh my! They're crisp and crunchy, much moreso than most jarred pickles. And they're nice and spicy. I'd say they were spicy much like most "bread and butter" pickles, but these are the best I've ever had. They're somewhat like sweet pickles, but nowhere nearly as sweet. I'd say, it's somewhat of a cross, and a delicious one at that. They taste very good while eating and have a nice fresh peppery aftertaste. My goodness! I've just never had better pickles that I can remember. This probably seems like a lot of hype. Well, let me know what you think. Hopefully, they'll become available soon via Amazon. Enjoy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: When I saw Ribena on Amazon I knew that the internet now has everything.<br /><br />Ribena is a concentrate, you must mix it with water before drinking it. I guess this saves on shipping and space since instead of buying 600ml, you're buying 5400ml (since they ask you to mix it with 8 parts water.) This type of packaging seems to have fallen out of favor since it isn't that popular anymore.<br /><br />What it is: It's a blackcurrant drink. Blackcurrant seems to be a berry particular to the British since no other nation sells this type of drink that I know of. On researching it, I found that it became popular in Britain during WW2 because there were few other sources of vitamin C available to British children during the war and this berry was suitable for growing in the UK climate.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the taste of blackcurrant to anyone who hasn't tasted it, only that it's a little like grape juice but without any tartness or aftertaste and quite sweet. I can't really compare it with anything else since it just simply taste better than any time of grape or berry juice that I've ever had. I can only say that it's great tasting and you must try it. On top of this flavorful goodness, blackcurrants are also rich in vitamins and anti-oxidants; it's almost like hamburgers which are good for you, or cigarettes which prolong your life, something too good to be true! You can drink it cooled in the fridge or hot with hot water and it tastes good both ways!<br /><br />When I was a kid I used to drink shots of it in a shot glass mixed with only 2-3 parts of water, ahh the memories... and the abuse my pancreas must have taken... As I see from other reviews, most Americans who love this love it for nostalgia's sake having had it as a child overseas. Well, it really is as good as nostalgia and I'm glad I can find it through Amazon today.

A lot of products are making an appearance as blasts form the pasts, kinda like necco wfafers, old fashioned laffy taffy, etc. Another great drink that has  Blackcurrents and Raspberries is calle d"Vimto" If you like Ribena then you will aslo like VImto (can or cordial) the cordial is a little less sweeter then the Ribenna.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KFX4PA">Ribena Original Blackcurrant Drink, 600 ml Bottles (Pack of 4)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O7G0SM">Vimto Blackcurrant Drink England, 23.6-Ounce Plastic Bottles (Pack of 4)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRIHSY">Vimto Fruit Flavored Drink 12oz</a>

review/text: Drank this stuff all my childhood, and because by chance I was in England at the time, all through my first labor (they allow that sort of thing there).  It's sweet, has a bit of flavor and lasts a long time b/c it's - or should be - concentrated.  BUT I can assure you it would NOT be 'better together' with Heinz Mayonnaise.  Bleah.

So I have had to order it through Amazon.com.  The first time I ordered it the company I ordered from took well over a week to get it to me.  This company got it to me in 5 days.  So originally I was upset with them for taking 3 days to ship.  But it only took 2 days to get here.  Thank you.

I must say I was quite surprised with the fruitiness of the product, though I shouldn't have been considering the omnivorous nature of the bear.<br />Overall, a bit chewier than you would expect from a dried meat product.

Why Amazon outsourced my order to a candy company who had the gaul to charge me $22.00 is beyond me.  This was a gift so I could not argue and did not know about it until it arrived at my door and I saw what the shipping charges were.  Amazon should have let me know they were outsourcing to a candy company.  I, needless to say, was very disappointed and will think twice before ordering from Amazon.com.

review/summary: AMAZING & ADDICTING but HARD TO FIND
review/text: A girlfriend gave me what was left of her little box of Halter's Watermelons....maybe 7 left.<br />I was INSTANTLY addicted.<br />They taste incredible. They are a hard candy yet  soft feeling  and pleasing to the tongue and....<br /> the box itself is a keeper.  It is SO well made and beautiful, especially the way it stays closed, I save every box. The would be perfect to use as little gift boxes for something..... or even to keep things you love in....<br /> I found ONE place in CA that I can buy them from, but even buying six boxes with sale tax cost me $15.45<br /> Now that I look at my receipt the tax alone was $9.75.  ONLY in CALIFORNIA.....  perhaps part of that HAD to be  a shipping charge I think....  none the less, Traders Joes does NOT carry them but I have no Whole Foods close enough to me to bother to see if they do as I was told....<br />  These belong in one of those candy bins in a grocery store so you can buy in BULK.  MORE PLEASE.  I do think at $2.75 a box they are too expensive tho.... I forget how many are in each box, it just says 1.4 Oz or 40 grams on the box....NOT ENOUGH i say!!

review/summary: Smoldering and tantalizing brew
review/text: Morning Thunder is an excellent name for this drink, but I have a feeling it might put some people off, as the tea is very good without being too whacky and crazy tasting. I was expecting a real potent punch, but upon reading that it had yerba mate in it, which I  drank in one of my favorite Chai mixes, I was sure it would be palate pleasing and I was right! This tea is very simple, as the ingredients list is short; roasted mate and black tea-no fillers, no funny stuff and no funky herbs and spices.  Upon further search on the internet of it I found out that Yerba Mate is an herb that is traditionally prepared as an energizing tea and consumed by natives of South American countries as it contains high concentrations of antioxidant flavonoids possessing potent free radical quenching activity.  It also includes several B vitamins, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Beta-Carotene and Calcium. Mixed with black tea, the Mate tastes like dark chocolate, just a hint mixed with the tea, it's a subtle yet an eye opening experience upon the first sip.<br /><br />I try to take good care of my health and drink lots of tea and water, but I had no idea how high in antioxidants this tea was! Per serving it had 1150mg, compared to 375 to 800 in broccoli, 600 to 900 in Tomato Juice and 650 to 1100 in Orange Juice. Tea is much easier to prepare than eating a bowl full of broccoli and drinking tomato juice, and it's quite refreshing and also tasted nice with some milk and sugar. I don't add lemon to it, just sugar and I let it soak in for about 3 minutes. Its makes a slightly smoky, chocolaty and exotic brew, yet it's still tea can be drank at breakfast or tea time. I love the cover art and the simple goodness of Celestial Seasonings, as it reaches out and transforms many coffee addicts to tea lovers :)<br /><br />-Kasia S.

review/summary: "Fresh Mixers" to "Lunch Express" Not Good For Consumers
review/text: Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former "Fresh Mixers" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to "Lunch Express," apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers for the chicken dishes, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now -- which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on -- but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction.

review/text: The antler we received was cut as indicated in the picture, with a small marrow opening on each end, and it was an immediate hit with my dog!  She was completely fascinated by it (which was hilarious to watch) and she has continued to enjoy chewing it.<br /><br />I also like that it is safe for her to chew on, no plastic shards or anything like that to worry about.  The antler basically dissolves into white dust, VERY slowly with my dog, who seems to be an average chewer.  (I have heard of extremely powerful chewers destroying an antler very quickly though).<br /><br />I had the opportunity to try another brand, and my dog definitely preferred the ZiwiPeak.  It took her a little while longer to "catch on" to the other brand, whereas the ZiwiPeak immediately had her attention.  Also, the ZiwiPeak looked a bit nicer/cleaner right out of the package.<br /><br />The antlers are a bit more expensive than NylaBones and other regular toys, but I think it is worth it for the dog's safety and enjoyment!  Give it a try!

review/text: I ordered the medium ZiwiPeak deer antler for my 65 pounds dog.  The medium antler is about 5 inches long and has a circumference of about an inch.  My dog is able to put the entire antler in her mouth at once, which makes me nervous that she'll somehow choke on the antler.  It is my fault for picking the wrong size.  I would recommend the medium antler for smaller dogs.<br /><br />That being said, my dog likes the antler.  The antler is smooth and odorless to my human nose.  My dog seems to like the smell and taste though.  She chewed on it for about an hour when I first gave it to her and has since been playing with it for a few minutes each night.<br /><br />My dog is a very light chewer in general and so far has not broken off any small pieces of the antler.  However, I still wouldn't feel comfortable giving this to my dog unsupervised even if it was a larger size.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun treat for my dog and she seemed to enjoy trying something new.

review/text: I've purchased antlers for my 8 month puppy before. She loves them. They usually take between one and three months before they get too small and I replace them. When I received this antler, it was cut in half lengthwise. I didn't think this was a problem. It was. It allowed her to get to all the marrow on day one. The marrow was far too rich for her. It took two days for her system to get back together. Also, after she got the marrow out, it wasn't as interesting.  I will not buy this brand again.

Sure, our dog loves it (yummy marrow!), but he'll have it cleaned out in no time. Plus, as others noted, the marrow is quite rich, so I'll limit his chewing fun to about 5 minutes a day. Not what I had in mind. And $13 for that? Not worth it. The next antlers we'll buy won't be from ZiwiPeak.

That is not okay with me, I live alone and there is no way I can use all four jars by 10/04/2012. No where did it say when I purchased the sauce was I told that they were soon to expire, in less than three weeks. I paid a lot to have them shipped to me, and then to find this out was extremely disappointing. I am a blind person, so until my care provider informed me of the expiration date, I had already opened one of the bottles. To say the least I am very, very disappointed in finding this out. I would not purchase this product again from this vendor. Thank you very much and hopefully this doesn't happen to everyone that buys Dynasty products.

It's a nice tea but the problem here is that without reading the label you probably wouldn't identify passionfruit (unlike Kwong Sang's Mango or Wild Cherry, which are unmistakeable). This may not be Kwong Sang's fault; it's likely that passionfruit is simply harder to indentify. I think this tea could benefit from a little tartness.

review/text: I am seeing some other reviews say this tea was very weakly flavored, maybe I got a fresher batch then they did. The smell when I opened the tin was very overpowering, thankfully it was a bit milder once brewed, but it was still very strong. I have not tried this hot yet, but as iced tea its actually decent but the first brewing is a bit strong and I usually have to dilute it a bit. Normally I make my black teas on the strong side, and with herbals/rooibos I routinely do double strength just because I like stronger flavors, and this tea is a bit strong for me, so that should say something.<br /><br />With that said, I am not a very big fan of the flavoring, others in the house like it so its probably just a personal taste issue. I have similar issues with mango, I like fresh mango but I usually despise mango flavored drinks. Unlike my issue with mango flavored things, this tea doesn't taste "bad" to me, I just prefer Roland's Lemon tea over this, but if you like passion fruit flavored things I don't see why you wouldn't love this as the flavor is quite strong.

review/summary: Subtle passion fruit flavor in economical tea
review/text: If you can pick up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028W3O56">Roland Kwong Sang Tea, Passion Fruit, 2.5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a> when it's at a low price, I absolutely recommend its purchase.  I've consumed several of the Roland teas from Hong Kong and this one seems to have at least a little flavor of the applicable fruit or spice.  I sense the sweet aroma every time I open the can.  I'm not a fan of overly sweet flavorings and usually do not select any fruity teas, but this one is perfect for my taste with a subtle almost lychee aroma, requiring no sweetening additions.  The tannins are not overwhelming and it stands up well in the cup.  It makes a lovely iced tea (my favorite now), so summer screams out for this variety.  At the low cost of around a dollar (or less at the time of this writing), I'm going to pick up more for friends enjoyment.  Although it's a pain to remove the stickers from the tins, I also reuse the Roland tins for  other purposes and save some bucks on storage containers for kitchen, office, art, sewing and shop supplies.

review/summary: My cat loves these!!
review/text: My cat loves these. He has always liked cat treats such as Pounce, but they always made him sick. I would just give him 1 or 2 pieces and 5 minutes later he'd vomit on my carpet! Greenies he can eat and they don't make him sick. Every day when I get home he waits impatiently for his treats. My other cat who never liked cat treats, not surprisingly, has no interest in these. The price is good too. Even with shipping it's cheaper than what I paid in a local store.

review/summary: Treats They Will Actually Love...
review/text: I will be the first to confess I pamper my cat.  In addition to regular dry food I also buy her snacks for the occasional extra purr and smile that I am a sucker for. Greenies are one of two snacks that I buy that she simply adores.  I actually went to a local department store here quite a while back and bought a bunch of those little expensive snack pouches all at once to see which she would go nuts over, and which she would sniff and walk away from.  Greenies was one that she practically inhaled, along with Whiskas Temptations that I have included a link for at the end of this review.  Whiskas are available all over the place quite easily here in New England.  However Greenies I have only found at the local Tractor Supply Co, (TS).  If you have been buying your Greenies here on Amazon for you have been unable to find them locally anywhere, try your local Tractor Supply if you have one close by.  The price here on Amazon for them per pouch is just about the same as I pay at my TS. However when you toss in the shipping, they are more expensive.  However they can still be considered a pretty good deal if you order enough of them at once for the shipping charge doesn't change all that much with a double or triple order.  You also of course have the convenience of shopping from the comfort of your home here on Amazon, as well as in most cases avoiding the sales tax.<br /><br />In conclusion, I highly recommend the Greenies for the kitty you love to spoil in your life. As well as the Whiskas Temptations as well. (The price per pouch is a little more for the Greenies, but they are also a little bigger as well). If my cat is any culinary expert to be admired, they seem to be delicious, as well as nutritional for your pet.  My cat seems a little more partial to the seafood and salmon flavors over the others, but she quickly gobbles down any flavor.  That could be due to the fact I feed her very little in the way of seafood of any kind, so she may consider it a special dining experience.  It's my opinion that your cat will love all the flavors of Greenies as well.  (This is the link to the Dairy flavored Whiskas.  Check out the other various flavors available).  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029NVJFQ">Whiskas Temptations Creamy Dairy Flavor Treats for Cats, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />PS:  I have noticed lately that the package of Greenies as changed its design.  It's still available here on Amazon as well as locally in both the old and new packaging.  They are the very same product as far as I can tell...

review/text: Not all my cats will eat the Greenies...only a few, but this really is a great product!  I wish all of mine loved them because they are so much better then commercial treats (which I will NOT feed my babies).

review/summary: My cats love 'em!!
review/text: I have 4 cats and these are their "before bed treats".  They get 6 each and they absolutely love them!  Their last vet visit confirmed that these do actually reduce tartar and plaque.  Their ages are 5yrs to 11 years and their teeth have minimal plaque and tartar.<br />I also have a pet sitting business and with permission of the owners, I give them to my pet clients as treats.  I haven't come across one cat yet that turned their nose up at them.<br />This is THE best place to get them.  I've researched many places online and at the local pet superstores the price per bag is over $5.00.

review/summary: Perfect size
review/text: The bags are a perfice size for small children as well as adults.  Your hand fits in perfectly and holds enough popcorn.  At first I though that the 1000 bags that you receive was rediculous.  However, they dont take up a lot of storeage space and if you eat popcorn they way we do, it's worth it.  Smaller quantites were actually more expensive.
