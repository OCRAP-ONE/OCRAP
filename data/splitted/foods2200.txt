review/summary: BEST SAUCE EVER!
review/text: And I don't mean just for Asian sauces.  This is easily the best sauce ever!  I put it on everything.  It's gotten out of hand.  I go out of my way to see what else I can have it with.  My latest thing is pouring some over peanuts and coating the peanuts with the sauce.  Then I eat the nuts with a spoon to keep my hands clean.  Sounds gross but it's so delicious.

review/summary: Perfect Condiment
review/text: I use this in my banquet kitchen for so many dishes.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and a pinch of heat.  If you toss chicken wings in it, you will have some great bar food in your own home!  Another idea: combine Sweet Chili sauce, heavy mayonnaise, granulated garlic, finely chopped parsely, ginger powder, and splash of siracha - this will give you a delicious sweet chili aoli perfect for burgers, sandwiches, egrolls, potstickers, fries, fish, or even chicken.  Like I said - it is good by itself, but serves as a great base for other things (from salad dressing to marinade).  Buy this sauce in bulk as you will find youself using it on everything!

review/summary: For a taste treat, substitute it for BBQ sauce
review/text: Once in a while you just want a spicy different flavor. Sometimes when I have a lightly seasoned or plain piece of beef or chicken, I put some Sweet Chili Sauce on my rice. Wow that perks up the whole plate. Other times I cook the meat without seasoning and add what every flavor I'm in the mood for when I reheat it. I've kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problem.<br /><br />If you have never tried this, the sauce is thicker than Heinz Ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you. Another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving.

review/summary: Really nice - sweet but with a bit of a kick
review/text: The sauce was just fine. However, I can't resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy, in the hope that someone might be able to convince Amazon next time. The sauce comes in a pack of 2, but one bottle was broken. Yep, you guessed it, Amazon sent me a new pack of two, and asked me to return the unbroken original. It's only cost me a little time, but how much it's going to cost Amazon to ship and process that returned bottle, your guess is as good as mine. Is it REALLY beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle?

review/summary: Can't Afford a Trip to Thailand?
review/text: Here's a tiny consolation: easy Thai barbecued chicken! Cut your usual fryer in quarters, cook it slowly over charcoal or quickly in a hot oven, and then brush it generously with "sweet chili sauce" and cook it just a few minutes more. Most authentic with 'sticky' rice but also delicious with brown or red rice.<br /><br />In Thailand, people squat over hibachi-sized braziers on the sidewalks and sell portion of this sort of barbecued chicken. Sometimes they trot alongside inter-city buses as they pull into stations, and sell chicken through the windows. Don't be squeamish! This is a treat you'll remember. The same sauce will enhance the flavor of any fowl from blackbird to condor or whooping crane.

review/summary: Sweet, and just down right delish!
review/text: I was introduced to this sauce by a good friend of mine from Cambodia, who runs a Thai restaurant and bar.  I wondered what sauce was used in their ramikens when they served their delicious crispy spring rolls.  Their actual sauce was handmade, but I was directed to try this brand.  Since then, (about 5 yrs ago) my mother, friends, and I have all used this sauce on fried chicken wings, grilled and sauteed chicken, pork, spring/egg rolls, and even sushi!  I keep the large 25 oz bottle in my fridge year-round, and this is the best brand I've used thus far.  Not too hot for those not accustomed to very spicy foods, but is mostly sweet.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!! :o)

I haven't tried cooking with it but I can imagine it would add a lot to stews, soups, etc. It keeps well - the last bottle I had got lost in my pantry and was several years old when I found it and it still tasted great. It belongs along with the A1, Heinz 57, Worcestershire Sauce, Catsup, etc as a condiment staple.

review/summary: Highly Addicting!
review/text: I did not purchase this product off of Amazon. I purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store, and I must say it's one of the most addicting sauces I have ever had! I'm a pretty picky eater, and a vegetarian at that, so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. This sauce is ALMOST perfect. It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear "skin" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce. I don't care where or how, just buy it. You'll fall in love!

review/text: I was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews, but it's nothing special. For my taste, it's way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough (even my kids agree). It reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. But if you're more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking.

review/summary: Very tasty Almond Butter
review/text: The first thing I noticed about Justin's Honey Almond Butter was a grittiness that I did not expect.  Unlike the smooth, light texture of peanut butter, Justin's Almond Butter is dense, somewhat dry, and gritty.  However, it tastes great -- just like fresh, dry roasted almonds.  I was able to detect a bit of sweetness without a honey taste.  This product has three grams of sugar in it per serving and the label tells us that it also has honey powder added to it giving the butter a little extra added sweetness, but, as I said, it does not have a honey taste.  Almond butter is touted as an exceptionally healthy food.  Justin's all natural Honey Almond Butter makes healthy eating a pleasure.  Recommended<br />Update: The new batch of Justin's Honey Almond Butter has a much smoother texture and mouth feel than the last batch I ordered.  I still can't taste the honey, but that's OK with me.  Less gritty is better, at least in my opinion.  Still recommended.

review/text: My girlfriend and I absolutely love this almond butter. We first discovered it in the little packets at Whole Foods. It was so good, we ordered the 3 pack and have not been disappointed. It is the perfect snack and we often make banana pancakes out of the almond butter, bananas, and an egg. Delicious and healthy.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Honey Almond Butter
review/text: In the rural town I live in, I am forced to order many of the unique foods I love; this is one of them.  I usually order the maple flavor but chose honey this time.  It is terrific!  It is not as sweet as the maple flavored but just as delicious.  My young children love this on crackers or to dip celery and apples in.  This product does require an initial stirring but is no where as difficult as some natural peanut butters I have tried in the past.  Justin's is a high quality brand and I will continue to order this brand and try all the available flavors.

review/text: I am fan of the Honey Almond Butter however the quality of the product is inconsistent.  I often find that the almond butter is already mixed however not evenly, leaving the almond butter dry after thoroughly mixing with the unmixed contents in the bottom of the jar.  I have ordered this product 3 times and only the first time was it absolutely delicious and that was when there was about a half inch of oil resting on top.  I hope my future purchases will turn out as good as the first.

review/summary: Didn't last 6 minutes
review/text: I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.

review/summary: Safer than rawhide, don't last as long but also cleans teeth
review/text: I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.<br /><br />Over all I am quite satisfied with these "bones." They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had "doggy breath." I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath "fresh" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them.

review/summary: An acquired taste
review/text: You'll either like this double-salted licorice - and, indeed, other salted licorice available on Amazon - or you'll detest it. The reviews on this and other licorice products attest to this polarity among reviewers. It's an acquired taste that, once acquired, proves to be somewhat addictive.<br /><br />I have only recently become acquainted with salted licorice. I actually prefer the normal salted variety, although the salty kick - from ammonium salts rather that sodium chloride - is very strong and strangely satisfying in these double-salt rounds.<br /><br />I would advise anybody who is thinking of trying salted licorice to seek out a small pack of the stuff first of all. If you like it, go ahead and order one of the regular-salted <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015V7GG4">Kraepelien & Holm Farm Salt Licorice, 2.2-Pound Bags (Pack of 3)</a> available on Amazon, making sure to take advantage of the subscription offer.

review/summary: Excellent slted licorice
review/text: I have been eating salted licorice for 30 years from all over the world. This is high quality and ranks among the best in my opinion. Much better than the gustaf brand which tastes a little "plasticy" and hard for my liking. Note this licorice is made in Holland whereas the gustaf brand is made in the US. Also this is very good value. If you go into a shop and try and buy it in small quantities then the price is sky high.<br /><br />Also those people who gave this 1 star because they didn't like the taste is plain dumb as the ranking is based on this brand versus other brands. Buying 3 huge bags of this without having tried salted licorice before makes no sense at all.

review/summary: An Adventure for the American Taste Buds
review/text: You can't find this flavor anywhere else in America to my knowledge, or at least not easily, and to be sure it won't appeal to everybody, but I am the type of American that prefers salty flavors to sweet. In fact, I don't like most candy because it is too sweet for me.<br /><br />To my surprise, the nutrition information for this product claims zero sodium. Apparently, ammonium chloride is not metabolized as sodium in the human body. So the "salt" label is a bit of a misnomer. Yes, technically ammonia chloride is a salt, but not table salt and not sodium. I guess I will find out in a couple of hours how this stuff agrees with my digestive system. But if I'm allergic to it, that's my bad, not the fault of the product. Prior to K & H's Double Salt Licorice, I tried the Diamond (Zout) salt licorice by Gerrit Verbourg, which was also yummy, so I know already I am not very allergic.<br /><br />I like the taste, but it's not mind-blowing. I don't feel overpowered by the saltiness at all. I can pop three in my mouth at a time and chew with no problem. However, I have learned not to chew. I recommend sucking on the tokens instead until they slowly dissolve. This way a more intense licorice flavor is achieved, and less candy sticks to one's molars.<br /><br />One cautionary note, this coming from my Mother, that I would like to add for all licorice aficionados like myself. Consume licorice in MODERATION. Why? No, not because of tooth decay, although that's a good reason too, this candy being gooey and sticking to teeth. Not because of the calories, although calories is a valid concern. Not even because of the ammonia chloride, although that may have certain negative effects on human digestion in large quantities... Really the chief concern is that the licorice itself, and licorice extract, interferes with the human body's absorption of potassium and also has many other complicated interactions with the body. If you like licorice, a good idea would be to add bananas to your diet as well, because bananas are cheap, delicious and rich in potassium. But do not eat large quantities every day. If you find yourself bruising easily and taking a long time to recover from bruises, your licorice habit could be the cause. Word to the wise. Everything in moderation, dontcha know?<br /><br />Five stars because the product was just what it said it was, was manufactured 02-2012 and doesn't expire until 2014. All in all, an excellent value considering the price, and Amazon had it on my front porch less than two days after I ordered it. Maybe there is better salt licorice for sale somewhere on the Internet, I don't know, but I know for sure there isn't cheaper licorice. Note to other reviewers: no fair dissing the product because you don't like ammonia chloride. Don't buy it if you don't know what it is.

review/summary: Tastes good, but way too overpriced
review/text: Just so that I wouldn't have to spend $$$ on Starbucks Chai Tea, I purchased this concentrate. This is the exact brand they use at the store, which I have no complaint about. However, I would recommend ANYONE who has access to a regular store to purchase this at a Wal-mart or Costco. Wal-Mart sells this exact product for $3.76.

review/summary: Great Tasting Product but Overpriced
review/text: If you are really into chai latte's at Starbucks than this is what you need to get since it is the same chai concentrate mixture the mermaid people use. I do find it a bit overpriced. Starbucks stopped selling it a couple of years back and outside of big wholesale retailers it is pretty hard to find.

review/summary: tastes almost exactly like Starbucks!
review/text: So almost every other day I have been going to Starbucks and getting a vanilla chai latte which have really started to add up. I saw this concentrate at Wegmans and decided to try making it at home. It's so easy - just mix equal parts of concentrate with milk and heat it up. Be careful to watch it because mine has boiled over every single time. It tastes almost EXACTLY the same as Starbucks. I also put in a little bit of vanilla syrup. I love that it comes in this decafe version which is great for nursing mothers. $3.99 for one box and I can probably get at least 10 servings - definitely worth it.

review/text: I love this stuff, but it's priced so high!  I get the same item in the same quantity for 3.50 ea. at my Target.  Also it is a mite too thin.  I only get 3 uses out of it as I have to use more to actually taste it in the milk.  I've seen what Starbucks uses and their supply is much thicker and looks like it's an actual syrup.  But as long as I can get it for the price I do it isn't as bad a deal.

review/text: I drink this tea when I'm home. Cost around $3 at most stores. I'm deployed for the third time in two years and this is one thing I miss from the states. We have a Green Bean here and one other place that I was deployed, but their Chai tea isn't half as good as this. I'm running low and just tried to order more... even though it is twice what I would pay at home. I really want it, but it's no longer available and it makes me sad.

review/summary: Delicious and versatile
review/text: We originally found these Indian meals in a few of our local grocery stores some years ago. Unfortunately they have been growing increasingly hard to find locally. I was very happy to find them here on Amazon, and it's especially nice that they qualify for free shipping.  Our family loves them - they are spicy, but not overly, and we find them rich with flavor and quite filling. They're quick to prepare in the microwave, just 2 minutes, so they're great for an evening when we're short on time to cook (they are best served over rice or quinoa, so that does add to the prep time). They are by no means a diet meal, so we consider them a special treat from time to time. They're shelf stable and keep for months, so we keep a supply of several varieties of these Kohinoor meals in our emergency pantry for weather or other emergency use (they're fully cooked, so they can be eaten cold if necessary, and we think they're quite good that way as well).  We've even taken them on trips when renting a cabin.  I prefer the whole meal packs that include the pre-cooked rice in the package, particularly for use in our emergency pantry, but those can be even harder to find.

These are one of my favorites, namely because most plantain chips are coated with sweet-this product is not sweet. I give this product a 5 star rating, however, I can't understand why they are charging so much for them. The in-store price $1.69 per 6oz. package. If you order them from this website, they would amount to $4.41 per 6oz. package-and that doesn't include the S/H they charge!  Find someone who lives near a Trader Joes to pick some up for you and ship it for waaaay cheaper.

It makes it taste soooo good!<br /><br />Used to be able to purchase this product from a local super market.  Not anymore, so I order it from Amazon with great results.

review/summary: Amazing How This Tea Worked!
review/text: Although the advertising for this product was deceitful - it was advertised at $3.26 for 6 boxes and it turned out that it was $3.26 for only one box (shame on me for thinking I was getting a deal because someone was trying to rid themselves of too much of this tea). I received a refund from Amazon and the seller but there have still been some misrepresentation with the advertising that I have had to remind Amazon about with this. But because I have tried other teas by Triple Leaf (Dieter's Green Tea) that were successful, I thought I would try this one. After just 2 mugs of this tea, my blood pressure was back to normal. It was as high as 164/100 and now it's at 128/80. Although I do not recommend anyone to stop taking any medications without consulting their doctor, I do suggest incorporating this into your diet as an aid to help lower your blood pressure naturally. I have started to blend this tea with my regular sweet tea that I drink with my meals and that makes it easier to get in at least 2 glasses a day. I am now going to start buying it in bulk.

review/text: I was diagnosed as pre-hypertension several years ago. At the beginning I took the pills I was prescribed, but side effects including a super-sensibility to allergy put me in the position to stop the pills and look for an alternative natural way to deal with my high blood pressure. For several years I drank a chinese tea that I found in a local chinese grocery store but could not find it any more. In early january I traveled to San Francisco and found this amazing Triple Leaf Tea, this tea worked even better and most of all, it is available in Amazon any time I am about to run out of it. Thanks so much Triple Leaf and Amazon for helping me deal with my health.
