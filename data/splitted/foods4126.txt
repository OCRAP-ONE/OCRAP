review/summary: Great sweet treat...slightly expensive
review/text: Wonderful sweet treat with a low "calorie" price. I was pleasantly surprised at the nice balance of caramel and chocolate flavors. The chocolate drizzle is just enough to take this from your average caramel popcorn to a more decadent treat, but not too much to overtake the caramel popcorn base. It is a relatively small package but just enough to satisfy a sweet tooth. The only slight drawback is a slightly expensive price for the amount in a package.

review/summary: Wife Pleaser
review/text: I had requested these for my wife who loves popcorn. She was somewhat skeptical at first because of the small bag size of the Snackwell compared to the much larger size of a regular bag of popcorn. She was watching a movie when I handed her the Snackwell. After she tried the contents of one of the bags she declared her assessment of the product to be "excellent". My only concern is that if she becomes addicted to this version of popcorn I would have to sell my pickup truck to pay for this stuff. Maybe sell the dog as well.

review/summary: Surprising
review/text: I did not have high expectations for these. Aside from the Devils Food Cakes, I can take Snack Wells or leave them. But these were surprisingly good.<br /><br />They tasted like your average caramel corn, so no diet food taste. I loved that they weren't doused in chocolate and over-sweet, just drizzled. The small packs were nice for lunches or a small snack. Great combo of salty, sweet, and satisfying.<br /><br />However, the sugar count was a bit high for a small calorie snack, but hey, it's a sweet snack. And one not to feel too guilty over. The price is a little high too when compared to similar snacks like Crunch N Munch or Cracker Jacks, but I really did find the taste better than Cracker Jacks.<br /><br />Worth the try.

review/summary: Great Taste, Less Filling!
review/text: This is a great little snack. It's basically popcorn with a "drizzle" of fudge and caramel, just like the name says. It comes in a small, individual snack pack, so portion control is not a problem--unless you can't eat just one. It's not filling at all--you know how light a kernel of popcorn is--and it all fits in something roughly the size of a deck of cards--or, for the electronically minded among you, something a little thicker than my iPhone. But the taste is really good.<br /><br />I recommend this for a quick, tasty treat. Oh, I also liked that each of the popped kernels was nice and soft--not mushy, but that freshly popped soft popcorn consistency. Good going, Nabisco!

review/summary: Sweet Treat for Popcorn Lovers
review/text: I like popcorn, but I love chocolate and caramel even more. Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn combines all three of these ingredients into one, with a sweetness level that makes this product more like candy than popcorn.<br /><br />When consumers think of caramel corn, the first product that comes to mind is Cracker Jack and this Snackwell product does, indeed, remind me of this classic snack food product. The difference is that Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn goes a step further by adding fudge to the mix. There isn't a ton of fudge- it is only lightly drizzled- but it certainly present and it adds more flavor to an already tasty product.<br /><br />This Snackwell food tastes great, but if I had to register one complaint, it would be the same complaint that many other reviewers have already made: there is an awfully high amount of sugar in each serving. The individual serving packs are nice because they allow easy convenience and only a small amount of the snack, helping consumers avoid over-consumption. But even with such a small serving size of only one ounce, there are still eighteen grams of sugar per pack. If you can eat only one pack, you should be okay, but I will be the first to admit that it is very easy to eat two or three packs at a time. Multiply this by eighteen grams of sugar per serving and you are bound to experience a case of sugar overload.<br /><br />Snackwell makes this product with only a minimal amount of fudge. I would have liked it better with even more fudge, but at the same time, I realize that any additional fudge would likely spike the sugar content even higher. So, as much as the chocolate flavor would be enjoyable, I am happy that Snackwell kept its ambitions under control.<br /><br />Snack foods are a regular part of life for me and I am happy to have tried this Snackwell product. I like the flavor profile very much and while I agree with others who voice concerns over the sugar content, this product isn't much worse than other sweet snacks. As long as one keeps their consumption in check and limits themselves to only a package or two, they should have no problem or guilt as they enjoy the sweet caramel and chocolate taste of this popcorn product.

review/summary: Very Tasty Combination of Popcorn, Chocolate, and Caramel
review/text: This is a great combination of popcorn, caramel, and chocolate. And each pack is only 130 calories. What better way to snack when you are craving something sweet?! I admit that it is hard to stop at one bag though. Each bag is just over 1 ounce.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is a ton of sugar in this popcorn, 18 grams her bag. When I tried them, they were way to sweet for me. But if I were craving a sugary snack, they would be perfect with the whole grain of the popcorn.<br /><br />Realistically, I would rather have a 6-cup bag of popcorn that will fill me up than a 1-ounce bag of sugared popcorn. I would probably eat the entire box and want more where as the plain popcorn has satisfied me and has a lot less sugar and calories.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.

review/summary: EXCELLENT
review/text: Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn, 5.3-Ounce (Pack of 6)<br /><br />Talk about yum and I really mean that, even before I was able to try this out I knew it would be good. First off I am a popcorn fan so that is a plus, add in caramel and chocolate fudge and it equals delicious. The box alone makes them look really good so I couldn't wait to get my hands on them. How right I was about how good these things are, very good indeed.<br /><br />Now when I get these things I usually want to share them a bit so I get various opinions on them. Needless to say I didn't want to do the same here especially after tasting them once. After that first little bag I was hooked but unfortunately every one else caught a peek. After that every one wanted some so I had to share and like me they all loved it. The caramel and chocolate taste is great as one would assume, of course with popcorn underneath all that it was great.

I even had my first pack with coffee (yes, they're hard to stop eating once you start) and the flavors blended very nicely (fudge, caramel followed by the liquid mocha).<br /><br />They're a bit sticky, so you'll want to keep a napkin to hand.<br /><br />Quite an innnovative offering on a snack tray.

review/text: My kids don't get a lot of sweets. So we were all excited to try out this popcorn. It's a little too chewy for my taste. The sweetener was more honey-like, rather than "sugar-y" if that makes a difference to you. It didn't to my children. They all scarfed it down. Except the two year old. She actually spit hers out, as if I had poisoned her.<br /><br />So, it's pretty good, but I have pretty laid back kids when it comes to eating. I won't be purchasing this again, since it wasn't a "slam dunk" with the whole family. Not terrible, but not great.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Suzanne Gose<br />Mother of Five, Teacher, Author<br />Flip Flop Spanish Series<br />The Key to Learning Anything

review/text: If you like popcorn, chocolate and caramel, you're gonna like this stuff!  A lot!  And if you like those little pre-measured packages with 100 calories or 150 calories, or in this case, 130 calories, you'll really like it.  Each 130 calorie package has 1.06 oz of popcorn with caramel and chocolate drizzled on it.  And it's not the kind of drizzling where you taste a whole lot of popcorn and very little chocolate or caramel.  There's a nice balance and you can really taste it.  The little bags are just the right size to tuck in your purse or briefcase for a quick mid-morning or mid-afternoon pick-me-up snack when you're on the go.  They'd also fit well in lunch boxes, backpacks or tote bags.  Yum!!

Reminiscent of Cracker Jacks with a drizzle of chocolate, this is a nice snack that will satisfy your sweet tooth and give you a touch of a chocolate fix at the same time.

review/text: For the most part I generally like Snackwell's products, though it's been quite some time since I tried any.<br /><br />While I liked the taste (nice combination of popcorn, caramel and chocolate)and the serving size to be quite adequate for a quick snack, I don't think I would add these to my regular shopping list. I prefer 100 calorie snacks. I didn't find that the taste justified the extra 30 calories. They also seem rather expensive.<br /><br />I'd rather stick with regular popcorn - much more for your calorie count/money.

review/text: love, love, love it. Very fresh taste of chocolate on every kernal & extremly crunchy. I don't really taste the caramel though but the flavor is still so good I don't even care. You get 5 packages in each box and each package holds 2 large handfuls. If you hold it in your hand for more than a few seconds before putting it in your mouth the chocolate will start melting so put it in your mouth right away as you take it out of the package. I love popcorn and usually eat 3 to 4 popped quarts at a time so it's too expensive for me to buy but it sure was good.......

review/summary: Delightfully good!
review/text: I have always loved Poppycock that wonderful concoction of popcorn drizzled in chocolate or caramel with clumps of peanuts or pecans or cashews.  I can eat a whole bag by myself.  Unfortunately, it's not light in calories or fat so imagine my surprise when I saw the Snackwell Fudge Drizzled Caramel popcorn on Amazon.  A 5.3 ounce bag has only 130 calories.  That is a snack after my own heart.  I tried the chocolate drizzle thinking it wouldn't be anywhere near as good as the Poppycock, but I was wrong.  One box contains 5 individual bags.  The portions are just enough to satisfy your craving for something sweet but not too much that you feel guilty for overeating.  As I seem to have a problem with portion size, it is nice to have individual bags that control the portion for me.  I felt like I had had a wonderful sugary snack without all the guilt. The taste was wonderful.  I enjoyed every bite.  I am so glad I can now have chocolate covered caramel popcorn without the guilt.  The Snackwell also comes in white fudge drizzle which I will also purchase.  This is a great snack if you are watching your weight and even if you aren't. I highly recommend this product to everyone.

review/text: I love the combination of chocolate with caramel corn and the Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Carmel Popcorn provided just the right balance of that combination.  The chocolate didn't overwhelm the flavor of the caramel corn.  The popcorn tasted fresh and the caramel coating has a good flavor.<br /><br />Caramel corn is one of those snacks that never seems to fill me up so I love that this is packaged in individual serving bags.  I can eat one bag and satisfy my craving for a sweet snack without eating an entire box of caramel corn.  At 130 calories and 18 grams of sugar per bag, it isn't a great diet snack but a nice treat once in a while.  In comparison, original Crunch 'n Munch has 160 calories and 11 grams of sugar in a similar serving size.

review/text: This is good stuff...caramel popcorn with some fudge lightly drizzled over it.  I liked it, my wife liked it, and my daughter liked it.  I guess the only negative I can see from a "healthy snack" perspective is that the key to each serving having only 130 calories is that the individual servings are quite small.  So it all comes down to portion control.  So if you have the self discipline (which I recognize I and many people don't), you could save yourself a lot of money by purchasing a larger package of caramel popcorn and splitting it up into small servings.

review/text: Snackwell's fudgy caramel popcorn looks terrible.  That's the only negative!  Those ugly streaks of fudge are a surprisingly good complement to caramel popcorn.  They add a smooth texture which makes it easier to savor a kernel.  Also, the fudge and caramel create an entertaining taste war.<br /><br />Nutrition?  It's a snack, not a medicine!  Fat and Sugar levels are high but too high for a snack.  Probably less sugar than a similar amount of candy.  Probably less fat than a similar amount of chips.  Not healthy, but not an outrage to your body either.<br /><br />The fudge will melt in your hand if you hold the kernel too long but, as you would normally pop a kernel into your mouth from the bag one at a time, that isn't a problem.<br /><br />If you like candy popcorn, you'll probably like these.  Check 'em out!

review/summary: A SINFUL LITTLE INDULGENCE
review/text: My wife and I are fifty-something, and so we watch the waistline! We eat healthy, unprocessed foods - well, most of the time.<br /><br />So Snackwell's Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is not our normal fare. In fact, it's definitely a Sinful Little Indulgence! The top ingredients are brown sugar, popcorn, sugar, corn syrup and so on. So this is not health food. HOWEVER, it is made by Nabisco, so you know it's professionally produced. Each little pack (6 in a box) has only 130 calories, and that's not bad.<br /><br />Recently we went to see a movie, and instead of buying some great tub of overpriced, grease-drenched popcorn, we each smuggled in a pack in a pocket. It was delicious, and in this case, saved us gobs of calories and bad oils!<br /><br />The popcorn is high quality, puffed just right. The caramel taste prevails, with a delightful tang of chocolate. I found my fingers probing the bottom of the bag for any tantalizing tidbits I had missed.<br /><br />This product lives up to its advertising, and that's a good thing. I give 4 out of 5 stars, because they might have tried just a little harder to put a healthier sweetener in the mix. But then it wouldn't be quite so sinful, would it?

review/summary: Very Tasty!!
review/text: The SnackWell's products I have tried in the past were OK, but they were usually a bit bland. This is not the case here. Imagine Cracker Jacks with chocolate drizzle (but no peanuts), and that is about what this product is like. Very tasty!! The envelopes contain enough to be a realistic sized snack, and they are only 130 calories each.

review/text: I love that these bags are individual for snack size.  They taste good, not great.  I only had one wish and that was for a little salty something to cut through some of the sweet.  If you like sweet, you'll love these.  If you do not like things too sweet, move on.  They are very, very sweet.

review/text: I opened these up expecting to find maybe 8-10 pieces of popcorn in a bag, but I was pleasantly surprised to find at least twice as many.  You really do get a delicious, sweet snack for only 130 calories.  however, the popcorn was a little chewy, perhaps the result of being left at my door on a rainy day by the mailman.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: The box contains five snack size packs of candy coated popcorn, like Cracker Jack, drizzled with chocolate.  It's sweet and salty and very satisfying if you have a sweet tooth and need a fix.  Each pack is 130 calories so if you want a treat that won't be too hard on your waistline this is it.  It makes a nice dessert if you like to have a sweet treat while you sit on the couch and watch TV.  It's preportioned so you can't go overboard. Also doesn't contain artificial ingredients.  However it's not a health food, it contains a lot of sugar and therefore has both feet firmly in the "treat" category. My eight year old also found it to be delicious.

review/summary: More than what i thought it was
review/text: When I put one of these very light, airy, tasty, caramel popcorn pieces in my mouth, I could not believe it. This was really good and delicious. I personally thought it would be kind of hard, sticky, and stuck in your tooth popcorn, but it's not. I will admit it's not really really sweet, so if you are looking for something as a snack that is light, delicious, and a little sweet this is what you need. I was also glad that I could eat the whole bag and not feel bad about it, since one bag is 130 calories.<br />P.s.  There was enough to satisfy my snack craving in this one little bag.

review/summary: Not a bad snack option
review/text: I love Kettle Corn, so, although I'm not much of a snack person, decided to give this a try.  It's perfectly fine combination of popcorn, caramel and chocolate.  They did a good job of making sure one taste didn't overpower.  It's a little salty for my taste and does contain 190 mg of sodium.  I was also a bit alarmed that the very first ingredient was "brown sugar," even before the popcorn - and I noticed a faint aftertaste.<br /><br />That being said, it's a nice snack and a nice size if dinner is late and you need a pick-me-up.  A lot of reduced-calorie foods taste like it, and this did not.  I probably won't buy it very often, but it was worth trying.

review/text: These snacks are a big hit with my family.  My kids (7 and 4) both loved them and begged for more.  This snack is similar to Cracker Jacks but with a lot less caramel, and then an added drizzle of chocolate (the maker calls it fudge). Note that they are "drizzled" with chocolate, not dunked.  Pretty yummy, without being sticky-sweet.  I would prefer a hint of salt on them to hit a few other tastebuds as well, but the kids dig 'em as is.  We'll be buying more of these.  Package size is a good serving size for throwing in a lunchbox.

review/text: Tasty caramel corn snack with a touch of chocolate.  Very light as compared to, for instance, Cracker Jack.  Individually packed in nice snack sized foil pouches (mine find their way into school lunch bags).  Seems nice and fresh.<br /><br />My two very minor negatives:  Wish they had a small hand wipe packet attached.  These are a sticky fingers guarantee.  And, I wish they would have provided a starter notch for tearing open the pouch.  Hard to get started and welcomes the "teeth method" from little teeth (bad habit).<br /><br />A good light snack choice.

review/summary: OMG!!! Delish!  Just wish it had better ingredients...
review/text: I am so glad that the Snackwell people didn't try artificially limiting everything to just 100 calories, and didn't jump through too many hoops to make the snack low calorie.  It's a perfectly sized serving of yummy deliciousness.  Just enough you have your sweet tooth satisfied, and that you feel you need to rip open another pack because you're not satieted...  but at the same time, you don't feel horribly guilty for over indulging.<br /><br />That said, my biggest issue was with the artificial ingredients.  I think I would have been possible to do this snack with "healthier" ingredients. Not necessarily organic, but more than just a bunch of chemicals.  I was particularly disappointed because the green packaging made me expect a bit more.

review/text: You get a good idea what you're in for just from the name: fudge drizzle caramel popcorn. And the taste doesn't disappoint; the popcorn is crisp, the caramel is buttery-good, and fudge is chocolately good. And a bag is just 130 calories, which shouldn't ruin anyone's diet.<br /><br />That being said, nothing is free in this world...so 130 calories amounts to a fairly small (but satisfying) serving. Just right for inclusion in a lunchbox for dessert, or for a special "reward" for those of us who need to count calories.

review/text: While this popcorn is truly yummy -- sweet but not overly so, with light caramel and fudge -- it is marketed a bit deceptively. Packaged under the Snackwell name and with today's popular "limited calorie count," many consumers might automatically grab for these, thinking they are healthy. However, in one serving size -- a mere handful of popcorn -- you've got 190 mg of sodium and 18 g of sugar! I did enjoy this snack, but in the future I think I'll stick with something damaging.

review/summary: should satisfy a sweet craving
review/text: I'm definitely not a big salt lover, and caramel can be a bit hit or miss with me.  So I wasn't sure how much I'd like these treats.  Well, I think there's a reason that Snackwell put 'Fudge Drizzle' first on the box!  This popcorn is definitely sweet, I didn't notice too much of a salt taste to the popcorn and the caramel could be more buttery and a little stronger in flavor.  But it's crunchy, it's got a good taste, the fudge isn't overwhelmingly powerful and what's really nice is there's no fake sugar after-taste to the snack at all, which is a concern when they're trying to watch calories.  I'm not exactly inspired to eat more than one bag at a time because of how sweet the popcorn is, but that's not exactly a bad thing.  It's nice to get the chocolate craving satisfied with one pack.

review/summary: Taste vs Fullness
review/text: The Fudge Drizzle Caramel popcorn is really yummy -- the caramel is sweet but not cloying and the popcorn is satisfyingly crunchy.  However, like so many SnackWell products, this is NOT a low calorie snack considering the calories to fullness ratio -- my daughter put away three bags in fifteen minutes as her after school snack after a long hard day at school.  This wouldn't matter a great deal except that the price of this treat -- five small bags in a box -- makes them more of a every-now-and-then treat rather than a house staple.<br /><br />The box is really pretty though.  The green made me feel good about opening the cardboard box.  And that's what it's supposed to do, right?  ;)<br /><br />So I'd finally recommend these if 1)  you're not THAT hungry and 2)  you have a lot of money you are wanting to get out.<br /><br />Taste is really good -- so I can see the argument for these.  Worth four stars but only if criteria 1 and 2 work for you.

review/summary: Enjoyable Twist on Cracker Jack
review/text: This is a good-tasting snack that comes in a portion-control pack. The popcorn base is very light and soft, which was the most enjoyable part of the treat, as many times caramel corn is chewy and indigestible. The corns are lightly coated with a caramel coating that I would say is closer to the taste of the old Fiddle-Faddle or Screaming Yellow Zonkers than Cracker Jack, and then drizzled with chocolate, for a more sweet than salty combo. If you are a caramel corn/chocolate fan but are trying to watch your sweet intake, this may be the answer for you. I don't see myself buying them regularly as we are trying to avoid sweets, but I think they would be a good addition to a "ditty bag" like we keep in our car on road trips, to keep from buying higher-priced, larger-portioned snacks at gas station convenience store, which contains a combination of baked chips and crackers, fruit, and trail mix.<br /><br />The one improvement I could think for this would be to add nuts, but of course then that would add calories and fat.

review/summary: More fudge-y than carame-ly!
review/text: I love popcorn... and I love caramel, therefore I do enjoy caramel corn. I thought the fudge drizzle would make it even better, but that made it too over-the-top sweet for my taste. I think I'd rather just have caramel corn and save the extra calories that the fudge adds. But then, admittedly, I'm not a huge chocolate fan. I'm one of those weird people who can take it or leave it. If you especially love chocolate (like most people I know) you'd probably really like the fudge. I did like that it has limited calories (130) per bag, so you can eat just that much and stop. With as sweet as this is, I didn't have any trouble stopping after one bag, even though it was only a handful of popcorn. Another plus: no high fructose corn syrup, no hydrogenated oils.

The chocolate is okay tasting; not the best. It will certainly satisfy your sweet craving for 130 calories in the individual package. I do like, however, the fact that there is no high fructose corn syrup in this product. Although there is brown sugar and corn syrup. If you really want sweet, by all means, have at these ~ you will most likely really enjoy them!

review/text: I bought a product very similar to this one from the Boy Scouts last year. That was good, but very expensive. This one was also good, but the price is more digestible. Really, you get what you expect from this product. No one who doesn't like popcorn is going to buy this product. People who do like popcorn are going to buy this product and really enjoy it. Is it a healthy snack? No! Did you really expect chocolate- and carmel-covered popcorn to be healthy? I guess you get some fiber in there, but - no - this isn't a health food. It is a guilty pleasure. It's just what you'd expect, and that is a great-tasting snack! Each of my kids is going to school, today, with a pouch of this in their lunches. The serving size is just right for this. The only reason I didn't give this product five stars was that I realize there are healthier snacks out there. But if you are just looking for a light snack that tastes great, this is a good one to choose! I'd love to get another free sample of this stuff!

review/summary: Tasty light popcorn
review/text: The Snackwell Fudge Drizzle popcorn is tasty, and light.  Each popcorn kernel is drizzled with an adequate amount of chocolate and caramel, and the popcorn itself is very light.  A little too light, such that the chocolate and caramel flavors overwhelm the delicate popcorn flavor with their sweetness (therefore requiring the deduction of one star).  Another reason for the loss of one star is the use of corn syrup; the ingredients list looked promising until I came upon corn syrup midway through.  On the plus side, the popcorn is a delicious snack without the guilt-inducing calories.

This may sound strange for popcorn, but either flavor goes well with milk. They are both favorites in our house.<br /><br />Like most low-cal snack packs, the serving size is "small". One isn't quite enough, but two servings would probably be too much.<br /><br />According to the label, each serving (1 package) has 130 calories and 2.5 grams of saturated fat. As of the time I'm writing the review, the box says that it contains milk and soy and was "manufactured on equipment that processes wheat, peanut".

The chocolate was real, melty chocolate, not some artificially flavored stuff you might expect in a low calorie snack, and I was pleased with the amount of chocolate as well.<br /><br />My kids and husband tried this, too - hubby and one daughter liked it so well, they asked if there were more packets.  The other daughter didn't like it, but she doesn't care for popcorn snacks in general.<br /><br />I will say the other pleasant surprise was that the caramel didn't stick heavily all over my teeth, as some other caramel corn products (like Cracker Jack) do - the caramel coating is light and crispy, and not too sweet for me!

review/summary: Cracker Jacks without the Nuts!
review/text: Maybe it is unfair to compare but I had to ask myself if I would purchase Snackwell's caramel popcorn instead of Cracker Jacks. One of my favorite parts of Cracker Jacks besides the popcorn is the searching for the nuts. I love the taste of the caramel corn mixed with peanuts.<br />I really missed the nuts in this small handy snack pack. The caramel taste was very good and very sweet as usual. The popcorn was very fresh tasting. Adding the drizzle of fudge did not bring a taste of chocolate. I felt the chocolate was lost within the sweetness of the caramel.<br />So my conclusion is why would I purchase this when a snack box of cracker jacks is less calories, more protein and about the same amount of carb?

review/summary: Tasty, BUT....
review/text: rather pricey.  Amazon is selling these for $34.98 a carton (you get 6 boxes, each with five little packs in them) That works out to about $5.83 a box.<br /><br />Ok, that said...they are tasty, and the convenient size makes it easy to control how much you eat.  Each little packet has 130 calories.  Not a bad snack if you are watching your weight, as I am.  There is a lot of sugar for such a small little snack size (18 grams), so that is a bit of a drawback for me.  I do like that there is no trans fat in this snack though.<br /><br />When I was young my father used to eat Snack Well cookies, I don't remember what they were called, but boy were they yummy!  As I got older I dont' remember seeing snack wells for awhile, or perhaps I over looked the items on the shelf.  But, it looks like the brand is reinventing itself, with bright new packaging. (The cheery green with yellow is certainly eye catching!)<br /><br />Bottom line-this is a tasty snack.  Something I might buy for myself once in awhile, but at this price point it won't become a mainstay in my pantry any time soon.

review/text: First of all, this is not health food.  It's mostly sugar with only a gram of protein and fiber.  That said, consider it a fairly low-calorie way to satisfy a sweet tooth and a need to eat something crunchy-- during a movie, for instance or as a treat in a child's lunch box.<br /><br />The product tastes a lot like Cracker Jacks covered in chocolate.  It has a nice crunch and a sweet, caramel-and-chocolate flavor.  My family agreed that we prefer the Boy Scout version of caramel popcorn, but this is definitely better than Cracker Jacks.  If the price were more reasonable, I would buy this as an occasional treat.  But in this economy, rent a movie and buy a box of Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn and you can still enjoy a family movie night for a fraction of the cost and calories as going to the theater.

review/text: I usually like something sweet to end a meal.  The problem with that, of course, is the calorie overload.  So then comes along this caramel and chocolate popcorn.  I like the size of the pack if I've eaten something else already because it's not too big and not too small.<br /><br />There's enough snack in the bag to be just right without being over the top in sweetness.  Best when eaten with something else though, rather than on it's own because then, not so filling.  The flavor of the drizzle and the caramels seem to be pretty balanced so one doesn't totally overtake the other and the conistency of the popcorn is just the right amount of crunch without being soggy.<br /><br />I liked it and would recommend it for others who don't want a big calorie laden and heavy meal finisher or treat.  My mom took a packet to work and told me several of her coworkers wanted to know where they could get their own and they're a pretty picky bunch, so it must be good!

I don't pickup any caramel flavoring either. I do taste the fudge but to me it tastes like dark chocolate. Which is perfect if you're into eating healthy but I'd prefer milk chocolate.<br /><br />One package has only 130 calories. Very low if you're trying to eat a little healthier.<br /><br />All in all I thought it was a good quick snack. While the price itself seems a little bit high it has some good flavoring and is a good after lunch/dinner snack.

review/text: SnackWell's loves to tout itself as a "healthy" choice, and I suppose their products are better choices than other options out there.  Having a small bag of their Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is certainly better than a large tub of buttery popcorn at the movie theater.  But as this product is super-high in sugar, I wouldn't necessarily put it in the health food category.<br /><br />However, as far as taste testing-- yummy!  I love the mixture of the caramel corn (which reminds me of Cracker Jack) and the chocolate.  It was a really nice treat. I'm glad the product was separated into individual serving bags, because this helps with portion control.  With one large box, I'd be tempted to have too many servings!<br /><br />If you do buy this product and use it in to-go meals or snacks, make sure that the bag stays in a relatively cool environment.  If left out in the heat, I'm sure the chocolate would melt everywhere and turn into a gooey mess inside the bag.  So it would be fine to put in an insulated lunch bag for work or school, but it might not be the best choice to take with you on a day at the beach.<br /><br />Yum!

Now I discovered a popcorn snack that definitely is for mature taste buds that appreciate the finer things in life.<br /><br />SnackWell's Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn by Nabisco is certainly not as greasy or as salty and has far fewer leftover kernels than my home-popped popcorn. But it has many more benefits than that, like a rich, deep chocolate taste that lingers until the next bite is taken and a subtle but distinct caramel taste. My home-popped snack I eat by the handfuls but SnackWell's popcorn I eat one at a time to fully enjoy this taste treat.<br /><br />This treat was first made in 1992 but it took me nine years to discover it; maybe because they upped the calories from 100 to 130. How can you enjoy a 100-calorie snack? What's with that! And others must have agreed with me because sales for the 100-calorie version sunk from $490 million in 1995 to $32 million in 2010. The 130-calorie version has been introduced on the market with the advertising slogan, "Be Bad, Snack Well." Sounds good to me.<br /><br />SnackWell's Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn comes in a box of five 1.06 ounce individual bags. You might beconcerned about theamounts of sugar, salt and fat, but you can't worry a whole lot about calories when engaged in snacking.<br /><br />Join the chorus, "Be Bad, Snack Well."

review/summary: Chocolate & Popcorn
review/text: There is honestly no question that there are some foods that really need improvement in taste. While carmel corn has been a constant classic, when it does come together with chocolate, it could use a bit of improvement. That is proof of the pudding with Snackwell's new fudge drizzle caramel popcorn. While the concept of the snack is alright, you really don't taste the carmel corn as much as you simply do with the chocolate. It is unfortunate that there was a lack with the taste of the carmel corn, becasue if there was more of a taste of the corn, it would've been a much sweeter snack than what is made out to be. Hopefully, if Snackwell's can keep this one out, they can improve the taste of it.<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Taste: C<br /><br />Overall: C

review/summary: Salty & Sweet But Not Healthier
review/text: These portion controlled treats are like an adult version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P4H57Q">Cracker Jack - 24/1.25 oz. bags</a>, replacing peanuts with a chocolate drizzle. I like a combination of salty and sweet, so they hit the spot for me, but other members of the household felt the salt flavor was too strong. We all agreed that the popcorn tasted fresh and the serving size was not too small. As a snack, I'd give it a 4 or 5 star rating depending on the household member rating it. As a 'healthier' option (which Snack Well's promotes) I think it is no better than other candied popcorns on the market. With 5 % total fat (vs 3%) and 13 % saturated (vs 0) I would not always choose it over our preferred candy popcorn brand, despite it tasting much fresher. That said, I would certainly get it for a change of pace, it's a very tasty treat.<br /><br />Ingredients: Brown Sugar, Popcorn, Sugar, Corn Syrup, Palm and/or Palm Kernel Oil, Skim Milk, Cocoa, Whey Powder, Salt, Soybean Oil, Soy Lecithin, Vanilla Extract.<br />Calories 130<br />Calories From Fat 25

review/summary: Tasty, not entirely unhealthy, VERY sweet
review/text: Not that I would expect something called "Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn" not to be sweet, but seriously, the first ingredient is brown sugar -- that's right, there is more brown sugar than popcorn in this!  The next three ingredients are popcorn, sugar, and corn syrup, so three out of the top four ingredients are sugars.  Also, 2.5 out of the 3 grams of fat in each serving are highly saturated palm oil ("and/or palm kernel oil," which is certainly no better).<br /><br />On the plus side, Nabisco appears to have made an effort to use only "real" foods in this snack:  skim milk, cocoa, salt, soybean oil, soy lecithin, and vanilla extract round out the list of ingredients.<br /><br />Snackwell's snacks are positioned as "a sensible snack" aimed at "weight conscious women" (from their own ad copy).  If you really want the fudge drizzle, and you can really eat just one pack, the Snackwell's Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn will definitely hit your sweet tooth and wouldn't be a horrible choice healthwise.  However, each pack provides just over an ounce of caramel corn, a handful, for 130 calories, 2.5 grams of saturated fat, and 190 mg of sodium (8% of the recommended daily value).<br /><br />Compare this to, say, Cracker Jack -- you can eat the whole box, peanuts and all, for 150 calories, 2.5 grams of fat (none of which is saturated fat), and only 90 mg of sodium.  Or, have a full cup of Orville Redenbacher's microwave caramel corn for 80 calories, 3.5 grams of fat, and a mere 20 mg of sodium, less than 1% of the recommended daily value.<br /><br />In my book, that doesn't make Snackwell's the most sensible snack.

review/summary: A Bit On The Sweet Side
review/text: At first taste I found these cloyingly sweet. But once my taste buds adjusted, I wound up enjoying the contrast between slightly salty popcorn and sweet coating. The chocolate tastes nice, it's a perfect movie treat, and I love the concept these days of limiting the size of one package to the size of one serving--really helps me not overeat. For a convenient, low-cal sweet fix, I say very well. SNACK well.

review/summary: Too much sweet even at only 5.3 ounces
review/text: Couple points to make about this.<br /><br />1) I don't think that any product that contains astronomical levels of sugar should be able to legally be sold under the label "Snack WELLs".<br /><br />2) I'm a huge sweets fan (and actually i'm partial to food in general). I don't eat healthy or in moderation. But I had a hard time finishing this minuscule bag of fudge-covered, caramel-coated popcorn in a single setting. I mean really? Do we need to add something to caramel corn to make it taste good? This is just like other American food trends, like the double bacon, extra cheesy, onion ring whopper. NOT NECESSARY. The equation of (great tasting food 1 + great tasting food 2) = food that tastes better than either food 1 or 2 does not always hold true.<br /><br />I would suggest eating this at your dentist so they can just give you a filling right after you're done eating it.

review/summary: Sweet treat, but not exactly healthy
review/text: Snackwell has done a great job over the years of providing low-calorie options for those who crave something a little sweet at the end of a meal. The new Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn is a delightful snack that certainly satisfies the sweet tooth, but isn't exactly a "healthy" treat, so much as a treat that depends upon portion control.<br /><br />Here is a breakdown of the key nutrition facts:<br /><br />Calories: 130 Calories from Fat: 25<br />Total Fat: 3g (5%)<br />Saturated Fat: 2.5g (13%)<br />Sodium: 190mg (8%)<br />Potassium: 30mg (1%)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 24g (8%)<br />Sugars: 18g<br /><br />Mind you, these numbers are based on a one-pouch serving, which is 30g. The high calorie ratio isn't surprising, when you consider that the first 2 of 3 ingredients are sugar, with the fourth being corn syrup. Here's the complete ingredient list:<br /><br />Brown Sugar, Popcorn, Sugar, Corn Syrup, Palm and/or Kernel Oil, Skim Milk, Cocoa, Whey Powder, Salt, Soybean Oil, Soy Lecithin, Vanilla Extract.<br /><br />Despite this, one cannot deny just how tasty of a snack this is. The popcorn is crisp and fresh, and the combination of caramel and fudge is undeniably a winner. A healthier, and far less expensive, option would be to pop your own popcorn, with no salt or butter, drizzle a tiny bit of melted caramel over the top, and sprinkle a little cocoa powder. But, for those on the go, the Snackwell Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn is a convenient option. Just be certain to grab only one pouch before heading out the door.

review/summary: Tasty but very sweet! Small amount loaded with sugar.
review/text: This Snackwell product is *very* tasty, albeit a small amount (1 ounce) for 130 calories. I have quite a sweet tooth, but I found it too sweet even for my tastes. The reason why is because it is LOADED with Sugar. Here's a list of the first 4 ingredients.<br /><br />First ingredient - Brown Sugar<br />Second ingredient - Popcorn<br />Third ingredient - Sugar<br />Fourth ingredient - Corn Syrup<br /><br />This is not a product that many health-oriented people would choose to put in their system! The product is not about eating healthy or snacking well. The product is all about portion control. If you are looking for a healthy alternative to sweet treats, I think there are better options out there. I am glad I tried it, but I won't be purchasing it again.

review/summary: A No Guilt Snack
review/text: When I first opened this product, I was expecting a lower quality cardboard replica of popcorn.  What I got instead was Cracker-Jacks with fudge - more than a drizzle, but less than a coating.  These are scrumptious.<br /><br />The 1.06 oz 130 calorie pack is just the right size for an afternoon snack without feeling overly indulgent.<br /><br />A sweet aftertaste with no added chemical tang that you occasionally get with other products.  The only drawback that I encountered was that they made me extremely thirsty.  Brown Sugar is the first listed ingredient, so maybe that is where the problem lies.<br /><br />Taste wise, Nabisco did a great job with this product.  Without a doubt, I will be purchasing these on my own.<br /><br />Price wise, once again this product can be found cheaper elsewhere.<br /><br />If you are looking for a limited guilt snack, check them out, but first check pricing and get your money's worth.

review/summary: Too much sugar
review/text: Reviewing a food product is rather difficult simply because we all have differing palates and consider certain things more important than others. So for example, I think the nutritional value is paramount, whereas someone else may only care for taste.<br /><br />I think it's awesome that this is a sweet and small portioned snack. We don't always want to snack on fruit, veggies or nuts, so it's good to be able to switch it up.  With that said, the 18 grams of sugar is really too much for such a small serving. In looking at the ingredients, there are 3 sugars named: brown sugar ( the first listed ingredient), sugar  and then corn syrup.<br /><br />The reason why this is not ideal (for my family and I) is that after you get that sugar high and then crash, you're most likely gonna want to grab another bag or another snack.<br /><br />With regards to the flavor itself, I would have prefered it without the fudge deluge (can't call that a drizzle). The caramel is plenty sweet on its own and has good flavor.<br /><br />All in all, if they come out with a non fudge version with a lighter coating of caramel it would be a win for me. As it is, this is a snack that I would not recommend.

review/text: I LOVE these!  RAVE!  The perfect amount of caramel to chocolate on every single piece of crisp popcorn.<br /><br />I used to spend $5-$6 on a tiny bag of the gourmet popcorn from a little shop to be disappointed that only a few had fudge and it was mostly just caramel. Not anymore! Problem solved, and for a fraction of the cost!  Also, at only 130 calories a bag its the perfect guilt free "dessert".<br /><br />Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn will definitely become a regular in my pantry!

review/summary: Doesn't taste light in calories, but it is.
review/text: Nabisco SnackWell Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn is very tasty.  You'd have no idea that this was a "light" or "diet" snack, but it is indeed low in calories and relatively low in fat.<br /><br />This caramel popcorn is moist and has more fudge drizzled on it than you'd think.  I think they're extremely tasty.  I suppose my only complaint would be that each serving is just a bit over 1 ounce.  So it's a very tasty snack but you don't get a lot of it.  I could eat an entire box in 1 or 2 sittings withough any trouble.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a reasonably healthy and very tasty snack that comes in controlled portion servings, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Good Enough for a last resort
review/text: As far as snacks go, my family tends to enjoy sweet and to the point when we're on the go.  We don't fall in for messy snacks, or snacks that you need to put together for the 'full effect'.  I got these thinking they'd be good for when we're at the park or beach.<br /><br />For purposes of this review I shared the 5 packs between myself, my sister (18), my cousin (13), my dad (50) and my brother (25) so I could get more than one opinion across age groups.<br /><br />First, I want to point out that these are NOT good for warm/hot days.  I kept my package in an insulated lunchbag in my car for the 15 minutes it took us to drive to the park for the picnic, windows down (save the AC!).  It then sat in the bag for about another 10 minutes until we set up the blanket and all.  It was a gooey mess.  The chocolate drizzling we were all looking forward to became a nightmare as we had to tear open the bags so they lay flat and pick out the popcorn nuggets one at time to avoid being covered in chocolate.<br /><br />Taste wise these were better then the average 'low calorie' snack.  In fact until I told my family they were only 130 calories they had no idea.  The packs didn't scrimp on how much either.  The 1.06 ounce package was easily filled 3/4ths of the way, which is always pleasing.  I prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate, but the group consensus was that it tasted good and didn't have a weird after taste some low calorie foods seem to have.<br /><br />Of the five of us my cousin and my brother seemed to enjoy the snack the most, my sister was so-so on it while my dad and I weren't blown away but enjoyed it for what it was.  I think if the treats hadn't melted the way they did we would have enjoyed these a bit more.

review/text: Oh my gosh....I love these.  They just arrived in my mailbox today.  I opened a bag planning to share them with my daughter and was disappointed that I had agreed to share!<br /><br />Each little bag is filled with crunchy caramel popcorn.  The delicious morsels have just the right touch of salt and when mixed with the drizzled chocolate they are sweet as well.  It's kind of like eating fries with a shake, it just works!<br /><br />Each pack is only 130 calories and whatever they did with these little guys to make them low in calories did not include sacrificing taste.  I have made the real deal myself and I think I like this low calorie version better, they are still sweet but not overwhelming.<br /><br />I will be buying more of these, a big thank you to Amazon Vine for the box of Snackwell's to sample and review!

review/summary: What's with the tiny little bag?
review/text: This is really ridiculous.  A little 3x5 bag stuffed with extraordinary popcorn.  At about $1 per bag.  I think a dollar bill might be bigger than these baggies.  I understand that we want teensy bags to fit in the lunch box, and we don't want to overdo our calorie intake, but YES WE DO WANT TO OVERDO IT!!!  Good thing there are more tiny bags in the box.<br /><br />Firm and crispy little popcorns smothered in caramel and prettily drizzled with chocolate... each piece is like a little work of art... really... I could sit and look at them for entertainment.  For just a few seconds.  Before I eat them.<br /><br />I will say that I have experienced tastier caramel popcorn.  Once in a while in life, a person encounters that gourmet caramel popcorn that is just slightly gooey, buttery, salty, sweet... these come close.<br /><br />These are wonderful.  Definitely not diet food... I don't know what they were thinking putting it in a green box and writing calorie info on it.  Very tasty.  You will eat more than one teeny bag.  Unless you have more self-control than I have.  I have eaten three bags.  More than half the box.  I would eat more but my kids already claimed the other two bags.  Poof... all gone.

Yummy caramel-covered popcorn with a light chocolate drizzle in little 130 calorie packs, these are perfect for throwing in my workbag for a mid-day snack I dont have to feel guilty about eating.

This is snack that will satisfy a late night or in-between meal craving for anyone. It also has just the right amount of chocolate drizzle to make it tasty but not too sweet. I hope they come out with more flavors.

review/summary: Tasty Treats!
review/text: I love popcorn so I was looking forward to this tasty treat and it did not disappoint. This fudge drizzled popcorn is chocolatey and sugary -satisfying the need for something sweet. The portion controlled packaging is great at 130 calories. Each package contains just the right amount to satisfy and indulge without feeling remorse after.<br /><br />This is not a healthy treat. It contains a lot of sugar and other non nutritious ingredients. Certainly an apple or orange would be better. But sometimes that sweet tooth just craves something like this.<br /><br />Price wise it is not as cheap as popping up plain popcorn, but at six boxes for around $35 and five pouches to a box, it works out to just a little over a dollar a bag which is pretty reasonable.<br />I do love the individual packaging. Given a full bag of caramel corn it can be easy to over eat, the packaging here tells you when it is time to stop.<br /><br />Overall, these tasty treats are a good bet to satisfy.

review/summary: Good Caramel, Weak Chocolate
review/text: Popcorn can be a healthy snack depending on how it is made and what you add to it.  Adding caramel adds a lot of sugars and calories so I was surprised by how many pieces were in one of these 130 calorie packs. It was a good size amount, a small bowl worth approximately.  The popcorn tasted fresh, it was crispy but soft at the same time.  The caramel was very tangy, not overly sweet at all.<br /><br />As some of my regular readers may know, I've been running a group called The Chocolate Cult for some time.  If this was a review for that group, the number of stars would be lowered to two because this product fails when it comes to the chocolate.  First, I noticed that the chocolate itself was slightly discolored which means it had some temperature problems -- not in my house because we know how to store and use chocolate -- which allowed some of the fat to rise to the top.  Some folks say this doesn't affect flavor but I think it lessens the cocoa intensity.<br /><br />If you want caramel popcorn, this was great.  If you wanted a strong fudge flavor this was poor.  They could lessen the calories and give us more of the caramel corn but just removing the drizzle entirely and it would taste even better.

review/text: Snackwell caramel popcorn adds a new twist to caramel corn.  The chocolate drizzled on them adds a new dimension to the flavor.  They have a sweet, salty and chocolaty taste that is well balanced.  Like all Snackwell snacks, they are not too high in calories (130) or fat (3 grams).  The size is just right for a quick snack but you only get 6 packs per box so you'll want to get several.  Seriously, these don't taste like a "light" snack.  They are really good!

review/text: Do you like caramel popcorn? Do you also like chocolate? If you answered yes to both of those questions, you'll love the Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn.  It comes in small packages which are enough for a little snack but the taste always leaves me wanting more.  My only concern I would prefer bigger packs.  The downside to a bigger pack, however, is that you have to have more self control in order to avoid over indulging.  When you see "only 130 calories per pack" you know it's not going to be very much. Portions aside, the snack is delicious.

review/summary: Satisfy your sweet tooth without sabotaging your diet
review/text: I figured a 130 calorie portion of caramel popcorn would be so small as to be a joke.  While it is true that my husband could easily eat this entire box in a single snack session, I found the contents of one pouch to be a surprisingly satisfying amount.  They are light, sweet, crunchy, salty with a hint of chocolate.  What more could you want in a treat?  They aren't exactly healthy but they are "less bad" than most other sweet snacks.  If you can be happy with carrot sticks for a snack you've got more willpower than the me and I hate you for it ;-)  But for the rest of us these Snackwell treats are a great alternative to a diet killing candy bar.  They are pricey though so I might need a second mortgage on the house to keep these in my pantry.

review/summary: A Great Little Snack
review/text: The Snackwell's Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is sweet, crunchy and tasty.  It is a satisfying snack.  In fact, I think they could've left off the drizzle for fewer calories or put fewer pieces in the bag to get the calorie count below 130.  If they did this, it still would make for a good treat.  At first I saw 130 calories and this small bag and thought it just wouldn't be worth it, but the popcorn is so flavorful and the texture so good that I'm planning on keeping a box on hand as a kitchen staple.<br /><br />This product is a real winner especially for those of us trying to maintain a healthier diet.

If you are on a diet but crave sweet<br />these pre packaged servings can help you control your portion sizes.<br />This does not taste like diet food and it does have a lot of sugar.<br />I would definitely want to try these again depending on the price.

review/summary: New twist on classic snack
review/text: First off I'm not a picky eater and I love carmel corn so the makers would have to do pretty bad for me not to like it. What I liked the most was Nabisco didn't go nuts with the chocolate. It is lightly drizzled so that the prominent taste is still the carmel.<br /><br />Maybe the batch I had was extra fresh but for popcorn this was also the freshest tasting carmel corn I've had from a package. Packaged popcorn can have a little stiffness to it but the package I had tasted and felt like it was popped that day. I think I was as impressed with that as the new flavor.<br /><br />130 calories per pack doesn't hurt either. Great little snack to take in your lunch to satisfy your sweet tooth without hitting a vending machine for a candy bar.

review/summary: Yum!!  Much better than Cracker Jacks!
review/text: For those times when your sweet tooth is calling, this is a fulfilling snack! The chocolate is not only drizzled on the top but the bottom of each huge kernel is covered. The popcorn tastes freshly popped with just the right combination of crunch and softness. Unlike Cracker Jacks, the carmel does not stick to your teeth, nor break them on hard pieces.<br /><br />While not nutrition rich, at 130 calories per package and 25 calories of fat, this is a nice occasional snack.<br /><br />I was sent a box free under the Amazon Vine program; however, think the Snack Well folks made a good investment as I plan to buy more!

The chocolate and caramel are done in just the right amounts to satisfy your cravings without being so heavy as to bog you down. The texture is just right as well.

review/text: I do like the new 100-calorie pack craze; it has been opening up some new horizons for those who can be disciplined enough to eat just one pack. These caramel corn packs come in at 130 calories, which to my mind is close enough.<br /><br />The caramel corn itself is very good, tasting like the caramel corn I enjoyed as a child, but even better with some fudge drizzled across it! I really do like these packs, and think that you will too!<br /><br />(Review of Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn)

review/summary: Does what it says on the tin: Chocolate Caramel Corn
review/text: This is a decadently tasty snack.  In fact, it's so tasty that I almost wouldn't want it for my snack drawer at work, because I'd eat all the packets right away.  It's good fluffy caramel corn, drizzled with just enough chocolate to give a good balance of caramel and chocolate.  The bulk of the flavor is very sweet, with just a hint of salt from the popcorn coming through underneath.  You get a good amount of product in each packet, though I've become so accustomed to 100-calorie packs that I wouldn't be upset to have a little less product per packet to get them down from 130 to 100 calories (and just put a sixth packet in the box).  The price here is a bit insane, especially with shipping (works out to over $1.50/packet), but I'd definitely buy these in the grocery store for 50 to 75�/packet.  This would be a great product for bulk packaging for home snacks, too, though I'd personally be tempted to eat way too much at once in that format.

review/text: I love this snack!  SnackWell's Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn sounded good 'cause it has my favorite treats combined so I was hopeful when I opened the package.  (The individual bags are a great idea, btw.) It reminds me of Poppycock, a favorite snack--crispy and crunchy and caramelly.  It's drizzled with fudge, but though it looks like it's covered with a lot of chocolate, there's not a real lot of chocolate taste, but it doesn't need it.  I'll definitely be enjoying this snack again.

It's a perfect coating of caramel deliciousness, with a dark chocolate drizzle on top.  It is light and satisfying.  Not too heavy and overly sweet like some caramel corn.  It's perfect for putting in the work lunchbox.  Mine showed up in the Amazon box on my front step warm from sitting in the sun, and the combination of warm dark chocolate and caramel on the popcorn was amazing.

review/summary: Nice Snack, Low on Calories
review/text: When you think low fat or low calorie - you automatically think it's not going to taste good.  Not the case with this product.  The Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn by SnackWell's is actually really good.  The popcorn taste just like the Cracker Jack's brand (minus the peanuts), sweet and full of flavor, plus the added fudge drizzle is a nice addition.  I actually forget this snack has only 130 calories per serving because it is very filling and tastes great!  The only problem I am going to have with this product is keeping it away from my husband.. he's a big fan of flavored popcorn and he can't tell a difference in the taste of this product verses other higher fat choices.

review/text: These just arrived today and I'm having a hard time keeping myself from eating the whole box! This popcorn is delicious. The caramel taste is not quite as strong as that of, say, Crunch 'n' Munch, but it's good anyway, and so is the chocolate. Also, a pouch of them feels more substantial than the 130 calories that are in it.<br /><br />It's pretty sugary so it's not actually a "health food," if that's what you're looking for. But it's YUMMY. The pouches make it easy to portion out a small indulgence. If you're after portion control, though, I recommend taking one pouch and hiding the rest. Maybe in a bank vault. Because I promise you will want another one.

review/text: I am enjoying this popcorn snack. The caramel popcorn is appropriately crunchy, and there is the right amount of fudge drizzled on. The individual packaging with its corner tear-starter is friendly. And I think the amount in this 130-calorie portion is just right -- a good item to throw in with your lunch, which I did today. I wasn't as concerned about the health aspect of this snack (just a dyed-in-the-wool chocoholic -- sorry), but it is nice to read the ingredient list and not find a bunch of chemicals.

review/text: These are nicely packaged in single serving sizes.  However, it takes a lot of will power to just eat one!  I noticed another review saying they could not taste the caramel.  I could although it was subtle.  If there was any suggestion I'd make on this, I'd say lighten up on the chocolate just a bit (and I LOVE my chocolate).  I just think it would be even tastier if the chocolate (fudge) were reduced just a bit.  Overall?  ENJOY!

There's 'more' to reach for, but not too much.<br /><br />I used these as a midafternoon pickmeup snack and I found myself looking forward to snacktime the way I normally only did when cookies or brownies...but with less guilt.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again!

review/text: I love popcorn. I love carmel popcorn. I love chocolate.  Fudge drizzed carmel popcorn felt like a dream come true.  I truly enjoyed this product, it quite delicious.  It tastes more like eating candy than popcorn, though.  It had the crunch of popcorn, but seemed rather sweet and sugery. I almost would prefer a little more popcorn and a less sweet carmel so that I can get the real feel of eating popcorn.  To sum it up, it's good, but really on the sugery-sweet side.  More like a dessert rather than a snack.

review/summary: A tasty snack definitely worth the calories
review/text: I've always been a fan of popcorn as a healthy (relatively) snack that at least offers a modicum of fiber, not too heavy calories and that is more or less good for your body if you can handle the sodium. Unfortunately, reduced portion packs of popcorn rarely satisfy, while reduced calorie popcorn tastes like cardboard, and whole bags of popcorn have just too many calories for a diet conscious body to consume. Then there's the 100-calorie "snack packs' of various other things like crackers, cookies and chocolate that just as you start to get sated, the pack goes empty and you struggle with whether you should open another pack or just suffer through your hunger pangs. SnackWell's, on the other hand, offers this rich caramel coating with luscious fudge accent over crispy popcorn that comes in individual 130-calorie servings. The rich flavor, satisfying crunch with varied textures of stickiness, crispiness and chewiness makes it feel as though you are eating something substantial, while the extra 30 calories over the usual 100 leaves one feeling satisfied and not craving another pack. The mix of saltiness with caramel and sweet chocolate is just right. The 130 calorie packs are convenient and not diet breakers. And that's it. SnackWell's tastes great, helps in controlling calorie intake, and dispenses with hunger. It is highly likely this snack will become a regular in my diet.

review/text: If you love popcorn and want a low calorie snack, this could be a good option for you. The single serve bags have 130 calories each. The taste is good and the serving size is ok compared to similar snacks. Personally I'd prefer a salty/sweet combination of flavors with this type of snack instead of just heavily sweet. And while the serving size is good for this type of snack, popcorn just seems like something you should eat by the bowlful (although not if it is covered with caramel and chocolate, I guess.) This was not a five star snack for me, but it could well be for someone else whose tastes are different. The quality of the food is very good.

review/summary: Good calorie count, but perhaps too sweet
review/text: I tore into these the moment they arrived.  I like that these are 130 calorie count packs, as I am on a pretty strict exercise regimen, but allow myself some snacks as long as the calorie count is low (FYI- I measure everything on the food scale if it isn't already premeasured).  The mix of chocolate flavor and caramel is fine, and certainly more crunchy than Cracker Jack, but halfway through the pack, my tongue started to burn from how sweet these are!  Now I don't eat a lot of sweets normally, but when I do I do not normally get this sensation.  Perhaps it's just me... but even my wife said these are extremely sweet, and she eats sweets more often than I.  Reading the calorie info, it's clearly the combo of fairly high sodium (190 mg) and the 18 grams of sugar in each pack!  In any case they're worth a shot if you're looking for a sweet treat that you can pop into your lunchbox.  Be wary however if you are sensitive to sugar... these are definitely not for you.

review/text: I saw my wife eating one of the bags of Snack Well's and asked her, "What do you think?"  She said, "Very good, I like."  I agree.  They are very good indeed.  They have a nice crisp caramel flavored pop corn crunch with lines of chocolate, which the manufacturer calls fudge, somehow "drizzled" across them.  Good enough that it's good they are in small packets are one might be tempted to eat the whole box full in one sitting.  I can comfortably recommend these Snack Well's.  I kinda wonder why the manufacturer put an apostrophe before the s, but perhaps there's an explanation somewhere in the ether.  Enjoy.  They're good.

The packs are only 130 calories and have just enough in them to satisfy your cravings for something sweet and salty. One pack won't fill you up, but then again it's not really meant to....it's a snack. I think these would be great if you are on a diet and have that NEED. I'm sure there are many who can identify :) It's a controlled indulgence, and well worth every single penny. Instant gratification in a handy snack bag!

The snack packs are only 130 calories each and 24g of carbs (which makes it within the snack guidelines for diabetics of 15 to 30 carbs).  Sometimes popcorn has a lot of hulls, but they used sufficiently good quality popcorn here to avoid that.<br />These are very yummy, but at only 1.06 oz. each, there isn't much in each package.  I could have easily eaten 2 or 3 packages, but that would have upped my calories and carbs, so I stopped at one.  If you are really hungry one pack is not going to curb your hunger.  Anyone who likes sweetened popcorn will love these.  This is a winner.

review/summary: Convenient for sneaking into the movies
review/text: These little treats are quite tasty.  They are like a sweeter version of Crackerjack with the added smoothness of the fudge coating.  Definitely a nice package and at 130 calories not too sinful to pack in a lunchbox or sneak into the movies as an alternative to the dreadful tasting and overpriced stuff you get there.
