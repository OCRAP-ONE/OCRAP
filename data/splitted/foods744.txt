review/summary: Yummy yummy.
review/text: Our dog, Cartman, really loves this stuff. He used to be on Canidae (all life stages). He had tummy issues and regularly had bad diarrhea. It broke our hearts; he looked miserable on his old food. He didn't even like to eat it. We'd have to coax him to eat some, and there was always a significant amount left in the bowl.<br /><br />From the moment we opened the package, he seemed really into it. He eats all of his food, and even likes the occasional nugget or two as a treat. He leaves his bowl empty, and yes--wonderful solid poops (after so much diarrhea, they certainly were pretty wonderful).<br /><br />It is pricey, though. The Canidae was significantly less. When he gets out of the puppy stage, we'll probably move him to Costco's Kirkland brand dog food--which is even higher-rated at Dog Food Advisor.

review/summary: Great Food For German Shepherd Puppies
review/text: This was recommended by the breeder we got our puppy from. It is excellent. Our puppy likes it and has had virtually no digestion problems. Even though nobody likes to do it, it's not that bad cleaning up after the puppy because everything is nice and firm. If you've got a dog you know what I mean!

review/summary: Crisp and Tasty
review/text: "Ryvita Sesame Rye" crackers are wholesome and very satisfying to eat.  I like whole-grain crackers, esp. European crisp-breads.  These crackers are made from three simple ingredients: whole grain rye flour, sesame seeds and salt.  One reason I got them is that I avoid eating yeast, but I think that the "Sesame Rye" crackers would fit into just about any special diet.<br /><br />When I bit into the cracker, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture. At first I was afraid that they'd taste dry and hard. But it is light and airy, with a gentle kind of crispiness that sort of melts in your mouth. Also the sesame seeds are a nice touch. I don't know how they got it so light and crispy like that without using yeast!<br /><br />The flavor is also quite pleasing.  Rye is a good grain to add to your diet for health and variety.  Unfortunately,  I do not like the taste of most rye products, esp. bread because of the caraway seeds in them.  Ryvita rye crackers combine three ingredients into a cracker that is tasty and healthy.  There's great to snack on alone or with any spread or topper you want.<br /><br />I purchased a box of them for $2.49 from my local health food store, so I was happy to see them here for such a good price, and I ordered a case of them.  I hope that you like them, too.

review/summary: BEST, LITTLE-KNOWN CRACKER ON THE MARKET
review/text: TO MY KNOWLEDGE THIS CRACKER IS ONE OF THE ONLY TWO CRACKERS AVAILABLE  WHICH HAS ONLY RYE FLOUR, SALT, & WATER IN IT. RYE IS A VERY HEALTHFUL GRAIN & HAVING NO FAT IN THIS CRACKER MEANS NO TRANS FATS & POSSIBLE TO PUT ON ONE'S OWN CHOICE OF FAT OR NONE.  EVERY OTHER CRACKER I'VE SEEN HAS ALL SORTS OF ADDITIVES--THIS IS THE ONLY ONE I KNOW OF WHICH DOESN'T. PLUS IT TASTES GOOD ALL BY ITSELF. AND RYE HAS LESS GLUTEN & MORE FIBER THAN WHEAT.  THIS IS A STEALTH HEALTH FOOD PEOPLE SHOULD TRY--IT GOES WITH ANYTHING, SWEET OR SAVORY & ONE VARIETY (MY FAVORITE) HAS SESAME SEEDS SPRINKLED ON TOP.<br />READ THE LABELS (NOT THE BALLYHOO ADVERTISING ON PACKAGES) & YOU'LL SEE HOW MANY ADDITIVES ARE PUT IN MOST CRACKERS, ESPECIALLY TRANSFATS & 'DOUGH CONDITIONERS'. THIS CRACKER HAS NONE! I CAN'T RECOMMEND IT TOO HIGHLY!

review/summary: the sesame seeds help a lot
review/text: We use RyVita regularly for a crunchy base for things like mashed sardines.........most everyone knows they have no taste on their own, but that's OK.  The sesame seeds do help, especially if you really love sesame like we do.<br /><br />They have just enough of a hint of salt to make them work for the following snack item:  Try "cutting" one in half and making a peanut butter sandwich (no jelly) -- the taste is a lot like peanut butter filled pretzel nuggets, without the wheat flour and without nasty preservatives in the filling part.

review/text: I have been eating Ryvita Sesame Whole Grain Rye Crispbread for years as a mid-day light lunch or anytime snack. Great with peanut butter or egg salad on it. The nutty taste and light salt compliment most any topping. Lately I have been breaking them and dipping them in mango salsa, using like a dip chip.<br />When the health food department of my local supermarket discontinued carrying them, I quickly looked for an alternative supply, and here it is. By using auto-ship I am paying about half the cost of the supermarket. Thank you Ryvita for a great product. Thank you Amazon for great pricing and convenience.

review/summary: Crackers vs cracker crumbs
review/text: I like these crispbreads. And it's convenient having them shipped to my door at a price that's less than my local supermarket. But sometimes the shipper bounces them around. And the Amazon shipping department puts the air cushioning in the shipping carton in such a way that the product doesn't move around in the box -- maybe two or three edges. So, if the carton gets bounced on those edges, the crackers stay intact. But if the shipper bounces the box on the other edges, the crackers crumble. Cushioning on all six edges would work better.

review/summary: Most versatile crispbread i've tried
review/text: These have a very small amount of fat - 1% per cracker which must be due to the sesame seeds.<br />It's worth the trade-off because they are actually quite tasty.  The subtle sesame flavor enhances anything you put<br />on them. While low in salt, they taste pretty good right out of the box.<br /><br />Ryvita must be performing some kind of sorcery since they contain no yeast but have an airy crunch, which makes<br />them safer for sensitive teeth.<br /><br />I just ordered a 10 pack in mid July and the expiration date for the batch is December 05.<br /><br />They are very good and I've added them to my subscribe and save list.

review/text: While the price for the Ryvita was cheaper than anywhere I could buy it in a store locally, I'd caution other buyers from getting more than one case at a time.  My order arrived recently with no problems, but the "sell by" date is August.  It seems these were sitting around somewhere and the reason they are less expensive is the shelf life is short.

review/summary: Don't waste your money
review/text: My husband bought this at a local store for us and after attempting to put this piece of crap together, with my son, I definitely have some things to say about it.<br /><br />First off, don't buy this for $16.95. my husband got it at a local store for $8. Shame, Amazon - what's up with that?<br /><br />Secondly - junkiest, grossest crappiest candy and icing EVER. The icing was hard, so you're supposed to knead it. So I did. For several minutes, in fact. But it never really got soft enough to squeeze through the hole in the bag like it is supposed to. Once I was finally able to squeeze it out, the hole I had to cut made it too big to make any kind of lines anywhere, or do anything but make a big mess. And then? The icing stuck to everything BUT the candy and gingerbread.<br /><br />And this is supposed to be edible? My son tasted the candy - you know, the part the kids are most excited about - and he immediately ran to the trash can and spit it out. I tasted it to see why, and yeah, so did I. This candy tastes like melamine mixed with plastic and chalk. That is supposed to be candy? Are you kidding me? What chemicals did they throw together in the back basement to make this stuff? DISGUSTING. Do not ingest!<br /><br />I thought half the fun of making a gingerbread house is getting to eat it - that was m childhood memory. Otherwise what is the point? I could have built one out of cardboard and glue - and frankly, I think that would have tasted better than this stuff. And it definitely would have been better made and easier to build.<br /><br />In short, please for the love of all that is good and wonderful about childhood, do NOT buy this crapola for your kids. We're going back to the store, which has happily offered a refund, and buying some graham crackers and our own candy and make a decent, edible "gingerbread" house, the way it's meant to be. I suggest you do the same, or at the very least, find one with real food in it. Incredible disappointment.

When I purchased the six-pack, the price at Amazon was as good or better as the best sale prices we can find in a local store; add the free shipping, and it was an unbeatable deal, the sort that I've come to love from Amazon. Unfortunately, shortly after ordering, I received an email from Amazon saying that it would no longer be available as a subscription item.

review/summary: Keeps dishwasher nice and clean
review/text: I add 1 tablespoon to each dishwasher load. The citric acid keeps the mineral deposits in check and the glasses sparkling. Our city water is extremely hard, and the spinners in the dishwasher would get clogged with deposits. Not any longer! I also use it as a neutralizer when shampooing the rugs, but you have to rinse with water afterwards, or it stays a little sticky.<br />I try to use simple solutions to keep the home clean. This is a safe way to clean.

review/text: I purchased this product for use in a homemade dishwashing detergent recipe, and it has served its purpose. It tends to clump together over time, but that is probably because it is stored under the kitchen sink (high moisture area). Be forewarned that the shipping can be incredibly slow - my citric acid arrived on the evening of the last day in the estimated arrival date range.

review/summary: Replace your toilet and tub cleaner
review/text: A 6-10% solution in H20 will clean your toilet and tub/shower just as well as commercial products and for pennies on the dollar. Citric Acid is actually the main ingredient in many tub and shower cleaners. It chelates mineral stains well, and is actually easiest to use sparingly from a spay bottle right after you shower. I just spray a little around, and after I dry off I rinse it with the shower head. It takes about 30 seconds total every other shower, but you never, never need to clean your tub or shower again if you do this. Be careful not to inhale it as it is still mildly irritating. Commercial products add some surfactants to help reduce mist and help it stick to surfaces, but with every-other-day-use I find that the h20 solution keeps the tub and shower perfectly clean and the chrome shiny without any real work. Kills Germs too!<br /><br />Can also be used as a mild facial peel/scrub.

review/summary: more uses than you thought!
review/text: Our water comes from a well and is super high in mineral content.  So the minerals build up on everything it touches.  So, the minerals "ate" our hot tub, our hot water heater, and a couple dishwashers!  AUGH!  I stumbled upon the idea of using citric acid in the dishwasher to clear out the debris and eureka!  It works!  It just makes everything that was dull...sparkle!  So now I clean the shower stall and bathtub, sinks, anything that has been affected...with a little citric acid added to my cleaner.  Good trick.  What I'm not sure of is..will the citric acid corrode things eventually?<br />At our local drugstore you can buy 5 ounces of citric acid for $18!  The NOW Foods 5 pound tub is close to that same price and came very quickly.  I'm about to order more.

review/summary: sparkling clean dishwasher
review/text: This product works wonders in my dishwasher. I live in the midwest and we have hard water. My dishwasher began having a white film on my glasses and dishes. The dishes weren't looking clean anymore and the inside of the dishwasher had the film all over. I tried running a cycle with vinegar and that helped some, but I was worried that my dishwasher was going to have major problems. I read about using citric acid cyrstals to remove the film. With no luck at finding citric acid around my area, I ordered it from Amazon. I got it quickly and used it immediately. It took 3 cycles to really remove the film and make my dishwasher look like new. Using the citric acid every couple of weeks keeps my dishwasher sparkling clean.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I have very hard water and everytime I run the dishwasher I would get a white film on my glasses, and my silverware would tarnish. Along time ago I used to buy citric acid in the drug store but have not been able to buy it there in years.  So, I googled it and found this product on line.  There are two containers to put dishwasher powder in, one for the first wash and one for the second.  I put dishwasher powder in the first and about a tablespoon of Citric acid in the second container and run the dishwasher.  My glasses are now coming out spotless, my silverware is starting to shine, and the wood handles on my cutlery are losing that white film that they had acquired. Little by little the dried on mineral stains are disappearing from all my dishes. Now, I don't have to be embarassed when company comes over and I serve them a beverage. Before I found the Citric acid I tried different brands of rinse aids and they did not work. Try it!  It works great!

We fill the soap dispenser with it, then when the dishwasher's in the middle of its cycle, we open the door and add a little more. Does a great job cleaning the dishwasher and getting rid of any built up residue, etc. Dishwasher looks like new afterwards.<br /><br />Works as well as the Dishwasher Magic product (its active ingredient is citric acid -- 3 ounces of it in each 12 ounce bottle) and ends up being less than one-third the cost.

review/summary: great in the dishwasher
review/text: Our black nylon "dishwasher safe" mixing spoons started getting this mysterious white gunk all over them in the dishwasher.  I scrubbed off as much as possible, and then started adding 1 teaspoon of this food grade citric acid to the dishwasher load.  No more white gunk.  Now the black spoons can go back in, and don't have to be hand washed.  Also the glassware sparkles.<br /><br />I put 1 tsp in every load.  There is an extra little well in the same place where the dish soap goes and that is where I put it, right beside the dish soap.<br /><br />Somewhere on Amazon, I think I read a review saying that dishwasher soap doesn't contain phosphorous anymore (for safety and/or environmental reasons), and that change is affecting what the soap leaves on the dishes.  Whether or not my recollection is exactly right, the citric acid is correcting the issue for me.  I've recommended it to friends and now they recommend it to their friends.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />ASK

review/text: I have learned a few wonderful things reading others' comments.  I make a lot of my own cleaners and use citric acid as part of the ingredients.  My dishwasher detergent works better than brand name detergents and it costs a lot less.  I now add a teaspoon of citric acid to my load of laundry and it works beautifully as it "softens" the water.  To the one negative review I read - you are in an apartment and there is no telling what kind of scum was in that dishwasher in the first place. The citric acid is probably cleaning out the residue which washed back on your dishes.  You should run the dishwasher a few cycles with citric acid only before you wash anymore dishes in it and put vinegar in the "rinse" compartment as well.

review/summary: Great for Descaling Coffe Machines, Hot Water Kettles, etc.
review/text: Commercial descaling products work great... but they're quite expensive. Citric acid does the same thing for a fraction of the cost. Consider that the leading descaling solutions cost between $0.35 and $1.50 per ounce and this product costs about $0.04 per ounce. Directions for an electric coffee maker: After every 25-30 pots of coffee mix 2 ounce (56 grams) of Citric Acid in 32-34 ounces (1 quart - 1 liter) of cold water. Stir until completely dissolved, pour it into the water reservoir, start the brewing cycle, and let it run about half-way through then stop the brewing process. Let it stand for 10-15 minutes then resume the brewing process. Finish by running two cycles of fresh water through the machine. --- Directions for an electric hot water kettle: Heat one quart of water to the boil and pour into a heat-proof pitcher containing 2-3 ounces (56-85 grams) of citric acid. Carefully stir until dissolved then pour the hot solution back into the electric kettle (unplugged). Let stand for 15-20 minutes then discard solution and rinse with cold water.

The lady who wrote the review is 100% correct!  We travel full time in a 45' motor home (bus type) and encounter all types of hard water.  Cleaning the two-sided glass shower and the tile was a hassle.  This product makes short work of it and then just spray it down after each use to maintain.  We use 1/4 cup of product to 20 oz. of water to clean and maintain glass (stronger if you need initially) and 1/4 cup of product to 30 0Z of water to clean the coffee maker.

review/summary: Best price, a lot of uses, quality product
review/text: My local grocery store does not sell this stuff, so I had to get it online, this product is a good price for the value if you use this a lot (for example in your dishwasher).  We also use a little bit of it when marinating salmon to give it an extra tang, it's like a secret ingredient!  The plastic jar is durable and easy to close (screw top lid).<br /><br />Also, as others have mentioned on here, if you have hardwater and use this in your dishwasher you won't get those water spots.  That's my primary use for this stuff but it has other uses as well in food flavoring.

review/summary: Great Preserver of Vegetables:
review/text: I found this product on the Amazon web page. But also found it locally in a health food store. So I tried it and found to my delight it is a must in my house. I garden and shop the farmers market, after rinsing all heavy dirt from the garden off my produce. I soak them in a solution of this product as recommended and found my vegetables stay fresh in the refigerator much longer. I have had carrots 6 weeks looking as good as the first day I pulled them from the garden. I'm sure I need this product and will continue using it. I found it cheaper on Amazon and in a larger container for my needs. I'll let you know about the delivery later.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Joseph

review/summary: Is this just vinegar?
review/text: I bought this to help get rid of mineral deposits in my dishwasher, luckily, not to eat,<br />but it smells like nothing so much as vinegar, which is mostly acetic acid, not citric.<br />Vinegar helps with the deposit problem, too, but, relative to cit*rus*, it stinks.  I don't<br />know whether it is of benefit to plants, and it surely seems concentrated so maybe<br />it's in a handy form, and I know vinegar contains some citric acid, but people should<br />know that's what they're getting.  I really don't know how to rate this, because it doesn't<br />do much for my purposes (I was already trying vinegar in the dishwasher), but I don't<br />know what it's really supposed to smell like, and I don't know how *not* to do a star<br />rating.

I ended up hand washing EVERYTHING that came out of the dishwasher and now Im stuck with a 5 pound jar of this junk. I feel weird being the ONLY poor review, but Im at a loss of what to do.

review/summary: King of Chamomiles
review/text: I drink a lot of tea these days and chamomile has long been my favorite tea.  I've tried at least a dozen chamomile brands and have settled on Yogi's comforting chamomile as my favorite pure chamomile tea bag.  There is a very rich flavor from these tea bags that is missing from most competitors.  You can definitely enjoy this one without any honey...or with a heaping spoonful.  My wife prefers the blend by Mighty Leaf which uses a lot of citrus, while I enjoy Community Coffee's blend with more herbs and spices.  Revolution teas makes a good, and very simple blend with peppermint and marigold.  However, for simple comfort, relaxation and flavor, Yogi wins out.

review/summary: One of our favorites
review/text: We are popcorn addicts!  We eat some almost every night.  The local grocery stores usually only have the Nacho Cheddar, Butter, and White Cheddar flavors.  I first ordered this as part of a variety pack direct from the company, and it quickly became one of our favorites!  It's a pretty strong flavor, and definitely sweet, with a touch of spice to it.  It's going to be one of those flavors you either love or hate.  If you haven't tried it before, try just a single to make sure you like it first.<br /><br />The 6 pack boxes here at Amazon are the best deal for these.<br /><br />Our other favorite flavors are the Ranch and the Nacho Cheddar.  The White Cheddar is also good if you want something a bit more subtle, as it doesn't have nearly as strong of a flavor as any of the others.<br /><br />The ones we don't care for are the Sour Cream (not much taste at all).  The Parmesan Garlic, while good for some things, doesn't seem to work so well on the popcorn.  Caramel, Chocolate Marshmallow and Kettle Corn may be OK for the kids who want something really sweet, but a bit too much for us.

review/text: I initially ordered this hoping I had found the wonderful seasoning a BBQ restaurant had used on french fries and corn on the cob. I was really disappointed the way it tasted on french fries. I just couldn't imagine eating BBQ popcorn, but what else was I to do with a whole case of the seasoning? Well I'm glad I tried it on popcorn because it is so GOOD. Yes it is sweet BBQ but that's what I like. I do wish it had a little more BBQ kick to it. But I'm ordering my 2nd case because I love it and no place in town carries this flavor.

review/text: I absolutely love Kernel Season's barbecue flavor.  It is a sweet barbecue flavor, which I love.  If you don't like sweet barbecue, you will not like this.  Personally,  I think it's great.  I didn't think it was spicy at first, but after I ate a lot of the popcorn with it, I felt a little heat (not a ton, but some).<br /><br />I have tried Kernel Season's barbecue, ranch, sour cream and onion, jalepeno, chocolate marshmallow, and caramel.  The caramel and barbecue are my favorites.  Guess it shows how I like the sweetness!<br /><br />I'm thrilled to see that Amazon now has the barbecue available with free shipping.  I can not find this flavor at stores in my area, so I have to order it online.  Amazon has better prices than the company's website.  I initially ordered from their site so that I could try a variety of flavors before purchasing 6 of one kind.  Now that I know my favorites, I am jumping on the great price with free shipping from Amazon immediately!!!  (I already ordered a 6 pack of caramel last week)

review/summary: BBQ Popcorn Seasoning
review/text: When I tried the seasoning right out of the container, it was good. It had a nice BBQ flavor, not too sweet, not too spicy, just right. I sprinkled it on pizza and it was pretty good. But, when I put it on top of popcorn, it was not too good. My husband asked me if I had put sugar on the popcorn. I could barely taste the BBQ and all I tasted was the sweet. The first ingredient on the label is sugar. I would have preferred a more spicy or salty taste. Now I have an entire case of the stuff I will need to give away and/or use on other stuff. Don't buy it unless you like sugary sweet popcorn.<br /><br />Update on 5/23/10: I have found many other uses for this seasoning and have grown to like it a lot. I use it in soups, on baked potatoes, on chips with salsa, in pasta salads, dressings, etc. I basically use this in any kind of food that needs a sweeter or smokier flavor without altering the taste. It works like a charm. I have also found that using it on popcorn works if I add some sea salt and pop the corn in coconut oil. makes for some great popcorn. I am ordering my second case right now! GIve it a try.

review/summary: OK flavor, Does not 'stick' very well
review/text: This seasoning has a typical (good) BBQ flavor. It is not ground fine enough to stick well to the popcorn, so half or more of what is applied ends up at the bottom of the bowl, and gets thrown out. I discovered if I apply it in layers to hot/steaming popcorn and place a towel over the bowl, letting it steam for about 2 min, it sticks better, but there's still quite a bit of waste.

review/text: This tastes like the seasonings on BBQ potato chips, so I like this one. It might just be my batch, but it doesn't seem to flow out of the shaker as smoothly as the other flavors though. And like all of these seasonings not all of the seasoning will stick to the popcorn and will wind up at the bottom of the bag or bowl, I don't think there is a way to get all the seasoning to stick unless you drench every single kernel of popcorn in butter spray. This stuff is cheap enough I don't mind, and keeps me out of the high fat and high calorie snacks.

review/summary: Excellent flavor but a little tricky
review/text: Has a excellent sweet barbeque taste.  But it is mostly sugar with very little salt.  Sodium content is 5 mg vs 60-70 mg for most flavors.  So if your taste buds are calibrated for saltiness, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />I find it works well with about twice the amount of the other flavors.  The coarser grind needs a little more oil to stick to popcorn.  Not a problem on other, moister, foods.

review/text: I don't see what all the good reviews are for unless the ones selling it are writing it. The stuff doesn't stick to the popcorn very well , even with butter added. You can empty half the contents of the Bar-b-que seasoning before the popcorn even barely has enough flavor. When your done with the popcorn you will see about 3/4 of what you poured on at the bottom of the popcorn container. They need to make this stuff more powdery instead of salt like to make this successful.

I haven't been able to find the big bag on Amazon since the first time when I purchased it. If I did see it, the price was different, and no supersaver shipping, so that was why I switched to the small individual packets. Ginger chews are delicious candies to say the least, and therapeutic, too.

Not the price, problems with your shipment, etc. Yes this is way overpriced if you live anywhere near an asian market or well stocked supermarket (Market Basket rules!) But the product itself is top quality, and let's keep in mind, not everyone lives within convenient shopping distance to an asian market. $8+ for 22 oz is almost double what I pay locally, but for many the $4 difference is made up for in convenience and gas$. A bottle of good Oyster Sauce is a really versatile pantry item, and well worth having on hand if you are interested in asian-style condiments/ marinades / sauces. And this is good Oyster Sauce.

review/summary: Like a cozy cup of hot chocolate.
review/text: This tea is like drinking a light hot chocolate that is spiced. Drinking it reminds me more of hot chocolate than, traditional Masala Chai tea. I add skim milk and raw sugar to this tea after brewing. You could add a bit of condensed milk, for a richer cup, or it would be lovely with soy milk, or other non-dairy creamers for those that are vegan, or do not eat dairy.<br />This tea tastes of chocolate, the kind of warm spices often used in bakeries, a little nuttiness rounded out by lush coconut.<br />This tea doesn't taste like the traditional chais sold at cafes, and such. It doesn't have any cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, or clove. In this tea there are big chunks of cut-up vanilla beans, long shreds of coconut, cocoa nibs, spices, and more. It is easy to drink, and childern may even like it.<br />If you like hot chocolate, but want something less rich, and more healthful, this tea is great. This isn't just an alternative to chocolate; it is a full flavored, aromatic, indulgent, and a seductive tea blend. It could be an everyday luxury. You may even wish your next cup of hot chocolate tastes like this chocolate chai, it actually makes hot chocolate pale by comparison.

review/text: Not enough chai flavor to balance the thin chocolate taste.  I've loved other Rishi teas but this was very disappointing.

review/text: This tea is just disgusting. We dont like it at all! Tastes nothing like hot chocolate like some people have said. Thats just our families opinion.

review/text: This is the best coconut water!  It has little bits of coconut in it and is sweet and refreshing.  I would never pay amazon price for it (four plus eight shipping, who would?) I pay one and a quarter, maybe less at the store.  Only problem is there are no stores around that sell it, so I get it when I go to a city.  It is perfect!
