review/summary: Hip Hip Hooray for Zuke's
review/text: We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement, Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat, corn, soy, by-products, or artificials.<br /><br />Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine, but I've taken it for years with wonderful results, and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.<br /><br />These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course, I'll be ordering another.

review/text: We have a border collie/husky. She is 13 years old and we love her dearly. She has such a sweet disposition. I keep the Zuke's treats in a basket in the utility room. Whenever I go to that room, Sasha follows me and starts doing some of her tricks on her own hoping she will get one of her treats she loves. Judy Watson

review/summary: My 3 dogs love these
review/text: I've started giving these to 2 of my dogs which are a very large breed.  They aren't really old yet, but we have mostly wood and tile floors which are hard on their joints.  So I've started giving them these in hopes of preventing - to some extent - damage and pain for them. They love these.  My small dog isn't very old, but wants them, too.  I don't think they are so good for her since she has thrown them up before.  The pieces are fairly large so the dog knows she's getting a real treat.  I haven't found any flavor that they don't like, although the Beef seems to be their favorite.  I like that they seem to be a made in the USA product since I lost a dog during the "bad dog food" epidemic. Since then, I've been very careful what I give my dogs.

review/text: I have tried a lot of different arthritis supplements for my small dogs, but this one is the best product I have found for the price.  My dogs love it and it is wonderful to see them running around where before they could hardly move for the pain.  Granted, they are old (one is 17 and one is 13) but I believe this product has given them a better quality of life, which, after all, is exactly what we want for our pets.

review/summary: It Works!
review/text: We have a 15-year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over-the-counter glucosamine for him, but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over-the-counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action, and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed, so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine), but he's doing great...running up and down stairs, playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action, but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog.

review/text: I have an elderly dog with hip and joint problems. She has been taking Zuke's Hip Action Dog treats for a little more than a month and there has been a HUGE difference in her. She loves the way the treats taste; and best of all she is walking with ease, has an easier time with stairs and yesterday broke into a full sprint for the first time in ages! We followed the guideline for her size as listed on the back of the package and have been so surprised by the results. We love Zuke's!

review/summary: Soft, Chewable, Yummy Treats for Your Aging/Arthritic Dog
review/text: I buy these for my nine year old Chihuahua. He has bad knees, hips, and back. He also has lost the majority of his teeth due to former owners who neglected his dental health. He loves these and they seem to help him a lot. When I pull out the bag, he starts doing his tricks hoping I'll give him one just for doing them! He can eat them easily even without the majority of his teeth, although I do break them into smaller pieces since he is only about 5 pounds.<br />These treats seem to have really improved his mobility and stamina. He skips less(to get his kneecap back in place), bunny hops less(because his hips hurt him), and jumps on the bed without any help(he used to stand on the top of his pet stairs and wait for me to pick him up). He's always had tons of energy, but now his body can keep up with him better.

review/summary: Fixed My Dogs Hip
review/text: I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past.

I have been giving them to her everyday for about a month and just last weekend she racied me down the stairs outside!!!  And she won!!! I really think these are helping her, so I'm on "Subscribe and Save" and will keep giving them to her forever if it keeps her out of pain. I also give one to my yorkie. No hip/lep problems there but maybe we can head em off at the pass!! They LOVE how they taste and both sit patiently waiting for their treat!!! Thank you Zuke's!!!!

review/text: Very happy to see a product that actually backed up what they said about the flavor.  Have purchased other products that stated they were "bacon" flavored and dogs love them.  Couldn't get my dogs to eat them (one of them usually eats anything).  I have no problem getting my dogs to eat the Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dogs Treats.  I've noticed a slight improvement in their movement.  Haven't been using the product that long so it will be good to see how their movement improves over time.

We started to give these once a day to the girls, and they couldn't LOVE it more. which makes me LOVE it because they take these easily and are getting great vitamins in the process. I wish I knew about these sooner, I would absolutely  give them to all future dogs I have as well. I was so sad when my local stores stopped selling them, and now solely get them through amazon. The service is so quick and easy. Overall I couldn't say enough great things about this product!

review/text: My dogs love these treats.  I've been giving them these treats for several years now.  They go nuts when they know they are going to get one, and my vet recommends the supplements for them as they get older.  They are a bit pricey, but I think they are worth it.  Much better now that Amazon is carrying them directly.  I can also say that the manufacturer stands by their products 100%.  I used to buy these in a 3 pack from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon.  On my last shipment, it was very noticeable that in all 3 bags, the treats were very hard and brittle, despite being well before the use by date printed on the bag and the packaging being intact (no holes).  I emailed the manufacturer, and within just a few days they shipped me 3 new bags without any hassle.  Now that is Customer Service!

review/summary: I like them. My dog doesn't like them so much.lol.
review/text: I have an 8 year old female German Shepherd. Lately I have been noticing she has a bit of a difficult time getting up and her hips always seem to be stiff.<br />Since I don't know anything about dog vitamins, I decided to take the route of these treats. I would much rather give her something she might possibly like over giving her a pill.<br /><br />Thing is, she doesn't really like these very much. I usually have to try 2 or 3 times to get her to eat. Bright side is that I can get her to eat them after a little hassle.<br /><br />The even brighter side to these treats (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3) is the fact that they do seem to be helping her stiff joints. I have only gone through one 6 oz bag of these treats and I have noticed a difference in how she stands up, walks and runs. For the first time in a while her legs don't look so stiff.<br /><br />P.S. you can get these treats cheaper on Linens and Things website(LNT.COM). You don't have to pay shipping. I paid 12.21 for a pound of these treats.

review/summary: Best way to give glucosamine that I've found
review/text: My dog loves these treats. I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid. These are pretty affordable, too. They also travel fairly well, and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.<br /><br />The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day. The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog's weight. But so far "over-medicating" has not been a problem (especially if you break them in half).<br /><br />I've been really amping up my dog's walks and runs to get ready for hiking this spring, and so far he's not only limp-free, but the stiffness he used to get just after a nap seems to be significantly reduced. All in all, we're both really happy with these. I'll be buying them again, and I'll be trying out more of Zuke's other treats.

So I now get her treats with glucosamine - so much easier than trying to get a pill in her.  She like the chicken flavor best - she tried beef too.  I like that it is made in the USA.  She does much better with her hips and joints - vet tells me it is really her knee that has ACL problems.  Zukes has a great product here that I like to give her, and she enjoys the good-for-her treat.

review/summary: Great supplement that my dog asks for
review/text: My elderly lab suffers from arthritis.  Her pain is greatly diminished by taking glucosamine and chondroitin.  Unfortunately she is not a fan of the gravy, chewable tablets or pill forms.  Hip Action has been a fantastic find because she actually wants her meds.  You can set a clock by her these days at 8 pm she goes into the kitchen and stares at the cupboard where we store the Hip Action and waits for her two treats.

review/summary: Really helps mobility
review/text: I bought these treats for my 16 year olo husky/beagle mix dog. Within two weeks she showed a visible improvement in mobility and seemed to be pain free. She has pretty bad arthritis and these seem to be working very well. The only issue is they are a semi soft treat so they were all pretty broken and in a big lump in the bag. But other than that they are a great product.

review/text: My dog has a fairly sensitive stomach and is a VERY picky eater, so I'm usually quite careful with trying new treats. But he loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>, so I thought I might as well give Hip Action a try. And he loved them!<br />They are also a great value - I actually took the time and counted the number of treats in a 1 lb bag - and I got 64, which means more than 2 months of hip protection for dogs under 46 lb (you only need to give one a day).

review/summary: Our favorite treat from Zuke's
review/text: I have been buying this product since sep 2010.  My dog loves this the most.  He sometimes refuses other treats but never this.  So it must be good.  It comes in one and a half inch squares.  It's a little big for us so we cut into smaller, bite-size pieces that are great for training.  We are still young so can't comment on the hip action part yet. I just want to give my dog a good quality treat and I think this is worth the price.

But, I guess there's no cure for age.<br /><br />This is a far better way to get your dog to take glucosamine and chondroitin.  We had the hardest time getting her to take a pill.<br /><br />I will note that the treats get stale pretty quickly if you don't seal the bag well (it's ziplock.)

review/summary: Yummy for my dog
review/text: My mom purchased a variety of treats for my dog to try.  He does not have any hip problems but we needed a treat that he would not turn his nose up at and not choke on.  The pieces are 1 x 1 squares, about 3/4 of a centimeter thick.  They smell like fruity beef bullion to me even though the formula says it is chicken.  I have a Bichon Frise (5 yrs old) and he likes these treats.  The texture reminds me of a Lara Bar but just a tad firmer/dryer.

review/text: I have a 12 year old Corgi that has been having problems going up and down stairs, has had no interest in playing with toys over the last year.  Went to the Vet and they gave him Rimadyl.  This helped some but still was having issues, and having to carry him up and down stairs.<br /><br />Started giving him the Zukes on a whim after seeing it in the local pet store.  This stuff WORKS I am sold.  He is playing with other dogs now, goes up and down the stairs, brings toys for us to play with him again.  He is like his old self again.

review/summary: Have you heard of "Kusa Mochi"? Well, this is it!
review/text: This Mochi is very hard to come by in the US. This is authentic "Kusa Mochi, or Mugwort Mochi that is popular in Japan. I love Eden's version as theirs are made of brown rice instead of white sweet rice. Of course the mochi with white sweet rice makes it more starchy and sweeter, but considering health benefits of using brown rice, this is the winner! Just bake it on a sheet of aluminum foil in an over toaster at 450 degree temperature for about 5 to 10 minutes, or you see it's puffed up for about an inch. It's ready to eat, and my favorite way to eat is to wrap it with a sheet of toasted "nori" or seaweed, and dip in a soy sauce or famous Liquid Amino to enjoy! The use of Mochi is endless - miso soup, or with noodles like udon, soba, or ramen. They are bit pricey and I wish they are available at cheaper price, but Amazon's subscription price is the best price I found so far online.

review/text: My grandmother had a jar of these out at all times.  When I came over, the only thing left was a graveyard of aluminum wrappers and the trademark paper.<br /><br />This is a wonderful and affordable way to get the Hershey chocolate experience.  If you enjoy them in warm(not hot) climates, they are great.  In hot climates, they lose there integrity and become a bit too soft.  In cold climates, they become the dreaded Hershey's "plastic", a dark looking thing which is not very rich or creamy.  Hershey's was always an affordable brand and never meant to be premium.  If you long for the Swiss chocolate experience, then there are better choices.<br /><br />For dieters, these MIGHT be perfect; put them in a jar and take one at a time, a few per day.  For some of us(read:  all of us), that's a tall order.

review/summary: LorAnn Pistachio Flavoring
review/text: The LorAnn pistachio flavoring oil was purchased for baking cakes and making frostings. There is a scant semblance of pistachio in this product and adding more than a few drops completely transforms quality ingredients into noxious, bitter, chemical-tasting trash. I believe these products were originally intended for making candy and may very well still be suitable for such things. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR BAKING.<br /><br />On a side, there are many LorAnn oils that have worked for me very well in baking (some of the berry flavors are excellent). I'm somewhat ambivalent about the flavors which are supposed to be rich or nutty such as their hazelnut or chocolate oils. I'm not dissuaded from buying LorAnn oils but I will certainly avoid purchasing 4 bottles prior to testing out a flavor.<br /><br />Happy cooking!

review/summary: Makes steak taste like vinegar.
review/text: First of all, Peter Luger's Steakhouse is highly over-rated.  The steak is overdone and tastes too fatty, sweet and vinegary.  In fact, at the restaurant, they actually tip the plate up and take a big spoonful of the fat that has drained to the bottom, and poor it like sauce over your steak serving. Crazy, in my opinion.  Anyway, this retail version of the sauce is just as bad: tons of sugar and mostly vinegar.  Marinate your steak in this and all you'll taste is the vinegar.  This sauce will ruin a good cut of meat.  From good to best, buy shell (aka strip), sirloin, top sirloin, porterhouse, tenderloin (aka filet mignon) and use a non-vinegar-based marinade, like wine and herbs.

review/text: These candies are a lot more solid than gummy bears, and dusted with a bit of sugar.  Flavors are Crisp, and clean, they do not have a chemical taste, and they will slowly dissolve away leaving you tongue in a bath of delectable sweetness. Made without high fructose corn syrup they are a Knock out of the park hit for your taste buds.

review/summary: Addictive, high quality, tasty candy
review/text: Having tried these during a trip to Europe 2 years ago, my kids and I love popping one of these in our mouths while watching TV or doing their homework.  Made of real sugar and fruit juices.  This is not for anyone looking for a healthy snack (lol) but it certainly better tasting than the traditional fructose corn syrup (yes, made from corn!!) candy.<br /><br />One other reason why I am writing this review is to caution folks that the latest order directly from Amazon had an expiration date of Feb 2012.  Called Amazon who quickly took care of this for me.  Another earlier similar order from another Amazon seller this month had an expiration date of Oct 2012 which is a little more acceptable than Feb 2012. Let's see whether my kids and I can finish 12 of these rolls (2 were gone the first day) within a reasonable time without going way past the Oct 2012 date.<br /><br />Wish there was a way to check the expiration date before ordering.<br /><br />Oct 22nd update:<br /><br />Amazon reshipped the same item and it was delivered with the same Feb 2012 expiration date.  Called customer service and I accepted their offer for a refund. Be aware this item comes directly from Amazon.  Amazon is suppose to pull this listing until they are able to investigate it.

review/text: I've tried the sweet and the mild and I highly recommend. These are a bit pricey at $50 per box of 20, but you get what you pay for. Perhaps if enough people start purchasing these, the price will come down a bit. The grass fed beef does not taste gamey either. I do wish they were certified organic though. My guess is that they are from organic cows on small farms but these farms don't want to pay for organic certification due to price.

review/summary: Not what it used to be...
review/text: Whatever happened to Cal's Tupelo Honey? I bought it for years in the natural food stores locally. None of them carry it anymore. Trying to locate the company, I spent a futile hour searching the Internet.<br /><br />The label on my old jar says "Cairo, GA 39828". Not to be found anywhere on Google, white pages or yellow. After checking Amazon, I see that the label on the 22 oz. bottles says "Calvary, GA 31729". Same non-results on Google. The local retailer suggests that they may have been bought out. It troubles me that they are unfindable. What troubles me even more, however, is that the bottom half-inch of my current (and last) jar has crystallized. Tupelo honey should never crystallize, so my assumption is that it's being cut with some other, probably cheaper, kind of honey.<br /><br />If you're looking for tupelo honey, see the website operated by The National Honey Board. It lists apiaries in every state which produce many varieties of honey, including tupelo, often with links to those websites, and has useful information in addition. Cal's Honey isn't to be found. Too bad. It was a favorite of mine.

review/summary: NOT REAL TUPELO HONEY!! DO NOT BUY...
review/text: My first negative review......<br /><br />This is NOT real Tupelo honey!  In fact I doubt if its pure/real honey at all.  It crystallizes QUICKLY, much faster than the cheap-o store brands, spring blossom or even clover.  Tupelo honey should NEVER EVER crystallize, hence the high price.  With this product your paying a premium price for a extremely poor quality honey.  I'm also willing to bet they use HFCS as a "food" for the bee's.  If you want REAL Tupelo honey look elsewhere.  Do NOT purchase this product if you enjoy real/raw/quality honey!<br /><br />I will be contacting Amazon.com to see if there is any recourse for this purchase.  Amazon has the BEST customer service, and will continue to do 99% of my shopping on the site.

review/summary: RAW, real honey, and the best premium kind you can get!
review/text: Tupelo honey is the finest honey on the market, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ517G">Cal's Honey, Tupelo, 22-Ounce Squeeze Bottle (Pack of 3)</a> is value priced! Tupelo honey does not get grainy or turn solid over time, and it is digested differently than other sugars so it doesn't cause sugar highs and lows - making it a good choice even for diabetics. This is thin, free-flowing honey, so we store it in the refrigerator to make it pour thicker. The flat top on the container makes it easy to store upside down for fast dispensing! Cal's Tupelo Honey is produced in Georgia, USA.<br /><br />More facts: Tupelos are valued as honey plants in the southeastern United States, particularly in the Gulf Coast region. They produce a very light, mild-tasting honey. In northern Florida, beekeepers keep beehives along the river swamps on platforms or floats during tupelo bloom to produce certified tupelo honey, which commands a high price on the market because of its flavor. Monofloral honey made from the nectar of the Ogeechee Tupelo has such a high ratio of fructose to glucose that it does not crystallize.<br /><br />The Apalachicola River in the Florida Panhandle is the center for tupelo honey. The honey is produced wherever tupelo trees (three species) bloom in southeastern USA, but the purest and most expensive version (which is certified by pollen analysis) is produced in this Florida valley.

review/text: Tupelo honey is wonderful, but hard to find, and very expensive. Locating it at amazon.com was a real stroke of luck. The bottles are large, you get three of them, and you can group the honey with other products for free shipping. That's the ideal way to enjoy the great taste of tupelo honey. I was told years ago by a health professional to use tupelo because of the way the body digests it, making it usable even by diabetics, who must control their sugar intake. So happy that amazon.com now carries Cal's Honey, a brand I had known for years.

review/text: Cal's Tupelo honey is the best I've ever tasted.  I have certain food allergies and Cal's tupelo does not cause an allergic reaction like other types of honey I've tried such as clover honey. I've been buying this honey for years at health food stores--now it's only available online through Amazon.  Squeeze bottle seal could be better--honey sometimes seeps out of top seal on the squeeze bottle which makes the jar sticky when it arrives.

review/text: I received this order today with a MAJOR problem!  I did not taste it because the labels no where had "RAW" on them, as it is in the picture. If it is not raw, it is as useless to me as commercial white sugar (granted, it is a tad bit healthier).<br /><br />Amazon has refused to take it back but I have written to them to try and find a solution.<br /><br />This is the second major problem I have add with Amazon in the past few days and you can check my review on the Casio Men's AMW 320D watch (they actually sent me the 320R, even though the box said 320D!!!, which went bad shortly after I received it). They refused to help me here as well, even though it was their fault, and I may not be able to get the repair(s)  done under the warranty because the Model numbers don't match on the receipt....again, their fault.<br /><br />Will let you know what happens. I will not deal with a company I cannot trust and is not fair.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/09/2011: I am pleased to say that Amazon gave me a full refund for the honey order and apologized for the misleading information. They still could not accept a return  of the honey because of health issues so I will dispose of it as best I can, but in no way eat it myself.<br /><br />They also agreed to replace the Casio watch if  Casio refused to repair it under the warranty.<br /><br />They bent their rules to reach a fair settlement and that should be greatly admired.

review/summary: Your Next and 'Possibly' Last Granola Bar!
review/text: The good folks at Quaker Oats have finally hit the nail on the head! If you're lookin' for a delicious, nutritious, and satisfying snack bar, this is it. This little wonder packs in a lot of value for its scant 100 calories: 3 grams of fiber, 2 grams of protein, and only five grams of sugar. What it doesn't have is equally impressive: no trans fat, low sodium, and only 1 gram of saturated fat. The taste is right-on, with no discernible aftertaste...the texture is both chewy and crispy, with no appreciable grit-factor. At three bars for a buck, how can you go wrong? Please read on.<br /><br />Revised:<br /><br />I recently discovered that Quaker's list of ingredients and nutritional values for this product do not jive. They listed partially hydrogenated vegetable oil as their fourth ingredient by weight, and it's listed no less than four times. Yet, they declare the trans fat content to be zero. Since these two injurious ingredients are synonymous, what are we to conclude -- or more importantly -- believe? C'mon Quaker, quit the false and/or deceptive advertising and give us the straight facts, so that we can make a properly informed purchasing decision. I'll amend my revised rating, if and/or when, I get a perfectly acceptable explanation.

review/summary: IGNORE AMAZON'S DIRECTIONS!
review/text: They're 'WAY off--use one TEASPOON/8 oz. of water at 190�. I start with a total brewing time of about two minutes (including the time needed to decant), adding 30 seconds to the subsequent two infusions (forget about a fourth--three is about as good as it gets although you can then place the used leaves in a jar, add about 6 oz. water, and refrigerate covered overnight for delicious, next-morning iced tea for a total of four steepings).<br />Now, as to the tea itself. This is EXTREMELY fine jasmine tea. Rishi's offering uses "dragon pearls" of excellent quality--Chinese green tea leaves that are hand-rolled into little...well, pearls. The pearls are then scented, over the course of several days, with fresh jasmine blossoms--20 lbs. of fresh jasmine blossoms are used to scent each pound of tea. This is excellent, absolutely delicious tea that, excepting the word "jasmine," has virtually nothing to do with cheaper grades of tea that are scented chemically with perfumes. It scents the whole room as it brews.  :)<br />Bearing in mind that there are no bargains to be found for top-grade tea--it's never cheap--Amazon has the best price I've yet found for Rishi Jasmine Pearls, especially if your order qualifies for free shipping. It can and should be infused three times, which might take some of the sting out of purchasing, the health benefits of green tea providing the final push.<br />Rishi Dragon Pearls are now a part of my parents' daily routine. In addition, I made a gift of a can to a friend's mom--that can went all the way to Russia and was, predictably, received with delight and appreciation. A cousin in California, on my recommendation, went a bit hog-wild and bought four cans from Amazon--she's now a fan, too. I doubt there are any better green jasmine pearls to be found. (Seven Cups, an online purveyor of top-grade Chinese tea, has white jasmine pearls that are equally fine but very different--I like both).<br />Incidentally, try to brew this tea in glass as the unfurling of the pearls is extremely beautiful to watch.<br /><br />Update: I just bought a new can and noticed that the brewing instructions are radically different. The suggested brewing times remain the same (3 - 4 minutes), but the amount of leaf has TRIPLED to one tablespoon and the suggested brewing temperature has decreased by 10� to 180�. Frankly, given that I get excellent results with the suggestions that are still posted on the Rishi Web site (steeping for a good minute less, though), I decided that the only concession I'll make is to drop the temperature to 185�, leaving everything else the same (the correct brewing temperature can be had very easily: pour boiling water into a large Pyrex measuring cup, then pour over the leaves). A higher concentration of scented leaf would likely gag me (as in the case of the brewing instructions for Rishi's Osthmanthus Silver Needle), plus the original instructions are MUCH more cost-effective. Tea preferences, however, are very much a matter of taste, so play with the suggested parameters, if you're so inclined, to determine yours. Keep in mind, though, that jasmine tea can become bitter if mishandled (this just passed on to me by Austin at Seven Cups), so play safe!

I know the price may be a little more than what you are used to paying for green tea, but, believe me, it is definitely worth it.<br /><br />The jasmine flavor is rich and sweet, all by itself. The amount of work that goes into creating each of these lovely pearls is astounding (hence the price!). Once you have tried this tea, all other jasmine green teas will pale in comparison. The flavor is so concentrated, you only need to use a scant teaspoon of pearls for each cup of tea that you brew, so these two cannisters will last for some time. I hope you try this tea, as I know you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: I wanted to find something cheaper...
review/text: There are plenty of reviews here to tell you that this tea is good.<br /><br />If you are like me though, you are a value shopper.  And the price of this tea is obviously expensive.  So after trying this Rishi tea, I thought I'd be able to find something similar that is a better value.  I ordered the one pound bag of Numi Jasmine pearls because it has pretty good ratings and is a better value per pearl, and surely I won't be able to tell much of a difference...<br /><br />If you are thinking of doing the same, save your money and order Rishi.  My experience is that there is a big difference in taste.  Rishi is just a lot smoother, I found the Numi to be kind of musty/moldy compared to Rishi.  Maybe I got a bad bag, I don't know.  But I would say don't try Rishi if you are satisfied with something else because you will probably be hooked!  I will probably end up dumping my Numi Jasmine Pearls because I already restocked on Rishi (actually I felt highly favored to find the one pound bag of Rishi Jasmine Pearls on sale for half price on the Rishi web site during their one day Christmas sales).<br /><br />I drink tea pretty much all day long (without any sweeteners) - usually starting with two big cups of this (two 16 oz infusions of the same tea made in the brilliant IngenuiTEA infuser by Adagio tea), then two cups of Rishi silver needle white tea, then some herbal teas in the afternoon.  I mix it up sometimes with Rishi Wuyi Oolong or something else, but Jasmine Pearl is a very clean and smooth tea that is a classic for me.  Multiple infusions increase the value.  Just be sure to use the right temperature water and steeping time to get the best value.

review/text: I have tried and reviewed a few Jasmine Teas and still have not found one current tea that has a jasmine fragrance.  When I was in China I had a great tea that when you brewed it, would fill the air with the smell of Jamsine.  You could smell it when you brought your nose to the cup. It was aromatherapy!<br /><br />I had seen people complain Rishi had too much jasmine smell so figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />Teance, Chaa by Te and Whole Tea version of Jasmine Dragon Pearl Fujian, All have about the same taste and smell  as the Rishi.  No need to spend more on this tea.  I would say Teance is the closer one as it is not as pungent.<br /><br />Sadly I do not smell any jasmine.  I have a jasmine plant so know what this should smell like if true jasmine.<br /><br />Rishi Pearls  I got do not have any jasmine smell. Not in the cup, not in the air.  It is more pungent when smelling in the bag but I can not place the odor.<br /><br />My only thought, after speaking to Rishi, is that maybe I am smelling the type of tea plant and they suggested trying their white tea and jasmine.<br />It is possible, since what I had overseas was a a loose tea, that I was not not drinking a silver tip tea.<br /><br />For the extra cost I did not get a better flavor. The other brands mentioned will give you the same results for a better cost per pound.

review/text: The delivery was so efficient and prompt.  The tea itself is fabulous.  It will be hard to get back to a regular tea bag.  There is no comparison. Thank you.  I will be a regular customer of this product.

review/summary: Amazing Jasmine!
review/text: This stuff is incredible!  I've had many different kinds of Jasmine tea, and this tops them all hands down.  No bitterness.  Tastes great unsweetened, and blissfully delicious with agave or stevia!  I love it.

review/summary: I agree
review/text: Just in case you're ignoring all the people who said a mere teaspoon, or less, of this tea is plenty, believe them.<br />I just bought a canister and a teaspoon of pearls expanded into far more than a tablespoon of their other, non pearl, tea.<br />I was able to get two huge mugs out of one spoonful.<br /><br />Another suggestion: if you have a basket type mesh contraption, or a traditional teapot, please use that. If you use one of those small metal balls or teaspoons that will enclose your pearls they will not be able to expand fully.

review/summary: Best Jasmine Green Tea EVER!
review/text: This tea is quite possibly the the best green tea I've ever had. I tried a plethora of green teas from various companies and this one tops them all.<br /><br />It's so good that I'm planning on ordering some more for gifts to friends and family for b-days and X-mas!

review/summary: Aromatherapy
review/text: This Tea is Aromatherapy according to my husband. And I could not agree more. Its soooo good and soothing...best of all u need just 5-6 pearls to steep and these can be steeped upto 3 times. I knew according to ayurveda that sipping on warm water all day increases your metab. What better way than doing it with organic green tea. I just got this and am here to order few more for presents for christmas.<br />I am in my third trimester of pregnancy and am enjoying every bit of this this...But If you google you would know that green tea hampers folate absorption and is best avoided in the first trimester.<br /><br />Awesome

review/summary: Ah, that's the ticket
review/text: I've tried somewhere between 10 and 20 varieties of Jasmine pearl tea ranging from commodity brands available at the local high end grocery store to absurdly expensive specialty brands imported by the tea shop.  This is as good as any I've ever tried and better than most.  The instructions on the canister say to use one tablespoon of tea pearls per 2 cups of water, but I find that to be too much.  I'd say one teaspoon per cup, best brewed in a glass teapot so you can watch the leaves unfurl as the tea steeps.  After all, why shouldn't tea be entertaining as well as delicious?

review/summary: Wonderful tea!
review/text: This is the best tea I've ever had.  It is mild with no bitter after taste.  Easy to brew and each "helping" of tea pearls can be used at least three times (four makes it a little weak for my taste).  Even my husband had started drinking Jasmine Pearl tea, in the morning.  Stir in a teaspoon of honey and you have absolute heaven!

review/summary: Gentle tea, great flavor
review/text: The fact that this comes as leaves wrapped in pearls makes it easy to steep and is not messy.  The flavor is wonderful, not bitter, and the Jasmine adds a subtle and aromatic touch. Also, the pearls can be steeped three times before being expended.  Wonderful tea.

review/summary: Even this non-tea drinker loves it!
review/text: I wouldn't consider myself a tea drinker, really; mostly I've been sampling loose tea in the past year or so in search of flavorful alternatives to soda and diet drinks.  I'm picky about what teas I choose to buy a second time, and I've got little patience for teas that are finicky to prepare (I do most of my brewing at work).<br /><br />I got a two-pack of this tea while searching for a good jasmine green tea as part of a gift for a friend.  I was a bit astounded at the recommended usage rate (1 TABLESPOON per 8 oz, which I see a lot of reviewers are saying really is too much), but I loaded up my brewing basket, got my not-quite-boiling water from the coffee machine's dispenser, brewed for about 4 minutes, and... ahhh, magic.  Even with that much tea, no accurate temperature gauge, and imprecise timing, I got (and continue to get) a perfect cup of delightful jasmine tea.  It's floral enough to be noticeable, and to cut the edge of the green tea, but not overly perfumey.  A second brew with the leaves actually turns out stronger than the first -- I suspect it's because I use too much tea, and some of the pearls don't fully open during the first brew.  I will have to experiment with using less tea from now on, but even overdoing it, this stuff is really fine.<br /><br />Now that the weather is heating up, I'm also looking forward to trying this cold -- I love Itoen's bottled jasmine tea on a hot day, and being able to make my own will be great.<br /><br />(And that friend I gifted with the other can?  He's much more of a "tea person" than I, and jasmine green tea is one of his favorites -- and he loves it too.)

review/summary: Decent tea at a high premium
review/text: I've had much better tea but this isn't bad. It's also quite expensive, since I have bought much better for cheaper. Also for those that drink tea as a coffee substitute, this tea doesn't have that much caffeine. I don't feel anything when I drink this but I do when I drink high quality green tea.
