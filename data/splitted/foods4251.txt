review/text: I bought this food as an additive to my dog's regular dry dog food.  My dog, who is actually quite large, has shown less and less interest in her dry food.  Now that I mix the two together she can't get enough!  Pedigree Little Champions has made life easier for me and my pet.

review/summary: Awesome Gluten Free Crackers
review/text: These are simply the best tasting gluten free crackers we have found yet. They also have the texture you expect crackers to have with a combination of light and crunchy. The parmesan herb are my favorites, but the sea salt are also very good. At this time Amazon is not showing a price for this product, but I have been paying $2.38 per box locally, so anything around $25 or less for 12 would be great.

review/summary: Pretty Good Chai Experience
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.<br /><br />The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: I love original Juicy Fruit gum, but really wanted a sugar free version. I was very excited for this new version to come out! Alas, it fell very short of my high expectations in terms of flavor. It's not long lasting, but neither was the original. But the flavor just doesn't have whatever "it" is that the original does that's so addicting. It tastes similar, like you can tell it's supposed to be the same thing, but it just doesn't quite get there. I wanted to like this, but I just wouldn't re-purchase. I will stick to the original for now.

review/text: My little Pomeranian loves treats, but this product makes him physically ill. I even cut them into smaller, bite-sized pieces (no easy chore by the way because they're rock hard) but they just don't agree with him. In addition, they have the most awful fake-bacon smell you'll ever encounter. They make me nauseous, too.<br /><br />On the other hand, the same company's peanut butter flavored treats are my dogs' favorite!

review/summary: These treats make my pooch sick!
review/text: I have a Cocker Spaniel who absolutely adores these treats. I jokingly refer to them as his "crack sticks," because he is seriously addicted. Whenever I pull them out of the cupboard, he starts running around in circles and barking like a crazy person. In short, he's a fan.<br /><br />I, however, cannot recommend them. Sometimes he can eat them just fine...but other times, he vomits them back up. We're also city dwellers, meaning I have to pick up his waste on the streets. I know this is gross, but the bacon treats are in his poo...um, unprocessed. He'll often even pass the bacon treat on its own, just dropping the little hard centers on the pavement while we walk.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing these again.

review/summary: DO NOT FEED YOUR SMALL DOG THIS!!!!!
review/text: After hundreds of dollars on x-rays, urgent care vet visits, etc - we finally found out the source for all my pup's pain were these treats.  The centers DO NOT dissolve in their stomach, and if they do not vomit them back up, they get constipated and cannot excrete, which leaves them in tremendous pain.  I have a Pomapoo (1/2 Pomeranian, 1/2 Poodle who is 10 months old) and he has been in pain for weeks because of this treat, and it broke my heart to know that I was the one keeping him in pain by feeding him these treats!! Maybe bigger dogs can digest them, but PLEASE PLEASE do not feed this product to your pet if you have a small dog! I thought it'd be a good alternative as he likes to chew and there is no rawhide in them, but the center does not break down, and he had one part lodged in his small intestine and another stuck in his stomach.  I cannot express how awful it is to see your pup in pain, and it is not worth the risk to try these products.  I hope in some way I can save another pup from having to go thru the pain and experience mine went thru - and the owner lots of spendy vet bills.

review/summary: Made both my dogs sick for a few days
review/text: Pur Luv Mini Bones for small dogs, peanut butter flavor, 2-pound bag from PetsMart. Looks like batch info is 2761SKC101 BEST BY SEP 2014.<br /><br />Just bought these in the middle of Feb 2012, and started by giving my two dogs one each in the evening. The next day my Maltese threw up her food twice. The next day the same. The third day my toy fox terrier (who can eat and digest ANYTHING) threw up in the morning on the bed, and the vomit was entirely pieces of these Mini Bones. Way too coincidental. After five days and each dog getting five treats total, I've stopped with these. And now a few days later my dogs appear fine.<br /><br />The bag says there's a website ([...]) but it suspiciously doesn't work. And I cant find a phone number, only a some consumer response P.O. box. Shifty.<br /><br />Don't risk it, stick to something else like Greenies.

review/summary: Good Price but My Dogs Didn't Love Them
review/text: For the money, this is a good deal.  You get a big bag of X-large 'bones'.  And compared to other brands like Busy Bone where they charge you five dollars for two bones - this really is a good price!<br /><br />Oddly enough though, my dogs didn't just love them.  Now don't get me wrong, they ate them - but that's not really saying much since they eat just about anything.  But they didn't snarf them down and beg for more like they have with some other brands.  It could be because this is the first time I've given them something peanut butter flavored, or it could be the brand - unfortunately, I really can't say why they didn't like them - I can only report my observations.<br /><br />For only $9 to $12 a bag, it's certainly worth the money to give them a try...and who knows, your dogs could love them.

Not worth the risk if it were to get stuck in her intestines.  Not worth making her sick.  Would rate "O" stars if I could.  These are awful.... not for small dogs at all!!!

review/text: Since buying these last week, EACH of my four shihtzu's got sick. They threw up undigested pieces and became listless for the rest of the week. I took one to my vet, and I DO NOT know if it's related to this product, but he said her feces had some kind of spores in it and they're all on pills now. He said the spores are passed around by eating dog poop, but they've been together for over a year and never came down with anything like this. As I said, I do not know if the spore thing is related to this product, but the vomiting definately is, and I'll be returning this large bag of "treats" today.

review/summary: Why all the chemicals?
review/text: My husband bought a package of Ann's House of Nuts Swiss Mix the other day.  I took one look at the ingredients list (posted at the end of my review) and thought, "How ridiculous.  Why all those ingredients, things you would never have in your kitchen, when really it's just dried fruit, nuts, candy-coated chocolate and peanut butter chips?"<br /><br />Tonight, in a fit of the late night munchies, I decided to try some.<br /><br />Yuck.  There's no taste!  The raisins are bland, the nuts have no flavor.  Even the chocolate is boring.  The dried pineapple has a powdery texture.  Barf...<br /><br />Here's a recipe for you, if you're in the mood for trail mix:  raisins and other dried fruits, nuts of whatever variety you like, chocolate chips.  Mix 'em up.  Voila.  A few flavorful, recognizable ingredients rather than this unnecessary mess:<br /><br />Peanuts (Peanuts, Peanut Oil)Raisins, Ernies (Sugar, Cocoa, Partially Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Oil, Whey, Artificial Color [Blue 1, Blue 1 Lake, Blue 2 Lake, Yellow 5, Yellow 5 Lake, Yellow 6, Yellow 6 Lake, Red 40, Red 40 Lake, Sorbitol, Titanium Dioxide, Phosphoric Acid, Methyl and Propyl Parabens, Caramel]Nonfat Milk Powder, Corn Syrup, Soy Lecithin, Wax, Dextrin, Vanillin [Artificial Flavor]Peanut Butter Drops (Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Oil, Partially Defatted Peanut Flour, Skim Milk, Whey Powder, Peanut Butter [Peanuts, Partially Hydrogenated Rapeseed and Cottonseed Oil]Dextrose, Salt, Soy Lecithin)Pineapple (Pineapple, Sugar, Calcium Chloride [for Product Texture]Citric Acid, Sulfur Dioxide and Sodium Metabisulfite [for Color Retention]

review/summary: Oh La La!
review/text: Wooo hoooo my third matcha today. Its been a long busy crazy kind of day with the need to multitask, be sociable, run errand, work, make phone calls, help family out, entertain teen girls with girl talk time, and go go go. Thanks to the power of matcha it has been a breeze! Now I am waiting on the husband to get home from work hopefully within the next hour or so and spend maybe one hour of quality time with him before I can unwind silently on my own perhaps doing some reading. However, I am going for this cup to carry me through till that time.<br /><br />So I am indulging in some french vanilla matcha from Red Leaf Tea linked above.<br /><br />This is one of the smoothest matcha yet from Red Leaf. A lot like Bavarian Cream it is very velvety and creamy. I think I prefer this over the madagascar vanilla because this one seems to be a bit more vanillay more in your face a term I over use but everyone who follows me pretty much knows I like my flavors to be strong. Between the two, if you want something more mellow and laid back then Madagascar Vanilla is your cup of tea, but if you want something sinfully smooth, rich, thick, and creamy, then French Vanilla is the one for you.<br /><br />I will probably do a bit more exploring of all the flavors Red Leaf Tea has to offer before ordering a larger quantity however I am pretty sure French Vanilla would make that list. I mean you can mix it with other flavors to get a more creamy texture and flavor out of them such as mixing Caramel matcha with French Vanilla but then I think I could do the same thing with Cheesecake, or Bavarian Cream so the list of possible mixes goes on and on!<br /><br />This is one that has a permanent home in my matcha stash!

review/summary: My One True Matcha Love
review/text: Now, those who follow me and my reviews know I can't stop raving about the Madagascar Vanilla from Red Leaf Teas. I'm almost out of it already, it's the one I reach for the most and when people ask which one they should try first, my immediate answer is "Vanilla. Oh my goodness, the vanilla."<br /><br />But Madagascar's reign may soon be over.<br /><br />French Vanilla is my one true love. French Vanilla anything. Vanilla was my favorite ice cream flavor before I gave up ice cream. French Vanilla is the ice cream flavor I will risk my dairy allergy for. It's just so creamy and rich and guh, so good. So when Red Leaf Tea let me know they had a new matcha out, a French Vanilla, I was sold. It immediately went into my cart and I feverishly finished my other reviews so I could order it as soon as possible.<br /><br />I opened the package this morning and almost drooled. It smells like icing. Like I had just opened up a new tub of Betty Crocker vanilla frosting. Oh god, I want to drown in it. It's almost too sweet for this early in the morning, but I don't care! I have to have some of this now! I'll make bacon later to make up for it.<br /><br />It...it's perfect. It's everything I ever dreamed of in a vanilla matcha. Everything. Creamy, smooth, beyond amazing. I want to shout from the rooftops that I've found The One, the tea I've been searching for forever, the tea that is the reason I own 6 different vanilla rooibos and 8 variations on a vanilla black. This tea is my holy grail. It's matcha, which I have come to love and value over almost any other tea, and it's that French Vanilla goodness that rocks my world. I know it seems like I've gone a bit crazy, but this is just...guh. It's fulfilling my ice cream cravings, my icing cravings, my everything cravings.<br /><br />That said, I will likely keep the Madagascar around for mixing, as it seems to blend beautifully with other flavors, but when I want to sit down and just enjoy a good cup of matcha, the French Vanilla is what I will be reaching for. Oh yes, my pretty. We will have a long, happy life together. Red Leaf Tea, I honestly cannot thank you enough for introducing this blend.

review/summary: Tasty tea with potential to help cure/avoid cancer!
review/text: Purchased this product based on researching the potential benefits related to cancer prevention and cancer cell eradication.  I'm currently giving the tea to my dad who has cancer in hopes that it will help him recover (he has stage 4 head and neck cancer).  Oncologist said it would not hurt him during his chemo treatment, so am making a cup each day for him in addition to giving him papaya leaf extract in 2-3 of his beverages each day.  In reading of the higher percentage that papaya leaf extract offers for cancer prevention, I decided to drink some as well.  I must say it is a tasty, easy to drink herbal tea - sometimes I add honey, but mostly just drink it straight.  I find it to help squalsh those desires to munch in the late evening which, since it doesn't have caffeine, can be drank before bed.  I will continue to purchase and drink regardless of the outcome of my dad's cancer.

review/summary: Tastes like Almonds
review/text: I couldn't believe it. I ordered a 4 pound bag of almonds, and that's what I got. They taste just like Almond milk, but in an solid form... not gelatinous like almond butter, but almost like a crunchy nut. They even had all the proper amino acids to promote muscle growth. I would consider ordering these again, but 4lbs of almonds should last me until the end of 2012.

review/summary: Best for Transitioning BFing Baby
review/text: This is the best formula when transitioning a breastfeeding baby.  Since I personally drank my own breastmilk to test the flavor, I can understand why some babies cannot stand formula.  My breastmilk tastes like milk with sugar in it, so very sweet.  I tried Similac Organic and Earth's Best Organic, but the fish oil taste (i.e. Omega-3) is so strong in these two forumulas that my 9-month old girl kept spitting up a lot from it.  I tasted them myself, and they were like drinking fish oil tablets.  Enfamil had the best taste - more sweet, although still a little fishy as well that is why I gave this product 3 stars.

Our son is 9 months and has been very healthy, even after being around other sick children. He started as a very small baby and is now caught up in size. Can't judge against other formula, but it certainly has done very well by us.

review/text: Simply put, my daughter loves the formula. It mixes up easily and she happily gobbles it down. The taste is slightly sweet. (I sampled it.) As this is a refill, it is slightly cheaper than the bin/tub version. We use this in conjunction with the bin, which is convenient and easy to use. I recommend washing the bin after every two bags. (Presently, my daughter drinks/eats about 8 oz at a feeding.)  You receive a new scoop in the box. The formula acts similarly to white sugar if it comes into contact with moisture.

With that being said, my baby responded much better to the Enfamil Infant than the Similac equivalent.  In fact, we even tried the "Gas and Fusiness" Similac and it made him MORE gassy.  After a couple days on Enfamil he was MUCH better.

I would also like the option to purchase a bulk option or one that comes with more than just two packages in it, but it doesn't appear that Enfamil makes those anymore.

review/text: I exclusively breastfed my daughter till she was 4 months, and then began adding some formula into her diet. Now she is mostly formula, and I had no problems switching her to Enfamil Premium. She seems to really like it. I haven't tried any other formulas, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it usually mixes up very quickly with out lumps. Once in a while an extra shake is all that's necessary! Just be careful when opening the refills, sometimes I open them too quickly (usually because my daughter is letting me know she's hungry!) and tear the sides a little bit where the tabs are to seal it up. Overall, very good. I won't use another formula!!

No messes and I love that the scoop attatches to the lid it stays so much cleaner. I have a daycare and the other babies I watch use the same thing, I just write their names on the lids and when its empty the parents bring me a refill bag. If you use the plastic container they are dishwasher safe too. Great product and super price. Wish they had an option to order a case and do the subscribe and save. My daughter uses a box a week at 9 months. Here is a link to the plastic container they make that is great, buy one then use these refills <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VKR0EU">Enfamil Premium Infant Formula, For Babies 0-12 Months, 23.4-Ounce</a>

review/text: Say that 10 times real fast.<br /><br />These sheets are like a sheet of paper. I immediately opened them and tried 1 sheet as is. It is very sharp like paper. It almost feels as if you could get a paper cut from them so be careful if eating them raw.<br /><br />I have never tried any other brands, but I own a few other Navita products and I have been satisfied with their quality.<br /><br />These sheets are very good tasting in my opinion.<br /><br />They have a similar taste to the green Mactha <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O7T87C">DoMatcha DoMatcha Organic 2nd Harvest Matcha, 2.82-Ounce</a>, but with a much saltier taste in addition.<br /><br />I cant wait to try these sheet in a soup and a wrap. But they are even good just eating raw as I mentioned before.<br /><br />I recommend this brand for their taste, quality, and price compared to other organic brands of nori out there.<br /><br />****UPDATED 3/14/12<br /><br />I tried the Nori sheets in soup and they were amazing! They add a nice flavoring to the soup and even a overall salty taste, leaving you to add less salt to your soup.<br /><br />Also, I made some sushi using there. They were a bit hard to wrap because of their texture. They do come with perforated lines to show you were to make your cuts for sushi, but it didn't help. Unless you have a super sharp, samurai type knife (pun intended), then these sheets will be hard to cut through. That may well be the case with any seaweed sheet, but I would not know because this was the first time I made sushi.<br /><br />One other thing I could mention is these sheets are pretty big if you are making sushi wraps, especially if you place to roll the seaweed with the rice on the OUTSIDE of the roll. You could definitely get away with using a half a sheet. If you are rolling the rice on the INSIDE like I did, then you might have to use the whole sheet, but they will still be too big and you will waste a bit unless you cut it off and use the extra in a soup later.<br /><br />Even still, the sushi turned out amazing (even though I wasted quite a bit because of the cutting issue).<br /><br />I still recommend these sheets and will be buying more.

review/text: My kids really enjoyed these Nori sheets.  They found it in the cabinet and happily consumed it over two days.  It was so much better than many of the other snack-y foods that they crave.  I didn't even mention I had bought any ;)  (the sheets were tasty, nice and crispy, and wrapped in a thick ziplocked plastic bag.)

I noticed a definite improvement within a month and not just in my joints but my hair, skin, and nails too.  This is one you should make a regular part of your health regime.  It has no taste and dissolves easily.  I drink it in my tea.  It's also great to take just before bedtime.  I think the calcium in it helps me sleep better.

review/summary: This stuff really works !
review/text: I have been using Nutrajoint for a couple of years and it has reduced my hip arthritis symptoms significantly. I am using one scoopful a day in my morning coffee. At first I was skeptical, having tried the glucosamine products in the past, and found no relief. Gelatin (which is the main ingredient of Nutrajoint) was recommended by my doctor (with no guarantees of course ). I had been through physical therapy for my hips, followed by regular gym exercises for about 6 months with only minimal improvement. After about 3 weeks on Nutrajoint I started noticing a reduction in the frequency of hip joint pain episodes, even after relatively vigoruous physical activity. I continued to improve and now only experience discomfort in my hips infrequently compared to every week a few years ago. Nutrajoint is not a cure, but, combined with regular physical workouts, it has made living with hip arthritis alot easier. The only "side effect" I have noticed is that I am trimming my finger and toe nails more frequently ( of course, that indicates that Nutrajoint is doing its job !! )

review/summary: Great for your gums, but ironically terrible for your teeth.
review/text: I have been supplementing with Osteo Bi-Flex for the last few months because I had terrible terrible gum loss and was on the verge of having to have bone graphs done.  I heard that Gelatin was the right stuff for the job. I just got back from the dentist and guess what? My gums are healing and my pockets are receding. Muy Bueno! Unfortunately, I had to have three cavities drilled on one of my front teeth, just on one! Can't wait for the X-Rays in a few months... Every time I take this stuff now and don't immediately brush my teeth and use fluoride, I feel tooth sensitivity. I also, have huge deposits of plaque that grow on my teeth after using this product. Often times, these deposits must be removed with a professional dental picker... On the other hand I do take a lot of this stuff, probably 3-4 times the normal daily dose. I originally switched to this stuff because I thought it was worth it to save the extra 20 bucks versus buying 2lbs of the GoBio Organic Gelatin. I am now switching back to the GoBio Organic Gelatin, simply for the tooth decay reasons (It also makes you feel better in terms of energy). The GoBio stuff is less processed and sticks to your teeth less if you avoid letting it dissolve in water... Would still recommend this stuff, but buyer beware if you have had dental problems in the past....

I had to take it for an extended time before it showed results, but now I can maintain on less product.  The taste is not very attractive, but after awhile it isn't too bad.  I have to believe that using this has helped with some lower back problems I had before regular use.  It won't always prevent them, but it seems to expedite recovery.

This brand is produced by Diamond Pet Foods, the company that makes:<br /><br />Canidae Pet Food<br />Costco's Kirkland Signature<br />Solid Gold Health Products for Pets<br />Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance Pet Foods<br />Kirkland Signature Nature's Domain (Available only at Costco)<br />Taste of the Wild Pet Foods<br />Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul<br />4Health (Available only at Tractor Supply Company)<br />NutraGold Super Premium Holistic Formulas<br /><br />All of these pet foods (even the Costco brand) are considered top notch and use high quality ingredients. There is no cheap corn meal filler (as seen in Iams and Science Diet) and the first filler is cracked pearled barley at ~#3 and white rice at ingredient #6.<br /><br />Kitten  Adult  Adult Lite<br /><br />34% Protein 22% Fat  30% Protein 20% Fat  32% Protein 9% Fat<br /><br />Chicken  Chicken  Chicken<br />chicken meal  chicken meal  chicken meal<br />turkey meal  cracked pearled barley  cracked pearled barley<br />chicken fat  chicken fat  turkey meal<br />cracked pearled barley  turkey meal  powdered cellulose<br />white rice  white rice  white rice<br />pea protein  potatoes  potatoes<br />potatoes  oatmeal  oatmeal<br />oatmeal  millet  millet<br />millet  natural chicken flavor  chicken fat<br />natural chicken flavor  salmon  natural chicken flavor<br />ocean fish meal  turkey  salmon<br />salmon  duck  turkey<br />turkey  ocean fish meal  duck<br />duck  flaxseed  ocean fish meal<br />flaxseed  sodium bisulfate  flaxseed<br />salmon oil  egg product  sodium bisulfate<br />egg product  DL-methionine  egg product<br />potassium chloride  potassium chloride  potassium chloride<br />DL-methionine  choline chloride  DL-methionine<br />salt  dried chicory root  choline chloride<br />choline chloride  taurine  dried chicory root<br />taurine  dried kelp  taurine<br />dried chicory root  carrots  dried kelp<br />dried kelp  peas  carrots<br /><br />Our cats have gone through all three varieties and seem to like the adult formula the best.

This is the most inexpensive quality pet food I could find anywhere, and with Amazon's free two day shipping, ordering a new bag is very convenient.

review/summary: Great food...terrible price
review/text: When I started buying this for my kittens it was $23/bag.  When I returned a couple of months ago to purchase again and saw the HUGE price spike I took my biz elsewhere.  The food itself, at least from the west coast plant which is where mine came from, is excellent quality and I fed this to my kittens and fed the dog food to my dogs.  However I won't be buying it anymore since the price hike and I actually ended up switching to a local brand where I know exactly what is going into my "kids'" food and I'm getting the same amount for $1.50 more.  Better deal all the way around.<br /><br />I suggest looking elsewhere for a different food.  Chicken Soup is becoming more and more scarce.

Instead of Xs, all food pellets are now shaped like discs (like pill capsules). My cats like this shape better but they don't chew their food now, which causes lots of vomiting. I've tried to discourage it by putting golf balls in their food but I think I'm just going to switch to another brand.

review/summary: Better for you than most other brands!
review/text: The main reason I purchased this brand over other brands is because there's no added preservatives like MSG. I am sensitive to that type of flavor enhancer. I am glad that most Chinese restaurants don't use MSG anymore either. Where I'm from, you can't buy these anywhere locally. The only choices I have is Jack Link's, Oberto, Slim Jim, and store brands. I've tried all those, and I don't like them. I don't have a Costco nearby to save more money on these, so this place (Amazon.com) is a blessing in disguise. Bj's and Sam's Club DO NOT carry this brand, at least not anymore or in my neck of the woods. I love beef jerky and beef sticks, so I've been on a hunt to find the best kind at the best price. Amazon is the only place where you can have many choices and compare prices.

He couldn't stop talking about them through the meal. I think they were good, but I'm not sure they were the best thing I've ever tasted.

review/text: Great beans....the best texture hands down.  These are the only that seem to have a great taste & don't turn to mush if you leave them on the stove while dinner comes together.  The vegetarian flavor are my favorite, but I haven't disliked any I've tried.  The only surprise was that in our stores they carry the larger cans (29 oz) for about $1.75 a can....these were only $1.06 on subscribe & save (with free shipping!!), thought I was getting a killer deal, but I guess it is comparable since they are 16 oz. To be fair, it was listed that way....I just thought it was an error since I didn't ever see that size available.  Yet, I do enjoy not having to put away leftovers, so what I thought was disappointing turned into a blessing in disguise!  I will keep my subscription going....hope it stays in stock for Summer grilling!!

review/summary: These are good. Yum!
review/text: These are tied with the b&m baked beans with extra brown sugar as far as flavor & everything is concerned, I think. They taste very good & are not too soupy. The bean to liquid ratio is very good. I like these. Yum!

review/summary: Tastes better in coffee than sugar
review/text: We LOVE this product.  My husband and I both use this in our coffee every day and love it.  There is no yucky artificial sweetener taste and it is good for your teeth.  Stevia tasted so bad in coffee, so we were hesitant to buy anything else for a while, but I am so happy we tried this.  I think we have used ideal packets for about a year now and have gone through many boxes.<br /><br />I'm happy to find it here, but the 700 ct package was a much better deal.  I hope they start carrying it again.

review/summary: best tasting sweetener!
review/text: I love this stuff! when I use xylitol alone I have to use a lot more to be sweet enough. I hate the taste of stevia and don't want to use too much splenda so this is the perfect option!  Doesn't affect the taste of tea or coffee for me like other sweeteners do. Not available to me locally so I appreciate the savings for buying multiples on amazon. I keep one in the car so its always with me. I even use it in my plain yogurt...turns a tart healthy treat into a pleasant one!<br />(the bags are an even better value)
