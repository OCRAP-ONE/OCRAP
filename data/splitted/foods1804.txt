review/summary: Truly tasty!!!
review/text: I just received these today.  I immediately opened one of the packages to give it a try.  I am impressed with just how flavorful these freeze-dried fruits are.  They have a satisfying crunch, like a chip, but so much better for you than potato chips.  I had ordered these to send in soldier care packages, which I still intend to do, but I'm ordering several more boxes for personal use.  These will be great to add to my work lunch everyday, instead of those single-serving size potato chips.  You get 2 boxes of 12 packages with this product.

review/summary: Unbelievably delicious freeze dried apples
review/text: I usually don't care for freeze dried fruit, but these are in a class by themselves.  They are cored and PEALED, and melt in your mouth delicious.  The same company makes the same product in separately decorated bags.  Mickey Mouse Clubhouse for Kids and Crisps for adults.  They are the exact same product, so if one is unavailable, you can purchase the other.  My favorite is Apple.  If you do purchase these, buy them through Amazon, as they sell them cheaper than the grocery store. These are really yummy and good for you too.  I am a grandmother, and this wonderful treat was introduced to me by my grand daughter.

review/summary: Best Snack EVER!
review/text: We got these [...] for $7 a box which was a great price!  My daughter is 1.5 yrs old and she LOVES them.  When we ask her what she wants for a snack she says "Ap-ple"  It is great, she gets a full serving of fruit and there is nothing in them that is bad for her. I think that the prices here seem high, however when you take into account that each bag has one whole apple, you would pay that amount for fresh produce and end up throwing out some of it anyways.  My daughter easily finishes an entire bag and what she doesn't we can save for the next day.  WE LOVE these apples!

review/text: I find I have grown somewhat addicted to having one of these crisps every morning with my coffee - they're not terribly filling because the crisps are relatively thin, but if like me you just need a little something to munch on in the morning these are the perfect pick.  Easy to grab and go, delicious, crunchy, all that you could look for in the morning.  Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.  I'm hoping they'll introduce more fruit flavors in the future.

review/summary: If you like good coffee, don't buy this
review/text: I like good coffee, and I can often get better coffee at a better price via the internet than I can at a local coffee shop.  I love Mocha Java Decaf, it is my favorite.  I was a little worried with this arrived, because it looks like it had been prepackaged and stored for a while (the bag was kind of beat up looking).  When I opened the bag, I was very dissapointed.  The coffee has very little aroma, and the ground is very large  (you need a fine ground to get the most flavor out of coffee).  Sure enough, I brewed a pot and it has very little flavor.  Now I have 5 lbs of this stuff that I have to drink :(.  I have stomach acid probems, so I was excited about getting this.  What I do is drink my coffee with milk and it seems to bring the acid down to an acceptable level.

review/summary: Amazing waffles
review/text: I bought this because I have recently switched over just about all of my food to organics.  I was so happy to see that I could fix something that seems like a treat and yet was pretty darned good for you without being loaded with chemicals.  I bought a waffle iron (the Presto Flipside--also 5 stars!)just for this batter.  It works great in the iron and tastes amazing in the mouth!  My family loves getting a special belgian waffle breakfast with berries on top every once in a while just to switch it up.  You can make extra and freeze them then heat them in your oven on the rack again in about 12 minutes.  I love it when DELICIOUS and CONVENIENT are combined with HEALTHY!  I haven't even tried it for pancakes yet, but I'm sure it's just as wonderful.

I just follow the simple batter recipe, included in the packaging.<br />I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TYBWIG">Presto 3510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker</a>.  I also like to add organic, cage free eggs and almond milk- when making batter.  With grams of fiber (28% DV) and protein per serving, the nutritional value of this mix is very high.  There is no saturated fat, trans fat, or cholesterol in this mix- before adding the eggs and milk.  I added a pic of the nutritional information.  The price is low, but the quality is very high.  In order to maintain the most potential freshness, I store my unopened bags in a freezer and the open bag in the fridge.

review/summary: Natural, nutritious but grainy
review/text: I agree with the negative review that this mix produces very grainy waffles when made as instructed.  I don't mind it that much.  In fact, I chew very slowly and keep it in my mouth to allow the flavor to fully hit my taste buds with minimal syrup.  My husband, who like most people, prefers smooth texture, does not like it even when paired with syrup.  He does like it better when pairing the waffle with a much stronger sweetener - buckwheat honey, which also gives the end product a nutty flavor.  My son, who is 7, does not like it, either, because of the visible dark grains in the waffle - he thinks it's "dirty".  My 4-year-old daughter does not seem to mind it when paired with syrup.<br /><br />That said, this is an honest product with all natural ingredients and definitely not one of those food-like products with smooth texture to lure you but are bad for your health in the long run.  This is how waffles were supposed to come out 100 years ago when steel mills were not around and people were eating stone ground grains and living a much healthier life style.  You can't beat 7g fiber per serving!<br /><br />I recently learned that with whole grain products, egg whites can tone down the grainy texture compared to whole eggs.  That's what I will try when the next shipment arrives.  Another thing I will try is to put a pack of Truvia in the batter to sweeten it up a bit.<br /><br />The shipping was quick.  The product arrived intact and as described.  Overall, I am happy with the product and the shopping experience.

review/summary: Very good pancake mix
review/text: I want to start off by saying I don't have pancakes that much, mainly because you tend to get those white floured dull, tasteless pancakes at restaurants that beg to be drowned in syrup, and still choke you to death. Over the last year, my wife has started cooking whole grain pancakes on some weekends, especially if we go on a bicycle ride that morning. I would also like to state up front that I have NEVER ever cooked a pancake myself. Really, never. Since my wife was out of town this weekend, and these High Fiber Pancake & Waffle mixes just came in the mail, I was itching to try them. I got out our grill iron, heated it up, mixed the 4 simple ingredients, poured out 1/2 the mix which is enough to make a large plate sized pancake, cooked as per instructions, and it turned out great. I cooked two with that amount of batter. (One large pancake is plenty for most people, I struggled to finish the last few bites, only because there was a lot of it.) I used minimal maple syrup, the real stuff from Canada, and cut up three Calimyrna Figs and placed on top that I also just bought here, and they were absolutely fantastic. They were as smooth and light as any pancake, and not heavy like some other whole grain cakes are. These were very good. I am glad the order comes with 4 bags, as I feel these might be used up in a couple of months. I have always liked Bob's Red Mill products, having bought many different seeds and mixes, but this is the first pancake mix I bought. Glad I did.

I used it to replace flour in an apple crisp recipe recently, and was really happy with the result.  For thinner pancakes, just add more water.  It's hard to review food products because everyones' tastes are different, but I really liked this product.  I eat a lot of high fiber foods to begin with, so if you don't, you may want to ease into them.

review/text: This is a wonderful pancake mix that our whole family loves!  It is moist and a little crumbly when drizzled with syrup. It is also great with chocolate chips in it, (a favorite of the kids) and applesauce on top. You can even try peanut butter for more protein. We love it!

review/summary: A Total Eclipse Of My Gum
review/text: It's minty. It's chewy. It's gum!<br /><br />It's an okay gum.  I bought it on sale here which made it more worthwhile.<br /><br />Otherwise, there are longer-lasting gums out there.  The pieces are "kind of small" - says the co-worker who regularly takes (steals) two pieces at a time from me.<br /><br />I have since gone to a Xylitol-based gum that has no sugar, and no cancer-causing artificial sweeteners in it (that we know of, right?)  At least Eclipse's flavor lasts longer than the Xylitol gum.

review/text: I love Honey Bunches of Oats and have been a fan for years. Of all the varieties out there, I prefer this pecan version the best. It seems to be slightly less sugary tasting than the original, and more flavorful than the almond version. The pecans are delicious. Overall, this is a fantastic everyday cereal. Its light and flakey, yet satisfying so you don't feel hungry again in an hour. Easily my favorite cereal.

I discovered this preserve after being aquainted with the Dundee Three-Fruit Marmalade. It was just so good I had to try some of their other things.

review/text: I personally can't handle the strong iodine taste of seaweed but my children love it and really raved about this soup I ordered for them.  They say it isn't too salty and love the abundance of seaweed in it plus the flavors of soy sauce and ginger.  They will eat seaweed straight like it is candy so additional flavor isn't necessary for them but they say these flavors are a good addition.  It is easy and quick to prepare and makes about 4 generous servings.  They would eat it everyday if I could keep it stocked in the cupboard long enough!

review/summary: Truffles? Where???
review/text: The name is misleading as there are no truffles listed in the ingredients. However, there IS a hard chunk of porcini mushroom in the bottle. Perhaps my palate is not sophisticated enough, but I didn't detect anything special in the taste of this oil. In fact, there is a strange synthetic smell that may be coming from the plastic spout. I even refilled the bottle with EVOO and microwaved it in order to release the mushroom flavor, but nothing changed. I guess I'll spend the extra money for some REAL truffle oil.

I immediately drained the oil into the toilet and recycled all the remaining bottles.  Ohhhhh, I can not tell you how putrid this oil was.  I get sick to my stomach just remembering the taste.  Do NOT. I repeat, DO NOT buy this company's products....at least not the ones with oil in them.  What a waste of money and produce.

review/summary: Total Waste of $
review/text: I love truffle oil and have been using different brands for a few years now. Some are better than others but this stuff is a total rip-off. There was NO flavor of truffles at all. The front of the bottle says Porcini Mushrooms & Truffle Flavour Infused Oil but under ingredients it shows sunflower & olive oil, mushrooms, flavors. What kind of mushrooms? At least if it tasted like Porcini mushrooms I wouldn't be quite as annoyed- but nothing. I have bought the Roland white truffle oil as well as La Tourangelle black truffle oil in the past and liked both of those. Now, none of these oils is going to have a really intense flavor of truffles- they're all based on truffle flavor or extract- but they also don't cost $100 per portion as fresh truffles would and still polish off a dish! If Drogheria & Alimentari has any "T" extract whatsoever -it's of such a small amount it can't be tasted. It says they've been in business since 1880- WHERE I can't imagine Italian cooks putting up with this quality!

review/text: This makes a great waffle, but contrary to the above description you will need to add oil and eggs to the mix, rather than just water. This probably is not an issue for most people, but for someone temporarily without a kitchen or fridge (like us), it was a little disappointing.

review/summary: Delicious Delicious Waffles (just add oil, eggs, and water)
review/text: This waffle mix makes great waffles.  The waffles are best if you use the "add oil, eggs, and water" instructions and not just the "add water" instructions.  Hard to find in stores, but well worth buying here if you can't find it locally.

review/summary: Great waffle mix
review/text: Well - can't really compare to any others, since it's my first waffle mix, so far I like it... no issues at all.<br />It's easy to prepare and comes out consistently good with our Waring Pro waffle maker.<br /><br />This mix uses vegetable oil - but I found myself using melted butter instead.  It seems to create a little bit crunchier surface, which we like more.<br /><br />It came with 4 boxes, which I thought it'd last for very long time - but we've been cooking 2 waffles per week, and we are now down to last box within few months.<br />Even though I do like this mix, I'm thinking of trying out different one (golden malt) and see if I like that one better.

Smells just like the tacos I made with the saltier seasoning blends, ONLY BETTER--because there's no salt!  The first thing I used this with was eggs...it was great!

review/summary: This product may contain silicon dioxide
review/text: The label of this Taco Seasoning informs that this product may contain silicon dioxide. According to Wikipedia the chemical compound silicon dioxide, also known as silica (from the Latin silex), is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula SiO2. It has been known for its hardness since antiquity. Silica is most commonly found in nature as sand or quartz, as well as in the cell walls of diatoms. Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica dust in very small quantities (OSHA allows 0.1 mg/m3) over time can lead to silicosis, bronchitis, or cancer, as the dust becomes lodged in the lungs and continuously irritates them, reducing lung capacities.<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN.

review/summary: Not real snow peas, but still pretty good
review/text: For some reason I thought these were actual freeze dried snow peas so I was surprised when I opened the bag. They may contain real snow peas (as well as MSG) but they're actually a puffed snack formed in pea-pod shape *made from* dried peas. Different, pretty tasty, but not what I expected. I liked them enough to try them again so that's saying a lot. 3 stars instead of 4 because of the MSG.

review/summary: An Excellent Source of Supplementary Protein
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Soy Protein Powder is a low-cost, versatile source of protein.  It has negligible fat and no cholesterol, has a neutral taste and odor, and mixes well with the foods with which I have tried it.  I have been using it more or less daily for approximately 1 month.<br /><br />At breakfast I mix 2 tablespoons with 1-1/2 cups of milk, 1 tablespoon of nutritional yeast and 1 tablespoon of blackstrap molasses.  The mixture is highly nutritious and tastes surprisingly good.<br /><br />I also add 2-4 tablespoons of it to approximately 2 quarts of mixed fresh and frozen veggies that I steam for lunch most days.  The protein powder takes on the taste of the veggies.<br /><br />Down the road I anticipate that I will add it to beans and vegetarian chili to give additional protein to these foods also.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Soy Powder
review/text: I have been using different brands of soy shakes for 7 months now.  Started with Herbalife (expensive, no fiber and too much sugar, then used Wholefood's brand (not enough fiber and again too much sugar).  I then found this product which is just soy protein, nothing else.  Now it's easy to adjust the amount of protein ( 5 grams per tablespoon), fiber (I use benefiber powder), sugar (I add none but any non-nutritive sweetener would do), vitamins (I use a liquid multi [...]).  I blend it up with soy milk, some ice and fruit. Sometimes I add extracts from my baking cabinet to add variety.  Great product if you are trying to cut back on the sugar present in the "ready to mix" soy shakes and don't mind adding a few other ingredients to make it complete.

review/summary: Fantastic Vegan Protein
review/text: I've been taking this for a while.  I finished off my 4 pack of 28 ounces of Bob's Red Mill Soy Protein Powder and ordered a new batch just so I can take a bag with me on vacation.<br /><br />To me, there is no aftertaste involved with soy or this product.  That is coming from a vegan who loves tofu by the way.  I take this twice a day.  A scoop in the morning and a scoop at night.  I exercise regularly, am 5'9", 163lbs (target weight to go, 155), and don't use this as a meal replacement but as a dietary addition.<br /><br />In the morning, it's just a scoop, with a tablespoon of flax meal, and a teaspoon of sucralose.  At night, after my workouts, I take a scoop, tablespoon of flax meal, banana, strawberries, lemon juice, sucralose, ice....blend for one frickin awesome smoothie.<br /><br />Word of advice, don't try to mix soy protein powders with just a spoon.  You can pick up a mixer cup which has some type of aerator in it that mixes up the soy powder perfectly well and smooth, no lumps and no machines needed.  If you mix this with a fiber source like flax or psyllium, it adds a nice thickness or body to your shake.<br /><br />Natural, pure with no additives...it's the way to go.  Add whatever you like to it.  This is a protein powder and not a "replacement meal".  However, you can easily turn it into one if you know what you're doing. ;)

review/summary: Perfect For Vegetarians w/Protien Intake Issues
review/text: I'm in college with a college meal plan. There are not a whole lot of well balanced meals for vegetarians. I found that I was not getting enough protein, especially as I am an athlete. I got this powder and put it into almost everything and since, I've had no problem meeting my protein needs.It fills out meals like oatmeal, yogurt, and cereal really well. It clumps a bit but since it takes on the taste of whatever you put it in, that's not much of an issue.<br /><br />Since it's also just straight protein, you don't have to worry about excess carbs, fat, or cholesterol that most other protein powders have.

review/text: I love this protein powder. In the past, I've found the taste of whey protein disagreeable, even in a protein shake with chocolate, banana, and peanut butter (you'd think that all those yummy ingredients would mask the taste). This powder mixes very well, has very little taste, and is a great thickening agent. I've added the powder to yogurt, oatmeal, and pancake batter. I just mixed 4 oz. of almond milk with 4 Tbsp. of the powder, half a banana, and a few blueberries and ate the mixture as a refreshing pudding. Delicious!!

review/summary: The best protein powder
review/text: This protein powder has no additives like some other powders.  It's just the powdered soy and nothing else.  It is also very economical.  I use it in fruit smoothies and don't notice any disagreeable taste.  Being a soy product, it is more environmentally- and animal-friendly than whey-based  protein powders, which rely on the dairy industry as a source.  I've been using it for over a year now; as an "almost vegetarian" and a runner, it has been a great help in allowing me to have a high protein diet.<br /><br />Update February 26, 2011:  Since writing this review I've read that soybean farming is causing quite a bit of the deforestation in the Amazon rain forest.  Thus, I wonder if soybeans are really eco-friendly.  Then again, maybe there's no eco-friendly food production, when we're talking about feeding 7 billion people.

review/summary: Wonderful soy protein and gluten free
review/text: I have used Bob's Mill for gluten free of the many varied items they carry.  They are certified and have a special mill for gluten free.  The soy protein is what I use daily with my Silk chocolate soy milk. I am a lover of soy (and chocolate) in many forms.  Bob's protein soy powder does need the blender (as pointed out in another review).  It is excellent quality.  I usually add my Silk chocolate milk, then my Nativa cacao chocolate, maca, flax seeds, and  some hemp protein as my average load of goodies for my mid morning shake.  I love Bob's Mill.  I can depend on them for safe gluten free.  This particular product I love as it brings my blood sugar up, I feel great with it, it is satisfying and filling.  I would suggest when using it that you always use the blender and always put something else with it, even if it is just a banana. It is very bland by itself.  It is a wonderful way to start the day even if your first meal is at 10:00 am with a shake then you will feel great the balance of the day.

review/text: I thought I would like the taste of Soy protein as I have eaten a lot of soy protein bars. After having tasted this vs whey protein, the whey protein tasts much better. There are 5grams of protein in one tablespoonful of this product, and it is hard to mask the taste of it, even with flavor drops, and splenda. I have found other products to give me 20grams of protein in one of their scoops, which the flavor can be masked a lot better.
