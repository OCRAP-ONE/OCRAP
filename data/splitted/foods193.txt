review/summary: 8 month Shih Tzu loves VENISON!!!
review/text: I guess my little pup went through what can be typical for the Shih Tzu breed to be a finicky eater.  He began walking away from his water moistened dry food: Blue Buffalo puppy, Nutro, Merrick (all of the same flavors).  I got this as my cousin had sent me some venison jerky she makes for her Yorkie's and they love it.  I put half the serving size bowl of this down for my little Weston and he lapped it up, looking up at me lovingly for more.  I gave him the rest of the serving size and he galloped away with more energy (even MORE than he normally showed) and played hard, napped and his eliminations were smaller and neater to clean up.  It seems that he is getting more nourished and retaining the nutrients he needs.  His coat is even more soft and supple.  This is a great product to take on trips without any mess or extra bowls, etc to pack.  Thanks, ZiwiPeak!!!!

review/summary: Good supplement for raw diet
review/text: I originally purchased this product to serve as my dog's main food since he is allergy-prone with skin issues and a survivor of mast-cell tumor disease.The vet had recommended other "veterinary prescription" kibble(potato/ rabbit) which seemed to really slow down our dog's healing process and worse, seemed to be doing more harm than good .  After giving up on vet reco 6 months later, we started experimenting with a number of 'healthy' and 'raw' alternatives, I landed on this just before going 100% raw. Though I have since gone 100% raw and eliminated all grain and processed food from our dog's main diet (with vast noticeable improvements in his health), I still use this food as one of his acceptable 'treats' and when I'm behind in making his raw meals. The texture is the consistency of beef jerky and the pieces are cut pretty small (think holding a small strip between your thumb and index finger about half the size of a fortune cookie paper...  It would be great for training since they are small pieces to feed frequently and more moist than dry kibble. It may be pricey to use as a main food , but it was great quality and seemed to be trustworthy ingredient sources. He likes the taste a lot too... but I can't vouch for that part.

review/text: My yorkies absolutely love this food.  Originally, I purchased this product because it was free of ingredients that would cause allergies.  Subsequently, I have learned that my dogs do not have food allergies but I kept them on ZiwiPeak because of its high quality content and delicious taste.  It is very expensive but I believe my yorkies are more than worth it.  I highly recommended this product to any dog owner who wants the best food for their pet.

review/text: I am a fan of Izze sodas. I don't and never have drank any other sodas.<br /><br />They have natural fruit juice in them and carbonated water, that's it.<br /><br />Considering all the artificial flavors, colors, preservatives and other chemicals, this soda is nearly in a class by themself.<br /><br />I am glad other companies are also switching to more natural ingredients.<br /><br />Especially for children and their health. Children will always love sweet soda and this one is the most harmless one to keep for them. It is the only soda I keep at home.<br /><br />I have tried all the flavors, this one is delicious and not overly sweet.<br /><br />I love this company and their sodas.Highly recommended.

review/summary: A great healthy alternative to soda pop...
review/text: My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon!  They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.

I also love to grab a handfull to snack on, it is so yummy and wholesome tasting and I have no guilt since I know it's good for me.

review/summary: Too bad...
review/text: I've always enjoyed Bakery on Main gluten-free cereals, and was excited to find this product because it is more like "real" granola and healthier than many of the alternatives.  However, my bag is largely over-cooked and a bit burnt tasting.  I also don't find the granola to have much flavor more generally.  The berries taste, well, fake because they are freeze-dried (at least the strawberries are, and those are the only berries I taste), rather than simply dried like the fruit they use in their other products.<br /><br />Overall, if they put some work into this product I'd be happy to try it again, but if it remains this way, I'm unlikely to try another batch.

Nowhere on the amazon product page does it tell you where these treats are made, so I searched for the Smokehouse website which claimed that ONLY some of their CHICKEN treats contained chicken from China, but all other products are made in the USA. So, I felt safe in purchasing these duck/sweet potato treats. After opening a bag, and giving them to my dog did I glance at the product origin. Needless to say my dog likes them very much, but I was NOT happy to find PRODUCT OF CHINA on the bag.<br /><br />Boo hiss to amazon for not putting the product origin on the product page, and to Smokehouse for misleading consumers on their product information website. Why do they do this, because there are customers just like me that care where the product originates. Many of you may not be concerned about this, but I am, and I think it's very misleading not to provide accurate, and complete information about the product when purchasing from an internet store. At least the product doesn't smell like plastic like the Dingo products.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing these again. My dog seemed to like them, but she won't be getting anymore of them. I took a star off due to the lack of complete information from amazon, and misleading information from Smokehouse.<br /><br />UPDATE: Big thumbs up to amazon for great customer service. When I called to return this item they were very helpful in processing a refund, and because it is considered a grocery item I didn't even have to return the items. I had also purchased the Smokehouse duck chips, but they too are made in China. I suggested the addition of the country of origin to both product pages. Just another reason why I don't hesitate to purchase from amazon. They truly have great customer service....rare these days.

review/text: As others have noted, these treats are made in China as clearly stated on the bag. I didn't like that, but the news gets worse.<br /><br />On the back of the bag is a statement: "Not for human consumption. Wash hands with soap and water after handling."<br /><br />If I have to wash my hands after handling these things, I'm sure as hell not going to feed them to my Yorkies!<br /><br />As expected, Amazon graciously accepted a return.

Please don't trust the health of your pets to Chinese-made treats.  I have personally lost a beloved pet.  I didn't know about the FDA warning.  Educate yourself before purchasing these.

review/summary: MADE IN CHINA!!!!
review/text: I've been trying to find treats that have no sugar, are low in fat and made in USA for my diabetic yorkie-poo. Thought I'd found them. Search Amazon with made in USA dog treats and see this product appear on the list. Go to Smokehouse's website and red that only SOME of their CHICKEN products have product of China on the label. So by omission I think, OK it's duck, NOT chicken so it's made in USA. I order them. My dog loves them. I come back to Amazon to buy more and notice something I missed the first time: someone has written a review saying they're made in China. I check my package and sure enough, it days product of china. I don't know who to be more angry with: Amazon for listing it as USA when I search. Smokehouse for misleading me on their website, or ME for not reading the label after it got here.

review/summary: My dogs love these.
review/text: My dogs loved these treats.  They are bigger than what I had originally expected.  I thought they were a tiny strips of duck meat wrapped around a sweet potato fry, which in a sense they are.  They are actually a whole breast or at least half of one wrapped around a sweet potato fry.  Much more meat than I expected.  These take my dogs a few minutes to gobble up instead of just a few seconds with other treats.<br /><br />I like the fact that the ingredients only state duck meat and sweet potato, no harsh preservatives you tend to find in most treats, especially ones that come from China.<br /><br />The cost compared to the amount you get is well worth the price I paid.  My dogs go through about 2 of these each a day which a bag will last me about a week or so.  I definitely plan on buying more of these, its to bad they don't have the automatic delivery for these as they do for coffee because I would definitely sign up.<br /><br />I highly recommend these treats.

review/summary: are these made in USA?
review/text: I typed "Made in USA" healthy dog treats in search box. These treats were first in list.  I understand they are Made in China!  Is this true?  if it is,<br />this is completely false advertising.<br /><br />  I add this comment a few months later, I may have been a bit harsh with my comment about this product. I was frustrated with not being able to find quality American made dog food or treats. My dog had become sick by eating a dog treat (not this one) that was made in China. I did not nor did my dog try this product named and should not have left a review. That is what this site is for, but that said... I do believe the company is misleading consumers with their advertising. What happened to ethics in this country? It seems there are ways to get around having to tell the truth. It has become a way of life and is pervasive in all areas of society- even in dog treat advertising.<br /><br />  In the meantime,  I have found dog treats that are wholesome, fresh and even made in the USA.  You just have to look around but there are some good new products out there.

review/summary: Dog's Favorite Treat
review/text: My dog loves sweet potatoes.  She has sweet potato dog food and her hands down favorite treats ever are duck and sweet potatoes with a close second and third being salmon and sweet potatoes and frozen blueberries.  The breeder encouraged both as well as other great natural foods for my sweetheart of a dog.<br /><br />I am glad that Amazon carries these treats because, as with the Salmon and Sweet Potato treats, I could not remember where I'd bought them.  I did eventually find out, but the vendor was sold out of the Salmon, and, as luck would have it, the Duck and Salmon are cheaper on Amazon!  That's one reason I love shopping on Amazon.  Great prices along with free delivery if the item is an Amazon Prime item.  Both products are!  The Smokehouse Natural Duck and Sweet Potato Dog Treats come in a resealable bag and would last forever if my dog didn't love them so much.  She got into an open bag that my nephew left out one day, only about a 1/4 of the bag was left, and ate all the rest!  :-)  No need for dinner!<br /><br />These treats are great for training purposes and even for just a "good dog!" moment.  I would definitely recommend them.

But it say's processed in US.  Not sure if that means the quality meats the FDA or not..  so far so good- I have mixed feelings about this product.  I'll probably order it again..simply because there are have been no cases involving duck.

review/summary: Before and After We Got Our Paws  on the "Duckies"
review/text: Everyone is giving these such a great review. I just ordered my first bag for my Scottie to replace the brand that he normally goes crazy over that is stopping making his "duckies". We were up in arms when we got the email from the company that they would not have duck and yam treats anymore.  Charlie has a lot of allergies and duck and sweet potato is one of the few things that the vet said that he could have as a treat (along with his allergy dog food, lamb, rice, and hamburger) We lucked upon these duck and sweet potatoes in an Internet search. I hope they are as good as all the reviews say. Because Charlie will be very disappointed if his "duckies" were not coming after he did his business outside, that is his reward. Charlie is waiting in for his new "duckies" to come, and try them out. We have tried chicken and yam but he does not like them as much as his "duckies.". We will keep you up to date on the progress on the new "duckies" they should be here in a day or two. Cross your fingers that they pass the muster.<br /><br />Just an update; after two weeks of switching duck and yam treats from a different company, Charlie has become a mad man for these duck and sweet potatoes. The other company is discontinuing their duck and yam, so on a whim and all these great reviews we tried this brand, now if you our down one of the old and one of these on the floor he gobbles down this one and just leaves the old kind. What a great find!  Charlie loves his "duckie" which he gets after doing his business outside. He now comes in and sits infront of his treat jar and waits. He eats the duck part first then the sweet potato which shocks me, I can believe he eats a veggie. But he loves them, I can not give a higher review then I am now, if there were a way to give 10 stars these would get 11! Great for dogs with allergies too, no filler just all natural products which makes me feel good about giving them to Charlie!  So worth the price, you only give your doggie 1-3 a day and there are a lot in a pack and it is resealable which keeps them fresh.  And they have the "rawhide-ish" duck which is good for their teeth and the sweet potato for fiber. I am kind of lucky that the old brand has stopped making theirs because I found these, and no need to run to Petsmart once a week to buy a new bag these seem to last forever, and are a good size for a treat, bigger than a milk bone and smaller than a greenie. Greenies used to be Charlie's favorite now he turns his nose up at them and wants his "ducky"  I can't say enough good things about them!<br /><br />I am buying three more bags today just so I have a stock up of them because I never want to run out!

review/text: I should have looked closer at the description.  I am quite disappointed that a product that is called "Eating Right" would contain HFCS (high fructose corn syrup).  The taste isn't all that great either.

review/summary: Awesome Natural Food
review/text: I've been using this food for my cat ever since he had some UT issues and the vet recommended we switch to a wet food. I looked for a food where the primary ingredients were actually meat or fish. All of Merrick's flavors have meat or fish or poultry (depending on flavor) as the primary ingredient. My cat loves them all! I feed him a half can mixed with water at night and in the morning. His coat is amazing; I noticed a huge improvement in his coat and energy level when I started using this over the cheap-o dry food.

review/summary: Great ingredient list, poor real-life performance with my taste-test panel
review/text: I bought a case of Merrick Surf & Turf with high hopes for my clutter of nine cats.  Alas, the hype didn't live up to the reality.  The product is essentially a wasted purchase, as virtually none of the cats will touch the stuff.  I'll be donating the rest of the case to my local animal shelter for their pet food pantry.<br /><br />The ingredient list drew me to the product, being grain-free, and offering a nice mix of meat and seafood, plus lots of complex carbohydrates for filler.  Upon opening the can, it was clear that the beef and beef fat content was pretty high, with little seafood scent detectable.  It came out of the can in big globs that were sticky to try to mush down for my gang.  Have tried two feedings for my gang with this stuff, and they just can't be convinced that it's both tasty and good for them.<br /><br />I realize that different cats have different sets of taste buds and some cats will eat anything, but when none of my nine will touch the stuff, I can't recommend it to anyone with an even semi-finicky cat, as a number of my gang will eat most anything, and to find them turning up their noses at this somewhat pricey stuff is kinda eye-popping.  If you're cat is very picky, but you know s/he likes beef, then this flavor will probably appeal to him/her, but otherwise, I wouldn't spend your hard-earned moolah on this stuff.  Save your money and your frustration.<br /><br />I give it two stars simply because of its relatively healthy ingredient list; I'd otherwise give it only one star.

review/text: My cats adore this cat food with ingredients like beef, beef broth, lobster and fresh Yukon Gold potatoes, it's easy to understand why.<br /><br />In addition to those mouth watering ingredients is the fact that there are no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.<br /><br />It is more costly than regular "supermarket" type canned cat food, but the benefits are undeniable. Made right here in The US, I highly recommend this superior canned cat food.<br /><br />Your companions will thank you for it !

review/summary: High quality cat food
review/text: I was originally turned on to this brand because of the ingredient list in the wet foods -- no more by-products! -- and vey few (if any) grains, depending on the flavor. One of my two cats will eat anything but the other is the pickiest eater and after MANY trial runs with other foods settled on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N62EAK">Merrick New England Boil Cat Food 5.5 oz (24 Count Case)</a> for whatever reason. What amazed me is after all that trial and error finding a food for the picky guy, one day he just started eating the surf & turf flavor I bought for the indiscriminate one. Now that he's tasted surf & turf he prefers it over everything else -- they both do. Exceptional product. Their coats look phenomenal and we haven't had an issue with UT issues since moving to Merrick wet food. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last time I ordered with White Dog Bone, the cans came a little crumpled -- nothing so bad that it had to be returned, but it wasn't preferable.

review/summary: damaged goods
review/text: I ordered a case of Merrick wet cat food, actually I ordered two different flavors, and the case of Surf and Turf was badly damaged before it was sent.<br />Almost every can was dented, one was missing from the case , one was so dented it had spilled the contents. The cans would not have been for sale on the shelf. The other case was fine and this was not the fault of Amazons's packaging, the case was full of damaged cans to begin with. Whoever put this order together should have caught this. Smelly, too! I am afraid to give my pets most the cans as they are so dented as to be almost broken open.<br />Expensive and disappointing as I live a long way from any pet store that carrys Merrick.

Not being a big berry fan the flavor on the lemon-lime suits me great.<br /><br />I have tried other products, most based on B-12 supplements, and this is a totally different product. The B-12 shots do NOTHING for me.

review/summary: Absolutely the best no salt added chicken soup EVER!
review/text: Whether you are on a sodium restricted diet, or would just like to eat healthier.  I highly recommend this product.  It is my favorite soup in the Health Valley line and my favorite soup from a can.  It is so comforting and delicious when I have a headache, when I am sick, when I am sad, when I don't have time to cook, anytime really.  It is great to know that Health Valley Chicken Noodle Soup is sitting there in my cupboard waiting for me with all organic and healthful ingredients.  I find the flavor to be just like homemade.  I have tried other no salt added chicken noodle soups such as Trader Joe's and Campbell's for sodium restricted diets and not only are they smaller cans with higher sodium, they taste like liquid cardboard to me.  I had just about given up on being able to ever eat chicken noodle soup out of a can until I found Health Valley's variety.  I believe the other two best-tasting no salt added soups are Health Valley's No Salt Added Tomato, and No Salt Added Potato Leek.  I find those varieties to be better than there sodium containing counterparts.  The No Salt Added Vegetable and Black Bean soups are OK.  If you like chili, you should also try Health Valley's No Salt Added Vegetarian Chili.  To sum up, this can of Chicken Noodle Soup is my still my favorite canned chicken noodle soup, even after eating it regularly for over a year.  This soup just makes me happy! :)

review/summary: A LITTLE SKIMPY ON CONTENT.  OTHERWISE, LOVE IT!!!
review/text: I'm ALWAYS looking for great deals on low or no sodium organic food. This is very good if you like very basic, healthy, no frills, organic food. Only real complaint is that it's a little skimpy and you definately need to make a salad on the side to get "filled up".  Also, when you buy in bulk like this you save close to a dollar a can compared to what my local supermarket charges for these.  It's not worth the price that way.  It's just barely worth it to me at the usual price (in bulk) that Amazon sells it for. Health Valley should lower the price just a bit or add more noodles and vegetables in the can.  I'm pleased enough overall, though,  and am going to continue to buy for now.  Peace and all good things, L.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, but didn't seem to enjoy it as much as their previous brand. After reading the ingredients of Beneful, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. I try to avoid corn in all pet foods, and as a main ingredients is just ridiculous. Dogs are meant to eat real meat, they are carnivores. Basically dogs cannot fully digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging when they are not present in the food; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.
