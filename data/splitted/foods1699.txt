review/summary: Delicious and great as gift for the person on the go!
review/text: Bought this originally for my Grandson in the military as a snack for his backpack but ordered it too late for him to take with him.  So I tried one of them intending to send him the rest in his next box but ended up eating them all.  But I did order another box and had them sent directly to him and did the subscribe and save so he will receive them regularly.  Really delicious and the cheese was really great too.

review/summary: Leaking Jars
review/text: Not sure how it tastes but it sure didn't smell good.  The shipment arrived very late.  I would have maybe been able to deal if that was the extent of the problem but as far as I can tell, all three jars were leaking after I opened the box.  Salsa all over the place is not my idea of fun!  I find this interesting since I'm not the first person to complain about this.  No expiration codes on jars have me wondering if it's still fresh even if they weren't leaking.  Does quality control exist at Arriba?  I do not recommend this product until these issues are resolved!

review/text: Pleased to finally locate a coconut extract at a reasonable price, BUT very disappointed in its flavor. We tried it three times; all three times we were completely dissatisfied with both the fragrance (Where was the expected wonderful aroma of coconuts!)and the taste (It tasted very artificial, not coconutty. Husband called it "plastic" tasting.)We poured the remaining extract down the drain, then tossed the bottle in the recycle bin. Thanks, but NO thanks!

review/summary: Exceptional tea!
review/text: I love black currant, so I was hesitant to order the tea due to its low ratings, but decided to do it anyway. In short: this tea is exceptional! I'm left to wonder whether previous reviewers know what black currant is or have ever tasted the berry. If not, then I can imagine a dislike as black currant has quite a different and specific taste. If yes, I can only guess you'll love this tea as the taste is very authentic. I'm very impressed by Lipton as before Superfruit editions I didn't give Lipton another glance. This tea is surprising and unique. It has a mild black currant taste (it's a green tea after all) and subtle vanilla smell, and it's very comforting. It's my favorite tea out of all Superfruit editions!

review/text: This will be a quick review, the Acai Blueberry is better than this but the Black Current Vanilla still tastes pretty good. The major complaint and this is weird but in my opinion the fragrance the tea gives off smells like cat pee in a litter box. I know its bizarre but there's something odd in the tea that stinks like cat urine. Stick with the Acai Blueberry you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: delicate and refreshing as iced tea!
review/text: Let me start by telling you how much I hate tea.  Yes, I am a coffee drinker, or should I say I was untill I had this one.  My mother in law is an avid ice tea drinker and she always tries new teas.  One day she made this one and I was sold.  I immediatelly looked for it in stores like Fred Myer, Target and Winco and nothing and then I got it here.  Subscribed and saved to make sure I never run short in supplies.  I always wanted to drink green tea for its benefits but never liked the biter taste.  The black current and vanilla add a very subtle and delicate flavor that make you want more and more.  Now I drink at least 3-4 glasses a day and still cannot get enough.  I LOVE LOVE this tea!

I then attempted to drink it, and although my mouth was telling me yes my nose said "What the hell is wrong with you?" I still have the box, so I plan on sniffing it until it no longer gives me a gag reflex so I can give a more accurate review on the taste.

review/text: I ordered this when the price was really low, and I figured I'd give it a shot, despite the reviews that claimed it smelled like cat urine.<br />I'm glad I gave it a chance!  Now I have 6 boxes of this tea that has become one of my favorites!<br />Most of the complaints are about the smell, but honestly that's what I like about it most.  I always liked the smell of french vanilla coffee, but I never liked drinking the stuff.  The vanilla smell from this tea reminds me of that, and is pleasant to me.<br />The flavor is subtle and smooth.  It is easier on an empty stomach than some of the other green teas I've had (I didn't get the urge to throw up as I have had with other flavors).<br />I can see how it might not be for everyone, but I would give it a shot.  If nothing else, it's something different to try.

review/summary: A little weak...BUT
review/text: I found this tea at a superstore a few months ago and haven't been able to find it anywhere since.  Yes, it is a little on the subtle/weak side, but it suits my needs fine.  It definitely has a delicate flavor and doesn't slam you with the usual green tea punch.  I like this as a mellow hot cup (yes, I can taste the hint of vanilla), but I truly bought it to blend teas.  I love making a 32 oz. bottle of ice tea with two black tea bags and two green tea bags.  My go-to base tea has long been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UEKFS0">Twinings Tea Blackcurrant, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and I rotate other berry-ish green teas with it.  The only ones I have liked and found worth it are from Liptons superfruit green tea series.  Some of the other green teas I use have a strong flavor that can taste a little tart.  I don't use sugar in my tea, so the strength of this tea is perfect for me!  Plus it is a steal of a deal!  Yay, thank you Amazon!

review/text: I bought this tea on a subscribe/save deal and received the 6 boxes at less than $1.00 a box.  The tea is rainforest certified so I appreciate the effort to help farmers.  That said, the tea has no actual superfruit in it and doesn't taste very strongly of the natural flavors that were added to make it taste like Black Currant and Vanilla.  For a daily dose of green tea 2 times a day which is the routine I use, it is fine for drinking but I don't look forward to tasting it each time I pull it out.

review/summary: Typical Lipton :/
review/text: I wanted to try this (GB special) since the price was right at under seven dollars.  However I am always disappointed at both the lack of strength (or weakness) of Lipton teas as well as the fact that since they are in paper wrappers, the essential oils dissipate before you can drink the tea.<br /><br />This Superfruit Black Currant & Vanilla tea was no different, and now I have 5 1/2 boxes to pawn off on some less discriminating green tea drinker.  I'm sticking with my Stash teas such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZRE">Stash Premium Green Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of 9 Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, or something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CK0VVI">Stash Tea Company Superfruits Sampler, 18-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>.  In my opinion it is worth paying a bit more per cup and getting a much higher quality tea.

The wealth of B vitamins that it contains will give you a noticeable lift within about 5 to 10 minutes. If you're at total burnout and exhaustion, it's only going to keep you going for about two to three hours at a shot, and I generally down the entire bottle at one sitting in those instances. It's been a lifesaver, and a lot healthier than coffee or so-called energy drinks, when you work-life is not so much in work-life-balance.

review/summary: GOT ME THROUGH FINALS!!
review/text: This was a fantastic deal. The Average price per bottle (including my free shipping option) came out to about $1.75; compared to $2.50 in stores. The shipping was fast; probably due in part to the Christmas season. And they have proven to be a much more effective tool over traditional coffee when it came to "crunch time" for finals! Oh, and no crash. However, with extreme use (as in my studying for finals example) there is a possibility of getting a headache; but I suppose that could also be attributed to only sleeping 3 hours a night =). All in all, it is reasonably priced, very effective, and a great alternative to coffee.

review/summary: It's ok, but after a few uses...
review/text: ...If you don't intake much caffeine, and use these once in a while they are great. However, if you are a coffee drinker, or consume large amounts of caffeine, you will lose the effect fast. I got a nice little "high" off the first couple and it helped A LOT with the day. But now they practically have no effect, and I rarely consumed caffeine. I would recommend for sparingly, but don't think this will help constantly, take it everyday and if it works, it's just in your head.

No jitters , no sugar crash, just a mild boost in energy. Still only using a half a bottle as that seems to work best for me. When this supply runs out, I definitely will order some more.

review/summary: Works Great
review/text: This product works great and as advertised.  However, I wouldn't recommend using these unless you plan to do some heavy exercising or is really tired.  It's much stronger than the Red Bull shots and the regular 5-hour Energies, but it'll definitely give you energy when you need it.<br /><br />Others say it doesn't give you a rapid heart-beat, but it did for me, and I had trouble sitting at my desk while at work, but I guess it's different for everybody.  In most cases a half-bottle shot of this was good enough for me, and I only use the whole bottle when I'm super tired.<br /><br />But as the commercial says, you can start by just drinking a half-bottle and then drink the rest if you feel you need more.  Personally, I would prefer the regular 5-Hour energies, as those worked really well for me, but this extra strength version will definitely give you the kick you need.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but just be careful with it, as with all products of this type, too much of it is not good for you.

review/summary: Delicious, just-right spiciness, and a comforting hot drink
review/text: I adore this stuff.<br /><br />The ingredients are simple, all it contains is ginger, sugar, and salt. Of course, if you are avoiding sugar or salt, you might want to reconsider or drink in moderation, otherwise, you will not be disappointed. (I could easily drink three cups of this a day, but because of the sugar and salt, I choose to limit it to one.)<br /><br />The "tea" itself looks a bit like light brown sugar, it pours out as dry crystals, you add hot water, and it dissolves quickly and evenly. It dissolves so quickly you can just heat your water to drinking heat, instead of "extra-hot-for-brewing-time" hot. It is slightly spicy, but if you are already familiar with ginger you know what to expect. It is not an uncomfortable spiciness, but a pleasant tingly wake-up of the taste buds warmth. Anyway, if you've read this far, stop reading. Just buy a box. You'll love it!<br /><br />Now, gotta go order a refill box, or three.

review/text: I went to the Asian market looking for ginger tea because I was getting sick. Ginger tea supposedly helps you when you are sick (fight infection, inflammation, etc). The Intra Instant ginger tea comes in convenient little packets. The taste isn't too strong and tastes good. The product is from Indonesia so you don't have to worry too much about tainted food. I would buy this product again. Also, the product has 90 calories per packet. However, fewer calories would be better.

review/summary: My Favorite Ginger Tea
review/text: I suffer from bouts of vertigo that cause extreme nausea.  I read that ginger can help with motion sickness and nausea and found this tea.  It has worked wonders!  It is pretty spicy and can help if you are congested.  I keep a pouch of it on me at all times.  I have tried it both hot and cold and it is good both ways.  It is pretty sweet, not sure about the sugar content but it might be too high for some.  It does have a heavy ginger flavor and it works great for me for controlling the nausea and vertigo.  It is in a powdered crystal form and dissolves easily into hot water. Don't add too much water though, or it gets really weak and doesn't taste as good.

As she got older, I noticed she quit eatting them.  She told me they were too difficult for her to open.<br /><br />Now that I am getting older and having problems with my hands, I am having a problem opening the top of the pudding too.  I wish you could make the product easier for older customers to open with different packaging.  I know that before too long I will no longer be able to open the pudding.<br /><br />I made the mistake of trying to cut a hole in the top a few days ago, and I cut my finger.  I am still wearing a bandaid...but the pudding was great!<br /><br />Barbara in Texas

review/summary: Made both my dogs vomit and eat less.
review/text: We switched to this food from Purina One because the ingredients are advertised to be of much higher quality, and we wanted to improve our dogs' diet. We made a smooth transition to this food by slowly mixing it in with their existing food, as vets recommend. Once the transition was complete, they were vomiting their meals several times per week, which they had never done before the switch. We continued to feed them this food for about a month to see if it changed, and they still have problems keeping it down. I often see them eating grass to induce vomiting as well, so I think its giving them a stomach ache. They also got to the point where they just didn't want to eat the food at all sometimes, which I've never seen them do. We switched to Newman's Own dog food now, and they're eating much better already.<br /><br />I wish I had done some research on this food before purchasing it. Type "Wellness dog food vomit" into Google, and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.

review/text: Wellness Super5Mix is a high quality dog food. Yes, it costs more than the junk you can buy in Wal-Mart, but as with most things in life, you get what you pay for.  Wellness keeps my beagle regular with no indigestion or diarrhea. I've tried switching to cheaper brands, but they leave him gassy, listless, and constipated. My dog isn't crazy about the taste. Of course, he'd prefer canned or, even better, table scraps. But he does eat the Wellness, and it keeps him healthy.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: A sub-par version of store bought Wellness
review/text: We've been buying this exact formula of Wellness for our Cocker Spaniel "Lucy" for over a year now.  We thought that it would be worth purchasing on Amazon since it was priced almost identically and it would be more convenient than going to Petsmart since it would be delivered to our front door.  We didn't receive the food for well over a week after we ordered it so we were forced to buy a small bag at the store until we received the food.  No big deal...we figured next time we'll just order it a couple of weeks in advance so that Lucy's food supply isn't as low and we have plenty until we get the next bag.  After feeding her two meals of the bag we got from Amazon, Lucy started having violent diarrhea.  I'm familiar with the fact that changing foods can cause an upset stomach with dogs but this is the exact same food we have been feeding her for a very long time.....or so we thought.  We knew that the only thing that changed in Lucy's diet was the fact that we ordered the food from Amazon.  So we went and bought another small bag of the same stuff from Petsmart.  Much to our disappointment, there was an obvious difference in the appearance of the food.  The bag from Amazon had chunks that were misshaped, very porous and even smelled different.  Our conclusion was that Amazon received the reject bags at a discount and sold them as the same product.  We then stopped feeding Lucy the Amazon bag and switched her back to the store bought bag.  Immediately her bowls improved.  Although we were refunded for our purchase we had to jump through a few hoops that weren't worth the time we wasted to do so.  Please reconsider before you purchase this food.  Wellness is an Amazing product and we're proud to feed our little Lucy the best food that we possibly can but this is not up to the quality that Wellness is known for.  I'm going to post pics of both the Amazon bought food and the Store bought food so that you can see the difference.

review/summary: NOT a cure-all if that's what you're looking for
review/text: My dog has severe allergies as well as a sensitive stomach. After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble.  Well, let me say...I'm disappointed.  It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching.  The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my "stomach of steel" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.<br /><br />While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this. Could it be just my dog, sure. But all in all, if you're looking for a magic cure, sorry to say this isn't the one it's hyped to be.

I have to say, I am really disappointed with this dog food. Besides her not really liking it, her breathe smells bad, has very loose to diarrhea stools, and she has been licking her paws & shaking her head like her ears are bugging her ( which she never has done before and that is a sign of allergies). I noticed the chicken formula is back on the market and I will for sure be switching.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED
review/text: I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. But I just thought I'd try to give everyone a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

My two Labradors actually turn their heads away from the kibbles. How do you return the opened bag with loose kibbles ? So I tried to feed the kibbles to the dogs and they were having diarrhea or very soft stool and I'm not happy with that type of situation at all. The Wellness dog food is good but something about shipping makes me wonder.... Anyway I went to the local pet store got the same kibbles and my babies are happy ever after.

review/summary: Good Going In, Bad Coming Out
review/text: After losing a dog at the age of 9, we looked into providing our pets with a better quality dog food just in case the Purina Pro Plan they had been eating was even partially responsible for her early death.<br /><br />The Wellness dry foods were one of the brands we tried. We took the effort to slowly introduce the food and gave it a good 4 months before finally giving up.<br /><br />Our dogs did not seem to really like this food. I am not sure if it was the taste or if it was the terrible gas or diarrhea it gave them. It would sit in their bowl for hours before they finally gave in and finished it.<br /><br />After much thought we decided that we would rather our dogs enjoy their food and not suffer from daily diarrhea than force them to eat this food, even if it might extend their life a little.<br /><br />We settled on Science Diet brand. They gobble it up at every meal and have returned to normal bowel movements. I realize the ingredients are not as good as Wellness brand, but I feel better about their quality of life.

I don't know what spices they put in this, but kudos (kudogs?) to the chefs at Wellness.  They have provided a product that is good enough to double as munchies at my next party.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention how full and shiny my hair looks.  Keep doing what you're doing Wellness!

review/text: Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference!

review/text: I have three dogs, a minpin, a lab, and an aussie pup. My min-pin got sick recently. It was pancreatitis and kidney problems. His liver was a mess too. After he got out of the vet hospital (800 bucks later) they wanted him to eat a prescription food that they sold. He hated it. Would NOT eat it.<br /><br />I got the Wellness through a reccomendation and it has been a life-saver. My minpin is healthy now. His liver is fine, as are his kidneys and pancreas. He looks years younger with his shiny coat. My lab and my pup are looking fabulous as well.<br /><br />Whats ironic is that I WAS feeding a supermarket wet food and it was costing me 90 bucks a month to feed these guys. Now, it's cheaper, they are healthier and they LOVE it. I have never seen dogs freak over dry food like they do over this.<br /><br />If you can afford it, I highly recommend this product. It saves you money in the long run and makes your pets happy and healthy.

No more shedding or flaking and NO RUDE ODOROUS GAS problem. Highly recommend.

review/summary: ALLERGIES DEALT WITH!!!
review/text: My black German Shepherd has allergies to corn & wheat, which seems to be the primary ingredients in most dog foods.  We suffered with her for years, cooking chicken, hamburger, rice to keep her healthy until we found the WELLNESS products.  They have turned her into a beautiful, not scratching or licking youthful dog.  We are also now feeding our lab and corgi the same foods with similar results.  Thank You Wellness!  (Incidentally the foods sold by the vet as hypo-allergenic had either corn syrup &/or wheat germ in it.  We read all labels now, all the way thru the fine print!)  Another added benefit for the larger dogs is the incorporation of glucosamine & chondroitin into it, saving additional vet bills.

review/summary: They Really Mean Improved!
review/text: Wellness has taken an already great product and improved it even further. I initially tried introducing Wellness to my black lab in 2003 and found her to be intollerant of the Lamb formula. So i put her on another food all the while hoping the Wellness formula would change a tad so i could try her on it again. I transitioned her onto the new Wellness about two weeks ago and she is doing fantastic!! She has a lot of food allergies and sensativities, but we have found the new and improved Wellness to work wonderfully for her. The high quality ingredients really do make a world of a difference - especially for a working dog!

review/summary: The best food!
review/text: I was concerned about the effect "regular" dog food was having on our dogs. We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  "high-end" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!

review/summary: GOOD FOOD!
review/text: I have used this product for five years now for both of my shelties. They like the taste, there coats are much smoother and it has lessened the number of seizures my female gets and there severity. I will continue to use the fish and sweet potato food regardless of price.<br />Update:<br />On Thanksgiving day of 2010 my female sheltie passed away. This broke my heart, she was my best buddy. I can't help but think her Whitefish and Sweet Potato food had something to do with giving her a very long healthy life. She lived to be 17, and was playful up to the end. My vet agrees that this food and good exercise was instrumental in extending both my shelties lives. I now have a new sheltie puppy and a rescued 6yr old sheltie female. Needless to say they are both on Wellness brand Whitefish and Sweet Potato food. There snacks have always been Blue Dog Bakery products supplemented with fresh baby carrots.

review/summary: My dog will only eat this brand
review/text: My pug had stomach problems and I have tried every food out there.  The only thing that worked was Science diet until I found this one.  Its more natural and my dog does enjoy eating it more and have not had any problems since I switched a couple of years ago.  Love this brand.

review/summary: Happy Dog!
review/text: We recently started giving our dog this food and he is thrilled. Our dog has always liked eating, but now he seems especially happy. Even more, our dog seems to have an sensitive tummy and he's had no tummy problems since switching to this food.
