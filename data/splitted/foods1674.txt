review/summary: delicious
review/text: This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it "worked" because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus.

review/text: I have a friend who is a dandelion warrior.  Everytime she see's one, she pounces and that plant is history.  As a little joke, I ordered and sent her the tea.  To my surprise, she reported that she actually liked it, mentioning it had a rather nice smooth flavor.  Although that has not stopped her from still being a dandelion ninja, I give it 5 start just knowing that if she liked it - it HAS to be good!

review/summary: Good night sleep
review/text: I purchased these tea bags in hope for a good night sleep. The first night I drank it, I slept great.  I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

review/text: I got this tea because it is supposed to help with PMS and supposedly helps "prepare" the uterus for conception. I figured it can't hurt, so why not? I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br /><br />As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.

review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.

review/text: I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/summary: Fenugreek Seed Tea
review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

review/summary: Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes
review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/summary: Red Clover Tea
review/text: I purchased this tea because it is recommended for helping women's PMS symptoms and menopause symptoms.  I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not.  I have purchased other teas of this brand.  I would recommend their teas.  I wasn't crazy about the taste of the red clover, but that is just my personal opinion.  It's a little bitter but bearable.  Add some sugar and you're good to go.

review/summary: Interesting taste
review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

Drinking Fenugreek tea, taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights' sleep (6 hour min.). Well, I am going to give it a shot. This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually. I wasn't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon. Seems they have everything!

review/text: I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

It's not as sweet and there's less chicken meat than Campbells, but the flavor is good, nice and chickeny, and the noodles, chicken, and veggies have texture.<br />The cans all arrived okay, no leaks, but every can is dented, two or more dents in the sides of each can, even the cans in the middle of the package! In other words, they were not dented during shipping, they were dented BEFORE being placed in the cardboard tray and wrapped with plastic. What's up with that?

review/text: My 8 month old son loves these. I keep one in my purse at all times. He is breastfeed and we make his other solid foods (cook, puree and freeze)--but this is what I use when we're out so that I don't have to worry about microwaving or his fresh food going bad from being out too long. He really likes this flavor and I'm happy because it includes three foods that I haven't been making for him. I'm trying to introduce him to all the fruits and vegetables that are OK for him to eat at this age, and I'm hoping that eating the spinach in this will make him less likely to reject it later... Only downside that I can think of is that these are rather watery. Not sure if that is solved if you move to the Stage 3 ones.

We still keep them on hand even after the baby food days are gone.

review/text: My 9 month old started eating this flavor at about 7 months old and loves it!  She isn't really a picky eater, but she likes some things more than others.  When its time for the spinach/mango/pear she takes one tastes then asks for more!  I've tasted it, its pretty good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the consistency is a bit watery and difficult to keep on the spoon when feeding the baby.  I'd love it if they just didn't puree it quite as much or didn't add quite so much water, then it would be perfect.

review/text: This flavor is great, I love the fact it has veggies and fruit together. I gave this flavor to my 6 month old baby and he loved it. If you have problem with this blend being to runny I solved it by using Boon spoon or Plum organics boon spoons for pouches which made it breeze to feed the baby.<br />My son loves all the other flavors he tried as well ( pear; pear & peas & broccoli; apples & cherry; banana & blueberries & beats ), he did not like sweet potato & apricot flavor, it was too tart and sour for him, but I contacted Happy Baby customer service and the next batch should have more sweet potato to help with the sour taste, but if you can buy just one pack and try it you might have a baby that likes it either way.<br />Most of all I love the packaging, it is perfect since we travel a lot and it is so much lighter then glass jars and easier to pack as well.

review/summary: Too sour for my baby
review/text: We tried this flavor when my son was almost 6 months and he wouldn't eat it. It is too sour even for me. I have talked to customer service and they had complains from other people and the next batch will have more sweet potato in so it should taste better. I will give it try again when the new batch is out. Otherwise my son loved all the other flavors we tried so far ( pear, mango&spinach&pear, Pear&peas&broccoli, apple&cherry, banana&beat&blueberries ). So try one before ordering bunch on Amazon.<br />The pouch idea is great, so easy to travel with! Some of the flavors are little runny but I am using Boon spoon and it works great. I am also going to try out the Plum organic Boon spoon for pouches, should fit Happy baby pouches as well.

review/text: I start giving these flavor to my son when he was 5,5 months and he loves it. Great mix of veggies and fruit that isn't too sweet. The pouches are great, we travel a lot and spend lot of time in our second home in Costa Rica and these are very easy and much lighter then glass jars to bring with us.<br />My so likes all the flavors he tried so far ( pear, mango&spinach&pear, apple&cherry, banana&beat&blueberry ) he didn't like apricot&sweet potato it was too sour for him, but I heard that the next one should have more sweet potato so it should not be as sour anymore.... have to wait to see when the new batch is out.

review/summary: One of my toddler's favorites
review/text: This is another one of my daughter's favorite snacks.  She seems to prefer the varieties with pears in them, and I do like that is is getting some spinach and that she actually likes it!  She does prefer the Peas, Broccoli, & Pear flavor, but this is also a favorite.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the smell of the mango can be pretty overpowering.  I like fresh mango, but for some reason the smell of mango baby food is just awful to me!  Other than that, a good product that I'll be ordering again.

review/summary: Not a hit
review/text: I've tried a few of these fruit and veggie squeeze packs (for my toddler primarily) in a few different brands.  This is the only flavor she didn't like.  She did try it, but gave it back to me after one bite.  Later, I tried to feed it to my baby with her oatmeal, and she didn't like it either!  I am a little surprised, since sweet potatoes are her favorite.  Maybe if your kids like apricot they will like this flavor, but mine didn't.  We'll be sticking with the Pears, Peas, & Broccoli flavor.

review/summary: My baby & toddler love this!
review/text: I originally bought this after my toddler had tried some squeeze pack apple sauce and enjoyed the novelty of it.  She likes applesauce anyway, but I thought I might be able to get her to eat some veggies if I could find them in a squeeze pouch too.  This fruit and veggie mix is perfect -- she gets some green veggies, but it really does taste just like pears!  I've tried several flavors, and this is her favorite by far.  My baby is starting solids now and she likes this one too.

review/summary: SUPER SOUR!!!
review/text: My 5.5 yr old son LOVES apricots and sweet potatoes so I was excited to try this flavor. I tried a sample package sold at Target and it tasted pretty good so I ordered a bunch online. He took one taste of this batch and handed it right back to me. I tasted it and whoa- it is SUUUUUPER SOUR - much more so than the one I tried at the store!?!? It gave me goosebumps! Wha???? I now wonder if they changed the recipe, started using unripe apricots or I mistakenly bought the wrong brand of this combo??? I'll have to try mixing it with some applesauce in a GU bottle or try to add it to my baked sweet potatoe/apple dish so it's not a total waste of money. Beware of this flavor!

review/summary: HORRIBLE tasting
review/text: I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a VERY picky eater.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and vegetable servings each day.  This does NOT do the trick!  He took one suck, made a horrible face, and has refused it since.  I tried it thinking it couldn't be THAT bad.  It was.  Terribly bitter (just the thought makes my mouth water) and runny.  No wonder he wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't either!  I did buy some of the other varieties offered by HappyBaby and he loves them.  I think this is just a bad taste combo.  Yuck!

review/text: This is probably my toddler's favorite pouch.  I have to admit, there's a lot of lemon juice in this mix, which makes the pouch somewhat sour.  My toddler loves lemons though so this is just exactly his taste.  If you're unsure whether your baby likes sour, don't buy this in bulk - it's probably for an acquired taste! :)

review/text: My one year old can actually "drink" these right from the package, using the spout like a straw, which makes these a super convenient option to have for snacks when we're out and about--no bib or spoon needed. He has food allergies, so finding processed foods that meet his needs and are still healthy and conveninent can be tough. He has loved all of the Happy Baby products we've tried. The multi-packs are a great deal and it is nice to be able to stock up this way instead of just buying singles from the only store around here that carries them.

It is tough finding on-the-go food options for him that meet with his dietary needs and satisfy my pickiness for healthy kids food. The deals for the multi-packs are great. My little one is old enough now that with a bit of help, he can just suck the food straight from the "spout" of the package like a straw and he LOVES them. He gets so excited when he sees me pull one out and they are so easy to throw in a purse or diaper bag so that I always have a good snack for him with me, no bib or utensils needed.

review/summary: Tasty & Nutritious in one easy to administer pouch!
review/text: My 15 month-old twin boys aren't big fans of spinach, but they LOVE these pouches. This is a great combination with the mangos and pears and you can still taste the spinach. Anytime my boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.  Also try the Beets, Blueberries, and Banana combo!!!<br /><br />These pouches are especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage. For the teethers, it's been helpful for us to place a few pouches in the fridge. For the picky eaters, we administer a swig of this inbetween bites and we can cram in a few more bites. These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy. If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food. The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all. Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later and if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack. No yucky jar top taste, no spoons to mess around with, and the combinations are tasty.  Just make sure your little one doesn't place the tops in their mouths.  Mine have done that a couple of times but with all the advantages of these pouches, I can keep an eye on the top a bit more.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save through Amazon, it's so much more cost saving than purchasing these in the stores.

review/text: I started using HAPPYBABY foods when my son was about nine months old.  At that time I was only aware of their frozen line.  I was SO EXCITED to hear about their pouches.  Although my son is now eating solids, I purchased some of the Stage 2 and 3 to use as snacks/fillers for other meals.  I loved the food combinations in the pouches.  An added plus, all the pouch packaging is BPA and pthlate free.<br /><br />My son loves the pouches.  I put the Stage 3 meat combos over pasta with a little cheese sprinkled on top for a nutritious, great tasting meal for my son (or the whole family).  He thinks he's getting a special treat.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend HAPPYBABY products.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Pouches Not Recyclable
review/text: This product tries to skirt the fact that the pouches are NOT recyclable, and the caps are a choking hazard. It doesn't make a lot of sense....buy an organic food product that puts more trash in the landfill. They toss around the buzz phrase "BPA free", but it is still more plastic going into the landfill. And, they use another buzz phrase, "lower carbon footprint than glass jars". Huh? Glass may have a higher carbon footprint, but it can be (and is) recycled over & over into food containers. Plastic cannot be recycled into new food containers. Yes the caps are recyclable, but recycled plastic often has no market for reuse. And, make sure your child doesn't try to eat them first.

review/text: My 2 year old daughter loves these sort of squeeze pouches so I ordered a whole case of these thinking that I could sneak some veggies in. Unfortunately this is not the case. These are so sour that she shudders after taking a sip!  So just says "don't like it!" and wants the plain mango one. Curious, I tried it and although it has a very sweet taste in the beginning the after taste of sour beets is awful!  Be prepared, if your little ones aren't a fan of beets, they may not be a fan of this flavor!

review/text: I was hoping to "sneak" beets into my sons snack, but there is no hiding with this brand. In fact, the beet flavor is rather overwhelming, and rather on the "raw" side. I enjoy beets, pickled and roasted, but this flavor is just not appealing at all. If your kid loves beets (maybe even raw ones?) go for it.  Also, someone commented on it being a runny consistency but my recently ordered batch is on the thick side.

review/text: My youngest loves this flavor straight out of the pounch and my older kids enjoy it without even knowing.<br /><br />My youngest often takes this in her lunchbox to preschool to enjoy during the day since she can recap it as many times as she would like.<br /><br />For my older kids, this is my favorite product to hide in all of their "treats"!  The apple & cherry flavoring is delicious in smooties, brownies, cupcakes and makes everything healthier.
