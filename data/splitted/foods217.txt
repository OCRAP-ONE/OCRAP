review/summary: Yummy Yogurt
review/text: I have been using store bought yogurt to make my yogurt. However I have found that Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt is so much better than the store bought variety. The flavor is purely delightful. I like to eat it as soon as it is cooled off. My yogurt is now much thicker and tastier than it was with the store bought yogurt. There is another benefit. I have been trying to regulate my digestive system......have had a problem for years. I have taken probiotic supplements with absolutely no success. My system now is perfect.....thanks to the Probiotic Yogurt Starter.

review/summary: Yumm
review/text: It's freaking delicious. I make goat yogurt and this is better than anything I've bought commercially, so I'm really pleased.<br /><br />BTW, I use my toaster oven as an incubator. I put a thermometer inside to monitor those low temperatures... So far so good and I'm glad I don't need another device in the kitchen.<br /><br />Note that you need to start incubating at 75 degrees and then slowly raise the temp to 105, 110. Don't go much higher.. food enzymes start to die at around 116 degrees.<br /><br />PS<br />The only reason why I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because the package did not give decent instructions for people working without the Yogourmet yogurt maker, and I wasted a batch by not cooling to 75 degrees. : )

review/text: This makes decent yogurt but not the best. It is not very good with skim or 1% milk. It does well with whole or 2% and a little powdered milk added in. I have the yogourmet incubater. I have to say the best yogurt I've made in it is Greek style using Yoplait plain Greek yogurt as starter. Very creamy and not runny and has just the right bite to it. I've used the Natren starter also, it is good too.

review/text: I have been using this product for about 6 months. I have had consistently good results when making yogurt with this starter. I tried to make follow up batches with yogurt I had made previously and it just never was as good as using this starter every time. One of the big secrets I have found to good yogurt is making sure that you mix in the starter thoroughly. Definitely improves the consistency.

review/summary: Homemade yogurt is worth the effort
review/text: My family prefers food made from scratch-breads, soups, jams, pickles, etc. The taste has more depth, better spices, texture & freshness. So, I thought I'd give making my own yogurt a try. I have used the Yogourmet  Starter with excellent results in a EuroCuisine maker. I use a combination of skim, 2% & powdered milks & a long overnight processing time  for a thicker, Greek style product.  All of us love the "tang"  & texture of the fresh yogurt. Since we started eating the homemade yogurt, we have noticed better digestion & less between meal hunger,too.

I tried once with cheap milk and the yogurt tasted terrible.

review/summary: consistently good batches of yogurt
review/text: Used with the Yogourmet yogurt maker, this starter has produced consistently great batches of yogurt.  One must carefully follow the directions on the package, rather that the machine's instructions, since the temperature of the milk must be allowed to cool to a lower level with the Casei Bifidus culture, as compared with the non probiotic culture.  Using this starter with 1% Organic milk from Costco and fortified with a cup of non fat instant milk powder has produced the richest tasting yogurt I have ever had.  I make a full 2 quart container, and fill a Donvier Yogurt Cheese strainer, so I have a choice of regular and Greek style yogurt.

review/summary: Temperature varies depending on room temperature
review/text: After several failed attempts at making yogurt, I discovered the small slip of paper included. It states, to paraphrase, that the unit will only hold the correct temperature for making the yogurt if the room temperature is between 68(F) and 72(F). If the room temperature is higher.. "It is important in summer to use the yogurt maker in an air conditioned room....". I can't imagine turning on the A/C to cool the house down to 72(F) JUST to make yogurt! When I DO turn it on, I set it for 80. In the winter, the kitchen is usually 65, so I imagine that would keep the temperature too low for proper incubation.<br /><br />Unless your kitchen is always around 70 degrees, I'd say pass on this unit.<br />I'll be listing it on the local FreeCycle board to get rid of it.

review/text: Ready Brek was a treat when I was growing up in England in the 60's and 70's, and I occasionally buy it still. It is very finely ground oatmeal, and when mixed with water or milk tends to have the consistency of wallpaper paste (for those of us old enough to remember when you still had to slop paste on wallpaper), and the bland taste is probably similar too. Funny thing is, I like it! If you grew up on this, then try it for old time's sake; if you've never tasted it before, I can pretty much guarantee you'll find it to be gross!!

review/summary: Tea ruined with hair in packaging
review/text: This is the most expensive loose tea I have purchased so far.  I have not strayed from the Davidson's loose bulk here on Amazon at such a great price but thought I would give this one a try.  The tea itself looks nice - partial leaves, better quality leaves than what I had seen so far out of other cheaper teas.  The taste is decent as well.  I do however have a HUGE problem with stray hairs in my loose tea.  The first time I scooped some out and noticed a long hair (and not the color of mine) in with the tea I was grossed out but thought "Hey it happens".  The second time I found another hair down further in the bag (oddly enough a different color and longer) it completely repulsed me.<br /><br />This isn't bad tea, but I would say there's a quality control problem in filling the bags.  Needless to say that I won't be buying this brand any more and back to Davidson's cheaper (and hair free) tea for me!

review/summary: Not the finest White Peony out there
review/text: This tea is rather cheap and you get what you pay for. It is a low-quality white peony tea and you should brew it for longer to get the typical strength and taste. I would say 4-5 minutes instead of the more typical 2-3 minutes. Even then there is some quirky chocolaty flavor.<br /><br />Finish your newly purchased tea quickly or, better, put it into your own spare tin boxes because this type of packaging will not keep it fresh for long.<br /><br />Next time I will probably pay more and buy some silver needle white tea (higher quality than white peony). Or I will buy my white peony in a brick-and-mortar store, where I can taste it first. This tea is not bad, but is not very good either. I cannot really recommend it.

review/text: its alright, I have had premium white and I will not say this is as good.. its a nice tea but its not as floral as the other whites out there, but its a good affordable white tea and if you love white tea but cannot afford the more expensive blend then this is for you. Also note if your not familiar with white tea it tastes totally different than green tea so if thats what your thinking this is.. your going to be dissapointed. Decent tea tho.

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: I love love love tart cherry preserves, and these are among the best I've ever tasted. The ingredients are: sour cherries, pure cane sugar. As such, they have a texture and color that is much more like homemade than even "gourmet" store bought. The color is a deep deep red/purple, almost black. The taste is very tart and delicious cherry, and is a nice contrast to almost anything that is savory or sweet.<br /><br />My only regret is buying the pack of 6 10 oz. jars; the price of 3 18 ox. jars is a much better value. However, without preservatives, I'm not sure how long they'll stay fresh in the fridge, so maybe smaller jars are the way to go.

review/summary: Not your Grandma's Preserves
review/text: You cannot imagine my disappointment.  The other reviewers say just like Grandma's homemade.  I suppose it is possible that my Grandma was a better cook than yours.  These are awful preserves.  And that is the nicest thing I can say about them.<br /><br />The packaging is spectacular, the quality, the flavor and the overall experience eating these preserves is way below par.  I did consume some, just hoping my initial experience was not good.  These preserves are terrible.  These are the worst tasting fig preserves I have ever tasted.  I was so excited reading they are just like Grandma's; I got the cherry flavored one too.  Yikes.<br /><br />Side-by-side, you could not tell the difference in the two jars.  They tasted identical.  The fig did not taste anything like figs and the cherry did not taste anything like cherries.<br /><br />They tasted identical.  They tasted awful.<br /><br />I am very disappointed especially since after reading the other reviewers; I was really excited to have finally found some good fig preserves.

review/summary: Very good chocolates
review/text: Every chocolate manufacturer will have a chocolate that can go with every season and satisfy the taste buds of all generations. Well Lindt has this chocolate which tastes absolutely awesome and goes with any occassion. You can either get the milk chocolate or go for the assorted one which has dark and other cocoa variations of chocolates. There is a myth that Lindt has liquor in all of its chocolates which is not so - Most Lindt in USA will only have cocoa liquor. Dark chocolates with whisky and other liquor variants are normally available from European markets - I got it few days back - available in Amazon. An amazing chocolate that melts so much in your much and makes you go crazy over its taste. In my opinion, truffles are the best chocolates Lindt has ever made over these years. Affordable price has mentioned at Amazon - you don't get that many deals for these stufss as these are preferred round the year. You may also smaller gift boxes that has around 20 truffles - you can also mix and match based on your prefernce

review/summary: Poor quality - storage?
review/text: I agree with the others' comments about buying from Amazon.<br /><br />We've ordered these chocolates before directly from Lindt and they've arrived in perfect condition - crisp shiny shells that SNAP when you bite into them, and fillings that literally melted in your mouth. So when Amazon offered them at a special price and sent directly from Amazon with free shipping, even better, right?<br /><br />Wrong. I don't know how these were stored but they arrived in mid-April when temps in Chicago the entire week before had ranged from the low 30s to the mid 50s, but they'd obviously been subjected to much warmer conditions. The shells were soft and kind of sticky and with none of the usual Lindt gloss, and the fillings were almost the same texture. The taste was barely adequate but the texture was not even close to what it should be even if you'd bought them off a grocer's shelf and a number of them even had dents in the shells although so far none seem to have been completely melted.<br /><br />If you can buy them directly from Lindt in the middle of December, you'll probably be ok. Otherwise think twice before ordering unless you can be pretty sure they've been properly stored.

review/summary: Received melted, misshapen truffles
review/text: Lindt Lindor Truffles are one of my favorite chocolate candies and I buy them often.  I thought it would be great to have a larger quantity on hand. But the box of 60 that I received from Amazon was evidently not stored properly. The truffles arrived quickly but in bad shape - almost every one is misshapen (dented, flattened) and almost every one has chocolate on the outside of the wrapper, indicating that they melted sometime. They're unattractive and a mess to eat because of this. They also don't have that characteristic Lindt "snap" of the shell; it's like one big, misshapen, sticky lump of chocolate instead of the usual truffle - again, I believe this indicates that they melted during storage. I'm very disappointed and will not be ordering these from Amazon again.

review/summary: Lindor Truffles
review/text: I ordered two-60 count boxes for the candy table at my daughter's wedding, knowing that these would be the ultimate! When we opened the box, the truffles were puckered, and chocolate was inside of the ends of the wrappers.  Some so badly (about 27-28), that I could not put them into the candy jar to take to the venue. The rest were still puckered with indentations on them. But I tried to pick the least worst ones. I opened some up to see how they taste because of the bad quality of them, in wrapped form. They did taste amazing as usual. What an embarrassment at a $30,000 plus venue. I sent an email to Sue"s Shirt Shop and More (seller through Amazon). They informed me that they were perfect at time of shipment, but wanted the order number. On October 3, I provided them the info and told them they were by far not perfect when received, that I did not have them in any heat (that I was home at time of delivery) and wondered how could they tell me they were in perfect condition at time of shipment unless they themselves physically inspected each one. As of this date, I have not heard back. I do know that we paid $10.98 for shipping and handling and would think that USPS was not responsible for their condition; however, only Amazon.com would know that. The issue of shipping never came up. But in the end, the customer (us) got the shaft. For the price we paid, we could have bought each piece individually in a local shop. Unfortunately, we did not know this would happen. I would never order these again, online. We did it because it was the only way to buy boxes of them.  omg, I have now first read other reviews and find that ours, too, did not have the shiny, crisp covering that they normally have. And, yes, there were chocolate stains on the inside of the box they came in. Just like in other orders. I now see that I am not alone in having the problems of quality being far under par. I just wish mine would have been of the correct quality so that it didn't leave a bad impression on the candy table at our daughter's wedding, which was otherwise elegant. Then again, hopefully, it reflected on the quality of Lindor truffles themselves. All I know is that someone should be very concerned. I feel like these were the rejects of their product. And, they probably were...

The price is only contestable when Lindt holds its 2 for 19oz bags @ 20 deal, but still, you are cutting it really close, and when you factor in shipping, forget it. Walmart at best can only match this price through an online offer, however, with additional charges this substantially brings up the total cost.<br /><br />Word of caution, this deal may not work for those requiring shipping in hot weather or steamy climates.

review/summary: One of the best chocolates
review/text: These are simply one of the best chocolates I have ever had.  If you don't believe me, you should look at the way my my nephews and nieces act when I bring these for them.  Their eyes light up instantly, and the way they simply ignore everything else in the world when they are enjoying the chocolaty goodness, is a five star review in itself.<br /><br />Four stars, because it's pricey!  But that never stops me from buying more ;o)

review/text: As much as we liked Lindt chocolates, I am very disappointed that I need to leave this kind of review.<br /><br />Those of us that come from Europe know what good chocolate should taste like. It seems that Lindt is getting too americanized.... chocolate is too sweet and no flavor. Too bad!

review/summary: Heafty and beautiful!
review/text: I bought this because it is made from real wood and from Oregon, not imported.  I like the litte size.  Very cute round and great drip edge!  The drip edge is very deep.  I don't see how I can make a mess with it.<br /><br />I like this size for quick chops.  Yes, you can see some marks from the knife, but that is better than on the counter.  Easy to clean and drys up quick.<br /><br />I look forward to buying other pieces.  I checked out the manufacturers website and they have a very large offering of products.  I bought a bread knife and a larger rectangular board as well.  With the 4-3 offer, I got a left handed bread knife for my brother in law's xmas gift!<br /><br />Did I mention, it feels like you are using a work of art?  The wood is beautiful, very rich in tone and color.  The natural variation is gorgeous.

review/summary: I like this cutting board!
review/text: I use this cutting board everyday for about two months and I really like it.  Firstly, the size and thickness is perfect, not too big or too small (I cook for 2 people).  A deep edge is very useful, no juice mess on the table and easy to grab.  Secondly, the color is nice warm brown and I like its mild wood smell :)  Thirdly, it's easy to clean and seems to last for a long time(although you can see some knife's marks on the board).

review/text: I'm so glad I purchased this cutting board. I'm glad I was able to support something relatively local (U.S. made) and it's the perfect size for someone who cooks for 1-2 people. It doesn't take up too much space in my cabinet or on my counter when I'm cutting. Also, it's a good looking cutting board.

review/summary: Good for display, not so much for it's intended use
review/text: First off, I hate to trash a product that is not only "green", but made in America, however we are less than pleased with this cutting board. First off the color of the one we received is way lighter than the one illustrated. I specifically want a color close to that shown to match our new kitchen cabinets. Right away upon using it AS a cutting board, small chips started coming off of the cutting surface and with just over a month of use, the board is now warped from being rinsed off under warm tap water so that it wobbles from side to side, definitely not what you want to happen when you are trying to cut something. Lastly, be aware that these boards are made of multiple pieces of wood glued together, ours is 4 pieces. I doubt this board will last half as long as the bamboo board it replaced.

review/summary: Just as I remembered
review/text: This product is exactly as I remember it as an adolescent in the 70's. Once you get past the first couple of pieces, you will find different flavors for each color, red and white for Cherry, purple and white for grape, and yellow and white for banana.  Other color combinations have different flavors, some hard to identify but all good.  If the weather is a bit warm, the wax paper can be a little hard to separate from the taffy.  Quick Fix - stick them in the refrigerator for a two minutes and the paper will come off easily.  Makes a great treat for kids.  Adults, watch out for the expensive dental work. This taffy is the real stuff.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Hate Gatorade? Drink this.
review/text: I bought several of these for a 350-mile walk across Madagascar.<br /><br />Never a fan of sweet rehydration drinks, I've always preferred straight water when going with a cool beverage. For this trip, however, I figured I may want something a little extra to ease muscle cramping, liven things up a bit, etc. I wasn't able to drink it through the day as I didn't want to encourage bacteria in my mouthpiece, but it was nice starting the day chugging down a canteen, or ending the day with it. I use a SteriPEN, but I would imagine this might also mask the delicious taste of purification tablets or iodine a bit...so be warned.<br /><br />The containers are waterproof until opened, then be careful to keep them sealed in waterproof bags to avoid moisture and varmints.<br /><br />They are slightly fizzy, which is nice if your stomach is having a moment. I ordered both this flavor and Tangerine Ginger; of the two, Lemon Chai is my favorite both cold and lukewarm. Certainly lemony, with a bit of flair. Tangy. As for Tangerine Ginger, I'm a ginger addict, but it is not the dominant flavor.<br /><br />Since returning, I've continued drinking this periodically during strength-training sessions.

The tea comes in a resealable "zip-lock" type back, within a nice box.  The price is quite a bit less than what you'd pay in a brick-and-mortar store and these folks ship very fast.

Toy Fox Terrier puppies have a very sensitive digestive system and mouth/teeth.  this is good quality and texture.  also at a small 3.5 oz. container, it's the perfect amount.  no leftover or waste.  this is perfect for small breeds and they love it.  mixes well with dry food too.

review/summary: Just what I needed
review/text: My puppy is a very picky eater and when I found out Cesar had puppy food I had to try it cause I always said if I got a small dog I would want him to b a Cesar dog. This came and I love the fact that it comes in the little trays so it made it easy and neat to store. My puppy took one bite and has not looked back. I have tried to sneak him some of his old food and it is a no go. He just looks at me like don't even try it. My only mistake aw I didn't get the subscription of this, so I don't have to keep placing the order.  It is fresh and saves u a trip to the store. By it being delivered to the house this is one less thing for me to worry about. I work 10 hr days and dont go shopping to often and this is very convent to have my babies food delivered to my door. This is a great buy.

I feel like they were eating her out of house and home so I bought this for a monthly delivery(each purchase is 24 trays) for cheaper than wallmart pricing! She called me in tears because this showed up on her doorstep as a surprise (came over 2 weeks early amazing) so she doesnt have to worry about running around town buying dogfood all the time. I do not go by serving size listed on the packaging since we use it as a treat  usually its half a tray per dog and mixit with dry dog food and leftover rice!
