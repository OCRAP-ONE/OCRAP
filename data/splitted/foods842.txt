No mess, no measuring, no fuss, just add to coffee and enjoy!<br />I purchased a 12-pack of boxes of 5 from this seller, and my order was filled and shipped quickly, and was at my door on the promised day.<br />I shall be purchasing more of these, from this seller, in the future.

review/summary: Light Bouquet, Non-Sweetened, Great Taste.
review/text: Tonight I again shopped  for a take-out meal at my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. I chose a packet of 8 California Shrimp Tempura Rolls with a nice soy sauce and bit of wasabi. For a drink, I went to the drink display and chose a 16.9-ounce bottle of Ito En Oi Ocha Green tea. Nice combination. Went down well. I've had the Ito En Green Tea before and it's absolutely first rate. It's non-sweetened. Just brewed tea and a little Vitamin C. The tea has a nice light bouquet, goes down like a soft, very-good-tasting water and has a nice green tea aftertaste. Excellent! No wonder this is Japan's leading brand of green tea.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Never knew a tea could taste this good
review/text: Its pricey, true. but after trying over a dozen other lower priced teas, and others that were only lower because of a pre purchased certificate, I decided it was less expensive just to buy what I wanted than try to save.  If I didnt think it was a good value in the long run, I would have had to go with 4 not 5 stars, no matter how much I love it.  But it earns that last star when you get down to it.  I first tasted this at a mall walking by a teavana shop.<br /><br />I was so dazed that this was a tea I was tasting...it just didnt seem real.  I didnt buy any that day, and kept hurrying to my destinatation.  Later I couldnt get it out of my head, and finally went back to be sure, and to buy it.<br /><br />then i went shopping around.  I can usually find things for waaaay below retail, without sacrificing quality.  But not with this.  I wasted a couple of hundred dollars on less expensive blends with no luck.  Eventually I found one that was a close second.  But the same was true in price... other than a prepaid half off certificate I had for that store.<br /><br />I was almost "enchanted" by the runner up.  But once I tried the Teavana again, the other just wasnt in the same district.  It was just too floral.  The teavana tea is more delicate and balanced. If I ever find a deal like that again, I'll try the other tea for use in blending with the distant third place winners.  If even the youthberry is a bit floral for you, tevana sells a lighter blended version with orange.<br /><br />But for me , by itself in the youthberry, you taste each flavor as a separate note, fruity, warm, then aromatically fragrant. I know they say taste is mostly smell.  I actually smell the roses more than taste them... Then at either the beginning or the end of the sip (or so I found, varying by whether hot or cold, may not be there at all for you) there is a brief moment when the notes make a chord or perhaps symphony.  All too short, leaving you wanting more, but at the same time, perfectly filled.<br /><br />If I sound like I'm reviewing a wine..  I have had that pleasure, and I think out of the hundreds of wines I tried, including most of the wines considered among the finest, I never enjoyed a wine more than this tea for flavor.  And at almost no calories!<br /><br />Then again, once I had to pay for the wines myself..for some reason my love for them waned. This tea is one of the few things I think is worth paying retail for.<br /><br />If you hate all things floral, including the scent of flowers, perfume etc...this isnt for you.  I dont know many who do, other than allergically.<br /><br />This is like drinking a cup of sweet fruit tea while visiting a fine florist.  sitting in a garden, or holding a rose.  But somehow it isnt girly, unless you want it to be.  I just found something totally new and different for me when I tasted it, and it was an unexpected pleasure that brought me into the tea afficiando world like never before.  I only like herbals I make myself usually.<br /><br />Oh the other two of my 4, had nothing in common with this, were just herbals I picked up to qualify for free shipping in hopes of finding something I could tolerate that had the benefit of some of the herbs within.  I actually found two I like for two things I knew I should either drink or eat, but hated the taste.<br /><br />The youthberry may have beneficial things in it.  (In fact it does, or so my herbal books say of the ingredients) but its a drink for pure pleasure.  I recently had to give up all forms of soda. diet or not, and was using tea for a flavor substitute.  It didnt really do the job, until I found this.  I like it better than the soda and dont miss it at all now.  I really only switch out from the youthberry for plain water, or something I need the benefit of, and to cleanse my taste buds to go back to this.  Leaves easily yeild two batches of water. I find that adding only about 25% as much I can stretch that to 4 or 5.  In the long run, I'm actually saving money vs soda.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: So, some friends said this was the best tea ever.  As a tea lover, I thought I would give it a shot.  First, the tea leaves and bits of fruit and what not, are large.  It's probably best to brew this tea loose in a small pot and strain it into a cup to let the flavors really develop.  However, for the size of the tea product the flavor was not very strong.  I have never been to a Teavana shop, but apparently they really sweeten the teas they serve.  I used a little agave for mine and I found it to be just OK.  In summary, not the best tea ever, but not bad, it certainly beats Lipton by a mile.  It's also costs a lot more than Lipton...so, there's that.  As for shipping, my products arrived quickly and safely packaged.

review/text: These are fine. As promised, they are flakes not whole beans. The only complaint I have is that they have added salt. As these are dried (really dried!), I don't think the salt has anything to do with preserving them. It is a lot better to be able to add salt if you want it and not be forced to eat a bunch of salt. Not for a low or no salt diet. They would be 4 stars if they didn't have all the salt added to them.

review/text: Absolutely disappointed with this product. I was so excited to see it finally at my door. Then I opened the box and the smell of cheap plastic was overwhelming. I said "hmm it will go away eventually", but then I noticed the bowl where you would put the tomatoes was cracked, completely unusable!! Then I noticed it is made out of this thin plastic that would've probably cracked after the first use anyway. I tried to put the whole thing together and it is so poorly made that none of the pieces come together properly. And of course the base for it does not stay in place on the hard surface I was attempting to install it on. I will return this item back immediately, because I can't even give it a try since the bowl is cracked in half. Waste of money!

review/summary: One of my faves
review/text: Welch's Fruit snacks appear to be a healthy, nutritious snack food for children and adults alike. They're made by Welch's, a company in the fruit juice business since 1869, and on the colorfully designed packages brimming with pictures of luscious fruit, we see that this wonderful snack is made with "REAL FRUIT", and no preservatives. Each 2.5 ounce package contains 100% of the daily vitamin C requirement, 25 % of vitamin A, and 25% of Vitamin E. Try to top that Snickers or Three Musketeers!<br /><br />I've been enjoying this delicious snack for years and never grow tired of them. My two favorite flavors  might be concord grape and mixed fruit; I don't have a least favorite. In my last bag of mixed fruit I observed mostly red pieces with a few orange and only one concord grape piece. The different flavored snacks are colored and shaped differently, many with pebbly texture on top to simulate berries. They are soft and chewy, but not overly so. Their sweetness is satisfyingly pleasing but not as intense as one might experience with a piece of candy. The tastes vary with the flavors, but in the bag of mixed fruit one doesn't distinguish distinctive flavors.<br /><br />I've always thought of the Welch's Fruit Snacks as a guilt free treat, like eating a piece of fruit. Well, that's not quite true. The first ingredient, you'll notice, is fruit juice, not real fruit, followed by corn syrup and sugar. The fruit part, actually a fruit puree, follows the sweeteners and the modified corn starch. Also in these fruit snacks are artificial colorings like red #40, yellow #5, and blue #1. Some of these colors can trigger hyperactivity in children. Yellow 5 use to set my daughter off like caffeine.<br /><br />The Welch's Fruit Snacks are not sticky to the touch like some other fruit based snacks. At work I sometimes share a bag or two with students who universally enjoy them as much as I do.<br /><br />Overall this is a good, nutritious snack, maybe a bit heavy handed with the sweeteners. I like the ingredient list better than that of other similar snacks such as Fruit Roll-ups. For what it's worth, Fruit Roll-ups have 373 calories per 100 grams of snack. Welch's Fruit Snacks have 325 calories per 100 grams.

review/text: The quality of the product was superb. The snacks themselves are very tastey, soft, and chewey in a variety of fruit flavors. I don't want my following comments to reflect negatively on the great flavor and quality of the gummies.<br /><br />That being said..... the size of these pouches is VERY SMALL. There are about 8-10 gummy pieces in each pouch. This is by no means a "snack" and is very much like what you would give to a trick or treater I also compare the portioning of the pouches to a snickers "fun size" candy bar. "Fun size" candy is usually a tiny piece of the product and is not really a true "portion". (And for that matter, what's so "fun" about less candy???) If you want to hand these "pouches" out as trick or treat items, they are well suited for that. If you want a REAL SNACK to tide you over until dinner, grab about 3-4 of the pouches and take them with you.

I recommend Annie's brand (particularly the Berry Batch) or Ocean Spray (the Berries and Cherries is really good).  Both of those brands have an amazing soft texture and don't have to sit there chewing forever as you do with the Welch's.

Originally they were in vending machines at work, but no longer.<br />I have tried to find them in stores, with no luck.<br />Thanks for satisfying that little sweet attack he gets in the afternoon.<br />Also for the prompt shipping.

review/text: These fruit snacks are so good, I consider them more of a treat than candy. The only bad thing about them is they make me want to eat 80000 more. Even the smell of them is wonderful - I have sniffed the plastic bags they come in because they are just so delicious. Om nom nom nom!

review/summary: Never buying here again
review/text: This is probably the worst purchase I've ever made on the internet, and I'm a frequent consumer of online purchases.  Firstly, this product was not shipped 3 weeks after I ordered it.  After emailing the company inquiring into my order, I was informed that they would now ship my product - 3 weeks after the order date!  Upon arrival of the purchase, I noticed a misshapen box on my doorstep.  Upon opening the box, I discovered my Fruit Snacks box was misshapen and squished, because it was placed in a shipping box that was smaller than the fruit snacks box, totally ruining the shape and appearance of the Fruit Snacks box.  In addition, under the fruit snacks box was a crumpled packing slip, which included a coupon for 5% off my next purchase from this company.  It's too bad the coupon expired 3 days before I even received the fruit snacks box, since the coupon was printed three weeks prior, when I actually ordered the thing.<br /><br />Tl;dr DO NOT purchase stuff from this company.  It is worth the extra time needed to find another supplier or buying it from the store.  I paid more for this product than it's price at costco citing convenience due to not having to leave my home, and ended up experiencing the worst online purchase in my 10 years of purchasing history.

review/text: They're in decent sized individual packages (each containing 80 calories, 0 calories from fat) and they absolutely delicious. Much better than any other fruit snacks I've had in a long time. They're made in the USA (and/or Spain? [says that on the packages]). It does contain gelatin, so it's not vegetarian friendly. It doesn't say it's vegetarian or organic on the box either, so it's not misleading in any way.<br /><br />NOTE I get this box (same size, same amounts, etc) for about $10 at Costco Wholesale... So if you live near one, this is definitely a more economic choice.

review/summary: Not just for kids, I love them too!
review/text: I love these fruit snacks!  My duaghter loves them as well, but I wasn't expecting to like them.  They have a great texture, chewy but soft.  And they have great fruit flavors including: orange, three types of berries, and peach.  They are very nutritious, since they are made from real fruit!  They are also fat free and have no preservatives!  The 80 pouch box has lasted over a month, with somebody reaching into the box every day.  The individual pouches are on the small side, my daughter prefers to have two of them occassionally.<br /><br />I wish the box had a punch out front tray, that would enable easier access of the pouches, similar to a display in a store.  Also, the combination of fruits in each pouch aren't even, with most pouches having alot of the peach & strawberry variety, and less of the other flavors.  But this not a deal killer by any means!

review/summary: Inconsistent quality
review/text: So far I have ordered about 5 boxes of the fruit snacks from Amazon. Two out of three times, I was disappointed with the quality of the product. Once I got the orange flavor that tasted very bitter (like the orange skin was mixed with the juice to make the flavor) and this time, they taste really pale and chewy (kinda like they are not fresh). The packages were shipped fast and the box was sealed so I can only contribute the different taste to the inconsistent quality of the product. Based on this experience this would be my last time ordering the Welch's Fruit Snacks.

review/text: I just found out (to my dismay) that these otherwise delicious snacks are made with pork gelatin, which is strange because I've eaten them previously and examined the ingredients, which did not list gelatin. Perhaps it is only certain flavors that include it? In any case, my family is vegetarian, so we will unfortunately not be purchasing Welch's Fruit Snacks.

review/text: Red Tea Leaf's Espresso Matcha is amazing!<br /><br />This product has helped with the joint inflammation in my hands.  I was told I had arthritis and that it would probably get worse.  After my own research, I found that an anti-inflammatory diet could help.  Matcha Green Tea was mentioned by several sources. Red Tea Leaf teas are excellent and their customer service is fast and friendly.  I had tried several different brands, but Red Tea Leaf's variety of favors that they mix with the Matcha was what drew me to this company.<br /><br />I chose Espresso Matcha because I am a coffee drinker, but wanted to drink several glasses of Matcha Green Tea a day and knew I would have to forgo my coffee to drink this much (and I love coffee).  There is a subtle flavor of espresso mixed with the Matcha green tea.<br /><br />During a workout when a bar bell completely slipped out of my hand because I lost my grip, I decided I had to try something.  I stopped drinking coffee `cold turkey' as soon as my Espresso Matcha from Red Tea Leaf order arrived and never once got a headache.<br /><br />My favorite summer time way to drink this tea is to mix 1 heaping scoop of Matcha green tea into my 20 oz. water bottle the night before, then refrigerate so I `m ready to go in the morning (I make 3 of these each night when I `m packing my lunch).  Just make sure to shake it before you drink it, the Matcha tea settles to the bottom.  Within two weeks, the ache-y feeling in my hands every morning almost completely disappeared!  I am able to grip jars to open them without pain.  During my workouts, I focus completely on form and only later realize, I never thought once about my hands!  They do not hurt... at all!<br /><br />As for my diet, I ate very `clean' before I started drinking Matcha tea from Red Tea Leaf and I love scientific research (I know, nerdy), so drinking 3 heaping scoops of Matcha tea a day was the only change that I made.  I consistently drink 60-80 oz of water now, but even before when I tried drinking this much water to flush out my system my hands still hurt.  It was not until I added the Match green tea from Red Tea leaf that I noticed an improvement in my hand.<br /><br />I am so happy with this product!  Thank you Red Tea Leaf!

review/summary: Finally -- peace within the pack!
review/text: I have 3 70 pound retriever mixes and they always have to have something in their mouths.  Unfortunately, it is usually one of their fellow pack-mates that they wind up chewing on and the 3 of them get to scrapping like a scrum in a rugby game.  Not very restful.<br /><br />However, with 3 of the large Everlasting Treat balls stuffed with these treats, I'm good for a couple of relatively peaceful evenings.  Depending on the dog and the ball, the treats usually stay in there and will one two-pack will last a couple of nights.  Occasionally, the treat will "pop out" of the ball and the lucky dog will be able to chew it up in about the same amount of time as a raw-hide chip.<br /><br />I like that these aren't raw-hide since raw-hide will sometimes cause digestive issues in my dogs (and there is nothing worse when 3 big dogs have digestive issues!).<br /><br />I'm so glad to see Amazon sell these because my local Petsmart no longer carries them -- at least not in the size that I need.  Plus, Amazon saves me a trip, shipping, and tax... happiness abounds for bi-peds and quadra-peds alike!

review/text: My dogs loved this treat. They would lick it and lick it. But after a couple of days my Corgi's which are very smart dogs, figured out how to get it out. Even after the treat was gone they would lick the plastic like crazy. There are new everlast locking treats out that are suppose to stop your dog from popping out the treat. I would try the locking system first since the balls are not cheap to replace.

review/summary: Everlast? I think not!
review/text: I've heard that this type of treat is very good. Dogs seem to like it and it seems to last a long time. Other than it seeming to taste good, it didn't even last 10 minutes! I have a labradane. She loves treats which doesnt help the fact people says it may or may not taste good. Other than that, this product stinks. I bought it a few days ago and it finally arrived today. I put my puppy in her crate and handed her one of these treats to keep her busy while I pack. This treat was GONE in less than 10 minutes. G.O.N.E gone! Now, its not like my puppy is an aggressive chewer, she just has a strong jaw. She's also a puppy, for those people reading this who have ever had a puppy, they are easily distracted by food.<br />I looked up dog treats for aggressive chewers/strong jawed dogs and this was one of the first 5 items that appeared.I read reviews on it and everyone was crazy about how it was soo good. Now to find that I'm not finished packing, I have to go fill up her KONG to keep her from crying as she sees me running in and out of the room. I do not recommend this unless your dog is old or isnt very interested in dog treats/bones and would rather lay next to you...

review/summary: Does the Trick!
review/text: This product used at the right time can keep me sane.  I have a German Shepherd and an Australian Cattle dog that just never want to stop playing...in the house....and they are very loud!  If I want to watch a movie or something like that and I have one of these to put in my everlasting treat ball, I am very happy!  It lasts for a long time for my cattle dog but for the German Shepherd it doesn't last as long.  He can chew up most bones in under 10 minutes and this actually takes him more like 30 minutes to eat the whole thing, both sides and all.  So to me the price is worth it and I think it's a great product, the dogs LOVE it.

review/summary: Keeps my dogs busy for days
review/text: My dogs are very aggressive chewers and other treats (Busy Bones, Dentabones, etc.) last literally 4-5 minutes. I bought two everlasting treat balls and each refill will last my dogs nearly a week. They even chew on the rubber ball and, so far, no harm yet. This has been the perfect thing to keep them busy between walks and playtimes.

review/summary: Hardly Everlasting--Devoured in 15 Minutes
review/text: This product looks just as advertised, and it must be tasty, because our mid-sized (40 lbs) dog devoured the entire thing within 15 minutes. It does not fit inside the Medium Everlasting Glo Ball, so get the large size, if you plan to use this product with that toy. Product was received way ahead of schedule, so pleased with delivery.

review/summary: City Roast Columbian Supremo
review/text: I would agree with stoney's review. I purchased a 5 lb. bag directly from Coffee Bean Direct using my Amazon account. Which makes it convenient to buy directly from them and the roasting dates are within a few days of your order.<br /><br />5 lbs. is a lot of coffee for one person. So I bagged 10-12 bulging full plastic baggies and put them in the freezer for use when needed. It would take too long for one person to finish the 5 lb. bag within a few weeks.<br /><br />But the smell was awesome when I packed the baggies. My apt. smelled like a coffee house for days, awesome!<br /><br />The beans are a dark brown color, slight oily sheen, smells great when grinding, best part of the day actually, the taste is good, bold like, or strong depending on how much coffee/water you use, lets you know you are drinking real coffee, I like it.<br /><br />I use the drip method, a single cup Melitta plastic drip cone right over the cup, brown paper filters. Less parts to break, simple clean up.<br /><br />I also tried a 1lb. bag of "Smoked Coffee" from Coffee Bean Direct. It does have that strong smoked smell to it, and it's good coffee, but I couldn't say that I tasted that smoked flavor in the coffee.<br /><br />But I like the City Roast, has good flavor.

review/text: The coffee arrived in very short order, like 2 days. The price was right making this a very attractive offer. Well roasted, full of flavor. The City Roast was a little more then I was used to as Im normally a straight Columbian kind of guy. This batch of Columbian City Roast was about another 25-30% darker and richer in flavor and acid.<br />Good to great coffee, just not my cup of Joe though. Will order from them again as the overall product was excellent. But I'll go with straight Columbian next time!

review/summary: Very Good Coffee; Very Good Value
review/text: SUMMARY<br />The City Roast is a medium to moderately-dark roast, rich coffee, which I would grade as A- (typical American coffee being C).  I drink my coffee strong, and City Roast makes a good strong cup.  It is full flavored without being bitter.  Unlike darker roasts, it is not glazed with sugar (which melts and sticks, like a turd, in your coffee grinder).  In short, it is not the very best coffee I have drank, but a very good coffee and the best combination of quality and value that I have found.<br /><br />Normally a coffee called "City Roast" would not have caught my attention, and I would avoid anything called "supremo", but the City Roast was included with the "sampler" I purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWHDZA">Coffee Bean Direct Assorted Whole Bean Coffee Sampler, 9-Pound Box</a>, and it was by far the best---the only coffee in the sampler which impressed me.  I'm now working on my second 5 pound bag.<br /><br />COFFEE BEAN DIRECT<br />Coffee Bean Direct concentrates on flavored coffee (which I loath), decafinated coffee (what's the point?) and dark roasts (which I usually avoid).  I normally prefer light roasts, but CBD's light roasts (and least those in the sampler) were mediocre, barely up to "Maxwell House" or "Folger's" standards.  As a generalization dark roast coffee is analogous to red wine as compared to white wine.  Some dark roasts are exceptionally rich and flavorful, but it is harder to find a good dark roast than a good light roast.  Intense roasting either enhances the flavor, or destroys it, more often the latter.<br /><br />COFFEE SERVICES<br />The great advantage of Coffee Bean Direct (and other services such as Boca Java {highly recommended} and Gevalia) is that you are assured of fresh beans, whereas you never know how long coffee has been setting on a grocery shelf or in a warehouse.  Fresh beans make a huge difference.  Of course, that means that if you buy 5-pound bags for home use, you need to refrigerate it and keep it tightly sealed.<br /><br />OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS<br />I've been using the Mellita system for about 40 years, which I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MIT2OK">Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker 10 Cup, 1-Count</a>.  I have found that the best artificial sweetener with coffee is pure stevia.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84">Pure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 oz</a>  Pure Stevia is the sweetener in the more common Truvia, but without the fillers which alter the taste and leave a yucky residue in your cup.  As an extra bonus, Pure Stevia is much more economical.

review/summary: Very good, for a columbian coffee
review/text: I just received a sampler and this was the coffee that Coffee Bean Direct threw in for free.  I don't like Columbian coffee usually -- I find it generally too mild and tasting like pinto beans.  But being peverse, I chose this bag as the first one to open.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The beans, which not very dark, we nice and oily and it smelled more like coffee rather than pinto beans.  I ground them in my burr grinder and it smelled slightly beany, but not overwhelmingly so.  I brewed a small pot of french press.  It's good!  Now this is pretty amazing to me because I don't normally like Columbian coffee - but this is a nice afternoon cup.  It's still much milder coffee than I prefer, but it's the best Columbian I have ever had.<br /><br />I am now excited to try the other varieties!

review/summary: If You Enjoy Lime, This Tea is For You
review/text: *****<br /><br />Dry Desert Lime is an unusual premium Numi tea. It is herbal tea (caffeine-free) containing solely dried lime---that's all---not lime and green/black tea, not artificial lime flavor, but real lime---alone---a truly remarkable feat. It is certified organic, and is kosher. It has the most amazing tart and lovely taste. If you like lime, you'll love this tea. If you don't like lime, definitely pass, as it is a very intense "lime experience". I love it!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer lyrically writes: "From the far reaches of the Arabian Desert, this rare lime has been enjoyed for thousands of years, both as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine and as a teasan. Traditionally harvested and dried in the hot desert sun, this oasis of Vitamin C has been drunk to soothe just about everything. The first taste brings a distant yet familiar impression, leaving the trace of a fleeting memory on the tip of your tongue. We find that its clean, bracing, and reviving citrus pleasure, nicely balanced with a touch of sugar, lifts the blues. Try it, you'll fall in love with it!"<br /><br />If you like Numi teas and enjoy lime, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love lime, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. In fact, I have never heard of anyone else making this tea. I enjoy serving it to company, but even more, just for me.<br /><br />*****

This does not taste at all like tea, but it is completely wonderful! On another note charging $7.25 shipping on a $5.99 product that weighs next to nothing should be criminal so, watch your seller!

review/text: This is the best Taco Sauce out there.  Love the flavor and just the right seasoning.  Hard to find in Grocery Stores now.  This used to be a stock item that your local Grocery Store had on the shelf, not anymore.
