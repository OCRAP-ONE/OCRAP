review/summary: Hot, but not hot enough
review/text: Sardines packed in oil (soy, olive and EVOO) are too bland for me. I've tried them with green chilies, chipotle and Louisiana hot sauce. These Vigo are hotter than the others, but not by much. I kick it up a notch with Tabasco Habanero or Jalapeno sauce. If you like 'em midly hot, these may be just right for you.

review/summary: Could kill you!
review/text: It's 10 tins in individual yellow cardboard boxes shrink wrapped in plastic. Item arrived with other items all in seemingly good condition. I opened one, ate it, and it seemed fine. Then, looking closer, I saw that a number of boxes were discolored. It seems that they were soaked with oil. I found the worst one, opened it, and the can inside seemed okay with no obvious defects. When I "oil canned" it (compressing and releasing it repeatedly), I could hear air hissing in and out. I immediately threw it away, of course! Then later I got to thinking--no shipping damage; other items fine; so it could either have "burst" from bacteria growth due to improper cooking, or the canning equipment was defective and no seal was ever achieved. Either way, this could be a one way ticket to the botulism hall of fame (the graveyard). I had already eaten one, and already thrown another away, so I haven't returned them, but beware that you should be very careful before you eat any. Make sure you hear the vacuum release when you open the can. The other eight cans seem fine, and I'm still here to write the review so the ninth one must be okay too! The pickers at Amazon might have caught this if they paid attention, but it wasn't obvious even to me.

review/summary: Sprouting made easy
review/text: In my younger days I used to grow sprouts in between paper towels. I recently wanted to get back to doing my own sprouts, but really didnt want<br />to go the paper towel route again. I researched a few styles and purchased this sprouter. I am quite pleased with the ease. I agree with the first reviewer that the hulls will not come out with the lid on, but it isnt difficult to add water and gently swish the sprouts. The hulls will float to the top for you to discard. I have my second batch of sprouts under way. I like it and would recomend this product. (No chance of paper towels drying up while your at work, and no need to mess with cheesecloth).

review/summary: easy to use - great product
review/text: I bought the sprouting jar with lid and the seeds.  Both the jar and the seeds came with instructions on how to grow sprouts.  One set of the instructions was vague, but the other set work well.  The seeds sprout well and require little attention other than rinsing and draining a couple times a day.  The instructions say that when the sprouts are ready you can fill the jar with water and the seed hulls will float out the lid - the openings in the lid are too small for this but I just put them in a bowl of water and they float to the top.  Otherwise great product and it works well.

review/summary: Easy to use
review/text: I like this product, it grows sprouts well. It's a bit pricey considering you can buy the strainer lid seperately for around $4 and use it with any standard qt mason jar.<br />Some have said that when using the separately bought strainer lid with their mason jars, it leaked at the threads.  The lid fits tight and snug on this product.<br /><br />Also, this jar is square shaped so it won't roll when set flat, unlike some older mason jars.<br /><br />I'm going to buy a sandwich blend of seeds, alfalfa alone is OK but not as peppy tasting for sandwiches. I suggest buyers order both alfalfa and a sandwich blend.<br /><br />Pressing a finger on the strainer lid gets the last remaining water out faster. A good draining is key to a good crop, it uncoats each seed of water and allows it to "breath."<br /><br />To de-husk my crop, I place a handful in a bowl of water and swish the crop around. Husks that rise to the top I scoop out along the side of the bowl, the remaining husks sink to the bottom. I lift out the sprouts and shake the water out or let drain on a plate.  I store in partially open plastic sandwich bags, they last longer if they can "breathe" a little.

review/summary: Don't let  water in fast enough through the lid
review/text: This sprounter jar was a little expensive for just being a plastic lid and glass canning jar.  The lid will be great for not rusting but the holes are small enough that the water was slow to go in for rinsing.  I don't want to have to take off the lid to rinse twice daily. I keep 5-7 jars going all the time in different stages of sprouting so I have at least one jar of sprouts ready to eat each day so I need to be fast at rinsing. I always sprout alfalfa seeds so could easily use larger holes anyway. I did get these Jars in a very short time after ordering so that was nice. I have a few lids that have stainless steel screens that fill really quick and rinse in a flash but still keep the seeds in. I like those lids better.

review/text: Sprouted successfully. The instructions say to have it on its side with the bottom tilted up a little so the water drains out the top. This is kinda awkward to arrange with the shape of the jar. I get good results just laying it flat on its side with a towel under it, but if you're worried about seeds rotting or bacteria growing in any pools of water (presumably this is why they want it tilted) just prop up the bottom with another folded towel or two for the right angle.

review/summary: Gently rinse and drain slowly, prevents mangled sprouts
review/text: I finally figured out how to sprout, rinse and not get the seedlings all tangled up in a big mess.  After about 3 days of rinsing as directed, I see the seedlings beginning their growth orienting the leaves upwards, while the roots mat at the bottom. Then I gently rinse, gently tilt sideways to drain, so I don't distrub the growth orientation.  I end up with sprouts that are not tangled, but with clear leaves UP roots DOWN orientation, like you would by in them in wholefoods supermarket.<br /><br />Love the rinsing once daily, prevents rotting. Sprinkle after each rinse with seaweed fertilizer solution. Fantastic.

Two heaping teaspooons make about 1 cup of great hot chocolate; you just add boiling water to the powder and stir. You end up having about 12 carbs per cup, a little more if you add milk to cool it down. Shelf life is about 17 months. Everyone in our family, including kids, LOVE it! You can fix it hot or cold, in milk or water. The cannister is perfect.

review/summary: Excellent dog food!
review/text: Currently I have a five months old bichon frise. When I first got him as a puppy, I thought I picked out the best food for him, Blue Buffalo at Petsmart. However, when I got home, I did more research and found Orijen. As owners of bichons, or malteses, or poodles know, they tend to have problems with tear staining because of their white fur. Since I already got him Blue Buffalo, I thought I'll finish it before switching. Because of the tomato pomace (it's the leftover tomato seed, pulp, and skin) in the ingredients list, he had tear staining problems. I did nightly cleanings of his eyes, but it was still noticeable.<br /><br />Now it's been a month since Orijen Puppy, and I just realized that it's been a few weeks since I had to clean his eyes. Even my friends who visit us constantly commented on just how clean and bright his eyes look.<br /><br />Besides helping with the tear staining, Orijen is an all-around great food. I've also noticed his coat has a sheen to it. His poops are solid, not too soft or hard. He loves it, gobbles it down each time. I am extremely excited about feeding him this awesome food! And I will whole-heartedly recommend this dog food to anyone. It's totally worth it.

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: dogfoodanalysis dot com rates all Orijen dog foods 6 out of 6. I had been feeding my puppy Natural Balance Organic Formula (no dairy, only one meat source), but after discovering that it was only rated a 4, I started looking into higher quality foods. Switching was super easy, my puppy loves Orijen. Since she's been on Orijen, I haven't noticed any smelly breath like she used to have, and her poop doesn't stink! I know it sounds crazy, I had read that in reviews about this food before, and could barely believe it but it's true. Orijen puppy has 10 total meat ingredients (it's 75% meat!), including fish, and no grains, which are not part of a wild dog's diet, instead having a good range of fruits and vegetables, as well as vitamins, minerals, and probiotics. All the ingredients Orijen uses are very high quality and their meat sources are closely monitored and sustainable. I've heard some people say that Orijen formulas are too rich for their dogs, so maybe don't try to switch from any really low end stuff. It is a high protein, low carb food, meant to mimic a wild dog's natural diet. I think this is about as close as you can get to that with a dry formula.<br />The only cons I can think of is that it's hard to find, there's only one place I can find that carries it locally (I live in the suburbs of Detroit, lots of pet supply stores...) and it costs $40 for the 15.4 lb bag there. The lowest I've seen it online was for 34.99, but with high shipping. But, I feel that providing premium food for my dog will ultimately save on vet bills later and improve quality of life for her, so I don't mind the cost so much.<br />Also, just FYI, Orijen does do a frequent buyer's program, after you buy 12 bags you get the 13th free. The local store I buy it from set me up, you have to keep receipts and the barcodes from the bags and it has to be the same size bag every time, but I don't think it has to be the same formula. It's kind of strict but I think it's going to be worth it by the time I need that 13th bag.

review/text: I bought a Toy Poodle last summer and found that he was getting really dry/flaky skin.  I was given some no-name food from the breeder and my vet suggested this may be the problem.  After recommendations and a search for the best dog food--I finally found it!  My boy absolutely loves it and his itchy skin was gone.  His coat is so much softer and shinier now.  I recently switched to Orijen Regional Red and he loves it even MORE!  If you can get a hold of some of that stuff I suggest you do.  It is a little pricier than the other Orijen formulas but I can almost guarantee your dog will love it.  Every time one of his puppy pals are over they're always sniffing and licking his empty bowl.  Worth every penny!

review/text: I have a pure white, 2lb, 5 month old, Morkie(maltese/yorkie mix).  We were having problems with staining around her mouth, feet, and HORRIBLE tear stains.  She was also constipated one day and then had toothpaste texture poo the next on her old dog food.(diamond puppy).  After a lot of research I decided to try Orijen Puppy.  AMAZING!! NO MORE SALIVA OR TEAR STAINS!! I can not tell you how much better she looks! her coat is even softer! as for her bowls, they are a nice, round, and firm.  She seems much happier and is a lot more active on this food than on her old food.  I was worried about the price at first, but with these results i would pay more!  I think ANYONE who owns a white dog and is having problems with the staining should give it a try! There is no fillers or Tomato Pumace, which is believed to cause staining in Maltese dogs.  I would give 10 stars if i could!!

Previously I was feeding my pup Blue Buffalo and wasn't having any problems.  I am now feeding 50/50 Orijen and Blue Buffalo to use up my stock of Blue Buffalo.  He loves the food but I honestly don't think he's too picky.  No issues and he seems happy.  I was a little concerned about the high protein content, particularly with the poster claiming liver damage to his dogs, but it appears he isn't a legitimate poster.  He posts that claim on every Orijen product and all over the net...no details and no follow-up.

review/text: We are currently switching our 5 month old Basenji from Wellness brand to Orijen puppy food and the little guy is actually picking out the Orijen and leaving the Wellness (we are mixing it to make the transition easier). Its nice to know that such a healthy dog food is also so palatable!

review/summary: Our Frenchies love Orijen Puppy Formula
review/text: We transitioned over to Orijen Puppy after getting a new pup and doing much research. Our 2 yr old Bella was eating not-so-good wet food, but loved Orijen instantly. Our puppy (now 6 months) loves it too. Bella has a lot less dandruff now, they also have less waste, but boy are they gasssssy! Gas has always been a problem with our Frenchies, but it is very common with this breed too. So, we are still very happy that we are feeding them the best food possible and their coat is beautiful, and less waste to pick up.

review/summary: Made my puppy fart horribly
review/text: When I first got my Shiba Inu puppy, I put him on this kibble. He liked it and had no health problems from eating it, except one which didn't bother him much, but made life hell for myself & my wife. While eating this food, the puppy would release huge, terribly smelling dog farts. He did this with alarming regularity, every 20-30 minutes my wife & I would look at each other, sniff the air, then promptly evacuate the room to escape an invisible cloud of deadly (DEADLY!) gas wafting over from the dog's direction.<br /><br />The puppy, being a dog, would usually follow us to wherever we ended up, only to administer another dose of the stench 30 minutes later. And so went the round robin, with all 3 of us changing the room we occupied twice an hour.<br /><br />We endured 3 weeks of this before switching to Wellness dry kibble which made the farting problem go away. The Wellness food is slightly worse as far as ingredient quality goes, but it's still very good so we're ok with using it.<br /><br />I'm still rating Orijen puppy food at 4 stars based on the ingredients, which are excellent. While on it, other than farting, the dog was happy and looked great, no problems with stool or health. So I'm not saying that this food is bad - in fact, I think it's one of the better ones out there. I am saying that every dog is different (surprise, surprise!) and that if you do decide to buy Orijen, start with the smallest bag to determine it works for you before committing to a bigger one. I now have about 13lbs of Orijen dog food left and no idea what to do with it.<br /><br />Actually, now that I write this, I know what to do with it. I'll ask a friend to watch my dog at their home for a few days next time we go on vacation, and provide him with Orijen puppy food. Then ask him how things went. Cruel, I know, but oh so funny!

review/summary: It's good
review/text: This is good. My puppy needs the best. This is pretty good. High in protein, good ingredients. Although I have a picky eater so he stopped eating it after a month. I had this and tried large breed but large puppy breed pieces are too large for my puppy. It smells like meat. A little dry.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: We have a 7 month old Havanese who has a very sensitive stomach.  He came to us with Royal Canin indoor puppy but he was scratching constantly.  I got him some generic puppy food thinking dog food is dog food right?  Wrong!  He ate it and liked it but about a week later had diarrhea.  We didnt know it was the food at first, but after reading the ingredients realized it was the corn in it causing his reaction.  I then began to do research and switched him to Nutro small bites with chicken meal, rice and oatmeal, also a bad idea.  He didnt even eat it, I mixed it with some chicken broth, which helped, but then the diarrhea returned.  So, I finally found Orijen!  I wish I had just gotten it in the first place.  He loves it and always begs for more although we don't give in because I dont want to over feed him.  But, there is no more itching, his poop is firm and round and since we're not feeding him as much now, the cost is not a factor.  I would definitely recommend this food to everyone.

review/summary: Great food, but gave my puppy terrible gas.
review/text: Researched puppy chows before adopting our Bassador and loved the mix of ingredients in Orijen. Unfortunately it gave our puppy terrible TERRIBLE gas. We were able to quickly identify that the food was behind the gas issue. We switched it up to Wellness 3 days later and the lethal gas is resolving. Still believe Orijen is a great product, just not for our puppy.

review/text: Found this on a consumer report website and it had the best reviews.  The ingredients are great and it's one of the best foods out there, but my dog just loves the food he was raised on, his royal canin puppy formula.  Maybe it's the smell and the shape?  Anyway, I swap back and fourth when the bags run out so he's happy and I'm happy :)

review/summary: Orijen Regular Puppy Food
review/text: Our rescue puppy was being fed Pro Plan and we switched to raw green tripe mixed with Orijen regular puppy food.  (We have had him for 3 weeks now.)<br /><br />He is doing very well on this mix.<br /><br />Energetic, firm stools, nice coat and overall health is excellent.<br /><br />So far, so good.<br /><br />(Note, one half of his diet is raw meat and bones.  Right now, green tripe the most raw meat, followed by beef neck bones and turkey necks.)<br /><br />ETA:  Oh, I forgot to say he is a Border Collie/Golden Retriever/GSD mix.  He is 3 months old and weighs 15 to 20lbs.

review/summary: great dog food
review/text: I slowly transitioned my pup to Orijen over a period of 2 months and she is now on Orijen completely. She is presently losing her teeth (she is 5 months old to date) and she seems to be swallowing the Orijen kibbles instead of chewing them. The Orijen kibbles seem harder than her previous dry puppy food but comes out in her poop appearing digested (even at present as she swallows them) compared to the old puppy food which still appeared like round kibbles in her poop. Her coat looks great and her poop is softer yet formed. Her poop does not stink with the bad smell it had with her previous puppy food product although it does have a quite distinct smell since being on Orijen. She has also been passing gas with the same distinct smell but I do not mind this at all. I am guessing that it probably is because of protein by-products. I am very pleased with this product.

review/text: This is an excellent dog food.  When I switched my Labradoodle puppy over to Orijen she had no problem whatsoever digesting it.  It is difficult to find this dog food at pet stores in my area.  However, when ordering on line, it is sometimes a long wait for your shipment due to this product's popularity.  A lot of pet supply websites are sold out.  So when you are somewhat near running out be sure to order ASAP as it may take some time to get it.

review/text: this product has turned a pleasant smelling 5 month old puppy into a dog that smells worse septic tank. A few people have been claiming liver damage, I'd doubt that. Dogs do eat protein diets naturally, and there are a lot of disreputable vets out there. That said, something in this product is just not for my dog. If you can live with the stench maybe try this food.

review/summary: WARNING:  Please read before feeding
review/text: WARNING:  I use to feed my dogs Orijen 75% protein but the last few months my dogs have had really bad diarrhea.  We thought one would need IV fluids because he was getting dehydrated.  I looked at the bag and saw they now changed to 80% protein and now use sodium selenite which I would never buy a food with this ingredient.  Instead of getting better they are getting worse.  80% protein is a lot for a non working dog. And now with the recall, I have to look for another brand of dog food with selenium yeast, no ethoxyquin, no BHT etc. Also, the company that once was great in customer service now refuses to answer e-mail questions.  What are they hiding.  This use to be a good quality dog food that I use to recommend to everyone.  When I returned the 80% protein bag back the girl said a lot of people have been complaining and they aren't recommending this brand anymore.

review/text: I tried wellness and evo, but my puppy had loose stool.  so I studied and gave orijin puppy food, my puppy's stool got worse and she refuse to eat Orijin puppy food.  Now I have changed to other brand(dehydrated food-addiction), she likes it and seems working well so far.  Maybe Orijin was too much protein to her. I liked orijin product, so I was bit disappointed.  Maybe when she gets bigger, I may try adult Orijin.

This food is way to high in fat calories and especially protein. While the ingredients may be great even to much of a great thing can be dangerous. If you feed this food get your dogs liver checked regularly which as I have found out is expensive and be prepared to lose your dog if you dont

review/text: I picked up my first small tin of this at a Starbucks - and now I'm hooked!  I'm usually a Lady Grey kind of girl... like Earl Grey, but lighter and more lemony-orangey.  This tea is even lighter-tasting and with more citrus flavor.  Plus - they come in little pyramid-shaped SILK bags!!  I'm kind of a tea snob, so this was perfect for me.  It turned my precious tea time into an escape!!  It smells decadent and tastes delicious even without sugar!  I'm loving the white teas... it's too bad this particular one is only available in stores in the winter.  Thank goodness for Amazon!!

However, if it's left to brew too long, the flavor can get a little bitter, so just watch how long the tea bag sits in the cup and you'll be sure to enjoy your cup of tea.<br /><br />A great white tea that I recommend!

Brew your white teas with care or you may recieve a bitter cup of tea.  Harney and Sons makes the great flavor of loose tea available by putting real loose tea in these little silk sachets for ease.  Each tea bag, brewed properly (the directions are on the tin), can yield two cups of tea.  This is my favoite white, I would whole heartedly recommend it.

review/summary: Great Food for the Money
review/text: I spent a great deal of time researching premium dog foods on the internet and at my local Natural Pet Foods store when I finally came to realize what a subpar product that Science Diet has been producing and calling themsleves a "premium" product.  Once I learned what constitutes a quality kibble, i.e. meat and meat based products, no corn fillers, chelated minerals, all natural products - I could go on and on.  Based on the quality of ingredients, the high ratings given by a number of respected dog food reviews and forums, and its price point, I decided to give Chicken Soup For The Dog Lover's Soul a try.  I did a slow changeover with my 7 year old chocolate lab in order to use up the balance of the old food.  After now several months on the new Chicken Soup food, I feel comfortable in stating that this is probably the best dog food kibble you can buy for the money.  My lab loves it - her poops are firm and effortless - her coat has a sheen and luster that we never saw with the Science Diet - her minor dandruff problem has disappeared - she doesn't scratch or itch at all - and she looks forward to her mealtimes.  Yes, there are higher quality kibbles available, but at his price point and with this list of quality ingredients, you can feel comfortable that you are feeding your dog a premium quality dog food without breaking your budget.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Top food for a great price!
review/text: We all know we can't afford Innova or Orijen, which is one of the best foods you can possibly feed your dog. A lot of people buy Iams, myself included, for our dogs. Then there are the people who continue to buy Beneful and Old Roy and Pedigree and don't realize that you are basically buying corn, which your dog cannot digest and will essentially poop out! So you are just throwing your money into fertilizing your yard! LOL Dogfoodanalysis.com has a great rating system and reviews all dog foods and rates them with stars. 6 being the highest. To put this into perspective, Iams is a 1 star dog food, based off of its ingredients. This food, Chicken soup for the Soul is a 4 star food. Blue Buffalo is also a 4 star food, but costs twice as much! Iams sells at Walmart for $17.88 for an 18 pound bag so .99 a pound. I would typically feed my dog 2 1/2 cups of Iams. This food, as of the time of this review is $39.99 for 35 pounds,so $1.14 a pound. And I would only give my dog 2 cups. Think about it, if you ate fillers all day long and food with very little nutritional value, you are going to eat more. But if you ate food with more substance, that was healthier, you would actually eat less. This is the same for dogs. So many people run out and buy Kibble and Bits because you can get a huge bag for $10, but you end up feeding your dog 3-4 cups and blow through the bag in a matter of days. They don't realize that if they buy a better quality food, you actually feed your dog less. Not to mention they would be on a healhier diet.<br /><br />I think for the money and the quality this is an excellent dog food choice. It's middle of the road, not insanely expensive, but not super cheap. And the quality is far above par in my book.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken, turkey, chicken meal, ocean fish meal, cracked pearled barley, whole grain brown rice, oatmeal, millet, white rice, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), potatoes, egg product, tomato pomace, duck, salmon, flaxseed, natural chicken flavor, choline chloride, dried chicory root, kelp, carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries, spinach, dried skim milk, cranberry powder, rosemary extract, parsley flake, yucca schidigera extract, L-carnitine, Enterococcus faecieum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevesiae fermentation solubles, dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D supplement, folic acid.<br /><br />Guaranteed analysis:<br />Crude Protein 24.0% Minimum<br />Crude Fat 14.0% Minimum<br />Crude Fiber 3.0% Maximum<br />Moisture 10.0% Maximum<br />Sodium 0.3% Maximum<br />Zinc 150 mg/kg Minimum<br />Selenium 0.4 mg/kg Minimum<br />Vitamin E 300 IU/kg Minimum<br />Omega-6 Fatty Acids * 2.2% Minimum<br />Omega-3 Fatty Acids * 0.4% Minimum

review/text: I started buying this brand of food when my dog had a litter of puppies (I bought the puppy-lover's bag).  I loved that it has wholesome ingredients, and that "meat" is the first ingredient on the list.  Look through the bags of dog foods at your grocer and you'll see that meat isn't first or second, and then when you find it you'll find it only contains "meat by-products."  My pets have had a healthy coat & firm stools eating this brand of dog food, and you can't beat the price.  The added chelated minerals and natural preservatives create a holistic pet food.  I will continue to feed this to my dogs and recommend it to my friends as well.

review/summary: Excellent food, excellent value
review/text: I have been researching and studying canine nutrition since about 1988. Ironically, my interest sprang from a program that Hill's (makers of Science Diet) used to offer called the Small Animal Dietician program. I completed all levels that they offered and learned quite a bit about food, most especially, NOT to feed Science Diet, lol.<br />That being said, I have been showing and breeding dogs for over 20 years. I have tried virtually every high end food on the market: Core, EVO, The Honest Kitchen, Before Grain, Prairie, Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Canidae, California Natural....I could go on. The *extremely* high protein content in some of those foods can be quite dangerous, especially for puppies. I just had to euthanize my 3 year old Staffordshire Bull Terrier in December due to kidney failure, and I am certain it was brought on by being on Before Grain, Orijen & EVO as a puppy.<br />Chicken Soup is a fantastic food and a great value. I am currently feeding it to my Bullmastiff and 2 Chihuahuas, one of whom is almost 16 years old. It is my exclusive food now and as long as they don't change the formula, I see no reason to switch to another food again. The price for the quality of food in unbeatable. I'm very happy to see it offered on Amazon now with free shipping! Makes things even better!

review/summary: Beneficial to health, great value, dog loves it; best kibble I've ever purchased
review/text: To initially sum this review up: I am so glad I bought this food for my dog. This is an excellent quality dog food and is a great value. Not only does my dog absolutely love it, but it has had many noticeable benefits to his health.<br /><br />I have an 18 month old chocolate lab, and unlike every other Labrador Retriever, he does not eat anything and everything. He is very picky about his kibble. For months, I was buying every kind of dog food, and never found a single brand that he was excited to eat. Normally, he would sniff the food, walk away, and return minutes later only because he was starving. For the past month, I had settled on Beneful, because he seemed to enjoy it more than any other food. Granted, he obviously wasn't ecstatic about it, but he usually finished it all. However, I eventually realized that I had to focus more on what he enjoyed. First off, he has several problems with his stomach. His stomach growls constantly, he belches, and he's occasionally gassy. He also throws up often and worst of all, he has trouble using the bathroom. He often appeared either constipated or his stool was very soft. Very worried, I made an appointed for a vet visit. My veterinarian instructed me to stop feeding him supermarket dog foods because they were all, for the most part, of terrible quality and not helping my dog at all. He told me all about reading ingredient labels on dog food, what to look for and what to avoid and went on to say that if I wanted to help ease my dog's discomfort, my only option was to buy a high quality dog food. I was reluctant because I knew that along with high quality comes a high price- except in this case, that is.<br /><br />I searched Amazon and found Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul. A 35 pound bag was only $40, and I had been paying $16.99 for a 15 pound bag of that Beneful crap. So obviously the price was great. Furthermore, it appeared to be a high quality food--no bad fillers and REAL MEAT as the primary ingredients, and the reviews were all positive. So I bought it, and I will never buy anything else.<br /><br />The first day I fed my dog Chicken Soup, he practically inhaled it. He LOVED it, which lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. He is actually excited about eating kibble now, doesn't hesitate to eat, and can't get enough of Chicken Soup. But the best benefit: he is so much healthier. His stomach problems seemed to have ceased altogether. I have not seen him throw up once, and when he has to use the bathroom, he is not constipated, nor are his stools runny or soft. He is able to go effortlessly and best of all, he doesn't go as often. He is not gassy and I never hear his stomach rolling. Moreover, his coat looks shinier and his bark sounds healthier. And did I mention: NO MORE STOMACH PROBLEMS!<br /><br />I returned to my veterinarian, and though he had never heard of Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, I brought him the ingredients label and he said it appeared to be a kibble of great quality. But the best evidence I had to show him: my dog. He is a thousand times more healthy, and my vet (as well as myself) was so pleased to see the turnaround.

review/summary: My Opinion
review/text: I was a Veterinary Technician for 12 years and my Vets have recommended this food to me for my own dogs. The Vets I worked for don't sell dog food like a lot of Vets do and this is the food they fed their own personal dogs. My dog has been on it his entire life (10 years old), he was on the puppy formula as a pup, then adult formula from 1-8 years old, and now he's on the senior formula which adds Glucosamine/Chondroiton in the food. He truly is the picture of health. He's a Yellow Labrador and he's in remarkably great physical condition, he even jogs 5 miles a day with me every single day. I have never had any problems with this food and my dog loves it. I love their ingredients (Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Salmon, etc.) most of which is their first ingredients and their quality is second to none, can't beat it for the price.

review/summary: Cost Effective Premium Food
review/text: At just over $1 per pound, Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul is the least costly brand of truly premium dog food.  There are no fillers (despite what another reviewer claimed) and the only possible improvement is to not use "meal" but "organic meats".  However, such foods cost at least $2 per pound i.e. double the cost, or even over $3 per pound.<br /><br />Nonetheless, those very critical reviewers should turn their attention to human food.  What is called "meat" in processed food such as sausages (skin, offals, a lot of chemicals, cereals...), frozen meals should be given perhaps more criticism than dog food.

review/text: I researched food extensively when preparing for my German Shepherd puppy.  I eventually settled on Canidae for the quality and price.  Unfortunately the store that carried it was just way out of my way for routine pick-ups.  I hadn't gone w/ CS because I couldn't find it at the specialty pet shops around.  To my surprise my hometown feed store carried it and it was less than the Canidae.  He's had this since he was a pup and his coat is always shiny.  He's a long-coated shepherd so it really shows.<br /><br />Trust me.  Get this.  Now that Amazon is offering free shipping on it I'll buy it here from now on.

review/summary: Best bang for the buck for GOOD dry dog food.
review/text: I'm a skeptic.  I've researched way too much about the available food for dogs out there.  In my search for something to feed my dogs, I had to balance my desire to not feed them the corn-laden garbage (which they cannot digest) sold in most supermarkets, against the $80+ per bag the premium foods cost.  I even considered going to BARF (biologically appropriate raw food) but it's just too much work for me.<br /><br />This is excellent dog food at an excellent price.  I switched my dogs from Eukanuba and they were practically inhaling it at mealtimes!  No problems switching, firm stools, and healthy dogs...done!

review/summary: Great Food!
review/text: I have a 2 year old Boxer/Lab mix that I recently switched over to Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul. He absolutely loves it, it's affordable, and I feel like I am actually feeding him something healthy, as opposed to the horrible mess that makes up most dog food.<br /><br />I think it's important for people to note: You need to prep your dog for the switch, you can't just give him new food and expect him to be okay. You need to ease the transition to the new food, mixing the food over a 7-10 day period, slowly at first, then more and more added in. It's funny how dogs can literally eat ANYTHING and be okay; they can eat shoes, socks, leaves, grass, wood, pickles, etc, and they are fine....but heaven forbid you switch their food too quickly, that'll mess them up! Dogs are crazy :)<br /><br />So, anyways. The ingredients in this product are top notch, and after 2 weeks of use I feel like he is consuming slightly LESS food, but I feel he is getting the same nutritional value as the less healthy brands. I am really glad I made the switch, and with Prime shipping it's a breeze to get this food in 2 days, whenever I need it!

review/summary: Great food
review/text: You can't beat the ingredients in this food for the price, all of our dogs love it and do great on it. You can pay more for garbage foods like Eukanuba, Iams and Science Diet but WHY? The first FOUR ingredients in this food are MEAT..not corn or unknown meat by-products..also includes duck and salmon farther down the list. When you feed better quality food you feed LESS food, a lot of people don't realize that. I have a yellow lab, a carolina dog, an eskimo and a pom, the 35 lb bag of Chicken Soup last just about a month. When I moved in my b/f was feeding his dogs Dog Chow (which in his defense he thought was good food, being a "name brand" and all he had NO clue he was feeding them McDonalds every day) and was going through 30 lbs a month just for his 2 (the eskie and the pom).<br />Are there better foods out there? Sure for a bigger price tag and most of the same ingredients. I would say this is one of the best quality foods you can buy at this price point, really it isn't much more than that bag of Dog Chow or similar food and when you figure in that you would feed about 1/2 of what you are now you end up saving.

review/text: I've been buying different versions of Purina food for the last 12 years of my dogs life. Just whatever I could find at the grocery that sounded healthier than the last. After researching it some, I've come to realize you can't buy a good dog food at the grocery. I just bought one bag of this a few weeks ago and all the licking issues we've had with him forever have gone away instantly. No waking us up in the middle of the night with his licking, or annoying constant licking while you're just sitting there. We've been putting allergy medicine in with his food for the last few years, and I haven't even used that for the last few weeks. It's amazing the level of relief for all of us. Including the dog I'm sure. He seems much more relaxed. I feel bad for not changing to something better earlier. There has definitely been an increased level of gas coming from him, but that is much more tolerable believe it or not than the licking.

review/summary: Chicken Soup Dry Dog Food is a Savior!!!
review/text: My pooper became mine due to neglect of owner (they abandoned him at my house for what was supposed to be a week... and 3 years later he still lives with me). We did not see eye to eye for a time but I fell hard for him! But I am a busy working girl and student with a very tight budget and no knowledge about dog food. For the first year I bought him the knock off version of kibbles and bits from walmart and he packed on so many pounds that I became concerned. I started to research and found that it was doggie mcdonalds. So, I opted to spend a little bit more money and for the next year bought him pedigree. He continued to pack on the pounds! I researched further and found that pedigree was not a much better choice and I was paying more for it! Then I found chicken soup! According to the research it seems to be a great dog food. It is very reasonable priced and I love the free shipping!!! No more lugging around a 40 pound bag once a month! He is already losing some weight and regaining his waist line. But my favorite part... is how he looks up from every bite to show how much he appreciates it. It seems to be his favorite dog food ever, and good for him! I will be sticking with this brand for a while, as long as he continues to move towards a healthier weight! Thank you!

review/summary: One of the few quality dog foods for German Shepherds
review/text: I've had GSDs for about 20 years.  During that time, I have tried a vast array of dog foods, always trying to get the best possible nutrition for my dogs.  But the top end dog foods, e.g., Innova EVO, Timberwolf  Wild & Natural, etc., all caused diarrhea -- despite a slow introduction by mixing with the prior food types.<br /><br />My two GSDs are a small sample, so it is likely not the case that all GSDs can't tolerate these products, but for mine they do.<br /><br />So, my alternative has been an old faithful:  Iams Lamb and Rice.  While not as good as the higher end foods by a long shot, that version of Iams is/was well-tolerated by my GSDs.  One lived 14 years on it.<br /><br />The only other -- better -- food that I've found that my GSD tolerates is Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul.  And because it also has objectively better ingredients than the Iams (more meat, less processed materials) -- all for the same price -- I am sticking with it.

review/summary: LOVE this dogfood !!
review/text: We switched our 5 dogs (mini-doxy, 2 border collie mixes, lab, & shih tzu) to this food from Pedigree last spring. We had been having trouble with loose stools on the lab and shih tzu & itchy bodies on the border collies . We had been mixing wet Pedigree w/dry. I noticed a slight color change in the dry bag one day and a consistency change in the canned and shortly after we had very soft stool problems with my 2 small dogs. After researching online, I was shocked about the research findings of all these dry foods. For many years we fed Science Diet but changed to Pedigree for cost reasons and because it seemed to be such a popular food, readily available and ran all those tender commercials on tv !! It made me sad to think we've fed poor quality food to our pets all this time. Like the other reviews, I agree the quality and price are fantastic. You can find better food for many more dollars but if you're feeding several like we are then this is a food you will be secure feeding. Some of our dogs are old and some used to be picky eaters but they clean the bowls quickly and have shiny coats, no itching, solid stool & lots of energy. You won't go wrong choosing this food for your four-footed furry friends !

review/summary: WE LOVE IT!  More nutrient dense food for our dogs! They LOVE IT!
review/text: I spent ALOT of time researching dogfood, and although we wanted a quality food, we just couldn't see spending over a hundred a month on their food.  So, I researched the researchers' recommendations and was happy to find this rated highly and up with the more expensive brands.  The name so cute that I would have bypassed it as just an advertising gimmick to appeal to sentimentally inclined customers  but the recommendation on a very picky dog food analysis site impressed me.<br />  We've found it to be very nutrient dense...the dogs need less to feel and look great.  They actually gained weight on it, and we had to cut back.  We have an AUSSIE and a MINIATURE POODLE we adopted. (We still can't believe we have this small poodle dog...but she is a terrier in her heart and has plenty of energy to keep up with the Aussie. We let her original owner (family)take her once a week for sleepovers which she loves.) She was on the Chicken Soup for puppies and she took off on this, and is actually large for her breed.<br />  Their coats are dense and great shape, eyes are bright, and skin great. No ear infections, allergies, or teeth scale buildup. We had an Airedale that had horrible allergies for which we tried everything from the vet.  Finally, put him on flaxseed and omega-3 fish oil tablets, and we got him off the cortisone.  This food seems to have the oils and nutrients for good health maintenance.<br />They love their food...always excited to eat it.  My husband says they just can't wait to dig into it.  They love it so much that we keep some in a little canister used for treats during the day. They think a kibble is a BIG deal.  Who are we to argue?  Also, we've never had it get stale smelling or off smelling like other more natural dog foods.<br />  This is our 3rd order, and we'd love to see it become an item that you can have sent on schedule plan so we could save even more.<br />I could be a spokesman for this food! I only wish we could had known of it for all our other adopted dogs:  Irish Setter, Standard Schnauzer, Airedale.  They would have loved it.

When I read the rave reviews on this product, I ordered it. Not only is it an excellent value for an extremely high quality dog food, my dogs no longer require wet food on top to encourage them to eat it. They absolutely love it. I'm using less food - it takes less to fill them up and they stay full longer; plus their stools are no longer loose and the gas problem is going away. If you've ever slept with two English bulldogs, you'll understand the 'gas' part !<br /><br />We may have settled on Chicken Soup for life !

review/text: Got this for my lab, who is far from a fussy eater.  Wanted to get her something healthy and not break the bank.  This seems to fit the bill.  Comes in a 35 lb bag so I don't have to reorder too often.

review/text: This food has given my dog the softest shiniest coat! I adopted a really underweight pitbull mix 3 weeks ago, and he was really skinny. I can hardly see that dog now. He's filling out and looks so much healthier. After I feed him, he's always looking for more.<br /><br />(I saw some reviews about soft stools and initially thought it was the food; turns out it was parasites. Once he was medicated, his stools were fine.)

review/summary: USED TO BE the perfect balance between "premium" and "affordable", UNTIL PRICE INCREASE
review/text: I'm sad.  I used to be able to purchase a 35 lb bag of this dogfood from Amazon for $39.99 with free shipping and my dogs liked the food.  The jump in price is why I'm dropping my rating from 5 stars to 3 and I will no longer purchase this food from Amazon. I'll be going back to my local feed & hardware store to see if I can find a good dogfood that's affordable.<br /><br />My previous review:<br />I love buying this food for my dogs!  I like knowing I'm getting a semi-premium food, with meat as the first ingredient, yet it's still affordable. I have five dogs of my own, plus foster dogs, and they seem to love this food. None of them ever opt to "skip" a meal or leave any pieces behind like they do occasionally with other brands I've tried them on.  This is the perfect dog food for owners who care what their dogs eat, but aren't able to cook for them or afford the more expensive premium brands.

review/summary: Good stuff, my dog likes it
review/text: When I got my dog, I made the decision to feed him "premium" dog food.  Unfortunately, this was getting to be an expensive prospect, with the cost of shipping big bags of dog food from other online sites.  Having recently signed up for Amazon Prime, I decided to seek out a Prime eligible dog food on Amazon.  I came across Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, and it's been a hit with my miniature dachshund.  He's somewhat of a picky eater, but eats this stuff rather enthusiastically.  When you factor in the free shipping with Amazon Prime, this dog food is quite affordable.<br /><br />No complaints from me on this one.  I'll continue feeding it as long as Amazon offers it for a reasonable price with free shipping.  Good stuff.

review/summary: Very Impressed
review/text: I have an American Pit Bull Terrier and Australian Cattle Dog. Both switched over great from their previous Nature's Recipe lamb and rice diet (it was very grain heavy). I did a lot of research to find the best dog food for under $40 and I'm quite certain this is it.<br /><br />The bag was fresh when it arrived, it has high meat ingredients, it's easy on the wallet, my dogs seem sharper and more energetic (probably because of the protein increase), and they love it. I will continue to buy unless something like the price or ingredients change.<br /><br />The price I paid: $39.99 + free shipping<br /><br />Here are the ingredients as they appeared at the time of writing this (matched with the bag):<br /><br />Chicken, turkey, chicken meal, turkey meal, cracked pearled barley, whole grain brown rice, oatmeal, millet, white rice, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), potatoes, egg product, tomato pomace, duck, salmon, ocean fish meal, flaxseed, natural chicken flavor, potassium chloride, salt, choline chloride, dried chicory root, dried kelp, carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries, spinach, dried skim milk, cranberries, rosemary extract, parsley flake, yucca schidigera extract, L-Carnitine, dried Enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried Lactobacillus casei fermentation product and dried Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried Trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D supplement, folic acid.

review/summary: Lexi loves her Chicken Soup
review/text: My 55lb lab mix Lexi loves her Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Adult Dog food.  What a great deal too!  Wow!!  For such a great quality food, this is such a great buy.  I feed my dog even less that what the package recommends.  A lot of people who don't want to spend a little more money on high quality foods don't realize that yes, you spend more per pound, but your pet does not need nearly as much food as the cheaper low quality brands since the high quality brands like Chicken Soup are not loaded with fillers.  A great, low cost dog food. Try it!

review/summary: Good Dog Food
review/text: The first four ingredients in the food are all named meat products. The first two of these are meat inclusive of water content (about 80%) and once that is removed it is likely that these ingredients would be more accurately placed somewhat further down the ingredient list (ingredients are listed in order of weight). However, since it is followed by two meat meal ingredient, our confidence in the meat content of the food is increased. We do note that this is followed by five grains, potatoes and tomato pomace ahead of the fat content, and this diminishes our confidence, making the food appear to be heavy in grain/carbohydrate content.<br /><br />There are further meat ingredients 14th and 15th on the ingredient list, though these are too far down to make up a substantive portion of the food.<br /><br />The main grains in the food are barley, rice (two forms), oatmeal and miller. These are low-allergenic and a good quality source of carbohydrates and additional protein. Potatoes are a further carbohydrate and protein source. Flaxseed is a good quality source of Omega 6 and Omega 3 essential fatty acids and the food contains a nice range of fruits and vegetables. We would prefer to see the use of whole eggs rather than egg product in the food.<br /><br />The manufacturer is guaranteeing the use of ethoxyquin-free meat and fish sources in their foods and a statement to that effect has been placed on the front page of their website.<br /><br />Overall this is a great food! However, these high quality foods such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W5P0W6">Orijen Adult Formula Dry Dog Food</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BRD63I">Acana Provincial Prairie Harvest Grain Free Dry Dog Food</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YUGAG">Blue Buffalo Adult Dog Dry Food, Chicken and Rice Recipe, 15-Pound Bag</a> are better for your pet.

review/text: The food seemed to work well for my dogs.  I ordered a couple of bags and it seemed to last well. Returning to view my previous order I see the price has increased from $39.99 with free shipping to the new outrageous price.  Amazon can't maintain pricing and will soon be paying state taxes.  Sad you can't find a reliable supplier.

review/summary: HUGE Price Increase!!!
review/text: It used to be 5 stars for the price, but now it's just like all the rest of the expensive dog food. I have been feeding my Rottweiler Blue Buffalo since she was a puppy.  We soon got tired of running to the store and paying high prices, so I did research and found this awesome dog food at a great price.  This actually even got rid of her HORRID gas she has always constantly had on Blue Buffalo.  Not paying this price though now that it ends up costing me more than Blue Buffalo. I guess I'll try Canidae dog food and see how she does on that, which I was going to try before I found Chicken Soup for a better price. Now Canidae is the most reasonably priced good quality dog food. BOO Amazon or Chicken Soup (whoever raised the prices)!

review/text: My picky little pekinese loves this food. My poodle loves it too,but he'll eat anything.  I'm really glad to have found a good dog food for my little munchkin.  The pieces are about 1/2" wide, and 1/4" deep - flat round shape.  They scarf this food up and after going through bags of expensive brands that the pekinese wouldn't eat i started making my own dog food, which is lots of work.  After reading all the good reviews I decided to try once more and problem solved in our household.  Two happy buddies!

review/text: I am always reluctant to change my dogs' diet. I felt they needed a better food and this one has two thumbs up! I changed them over completely in about 2 weeks and both are known for sensitive stomachs. They both have done great on this food and I am glad to know they are getting a better diet. One of my dogs is a very picky eater and HE even likes it. I will definitely keep both my dogs on this food.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED
review/text: I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. Just though I'd give a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/summary: Inability to handle numerous proteins
review/text: I switched my two boston terriers (one is 16 pounds and the other is 24 pounds) to Chicken Soup over a 10 day period.  I noticed they had considerable gas, but assumed it was a temporary condition from switching to a new food.  Once they were only on the Chicken Soup, they had diarrhea, black and tarry stools.  I immediately switched them back to Science Diet.  I contacted the company and asked if they knew what could have casued this digestive upset - they responded that the numerous protein sources were probably the cause.  So maybe boston terriers don't do well with this type of premium dog food.  I would recommend you purchase a small bag first, in case it doesn't work out.
