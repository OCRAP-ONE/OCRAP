review/summary: hard to find, very tasty
review/text: Confit, (Websters) pronounced kon-fee  "a garnish made usually from fruit or vegetables that are cooked until tender in a seasoned liquid"<br /><br />This is really tasty!  We searched for it at the local grocery store, zip, nada, zilch.  Lots of internet recipes for how to make your own.  Too much bother.  It was required in a recipe we wanted to try, so we decided to have a jar shipped to us.  It made the dish really great.  Then I tried it on my next hamburger.  Wow, love it.  My wife said it made her tummy unhappy later, but her system generally has the same response to all onions.  So if you're OK with onions, you'll love the sweet onion confit.

review/summary: Love the sauce hate the cost
review/text: I love this sauce. Unfortunately I now live in an area that doesnt have an asian market. I came on here to order some and I thought the price was kinda spendy for so little. I used to get these all the time, in the previous place I used to live I used to get the 16.4 ounce bottles for 3.95. they sent me 2 16.4 ounce bottles instead of 4 6.4 ounce bottles, so I actually got 6 ounces more than normal but at 2X the cost. but considering shipping was spendy and it took a month for them to get here, at 25$ for 2 bottles I will never be doing this again. buyer beware, if you are looking to get some of these, its in your best interest to contact someone from another town and have them look for you, itd be far cheaper.

review/summary: Works Well For Fine Hair
review/text: I used this conditioner with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8AC">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo</a> for a week, and I was very happy with the results.<br /><br />Even though I do not color or over-style my hair, it gets dry & has fly-away static if I don't use any conditioner. The problem is that I have fine hair, so almost all conditioners weigh it down - even the ones that claim to enhance fullness/body, but this Clear Boost conditioner worked exactly as described.<br /><br />My hair looks healthy with a noticeable lift, so I will continue using this brand.

review/summary: Great Conditioner!
review/text: My hair is fine and straight. (ok, it's limp) I normally use Aveda products on my hair because of how they add volume and rinse out so well. I switched my Aveda Full Volume Conditioner out for the Clear Scalp and really didn't expect much but I was pleasantly surprised! The conditioner is fresh smelling and light.I only used a bit on the ends of my hair and more on the scalp towards the front. If you have fine hair you know conditioner can be filmy and just weight everything down. It seemed to rinse nicely and when I blow-dryed it, my hair felt soft and yes, fuller. It was humid today and my hair is still bouncy and not flat. I will use this product again and that's saying something because I am one picky hair product person!

review/summary: Conditions well yet doesn't weigh down my long hair
review/text: This conditioner is wonderful.  It has a very fragrant and fresh smell.  After I applied this to my long hair, I was able to run my comb through much easier than when I use my other conditioners (such as Biosilk, Pantene, Tresemme, etc.).<br /><br />I let my hair air dry and the fresh scent remained.  My hair (especially the ends) also had bounce without being weighed down or flat.  I love this conditioner and really like the sleek light lilac bottle it comes in (especially since my bathroom is light purple).  After reviewing this product, I just ordered this conditioner and their volumizing shampoo on Amazon's subscribe and save program.<br /><br />From now on this will be one of my conditioners; I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Makes your hair fall out...
review/text: I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.<br /><br />Within one month my hair was falling out. Not just a little, A LOT. Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling out.<br /><br />Thought it might be Thryoid, hormones or something else. Went to the doctor and had all blood work done. Everything FINE!<br /><br />I read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....<br /><br />Quit using the shampoo and went BACK to Pantene. Within 2 weeks, my hair was slowing down in falling out. Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.<br /><br />Called the manufacturer and complained. They said this was unusual... I advised them to check customers comments on Amazon.<br /><br />They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...<br /><br />If you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck. If your hair starts to fall out, remember this comment. IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FALL OUT.

review/summary: Great cost performance
review/text: This looked like a woman's product, so I gave it to the missus. Here's what she had to say:<br /><br />I had never heard of the Clear brand before and had some doubt about the quality level. My doubt came from the low price and sort-of-cheap bottle design. I usually pay $10 to $20 for a bottle of conditioner from name brands such as Frederic Fekkai, Paul Mitchell, Redken, Pureology and The Body Shop. I didn't think it fair to compare Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Daily Conditioner with products in this price range, but I can say that the quality of the Clear conditioner is comparable with some of the conditioners mentioned above. It has nice fragrance, conditions my hair with only a small amount of liquid, makes my hair look healthy and shiny, and after using for a week, it made my hair more manageable when used together with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8A2">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>. Although I won't say the quality of Clear conditioner is equal or better than my favorites, I can say the cost performance of Clear conditioner is great. The only thing I don't like is the bottle design. I don't like the inexpensive-looking (well, it is inexpensive), light lavender-color, curved-shape bottle. Although I thought it's a smart idea to place the dispenser at the bottom, I wish it had a nozzle dispenser or round shape so that it's easier to hold with wet hands. When I have an empty bottle of one of my regular shampoos, I may transfer the liquid to it so that my bathroom looks better and I feel better!

My hair is color-treated and dry, and my hair is thin but I have lots of it. I'm always pressed for time in the morning so I shampoo, then put a tiny, less than pea-sized amount of this root boost conditioner in my hand, apply it to my hair, and I LEAVE IT IN, no rinsing it out! It doesn't make my hair greasy or flat, in fact, I've never seen it so full.

review/summary: Leaves hair soft with no tangles
review/text: This is the second Clear Scalp conditioner I have tried (the first one was for color-treated and/or damaged hair.) I have long fine hair.  I found this to be a great conditioner.  It leaves your hair very soft.  I often have a problem with tangles after using many other conditioners, but with this conditioner, my hair has almost no tangles.  However, I did not find that it left my hair with greater volume than normal.  It does not weigh my hair down at all, but I didn't notice the volume boost as advertised.  Overall though, I really like this conditioner.  I think it is better than many salon conditioners I have tried, so I definitely recommend it.  Just don't expect it to work miracles on the volume of your hair.

review/summary: Leaves Your Hair Soft & Smelling Fantastic!
review/text: I have straight, long, highlighted hair that is thick, but looks thin. I use both shampoo and conditioner on a daily basis and I normally alternate between Herbal Essences, Pantene Pro-V and Aussie. I actually used this conditioner with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR89S">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Damage & Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> since I also received that from Vine.<br /><br />The conditioner is thick and creamy. It has a really nice sweet smell. The scent smells great, but is not overpowering. It washes out of the hair easily and leaves it smelling nice all day long. It also makes my hair feel soft and like it has a little more volume without weighing it down. Like the shampoo, this conditioner reminds me of Pantene Pro-V. It is similar in thickness, texture and feel.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend trying this conditioner out to see how you like it. I love it and I will be buying more CLEAR products.

review/summary: As good as the shampoo, with one problem
review/text: I like this conditioner almost as much as the shampoo, though I'm not sure that it "volumizes" as well as the shampoo does.  One other thing that I've noticed is that my hair starts looking oily sooner than it did using another conditioner.  I wash my hair frequently and with this, I had to even more frequently.  But it has a nice texture and smell, and my hair feels and looks pretty good right after shampooing, so I was pleased.  One other note:  Just like with the shampoo, I hate the shape of the bottle.  It's little at the bottom and bigger at the top, which makes it top-heavy and liable to tip over.  Still, most of the time it's in my storage pocket in the shower, so it's not a big problem.

review/text: Beautiful hair starts with healthy hair. Although I've been very happy with Pantene for some time, I was very interested when I saw CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner. I expected something light and effective without much of an aroma.<br /><br />The conditioner works well enough, but is not any better than my Pantene products. Worse, it has a heavy perfume smell that I don't like at all.<br /><br />This conditioner definitely leaves the hair soft and tangle free, but my hair has no more volume than when I use Pantene.<br /><br />I will finish this bottle, but will go back to Pantene when I am done. I like its clean, fresh scent much better than this one.

review/summary: Surprisingly Terrific!
review/text: I have fine, limp, thin hair. Right now, I need a haircut and a color, too.  But...this conditioner really helped my hair look fuller and last fuller longer.  Now, I'm not saying if I used crummy other products like bad shampoo or gel that my hair would still look good.  It wouldn't.  I tested it.  But when I use a decent shampoo and a better than average (for my hair) styling lotion or gel, this conditioner really gave my hair more body that lasted longer.  I tried it seven different ways, all very scientifically:  once, changing just the shampoo and leaving the conditioner and gel the same;  other times, just changing the styling gel or lotion, but leaving the shampoo and conditioner the same. This conditioner really seemed to work.  It isn't a miracle worker.  I still have fine, thin hair.  But it was less limp...and that's a miracle!

review/summary: Don't use this product as directed
review/text: This is a rich conditioner, and it makes it super easy to get tangles out of  your hair, but it definitely should not be used as directed if you have fine, limp hair.  Nourishing the scalp is the stated goal of this product, but if you put it on your scalp and let it sit before rinsing (quite a chore in itself), your hair will be almost greasy when it dries.  Way too heavy and  oily for fine straight hair.  Even applied only to the ends of your hair, it's too much, and I hated the way it left a residue on my body as I rinsed (and even made the tub slippery).  I can't imagine how the makers think it volumizes - try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P22WKI">Suave Professionals Volumizing Conditioner</a> instead; it's the best I've ever used.

review/summary: Worked very well for my fine, straight hair
review/text: I have fine hair that tends to fall flat, so you would think that using a volumizing conditioner would be a no-brainer, right?  Unfortunately, many of the conditioners I've tried in the past--usually branded as "for fine hair," "body-building," "voluming-boosting," or some combination of the above--have not worked well for my hair.  The problem is that these types of hair often do not condition my hair ENOUGH.  Given that my hair is fine and thin, it is prone to tangle and break easily, so I need a product that will condition my hair well without leaving it feeling weighed down.<br /><br />Unfortunately, finding the right conditioner has proved elusive, and I've switched products and brands over the years.  Therefore, I was quite impressed with CLEAR Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, even with the very first use.  The conditioner had a subtle yet light, fresh scent.  The product itself was sufficiently thick, spread nicely through the hair, and rinsed easily.  But most important of all, I was pleased to see that my hair seemed less flat than usual after using this product.  I wouldn't say that it produced huge amounts of volume, but for my fine hair, simply having the conditioner leave my hair feeling soft yet not weighed down is a huge plus.<br /><br />I have been using this product with the matching shampoo, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8AC">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo</a>, and the two products seem to be working well together.  The only (small) complaint that I have about both the CLEAR Conditioner and Shampoo is the design of the bottles--they sort of flare out, which make them difficult to push neatly together on a bath shelf and which give them the appearance that they are leaning over.  (I do like how the Conditioner opens at the bottom--but why not make the Shampoo open that way too?)<br /><br />Overall, however, I am definitely pleased with this product, and I plan to continue buying it as long as it keeps working for me.

I worried that it would be overpowering, but after I rinsed and blew my hair dry, just a hint was left. The product is easy to apply to wet hair and my hair still felt clean after I rinsed it (not my experience with other conditioners).<br /><br />I like the natural moisturizers: almond, coconut, and soybean oils. Wet hands can easily manipulate the plastic bottle in the shower. The opening is a pop-out on the base of the bottle so you will be able to use the entire product without coaxing it up from the bottom.

review/summary: wow
review/text: I was really excited to test this product.  I'm one of those shampoo/conditioner hoarders.  i have tried almost every brand out there and really can't find one I like.  I have long hair that is very thick and slightly wavy.  When I wash it, it's very difficult to get a comb through even with conditioners.  Lately, I've been hooked on WEN (which I got on Amazon) and it's been working great but I do miss the lather that shampoo provides.<br />I first used this 4 days ago.  I shampooed with one of my ordinary shampoos and then used this and oh my goodness, I have NEVER felt my hair that soft.  It was also easy to comb and smelled great.  The next day, I didnt' wash my hair and it was still soft, and manageable and perfect.  I sometimes have a dry scalp and i noticed a huge difference using this product.  I used it again last night and I got the same results...soft, manageable hair, smelled great and no dry scalp...and my hair was very easy to comb wet.  I can't believe there is a product out there that does this great of a job for my hair.  I will most definitely be buying this conditioner and it will be one of my favorites.  It's thick but very easy to wash out.  I also have a little more bounce to my hair.  If you're like me and have tried product after product and are just not satisfied, try this one.

review/text: When I saw commercials and saw ads for Scalp & hair therapy volumizing root boost shampoo and conditioner, I thought - scalp soap? What will they come up with next?  I used the nourishing daily conditioner, I have thin hair that is fairly long, with no body and in the winter months my hair is SO dry. I have tried every conditioning product out there, cheap and expensive so I thought I would try this.  First, I LOVE the smell of this conditioner, and after you use it you can smell the great scent all day.  I didn't notice any root boost but it did condition my hair so that it looked shiny and not all dried out and frazzled.  I even used some as a leave in conditioner after I washed my hair on the very tips and it worked great. I would recommend this conditioner and will use it again.

review/summary: Pretty good...conditions well & seems to make thinner hair more full.
review/text: Of all of the Clear conditioners I've tried, the Volumizing Root Boost is probably the one I've liked the best. Like a lot of guys my age, my hair has started to thin a bit in the front, so anything that will make that less noticeable gets my vote. I've tried more than a few products, and most don't do much of anything. Fortunately, the Root Boost not only conditions well, leaving my hair soft and manageable, but it also seems to actually "volumize" the roots and hair shaft, making my thin areas look a good bit better (especially on the days that I use Nizoral).<br /><br />The only real negative, in my book, is the scent. It doesn't smell bad, but it's a bit more perfumed than I'd like. The good thing is that Clear Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing conditioner rinses out very well (no oily film in my case), so the scent ends up being much more subtle (and pleasant) than it would seem at first.<br /><br />Clear Volumizing Root Boost conditioner delivers what it promises, and really does a great job on my hair. It's definitely going to be a regular purchase from now on.

Overall it's above average but not my favorite. I love the 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner they are really great.

review/summary: Great volumizing conditioner
review/text: Not only do I have VERY fine hair, but my hair is falling out because of a recent surgery. The Clear Scalp volumizing conditioner has helped add a great amount of volume to my hair. Not only does it add volume to my hair, but it smells great. I have had many complements on how good my hair looks and how good it smells.

review/summary: Awesome Conditioner
review/text: I've used Clear Scalp a few times and I must say their product never disappoints. It smells great, comes out nicely, and leaves my hair with a nice shine.<br /><br />This volumizing root boost conditioner worked great. My hair feels wonderful and even a little softer than it has before. Even after I'm done using this conditioner, I imagine I'll continue to buy it for years to come.<br /><br />If you're looking for a new conditioner, you really can't go wrong with Clear Scalp. Their products are amazing and very inexpensive.

review/summary: Definitely adds volume...
review/text: This conditioner definitely adds volume to my hair which is a huge plus for me.  No more flat hair.<br /><br />The smell is decent.  Certainly not something to rave about it but it's not bad either.  I've had some products from this brand that the smell was just downright awful.  This isn't one of those.<br /><br />It's great with tangles too which is great for my 11-year-old daughters hair.  Brushing the tangles out can be very challenging at times but this conditioner really helps out there.<br /><br />I would recommend this product.

review/text: I tried this conditioner with the matching shampoo and was not impressed.  The combination left my hair looking oily or greasy- like I hadn't washed it at all.  I was also hoping that it would be good for my scalp, but I didn't notice that to be true either.<br /><br />The bottle came open during shipment and made a real mess- didn't seal well at all.<br /><br />All in all this produce did not work for me.

review/summary: Moisturizing without leaving residue or weighing down
review/text: This conditioner really surprised me. I have thin hair plus I feel like I'm losing a lot of it, so anything that weighs my hair down makes it look even more sparse. Because of that, I haven't used conditioner on the roots of my hair at the scalp because I thought it was too heavy. I realized though that neglecting to moisturize and nourish the scalp wouldn't help at all with my hair weakness, so I tried out this conditioner. Even slathering it on the roots and rinsing well, it feels incredible CLEAN and SOFT when my hair is dried. I'm really impressed with the feel of it, and hope that it's actually doing its job to nourish the hair from the root.

review/summary: Too heavy for very fine hair
review/text: I've tried several items in the CLEAR line and I think I'm done with them. The scent is ok, if cheap smelling. Some product lines make members of my household sneeze, but CLEAR was fine for all of them. The problem is the heavy feeling it leaves in your hair. Hair feels like it has product in it and is limp instead of loose and lightweight. This product is probably better for thicker or drier hair types. Mine tends to split easily and I haven't noticed any change after several weeks of product use.

review/summary: Worked fine, not outstanding
review/text: I also used the shampoo that goes with this conditioner, but not in tandem with the conditioner as I had used it up before I got this. Overall, I think this conditioner worked just fine on my hair. Nothing outstanding, but it performed on a par with any other conditioner I've used. I didn't notice a boost in volume after using it a while (and I have had fine hair all my life). The texture is creamy and the color milky white. It comes out of the bottle in neat ribbons. It goes on easily and rinses out just fine. I enjoyed the scent, and this conditioner definitely helps get a comb through my wet hair after the shower, which is really the main reason I use conditioner, as I've always kept my hair long. I love the fact that it contains vitamins and healthy natural ingredients. So yes, a good impression overall.

review/summary: All Day Volume.  Lightly Scented.  Performance on Par with Others in Its Category.
review/text: Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner is lightly scented, goes on thick & takes a little work to rinse out.  It claims to add all day volume to your hair.<br /><br />I have medium to fine layered shoulder length hair & find that this product (1) does not weigh my hair down, (2) makes my hair feel soft and bouncy all day, and (3) gives my hair a nice shine. Additionally, the scent lasts most of the day.<br /><br />However, my old stand-by (Suave professionals conditioner) does the same thing, so, in the end, my choice of conditioner would come down to price point since performance seems to be equal.<br /><br />Note: I do like the bottle's design (dispenser on the bottom), which allows you to get the conditioner out of the bottle without a lot of shaking.

review/summary: nice conditioner
review/text: Like the other "CLEAR" brand conditioners I've tried, this one is lightly scented and I would have to say that I like the scent. I'm not sure exactly what the scent is but it is pleasant. The consistency of the conditioner is okay but I prefer thicker conditioners. It rinses out well enough and leaves my hair soft.<br /><br />I like that the spout is on the bottom because this helps the conditioner settle and makes it easier to get the last bit of conditioner out of the bottle.

review/text: This conditioner seemed to work well and rinsed out without the sliminess that some conditioners have. It has the same nice clean smell that the rest of the Clear line has.<br /><br />I noticed a slight volumizing, but my hair is also about 8 inches below my shoulders, so is heavy to begin with, it might work better that way for shorter hair.<br /> I will repeat my main complaint against all the shampoos and conditions in this line. The bottle seeps a bit when it is left upside down in my shower and it is about 3 times more expensive than my regular less expensive conditioners that quite frankly do just as good of a job.

review/summary: Washes Out Quickly and Cleanly
review/text: I should use conditioner, but do so infrequently because it is difficult to rinse out thoroughly. As a woman who now has to color treat her hair, hot water is the devil to my hair as it diminishes the color more quickly. This conditioner rinses out more quickly and like the dandruff shampoo leaves my fine curly hair with more volume. It is so effective that I am using conditioner more than once a week for the first time ever.<br /><br />i highly recommend Clear Scalp and Beauty. Their products work well and you use very little so your money goes a long way.

review/summary: Used with the shampoo, it seems to meet claims and has mild fragrance.
review/text: As stated with the shampoo review, these two products used together do seem to create some additional fullness of my fine hair even with the hard water here.  Again, the fragrance is pleasantly mild and I've not experienced the usual itching and/or burning with a fragranced product.  Time will tell, but I think these two are going to meet the manufacturer's claims.  Both bottles have a substantial flat base with opening end down to enable using those last few drops, and they are not going to be falling over with the slightest hit of water from the shower head.  These are products I will continue to use if they live up to claims.  Thanks!

review/summary: Doesn't leave my hair flat like some conditioners
review/text: This didn't add volume, but it didn't take it away either.  I have very fine hair, and some conditioners weigh it down.  I always have to look for volumizing conditioners to eliminate the problem.  This one worked well.  It has a pleasant scent that doesn't seem to linger after you have used it.  I like the creaminess of it, and it seems to coat my hair well.  When rinsing it out of my hair, it washes clean easily, and leaves my hair slick and easy to comb through when wet.  I don't tend to have a dry scalp in the summer, so  I can't speak for the claims of moisturizing my scalp.  I'm giving it a 4, because I wasn't super impressed with it, in that if something I have used before goes on sale, I would probably pick it over this.  However, I would buy this again, and it does what it promises.

review/summary: No good for me
review/text: Shampoo and coditioners will always be something that works differently for different groups of people. For me, this version of Clear did not work well at all.<br /><br />My hair is long, to my waist. Not very thick, but pretty wavy. I don't use straighteners too often in the summer months, but I do use a blow dryer often and am in the sun alot, so my hair can get dry at times.<br /><br />A conditioner for me has to work well at detangling and moisturizing, but more emphasis on the detangling due to my hairstyles. Especially with my hair being so long, I need something that actually works, so that I am not using a whole bottle at a time. This is why I stick to salon brands since they are so concentrated. Every now and then I will switch to a drugstore brand, just to try something new though.<br /><br />Clear Scalp Volumizing Root Boost conditioner was horrible at detangling for me. I don't feel it was very good at conditioning at all in general. I had to use 3-4 heaping handfuls at a time and even then it just did not seem to be doing much. This Clear conditioner is very thick and rich, but it just didn't perform well for me. My typical shower routine is to shampoo, then wash my face, then apply conditioner comb it through and clip my hair up while I wash off. I like to let the conditioner soak into my hair. With this, it was much more difficult to comb through my hair with the conditioner on and my hair still felt rough/ragged.<br /><br />This conditioner seems like it isn't absorbed by the hair at all. It is like it just sits on top of it and then rinses right off. It does rinse easily with no apparent residue, so that is a plus. It didn't weight my hair down at all, but it also did not give me any volume. This could be because my hair is so long, but I do use other volumizing shampoo & conditioners and can see the volumizing effects. I tend to be flat at the roots, so in lieu of teasing or heavy use of styling products, I like to use a volumizing shampoo & conditioner from time to time for fuller styles.<br /><br />I had to follow up with a leave in conditioner every day that I used this. My hair is not overly dry, so it shouldn't have been such a big issue. I will try the other Clear varieties and see if I have better luck. This one was just not for me, but it may work very well for others, especially if your hair is shorter and not as wavy/curly. It does smell good though, for what it's worth. It is a light, fresh, somewhat floral smell.

review/summary: Good conditioner
review/text: This Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy is a very nice. I love the fragrance. It smells floral and reminiscent of my visits to the salon. The conditioner is on the thick side, but it's easy to work it into my hair after shampooing. I particularly like the container. The opening is at the bottom, so the product will continue to move to the opening as it is used up. I'm sure you get to use the most conditioner possible out of the container and there is less waste than with other conditioners that have top spouts or openings.<br /><br />This particular product is a Volumizing Root Boost. I have long, fine, straight hair and my roots were not noticeably boosted. Although I haven't tried many, I have never found a root booster or volume product that does work on my hair. This is however, a very nice conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy and I have not found that it's building up after daily use. If you're looking for a conditioner, this is a good one.

review/summary: Volumizing Conditioner WITHOUT the frizz.  No tangles!!! Love that.
review/text: Typically, I'm a Joico (Kpak) girl, and I default to Herbal Essences or sometimes Pantene (both have long hair products) when I cant find Joico on sale (full price Joico is not in the student budget...though discounts are pretty easy to find).  In general I use minimal product: perhaps a little mouses on the roots and a leave-in on the ends if im straightening, spray gel if not straightening, and, when I'm in the mood, some hairspray.<br /><br />My hair is waist length and fine/thick.  I have a lot of strands---but the strand texture is fine.  So that added to the length means weight.  Which would make one want to TRY a volumizing conditioner. However, having long hair means you must protect and condition.  This product promised both: moisture and volume.  Worth a try!<br /><br />Overall I'm pretty happy with the results.  "Volumizing" conditioners have in the past been a HUGE fail.  They leave me and my curls rockin' the white girl 'fro.  With frizz and tangles!!!!  This was a lovely change: lightweight volume, No frizzled, and my hair straightened happily.  :)<br /><br />As an added bonus the little tilt to the cap and side dispensing means you can easily dispense even the last of the product. (Huge points to the bottle design team!!!!)<br /><br />I do think the name of the shampoo needs changed.  It simply doesn't sound "pretty."<br /><br />Very little scent.<br /><br />REASONS FOR LOSS OF ONE STAR:  did not leave my hair quite as shiny as I like.

review/summary: So worth the $!
review/text: I used this product several times along with the dry scalp shampoo by the same company and have had wonderful results.  Love the fragrance and the silkieness of the product without having to use a ton of it at one time.  My hair is short and color treated and with using both products I get a wonderfully soft texture to my hair with tons of volumne.  I always leave my conditioner in for 3 to 5 minutes so as to soak up any extra umph that the product might be able to deliver on.<br /><br />If you want a good product that can do the job without breaking the bank then give this a try.  I think you just might be surprised.  I surely was.

The conditioner is light and, while not as noticeably as the shampoo, does achieve good volume and doesn't weigh hair down. I only use it every other shampoo. Also, like the shampoo, it has a very strong perfume, which is another reason to use them together, as I think the fragrance would clash with other products.

Interestingly enough, I notice that my hair dries quickly with this line of hair products, I don't know what causes that.  But I do enjoy that aspect of it.  In short, I don't feel compelled to buy more but I'm not sorry I tried it.

review/summary: My hair was not impressed
review/text: I'm in my 50's with very long, color treated hair.  However, since I only color my hair 2-3 times a year and I don't use heat tools such as blow dryers, flat irons, curling irons or hot rollers; my stylist says my hair is in very good shape.  In fact, she only sees me every 2 months to trim a little off the ends.<br /><br />I usually alternate between Fekkai Glossing Shampoo & Conditioner and L'Oreal EverCreme Intense Nourishing Shampoo & Conditioner.  However I was up for a change and thought I could swap the Clear Scalp line for the L'Oreal line.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that the new products had a much thinner consistency than my usual shampoo and conditioner.  The scent was also just okay, nothing remarkable.  After the first wash, I noticed my hair had more tangles and after a few more days I noticed that my ends felt dryer.  After I added the Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp Oil, my hair got a little softer but the Clear Scalp & Hair Moisturizing Dry Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner isn't moisturizing enough for me.  My husband, on the other hand, tried it and liked it but then again, he has much shorter and thereby younger hair than I do.<br /><br />Oh well, I'm glad he likes it because I don't think I'll be using it on a regular basis.

review/text: My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it, which gives it the illusion of being thick.  The problem is that, when my hair gets a little long, the weight of the top layers of hair weigh down the lower ones, making my hair look heavy and, well, blah.  I gravitate toward root-boosting products to restore natural body by giving my fine hairs a little lift.  After using this conditioner, my hair retains its body throughout the day.  Even better, I love the scent -- I can smell it as I write this, and it's been hours since I got out of the shower.  Obviously, if you are bothered by perfumes, you should look elsewhere.<br /><br />I'm really pleased with this shampoo.  It's going to be in my shopping cart when the current bottle starts to run out.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

review/text: I have fine hair, and this conditioner works well. There is a  perfumed scent that lingers even after you rinse out the conditioner, unlike other conditioners I have used that don't leave much of a smell.  The scent is pleasant enough, however.  My scalp feels less dry and looks more vibrant, and my hair has excellent body after using this conditioner. The only problem I see with this conditioner is that the opening is on the bottom, so if you don't fully close the bottle, gravity could take its' toll and some conditioner could leak out (they should have put the plastic opening on the top of the bottle). Otherwise, this is a great conditioner.

review/text: I have hair that is thick and goes about 3" past my shoulders and difficult to manage-it always seems to be frizzed out (just thought I would included that so you know when reading the review you can compare your hair type to see if this will work with your hair or not) I am a Head and Shoulders Loyalist, however, this conditioner works pretty well.<br /><br />It is smooth and goes on easily.  I also like that I didn't have to use a whole bunch to get full coverage (I only had to use about a quarter sized amount). It smells pretty good (I would say about as good as Pantene or Garnier Fructis, but better than any of the Head and Shoulders scents I've tried) and after blow drying left my hair soft and silky, but not greasy-even the next day.  I did use it with the Clear shampoo, so I think that using both products together also helped and would recommend that you get the shampoo as well!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.

review/summary: Better Than Average Conditioner
review/text: I'm losing count on how many times I have washed and conditioned my hair to test this line of hair care products. This conditioner is definitely a keeper. I liked the scent. It was easy to apply and easy to rinse out of my hair with cool water. It left my hair shiny and manageable, but the greatest benefit was that my hair wasn't weighed down or greasy. This product touts that it is a volumizing root boost nourishing conditioner. While I think it definitely doesn't weigh hair down which makes it easier to add mousse or a volumizer, I don't think it actually does anything to increase volume. That said, I like this purely from the point of view that it doesn't over condition my very fine hair and makes styling with product easier. I would recommend this as a good alternative to some pricier conditioners I have used in the past.

review/summary: Thick In Your Hand; Light In Your Hair
review/text: I have very fine hair and when I first put this conditioner in my hand I thought, "Oh great, this is going to make my hair go totally flat." Unlike some other heavy conditioners, the result is soft, smooth, and not-flat hair. The smell is fresh and not overwhelming or obnoxious. And both I and my husband have noticed that it seems to have more volume than normal. So overall, my opinion on this shampoo is all positive: Inexpensive, helpful, and not too heavy.

review/summary: Great partner for the matching shampoo
review/text: I chose to test both the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty volumizing root boost nourishing conditioner and the shampoo at the same time, and I'm delighted that I was so wise.  This is a nice pair of products worth trying if, like me, you've got wispy, fly-away, fine hair that frustrates your attempts to keep it corralled into some semblance of a style.<br /><br />Unlike many of the similar products I've tried, this conditioner leaves no waxy or stiff feel behind, and my hair isn't the least greasy or weighed down.  In fact, it rinses out so completely that I wondered at first use whether it was doing anything at all.  It was, and it still is.  Combined with the matching shampoo, this product has left my hair clean, shiny, and with enough body to keep it in tow.  I supplement with a bodifying mousse styling product, and the effect is really surprising.  I might be able to stop my endless search.  Healthy-looking hair with some body is all I've been after.  It's only been about a week of daily use, but I will continue to use this pair of products, that's for sure.

review/summary: Gets better with continued use
review/text: The idea behind this hair care line is that to truly nourish your hair, it's important to start at the scalp where the hair grows from as opposed to the length of the hair which is considered to be dead. This makes sense, but I did have some reservations because the directions instruct you to gently massage this conditioner on your scalp and hair stylists have always advised against that because it causes your hair to be weighed down. I went ahead and used the conditioner as directed. After I dried my hair, I was pleased to see that there was more volume at the crown of my head. The downside however, was that my hair did not feel as conditioned as it normally does, but after continued use (about a week or so) it did start to feel softer and conditioned. I do recommend this product, but my advice is to be patient and give it a chance to start working, it's worth it.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I tried the conditioner right after the Clear Scalp Volumizing Shampoo.  The product has a nice consistency -not too thick or too watery.  It has the same fragrance as the shampoo which I wasn't really fond of.  It's not bad, just sort of bland.  The conditioner feels creamy when applying to hair.  I left it on my hair for 1-2 minutes while finishing my shower and then rinsed.  It rinsed very cleanly and didn't feel like a lot of residue was left on my hair.  After drying my hair, I was surprised at how shiny and soft it felt while still having lots of volume.  I have short, color treated hair and have struggled trying to find products that will give my hair softness and shine again but they all seem to be oily or heavy and end up making my hair flat.  Clear Scalp conditioner works perfectly.  Every member of my family has tried the shampoo/conditioner combo and we all love it.  It will definitely be on our shopping list for the future.

review/summary: Clean Feeling, but a bit Strong on the Scent
review/text: I used this conditioner for three weeks in place of my very pricey salon conditioner and found it to be quite comparable in quality, and it's a fraction of the price. I don't wash my hair everyday, so any conditioner that weighs down my hair immediately gets tossed out (I have straight hair - zero curl). I was definitely skeptical about the volumizing claim, I usually find hair products touting this to be gloppy and waxy feeling, but not so with this product. Here's the quick summary:<br /><br />Pros<br />- a little goes a long way; you don't need a heap to soften hair<br />- the ingenious spout is on the bottom and doesn't leak (wish ALL hair products had this!)<br />- did in fact leave me hair feeling a bit more voluminous as advertised<br />- great value<br /><br />Cons<br />- the scent is bit too strong (hence the 4 stars)

review/summary: Caused my scalp to itch and break out...
review/text: I have used many different shampoos and conditioners and wouldn't consider myself to be a person with sensitive skin or special hair care needs. When I first attempted to use this conditioner, I found the scent to be very appealing. I used my regular brand of shampoo(John Frieda) before using the conditioner. When applying the conditioner I did find that it was thicker, more like a masque, than other conditioners. I didn't notice anything strange until I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror. My forehead had red blotches around the hairline. When I started putting on my makeup (10 to 15 minutes later) my scalp and forehead began to itch. It lasted for a couple hours. Just to make sure that it wasn't a fluke, I tried this conditioner again a week later and had similar results. I was not able to use the product more than those times so I cannot say how well it volumizes. I am sad I couldn't continue to use the product.

review/summary: Leaves my hair soft, silky, and tangle-free...
review/text: I like this conditioner and I've very picky about what hair products I use. It leaves my hair soft, silky, and most importantly tangle-free! My hair knots up if you just look at it the wrong way and I've definitely spent less time combing my hair out after switching to this conditioner.<br /><br />Once rinsed out it does leave your hair smelling good, although I did notice that it had a slightly chemical smell to it when in the bottle, however it dissipates quickly.<br /><br />The bottle doesn't say that it's safe for colour-treated hair, however I have highlighted hair and have been using this product for several weeks with no ill effects on my coloured hair. Your mileage may vary of course.

review/summary: Very good conditioner -- just short of great
review/text: UPDATE: The longer I use this conditioner, the healthier my hair seems to be and the better I like it.  The concerns I mention in the original review are still valid, but I've decided to continue to use this conditioner given its reasonable price and the health its imparting to my hair.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: My hair is fine, limp, and has no natural body. Conditioners that add body usually leave my hair feeling dry.  Conditioners that add shine and moisture usually weigh my hair down. So my conditioner needs aren't easy to meet --and my guess is that yours aren't either. I love my Fekkai Glossing conditioner, but it's so outrageously expensive I use it less often than I'd like.  Other days, I use different conditioners and haven't settled on anything reasonably priced that really works for me. I like this CLEAR conditioner, but I don't love it.  It leaves my hair shiny, but adds no body at all. It does make my hair feel healthy, but only time will tell whether that is merely superficial or truly healthier hair.<br /><br />The really odd thing about this line is that there appear to be more conditioner names and claims than distinct formulations.  For example, the Volumizing Root Boost, the Total Care, and the Strong Lengths conditioners all have EXACTLY THE SAME INGREDIENTS LISTED IN THE SAME ORDER.  They all look exactly the same, feel exactly the same, and leave my hair feeling exactly the same.  They even smell the same (mediocre). Yet they are being marketed for different hair problems.<br /><br />Volumizing Root Boost indicates it has "lightweight nourishers" and is for "all day volume & body from the root." It does not volumize at all, doesn't boost my roots in the least.<br /><br />Total Care says it has "advanced moisture complex" and provides "total care for scalp & hair." I don't have dry scalp, so I can't say for certain, but these claims seem more in line with the way the conditioners actually perform.<br /><br />Strong Lengths states it has "strengthening serum" and will give "stronger hair in only 7 days."  My hair seems no different after 7 days, but in a month or two who knows?<br /><br />Since all these conditioners have the same ingredients, it would follow that the claims made for each of them should apply to all three of them. If all the conditioners did all they claim that would be one great conditioner. It would volumize, moisturize, provide total care, and make my hair stronger. But, as I said, they don't. They are okay for me, but they don't do everything I want. If I can get any of these conditioners at the right price, I will buy it, but I won't go out of my way to find it and I won't pay a premium for it.

review/summary: Prefer Other Clear Products
review/text: When I first started using Clear products for my hair, I noticed a distinct difference in the health of my hair. After about two months of usage, other people have started noticing and commenting as well that my hair seems healthier. That is important to keep in mind as I review this specific product.<br /><br />I have very fine hair. Any little thing will weigh it down. In fact, that's the one complaint I had about the first Clear product I reviewed (Strong Lengths) - I lost what little volume I had. I didn't want to lose the benefits of the sleek, shiny healthiness I found with Strong Lengths from Clear, so I tried the Strong Lengths shampoo and the Volumizing Root Boost conditioner together before switching to the volumizing shampoo. To be honest, I didn't seem much of a difference with that combination.<br /><br />Next, I switched to using both the volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I did see a difference in the volume of my hair, but it also became more fly-away and less sleek. That has made it a little harder to manage, especially with my new short cut. (I made the switch two weeks after I got my hair cut.)<br /><br />I really don't like to use other volumizing solutions other than a little hair spray. But, I think I would prefer those over the results I get from this volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I'm glad to have the set. I'm glad to have tried it. And, if I still had long hair I might even like it. But, with my current hair cut, I doubt I'll go out and buy this product. I have no qualms, however, about sticking to the Clear brand.

review/summary: Smells GREAT!!
review/text: I have been using the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner a couple times a week.  I wanted to add it into my regular regimen so that I could be certain any changes in my hair were from this one product, so I used my regular shampoo and styling products.<br /><br />At first I was concerned, because I still had to work to get tangles out of my hair.  I keep a wide toothed comb in the shower to comb through my conditioner.  I have natural blond hair, and my hair tangles very easily.  So, this step was still a little difficult with the Clear conditioner, so I do end up using more than what I feel I should need.  I also didn't notice any extra volume in my hair.  I'll admit, I tried the volumizing formula rather than others, because I have found with a lot of lower cost conditioners, the moisturizing formulas can often make hair look greasy, and I wanted to avoid that.<br /><br />The conditioner smells absolutley incredible!!!!  I love it.  I notice myself swinging my head around sometimes during the day, just so that I can smell my hair as it swings in front of my face (when nobody is looking!!).  Even though, I had trouble combing the conditioner through my hair when putting it on, drying my hair afterwards was fine.  My hair felt soft and looks good.<br /><br />So, the negatives for me are that I need to use more of this conditioner than other products and it doesn't give volume as advertised (not a huge deal to me, but I thought I should point it out for others who are looking for volume).  The positives are that it smells splendid and my hair feels and looks soft after drying it.  I will continue to try the Clear products and alternate them with my higher priced salon products just to be able to save some money.

review/text: This conditioner is creamy and really does feel nice but it doesn't provide any volume, not to my hair it doesn't. It seems to weight it down instead. It really seems more like a smoothing conditioner than a volume conditioner. It feels sort of like it leaves like a silicone feeling to the hair. I have wavy hair so I don't want it weighted down, I want it to be more natural looking and keep the waves. Maybe if you have straight hair it works better?

review/summary: Does A Good Job
review/text: I received Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner and the shampoo from Amazon Vine two weeks ago and have been using it ever since.  It does a good job conditioning.  My hair is soft and tangle free.  Using the conditioner and the shampoo has not made any difference in the volume of my hair.  That might be because I have thin fine long hair.  Just the weight of my hair could be keeping the volumizing from being effective.  My one big complaint is the size of the print on the container.  The smallest print is the word conditioner.  I wear glasses for reading and do not wear them in the shower (does anyone).  The print was so small that I could not tell which was conditioner and which was shampoo. I solved that by using a black marker to put a large S on the Shampoo and a large C on the conditioner.  It would have been nice if both words were in large print on the bottle.<br /><br />After I wrote this I had my hair cut much shorter.  I can tell a difference now.  It does give my hair body and volume now that it is shorter.

review/summary: OK conditioner.
review/text: So after using this for about a week along with the shampoo, I can't really tell much.  I don't really have a sensitive scalp, but I do have a scalp that likes to get a good scratch now and again.  I've tried all the tingling shampoos, the liquid medicines but nothing seems to really take away that need when my scalp starts to itch.<br /><br />I must say I was surprised that with a name like Clear Scalp & Hair...I was shocked to see the product is not clear.  I don't know why I had my mind made up that it would be, but when it came out and wasn't, there was a sense of let down which leads me to believe that it's still just a bunch of chemicals I'm putting on my head.<br /><br />Since I was fortunate enough to have both the shampoo and conditioner at the same time, I will also say that I'm not a fan of the product packaging.  The shampoo stands up with the opening in the air, while the conditioners opening is down.  Maybe this is so you can tell the difference in the shower?  I don't know, but again, I didn't like it.<br /><br />It definitely made my hair softer and more manageable, however, I keep my hair short so it really doesn't benefit me.

review/summary: Leaves hair soft and tangle free
review/text: I used this along with the Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo and was very pleased with the results.  I loved the light smell and the thick smooth texture of both.  I had no problems rinsing out either the shampoo or the conditioner.  As my hair was drying (I let my hair air dry rather than blow dry) I could just feel the softness settling in.  I have this weird habit of ruffling and fluffing my hair as it dries and after using this product, my hair had such a great feel to it as I did so.<br /><br />Once dry, my hair settles nicely with no wild/static craziness and looks smooth and soft.  I have long hair - below my shoulders - and it sometimes likes to go the crazy route.  Also, one of the things I miss most about my youth (granted, I am only 38) is the incredibly thick hair that I once had.  Once I began having children, my hair thinned quite a bit and I miss that thick mop, lol.  In any case, this product does seem to give it volume and "plump" up my hair.<br /><br />I also want to be sure to mention that I have weird/picky hair/scalp.  It responds to different products in an extreme way.  My scalp is oily, while my length is more dry.  When I use hair products it either leaves my hair a limp mass of yuck or works really well.  Most of the time, it leaves a limp mass.  Needless to say, I was thrilled and pleased to find that the Clear product left my hair looking and feeling great.  I am also one that has to wash my hair daily - in the morning, otherwise it looks oily and feels horrible.  I notice with this, however, I can wash my hair one day and the next morning it does not have that oily look and feel to it!  Yay!<br /><br />At the price, I feel this is a great product and one that I will continue to use for a while.  The scent is great, the effect is great and I am very pleased with the outcome when I use the shampoo and conditioner combination!

review/text: As I have ventured into my 30s, my hair has become much flatter and is losing its bounce.  I have what "appears" to be thick hair but really, I have a LOT of hair that is made up of lots of thin strands.  I figured trying out Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty volumizing boost nourishing conditioner couldn't hurt.  I thought the smell was pleasant and not overly strong.  It rinsed out nice and clean without any kind of left over residue that would need lots of extra rinsing.  I didn't notice much of a boost to my volume after the first use.  My hair felt nice but that was it.  I don't wash my hair every day, just every other day, but on the second wash and condition, I did notice my hair looked more voluminous- not a huge amount of volume but definitely wasn't my usual flat hair!  So yay!  A little volume is better than flat and I am good with that.  The price (less than $5) isn't too shabby either!

review/text: When I first saw the conditioner I was skeptical.  I'm used to thicker protein rinses it looked the consistency of white hand lotion. I was afraid it would hold down my fine hair or leave it oily.  But it doesn't.  It also doesn't thicken the hair shaft with gel that will get messed up as the day goes on. The smell is light and the shape of the shampoo container is opposite of the conditioner so people with bad eyes won't confuse them while in the shower without glasses. It is too soon to know if this will help hair grow by nourishing the roots but when used with the matching shampoo and a blow-dryer it seems to have a lasting lift.  I've used it twice. Will report back if there is long term hair growth.

review/text: Clear Volumizing conditioner is part of a shampoo and conditioner set to help boost the volume of your hair, among other things. It has a nice scent and it rinses clean, and I've noticed a bit of lift to my hair (or at least it's not as flat by the end of the day).  That it does provide a nice shine and a bit of volume is a definite selling point for this conditioner - however, I've noticed that in following the instructions, I tend to use a little more than I normally would of another brand (Clear instructs you to massage the conditioner into your scalp and then through your hair).

While it had a pleasant scent, the conditioner itself didn't seem to do anything.<br /><br />It didn't coat my hair well like other conditioners and didn't leave my hair soft once I had washed it out. My hair remained rough and tangled-feeling, about the same as after shampooing but before conditioning. Once dry, my hair seemed to have even less volume than it usually does (which isn't much to begin with). The lack of volume may have been because I needed to use a conditioning spray to get a hairbrush through my hair after using this conditioner that may have weighed it down.<br /><br />This conditioner didn't damage my hair, but it didn't help it any either. I needed to use more product to keep from damaging it by using a brush while it was wet than I would have normally had to use with a different conditioner, so I found no benefit to using this product. I won't be finishing the bottle.

review/summary: Rich, creamy conditioner -- does what it claims to do
review/text: I've used the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner for about a week now, and it it works well on my long, thin hair.  It's very creamy and easy to apply, which means a little goes a long way.  I followed the directions, massaging it into my scalp and hair and then rinsing it out completely.  After use, I found my hair to be very easy to comb through.  After blow drying, my hair was shiny and lush.  I wouldn't say it's better than other conditioners on the market, but it's certainly comparable to others in the same price range -- it does what it says it does.<br /><br />I did use this conditioner with its companion shampoo, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8AC">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>, so I can't comment on whether it would work as well with other products.  Both the conditioner and the shampoo have a light floral scent which was more intense in the bottle than it was on my dried hair.  I found it pleasant.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good product for those looking for a boost for thin, fragile hair.  Whether it actually nourishes the scalp will be determined over time.

review/summary: Creamy conditioner that flows well out of the bottle
review/text: The conditioner ingredients are unremarkable - chemicals plus oils from almonds, coconuts, soybeans and sunflower seeds. Many conditioners have a similar smell - not a heavy perfume - just that of a typical hair product.<br /><br />Many conditioners now have bottles with lids at the bottom. This is no exception, the bottle is elegant and simple - not fat - so it only contains 12.7 fl. oz. (375 ml), yet is the same height as a 25.4 fl. oz. (750 ml) bottle - clever packaging to make you think you've bought more than you really have. What differentiates this conditioner is its consistency. It is neither too thick to pour nor too runny to drip. It has just the right creamy consistency that makes it easy to rub into the hair.<br /><br />I have thick, dry, over-treated hair that can be quite brittle. The conditioner performed as well as the conditioners that typically come with hair color. I have used a paraben free SimplyU conditioner from Walmart that I like better.<br /><br />I compared this conditioner with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QXC97W">Dove Daily Moisture Therapy Conditioner, Dry/Rough Hair, 40 Ounce (Pack of 2)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A8V8A4">Garnier Fructis Conditioner, Fortifying, Pure Clean, Normal Hair, 13 oz.</a>.  Both of these were thicker and in both cases I had to put water in the bottle to dilute them - so they probably will last for more shampoos per fluid ounce (or milliliter) than the Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Conditioner, which I have not had to dilute.<br /><br />I don't wash my hair every day - so the idea of a Nourishing Daily Conditioner doesn't appeal - however I do use conditioner once or twice a week. It has left my hair manageable, just as any other good conditioner would.<br /><br />This conditioner is not one I would rave about, but it does have excellent creamy consistency that makes it easy to apply.  I like paraben free, very simple products. This has about 30 ingredients - are they really all necessary?

review/summary: VERY MUCH WORTH A TRY
review/text: ok, I got the family to try this for the last 3 days.<br /><br />The 65 year old's (female) hair found this product to be very nourishing with a short hair cut that is washed and conditioned daily. The hair volume felt fuller but didn't seem as bouncey as usual.<br /><br />The 50 year old's (female) hair is longer and thicker. She was able to use this conditioner to deal with the split ends that occur between salon apppointment.<br /><br />There was concern from the intial smell that the scent would be overpowering but it rinsed nicely and was very light and subtle after air drying.<br /><br />Loved the bottle design with the bottom being the click to close dispenser.  That way when the content is down to the last inch there is no struggle to get the last bit out, it's already at the mouth of the dispenser.<br /><br />The price was right and we would try again. Will get the male perspective next time we have relatives visit.

review/summary: Large Palm Corned Beef 15 oz with Juices (Ordered 8 Cans)
review/text: What we expected:  That the corn beef was exactly what we remembered eating back in American Samoa, New Zealand and Australia.<br /><br />Our Actual Results:  That the Corn Beef is AWESOME.  Excellent quality and taste and just enough fat (not too much) mixed in making it so juicy and tasteful.<br /><br />What we were NOT Happy About:  Is that we found out this same 15 Oz Can is cheaper elsewhere on the Internet but I found this out AFTER I already ordered and ATE my order (LOL).<br /><br />Overall - I am happy with my purchase but just not happy with the price WHICH could be more competitive meaning, the Seller/Vendor (My Filipino Grocery) should research and price their items so they can compete (as I am not ordering this again).<br /><br />My Future Plans:  I will not be ordering anything from anyone without researching as I could have ordered this for less than $7 Dollars per can (this one is $8.49 per can).<br /><br />Thanks so much.

review/summary: So disappointed!
review/text: I spent several hours reading reviews for deer repellents before settling on the Havahart Deer Off product. I gulped at the price, but reasoned that it was a concentrate and I would get my money's worth. First, let's start with the fact that the product is filled with little mushy granules that immediately clogged my garden sprayer. I had read the directions. I had shaken the product vigorously as recommended. It still clogged not only my standard gallon garden sprayer, but every other sprayer I tried to use to dispense the product. I wound up "painting" it on the plants I wanted to protect. And now comes the second part..... it did absolutely nothing to protect my plants. The deer ate three quarters of everything to which I had applied the product within a week of application. Flowers, vegetables, shrubs. It was as if I had used nothing.<br /><br />My opinion? This product is a complete waste of money.

review/text: Whew, what a relief, I have used Deer wrap, Human urine and Garlic, the only thing that deterred the deer was this stuff. The 1st year I bought a small bottle,it worked so well, that for the past two years I have purchased the 32 ounce concentrate. I had an old deck sprayer that had never been used, and I mixed half the concentrate, with 7 parts water and applied it liberally.  Each year on Halloween I use it,and it lasts all winter with no re-applications. This Deer Off is all I will ever use on my trees and shrubs.

review/summary: Great Rice, Great for You!
review/text: We eat a lot of rice. In an effort to eat a more healthy diet, we have been enjoying this rice. This Nishiki rice is partially polished, or has just a bit of the outer hull milled off in order to allow quicker cooking. Online sources state that the fact that the germ is left intact makes this rice very heart-healthy. According to information on the bag, haiga rice, that we were originally looking for, is processed even more than this rice, removing the hull entirely, but leaving the healthy rice germ.<br /><br />This rice tastes great, a little nutty. It is medium grain, which is stickier than long-grain rice, particularly suitable for sushi and rice pudding. However, we use it as any general-purpose rice in Asian cooking, stir-fries and the like. We primarily use a rice cooker on the white/haiga (regular rice) setting with no presoaking and it always comes out great. We do usually let it steam for a few minutes after it is ready, but not every time, and we have ALWAYS been happy with the flavor and performance of this rice. (I have some cooking now!!)<br /><br />We bought two bags in the 5-lb size. The package design is a little differently than pictured; I can't say what you will receive, as we special ordered it from a local specialty store; it was impossible to find at grocery stores here. Our next order will be for a bigger bag!

The generation before these has a single flavor that literally made me retch. The fish flavored jelly beans are SO AWFUL that you will gag.<br /><br />You will.<br /><br />Trust me.<br /><br />These, on the other hand, only have a few really awful ones. Avoid vomit if you can, because that's probably what you'll be doing next.<br /><br />whoever makes these is awesome.

review/summary: The flavours are not lies!
review/text: These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully.<br /><br />To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote:<br /><br />Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. "Okay," I begin "but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."<br /><br />My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt!<br /><br />Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. "Alright," they said "This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."<br /><br />Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth.<br /><br />It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product.

Boy was I wrong.  The boxes are the size of small raisin boxes, and they aren't even filled very full.  I was very disappointed and feel ripped off.  Breaking the cost down, each jelly bean costs about 25 cents, and these are small candies - the size of jelly bellys.  Don't waste your money unless you have a lot to waste...

This is just what Bertie Botts supposed to be. But don't try it if you are NOT OK with awful flavors.I took a VOMIT one thinking it was cinnamon...and blueberry flavor tastes like dishwasher. I give it a five star because it is perfectly awful, but don't buy it if you haven't decided how much you can take...just don't!
