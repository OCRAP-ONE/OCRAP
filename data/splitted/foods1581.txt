review/summary: great Finnish snack
review/text: For awhile there, I rather suspected that Finn Crisp had disappeared from the planet,so difficult had it become for me to secure even a single small box of this marvelous product.  Imagine my surprise at finding it, not only readily available, but at the same level of gustatory excellence that I had grown accustomed to over many years!  Admittedly, I am no "gourmet/gourmand" (a la super-snooty Frasier or Niles Crane of the television sit-com); yet, with a goodly slice of quality Havarti, a tasty wedge of Dutch Gouda, or (my particular favorite) a generous portion of homemade,freshly cured gravlax (Kosher salt/fennel/white peppercorn/sugar-cured Pacific salmon), there are indeed few supremely crunchy accompaniments that can equal Finn Crisp.  The only thing that can consistently make this latter treat a "skosh" better (at least in my modest opinion) is a few generous "fingersworth" of a top quality ice-cold aquavit. So,...avast and feast on, me 'earties!

review/text: These are my hands-down favorite rye crackers.  Much better than Kavli, Wasa or Ryvita.  These crackers are thin, strong, not crumbly or gritty and have a very full rye flavor.  On top of all that they're healthy too.  These are great when topped with cheese, jam or butter.  When buying bulk these keep fresh a long time until you open the individual plastic pouches.

review/text: I grew up eating Finn Crisp but a lot of the stores in the area I live in don't carry it, so I was grateful to be able to find it on Amazon.com.<br /><br />Like a lot of people, I crave carbohydrates, and was happy to find this Finn Crisp to be able to eat a healthier version of carbs.  I eat it with either herring, or deli meats, but it would be just as tasty with some kind of spread and sliced cucumber or other veggies put on top of it.<br /><br />I am also allergic to wheat, so am especially happy to be able to find this crisp bread made from rye, which I have always loved the taste of as well.

review/summary: not for me
review/text: I've never had Finn Crisp (any flavor) or other crispbreads before. Pretty happy with the taste of traditional crackers (I can eat a lot of them without toppings). Just starting to explore the crispbread space (after reading about it in a health magazine), hoping for a healthier snack, especially something lower in sodium. I tried Ryvita (can't remember what flavor, but it is the sodium free one), and it tastes like cardboard. I couldn't find Finn Crisp at any of my local stores. So I ended up ordering it from Amazon, for a pack of 9. I was brave enough to do that because of all the good reviews.<br /><br />As soon as the shipment arrived, I made everyone in my family try one. Thumbs down from everyone, including myself. Makes me wonder why the magazine people say this crispbread can go topless, and why pretty much everyone who wrote a review think this stuff tastes good. To me, it has a faint bitter taste; to some of my family, it is tasteless. I can eat it, but certainly not something I can say I like. So spending 40+ mg of sodium per slice on this is not worth it.<br /><br />Well, I think I will go back to the cardboard taste Ryvita. At least it is sodium free, and I can buy just 1 box from a local store, not a pack through mail order. Personally, I prefer the cardboard taste to this faintly bitter taste.

review/text: This is a great snack/animal cracker for young children who have many allergies.  My son loves to chew on crackers of any kind, but it is very hard to find ones that are free from all the food allergies he has.  These are perfect for when I need a snack for him when we are wandering around town.  Taste wise, they are ok, but since my son is only 18 months old and eats anything he is given, he's not too picky when it comes to flavor.  For a wheat free, nut free, egg free, dairy free, soy free cookie, they are not too bad.

review/summary: Great Cookie Option for our Toddler!
review/text: Since our little one was diagnosed with multiple food allergies our options have been limited.  We make everything from scratch, of course, but sometimes, it is nice to be able to toss something in the diaper bag that requires no work and is a little sturdier than home-baked goodies.  These are it!  We can't really distinquish the animals too well, but that aside, for allergy-free treats, these cookies taste great!  Any child who doesn't take to them right away should just be offered them again & again...eventually they will appreciate them with gusto!  Our daughter did.  It is hard to adjust to allergy-free eating in general, especially if your kids have had the pleasure of tasting "normal" food.  Now she LOVES these cookies, though, and for me it is a convenient & simple treat to give her.

review/text: We love these, even my husband who has no allergies.  They aren't super sweet which I love, and the kids beg for them all the time.  I like to crush them up and put them in my homemade ice cream for gf-cf cookies and cream ice cream.  Yum!

review/text: These are great.  Safe for my kids to have.  Small packages prevents too many cookies at a time complaints.  Plus, easy to pack in lunches, to share with class and for in the car.  We recently removed soy from our diet and found many of the peanut free products we had were off limits now.  OrgraN to the rescue!  Very happy.  I will be buying the large cookies for my sons preschool class birthday party celebration.  Great deal here since my local markets do not carry OrgraN.<br /><br />Plus, I emailed OrgraN to confirm the nut free labeling included peanuts and it does.  They sent me an email listing all products and production facilities use of peanuts.  Very helpful.

review/summary: Low marks on taste
review/text: My daughter has a severe gluten allergy, so I was excited to find these cookies. However, after trying one she wouldn't touch them again. I tried one myself and was underwhelmed. The texture is crumbly and rather bland. We have tried a range of gluten free products and I find these cookies to be disappointing. I normally try a product before buying a whole case, but I was unable to find this particular brand in local stores, so I took a chance, I won't be doing that again.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: Now, I've had these cookies before and they are pretty good, but have a bit of a sandy after-taste. However, my son with multiple food allergies LOVES thems and would eat as many as I'd let him. The problem is I've bought the big box, but they tend to get stale from being open since I don't let him have cookies that often...this is the perfect solution. There are 8 mini packs in each bag keeping them fresh and easy to grab and go. Perfect for a fun or "special" snack and to have on hand in the classroom in case a friend brings an unexpected treat to which your child might be allergic. Finally a animal cracker for kids with allergies. Thanks Orgran :)

review/text: If you have a child with multiple food allergies you must by this treat!  They actually taste really good (Mom had to do a taste test)!  My son (who just turned 2) loves his new crackers.  It is hard to find a snack that fits into his definition of a "cracker" with all of his allergies.  Now when he asks for a cracker, I can fulfill his requests (makes a Mom's heart happy).  Now we are going to try the chocolate ones as an extra special treat.

review/text: These cookies are fantastic!!  They don't taste gluten free at all.  My boys and I love these cookies.  They also are not high in sugar and have some fiber in them.  They are also casein free, soy free, nut free, among other things "free".  And, they are made in a dedicated gluten free facility.  We used to eat the kinickinnick animal cookie.  Now, we've moved on to these.  Again, the best GF/CF/soy free cookie we've ever had.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S. Some viewers said they were "sandy".  I didn't get that at all.

review/summary: Pretty tasty for a "healthy" granola bar
review/text: I stumbled across these in the grocery store today, and immediately noticed the 25% less sugar label.  Sounds promising I thought.  Just 100 calories?  Even better!  No high fructose corn syrup, 0 g trans fats, sign me up!  Upon closer inspection, these granola bars aren't quite as healthy as advertised; they still contain corn syrup, though not "high fructose" corn syrup, as well as a bunch of preservatives, oligofructose, polydextrose, and various hydrogenated oils.  Minus 1 star.<br /><br />Taste wise, they're pretty good.  They still have enough chocolate chips scattered about to resemble a chocolate chip granola bar, and somehow the ratio of oats to barley/rice is higher in this than compared to the oatmeal raisin 90 g bars (see my corresponding lowfat oatmeal raisin review).  The bar isn't too dry, and you feel pretty good eating just one of them and only taking in 100 calories.  Only 100 calories?  Hmm, I can afford to eat a few more...

Every time we left the house I told them to go to their cages ( I called it Day Care) then they would get a Chicken Chip.<br />Now all I have to do is open the container with the Chips and say "Day Care" and they are in and ready.  I do not shut them in in the daytime, but at night we go through the same routine only I say Nite Nite time and they go in and get their Chip and I do lock them in at night.  When Petsmart stopped carrying the Chicken Chips I tried several different kind of snacks - none to their liking.  Then I found them on line and have 2 happy pups again.

My sister told me to check the container to see if the product came from China, it did.  She gave me a different bag of the same product that was made in the USA. Check your packaging.

review/text: these small "all-chicken coins" are no longer being sold at my local or chain pet-stores, so i was thrilled to be able to get a large tub (fyi: smaller packages are also available, but why get a small "zip-locking" pack if you can buy a well sealing jar of them?) thru amazon! they do not stain your pockets so you can always carry a few around for your pooch, or for a nice stranger's dog that you randomly meet (i had some in a jean's pocket for >3 months, not on purpose, and they did not crumble, stain, smell, or go stale), they can be easily broken in half for a mini-dog, and my not-food-motivated boxer totally loves them! so say good-bye to all of those messy or crumbling dog treats, and spread the word: as soon as your friends (well, the ones with dogs) see you that have found them (i still do not understand why my local pet stores dropped this dog-treat line), and that their dogs like them, they'll be asking to "borrow" a handful :-)

review/text: My yorkie loves these, we were first introduced to these at xmas by my sister-in-law and have had a terrible time finding these here in NY. Once in a while I can find these at an end-cap at Dollar General but that's about it so I'm very happy to find these on-line and they are the right size too, about the size of a quarter.  Thanks!

review/text: These are one of my corgi's favorite treats! My mother-in-law bought us a little package when we adopted him and he's been hooked ever since so I love that they come in a large tub. I love that the only ingredients are chicken, wheat flour & salt-- healthy & delicious!

review/text: We adopted a very large 1 year old that had little or no training.  These treats were the only way we were able to start getting her to pay attention and behave.  Without them, we would now have an untrained extremely large three year old.  We always carry some of them in our pocket and all the dogs in the neighborhood love them.

review/text: Our companions, Amani and Kody have a passion for these little circles of chicken. They get their treat in the evening after supper. I have on occasion opened the jar during the day to suprise them and been surprised my self to find them behind me focused on my back. The chicken smell brought them from the far corners of the house. I was even tempted to try one myself but to crunchy for these old choppers. Great product.

review/text: My dog loves these treat but in the past 8 months Amazon this item has double in price of the same 1 pound tub. I love my dog but this is outragous. I can see a couple of dollars but almost a $9 increase. I will no longer by this product till the price comes back down. I use to get 3 1LB tubs for $27. Now I get 1 for $19.

review/summary: Favorite Treat for my Picky Shih Tsu
review/text: I must have the pickiest five-year old Shih Tsu in the world.  She has been a picky eater since a puppy.  She loves these chicken treats and probably would like me to give them to her instead of her food.  Of course, I don't but really enjoy watching her enjoy.  My Yorkie puppy eats everything and adores these treats as well.  They come running as soon as I say "Chicken Treats."

review/text: My shar pei's LOVE these.  The 3 year old is such a picky eater that she is thin, and even she gobbles these up.  I bought a 4 oz. bag at Petsmart and paid almost the same amount as I did for the 1 pound tub. They are great for training because they are small bite sized pieces.  Since they are dried, I can put them in my pocket so I don't have to carry a treat bag on walks. Even though it is made in China, the label says it contains only chicken.

review/text: Imagine you took a raspberry, drizzled chocolate syrup on it, and then put it on a frying pan.  You turned on the frying pan and let it sizzle for about 3 or 4 hours.  Put that in a coffee filter and brew it.  Sound good?  I didn't think so.  Thats what this coffee tastes like to me.  I bought a double pack, and I don't like it.  I tried to like it, and even gave it a second shot.  I wish I knew what to do with the rest of it, but I wouldn't subject my friends to this, so I can't give it to them.
