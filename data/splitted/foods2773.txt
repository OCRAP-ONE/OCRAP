review/summary: My Favorite K Cup
review/text: I am addicted to Emeril's Big Easy Bold. It is strong but smooth, not bitter. I love my Keurig but many K cups are too weak for me.  I used to order from Amazon when they had subscribe and save and started ordering it elsewhere whey they stopped.  Prices have gone up everywhere it seems and this pack offered on Amazon is once again the best price I could find.

review/summary: Strong-er and Rich
review/text: I am a recent Keurig convert, and LOVE IT! But I have struggled slightly with the weaker coffees of K-Cups. I like my coffee with a pretty strong flavor.<br /><br />But today I am sitting here with my first cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold and can say, it is stronger than most but also feels rich in flavor, instead of bitter. It's very good!<br /><br />As far as shipping it arrived right on schedule, although the 50 K-Cups come loose in a large unlabeled  box, which was... odd. I just did a quick count to make sure they were all there and in good shape, which they were, and I just restocked a smaller K-Cup box in my cupboard. No big deal to me.<br /><br />While gambling with your $30 to pick a good coffee, I bet you'll win with this one.

review/summary: Love the Coffee - problems with the k-cup
review/text: EBEB is my favorite k-cup coffee flavor.  It has great flavor and is my preference for a bold coffee taste without being bitter.<br /><br />...but...<br /><br />I've had a lot of problems with the actual EBEB k-cup.  There is some manufacturing defect with these particular ones.  About every 3rd k-cup something gets clogged somewhere and it overpressures the cup resulting in coffee & grounds spilling out of the top of the cup holder on the machine.  I've purchased several different boxes of EBEB from different stores (including Amazon) and have had trouble with all of them.<br /><br />I've run hundreds of other styles of k-cup through our machine with no problems - this only happens with the EBEB.<br /><br />I called Keurig to tell them about it and while they were nice and sent me a free box of another type of coffee, they didn't seem to interested in understanding that there is some manufacturing defect in this coffee flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line is that I'm very sad - I won't buy EBEB anymore because of this continuing problem with the manufacturing.

review/text: First- taste:  Bold-ish. I didn't get that full body taste that I expect from a bold brew. Bold does not equal strong. I will say say that it is very dark if that is what you are after. Starbucks 'Espresso Roast' is a better example of a good, smooth, bold brew.<br /><br />Second- the packs:  I don't know if I got a bad lot of packs but I end up with sludge in my cup about half of the time. I've shaken the packs, closed the top in slow motion, pushed the packs manually onto the bottom needle and all the other things you may have heard to fix pack problems. This particular box does not show the top of the pack to be 'proofed out' with nitrogen.  I've used about 12 of a 50 pack box. I've had to clean my machine twice.<br /><br />Planning to complain and return for a different product.

Not so upset at losing a few kcups...stuff happens. More upset at the time it would require to wipe the grinds off of each kcup and then find and throw away the damaged ones.<br /><br />AMZN very promptly gave me a full refund and since it was a 'Grocery Item', they said to keep it or throw it away, but they couldnt take it back.<br /><br />Obviously I took the time to clean everything and kept the undamaged kcups.<br /><br />I recently tried EMERILS BIG EASY BOLD and like it very much. Tried around 8 cups to ensure the last was as good as the first.<br /><br />I wont put it at the top of my 'favorite kcups' list, but will say it was very tasty and worth ordering.<br /><br />Nice 'Parisian' taste. Decent kick.<br /><br />4 star coffee + 5 star AMZN CS = BUY IT. You and your guests should like it and AMZN CS ensures if there is an issue, they will make it right.

We previously got them in 2 25-packs that were easy to open and keep on the counter.  The first time we got this with the new packaging, I had to stop to count if there were really 50 there (seriously, does someone sit and count them as they go in?).  If you have a carousel or old packaging, it won't be an issue.  You will need some way to store them.

review/summary: How Could You Be So Bold
review/text: After FINALLY purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a "to each his or her own" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the "Midnight Magic" brand; I've tried the "Jet Fuel" brand; I've tried the "Donut Shop" brand; I've tried all of the "Extra Bolds"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!

review/text: I ran across this coffee when looking for a dark and 'bold' coffee.  I've always called that "a good strong cup of coffee".<br />This coffee meets my criteria for that.  It is not bitter and doesn't leave a bad coffee taste in your mouth.<br /><br />I'm a tightwad so the $.55/Kcup appealed to me also.  Sometimes I add a teaspoon of my favorite instant and rotate the Kcup 180 deg. and run it through again.  This gives me a second good cup of coffee at reduced prices.:)<br /><br />I will buy more of the Big Easy Bold.

These are not the "extra bold" that have the 25% more grounds so you can make the larger (11 oz) cup, but it holds up nicely on the 9oz setting on my brewer.  Body is deep, good aroma with some bitterness that you would expect from a French Roast blend.  The Keurig review mentions that it uses a minimum of 50% rainforest alliance beans.<br /><br />This is not a flavored coffee, just a nice blend, so don't expect chicory coffee :-)  Now that Amazon sells them, we will put this into our rotation.

review/summary: Defective K-cups!  Great Coffee, but only 1 in 3 K-cups not defective
review/text: This product that comes in the Amazon packaging is defective. It appears in an attempt to save cost, too little foil material is used to seal the top of the K-cup.  As a result, when the K-cup is punctured by the Keurig coffee maker, the foil lid separates from the side of the k-cup, resulting in an explosion of coffee grounds in the coffee maker.  Only 1 of 3 k-cups did not do this.  It is specifically this brand/packaging, since I was making other varieties of k-cup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those broke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker.<br />Looking at the seal on this product, compared to other K-cups varieties, this seal is MUCH tighter, and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this k-cup, there's a lot more to make a mess!<br />Loved the taste of the coffee, but can't waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot!  Don't buy in the Amazon hassle-free packaging, you'll be sorry!

review/summary: The best K-Cup, OBJECTIVELY
review/text: Look, I'm aware that every K-cup variety has a review saying "This is the best K-cup." But I know what I'm talking about, okay? We all know the kind of people whose favorite flavor is Caramel Vanilla Creme, or heaven forbid, "Cappuccino". I'm not talking to them. I don't use cutesy cliches like "cuppa joe" or "packs a punch". This is also not one of those stupid reviews that claims "This is the best cup of coffee I EVER DRANK", because we know K-Cups cannot really compete with fresh-roasted beans. But if you drink K-Cups and you have some discriminating taste in coffee, get this one. Emeril's bold is nice and bold, dark but not too dark, the flavor has some dimension besides "burnt"...trust me.<br /><br />P.S. If you did happen to brew any of those flavored kinds in your machine, because it's a shared machine or your mom got you a variety pack or something, brew a cup of water through first. Then look at all the stuff floating in it, and consider yourself educated.

review/text: I liked the coffee, it was bold but not bitter. I can't recommend though, due to at least 6 k-cups "blowing up" in my Keurig.<br /><br />The whole point of the Keurig is that it's quick, easy, and you get a decent cup of coffee out of it. When you're running late in the morning, and the seal around the K-Cup breaks and coffee / grounds go all over and you've got to clean it up, it's no longer a convenience and is a huge of a hassle.<br /><br />I'm sticking with the Tully's, I've gone through 4 boxes (200 pcs) so far and not a single "blow up".

review/summary: Most K-cups in this lot are defective
review/text: I ordered these last month. Of the first six I've tried, five have blown open and spewed coffee grounds all over our machine (as well as in the cup). I'm getting rather tired of cleaning the Keurig. Normally, I buy our K-cups at local department store but buying in bulk here at Amazon was less expensive. Amazon has graciously replaced the first lot and I was told if this second lot has the same problems, to call them back and they will need to look at pulling the lot. After looking back at the reviews for this product, I think that would be a wise move considering many of us are having the same problem. Thankfully, Amazon's customer service is 5-star so I haven't lost my money.

review/text: Big Easy used to be one of the best bold blends out there.  NOT ANY MORE. The box of 50 I received about a week ago is one of the most disgusting blends I have ever tasted. Very BITTER, no distinguishable aroma, no flavor complexity, nothing going for it. If I was Emeril I would not want my name associated with it anymore. Maybe this will get straightened out, but while they are playing with the coffee chemistry set this blend is best avoided.

review/summary: ...Only because the coffee is so good
review/text: Love this coffee, so I was rather disappointed when I recieved this particular shipment.  The box said it was a pack of 50, but there were only 47 K-cups in the box.  And one of the K-cups had come open, reducing the quantity to 46 and creating a mess of coffee grounds in the box.  Not sure who takes the blame for this - the coffee box was sealed and included inside another box with other items, so that leads me to believe fault lies with "The Coffee People."  I suppose if many others are experiencing this same issue, it may be time to choose another coffee provider.<br /><br />March 29 Update: Discovered 8 other faulty cups in this batch - Top seal would come loose while brewing & cause grounds to overflow from top of K-cup, or the internal filter would leak by and puke coffee grounds into my cup.  I was beginning to suspect a faulty brewer,but when these same results occurred on a second and third brewer, the problem lies in the K-cup...

review/summary: Be Wary of These Pods
review/text: I ordered Emerils Big Easy Bold a few weeks ago, and at least half the time I have been dissatisfied, because there is something wrong with the pods.  The pods do not work well in the Keurig.  Instead of dripping down into the cup, they collect the water, flooding the dispenser and delivering only half a cup.  At first, I thought it was our Keurig, but the other coffee we have, the tea, and the hot chocolate work fine.  It's only Emerils that doesn't perform the way it should. It was ordered new from Amazon, but other Keurig products from Amazon are fine.

review/text: I've tried many brands of extra bold K cup coffees and this one is the best. Well rounded and bold as the caption states. It has gotten slightly weaker over the years, but it is still good. Retail keeps going up here on Amazon as well as other outlets. However, Tully's and Newman's Own is currently much less expensive at the local Club store (C---co). The cost difference is forcing me to move to other retail and brand options. One item of note, the patent on the K Cup is expiring on Sept. 16, 2012. When Green Mountain Roasters is no longer the exclusive manufacturer of K Cups, we can all hope for a large decline in retail prices.

review/summary: good strong cup-o-joe
review/text: First, let me say, I do not consider myself to be a coffee connoisseur or snob. I do not have a refined pallet. But, I do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee. The Emerils bold is exactly what I was looking for. I know there are always those out there that say, "nowhere close to my custom grind and French press." But, I use the keurig for the convenience and variety. The emerils bold is perfect for what I want - a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day.<br />***********<br />Update 7/26/12<br />I've tried a couple other "bold" coffee's, just to compare. (Brooklyn Beanery Fugettaboutit and Jet Fuel)  Not all bolds are the same. The other bolds seemed more bitter. (Some people think that bitter = strong coffee. Not true, strong coffee = good coffee, bitter coffee = bad coffee.) I'm done experimenting with different brands. For a good, strong cup of coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold will be my go to coffee from now on.<br /><br />Also, I just want to make one more comment on defective K-Cups. I see alot of reviews for both Emeril's and other K-Cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their Keurig machine. My wife and I go through 60 - 70 K-Cups per month, since December 2011. We've never had a problem with any of them. (when I say 60 - 70, they're not all Emeril's bold - we would be bouncing off the walls. We also use Caribou breakfast blend, decaf, green tea, heral tea, and hot cocoa.)

At night I go with a lighter blend (from Supermarket using the MyK-Cup) but Emeril's Easy Bold is perfect for my mornings.

review/text: I've had my Keurig coffee maker for over a year and have tried many different K-cups. Most recently, the new Dunkin' Donuts. HATED IT.  I couldn't wait to dump it out and brew one of my Emerils. Of course, with the Keurig brewer, I didn't have to wait long. YUM.  This coffee is for the real coffee drinker. It is strong (even on the large cup size setting), bold and full bodied, but smooth with no bitterness.  By far, my favorite. I order them through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program for the best price. Once in awhile from Bed, Bath and Beyond with a 20% coupon, but their prices have gone up substantially and I prefer the size (50 pack) from Amazon.

review/summary: K-Cup Class
review/text: While my husband and daughter have tried several different k-cup coffee choices, their favorite, hands down, is Emeril's Big Easy Bold. The added chicory gives it the home-grown flavor of New Orleans and blends well with the boldness of the coffee. Give it a try, you may like it too.

review/summary: Nothing but problems
review/text: Just about 9 out of 10 of these would not work in my machine.  Its not my machine we have run hundreds of cups of coffee through it without an issue.  Had to toss most of them in the trash and clean up the mess they made.  They would just stop filtering about a third of the way then just pop and spill grinds everywhere!

review/summary: Delicious but packaging is faulty
review/text: First of all I love the flavor.  Couldn't be happier, it is as described - bold, delicious, loved it.<br /><br />BUT I bought this several times and each time I had problems with my Keurig and the packaging.  The K cups would not empty, would overflow, and would make only 1/2 the amount recommended.  Keurig would say "prime" repeatedly after using these cups, and I would have to go through the extensive method of re-priming my Keurig.  I bought this twice, and (yes, I'm slow), with the second batch realized the problem was the packaging of the K cups.  For whatever reason this kept happening.<br /><br />Since I cannot return this item I am stuck with 30 of these that I won't use.<br /><br />I also won't order anything with the blue cups again, especially not this brand.<br /><br />Just to clarify - I am not a serially negative poster, and I have had my Keurig for over 6 months.  I've used multiple other brands without a problem.<br /><br />For now I'm sticking with Paul Newman's extra bold.  Great flavor and no problems with the K cups.

review/text: My daughter had given me Emeril's Big Easy Bold coffee as a gift.  I like strong coffee.  When I had finished by gift of coffee, I tried other coffee and found I needed to order Emeril's coffee myself.  I work 3rd shift and need coffee to keep me going and this coffee definitely does that!  It has a great flavor, body and aroma and would recommend it to anyone.

review/text: I give this coffee five stars, but I like a really bold bitterness to my coffee.  This coffee is super flavorful, but if you like your coffee medium roast then you should go with another flavor.  This coffee will wake you up, if that's what you are looking for.

review/summary: Emeril's is the best!
review/text: Emeril's Big Easy Bold blend coffee is a full bodied good cup of coffee you will enjoy every morning. I can't wake up until I have the first, then the second cup, and then let the day begin. If you like a stronger cup of coffee without an acid or bitter taste, this one's for you. I prefer cream and sugar in mine and feel it stands up to the taste of any coffee house selection.

review/text: Was hesitant at first to buy this coffee but I couldn't pass up the deal.  My husband and I drink med/bold coffee and are pretty snobbish when it comes to coffee.  I have had better coffee than Emeril's but it's up there in the "good" coffee category.  I would definitely buy again for the cost that it was.

review/summary: A bit bitter
review/text: We love the big bold flavors we typically find in the dark roast coffees available for the Keurig.  However, my family and I found this one a bit too bitter.  The flavors are strong and this is definitely a bold coffee, but the lingering flavor was not as smooth as some of our more favorites.<br /><br />We've tried this on two occasions, once from a sample pack and another time from a box of 24.  We all consistently agreed across the two times.  So I feel pretty confident in our assessment.  Perhaps others will like this if they put more sugar or cream in it to knock a bit of the bitterness off.  Since I use no cream and only a little sweetener, this is just a bit too strong for us.

review/summary: Worth the problems
review/text: I have ordered about 20 boxes of this coffee.  Seems in 3-4 of the packs in each box of 50 clogs up and gives me issues on my machine.  For some reason it punctures the filter bag and grounds clog up everything.  I will normally tap the k-cup on the counter prior to insertion to try and get the filter away from the punture mechanism at the bottom but it still clogs at times.  I have a wire that I use to clean out the jet when it gets clogged.<br /><br />Outside of this issue the coffee is the best on the market if you like a good bold<br />cup of coffee.  I still highly recommend this product.  And..it is a great value.

review/summary: really bold taste - the best I have found
review/text: I have been grinding my own coffee and putting it into a DIY k-cup. I tried several of the "bold" pre-packaged k-cups (I use these when I am in a hurry.) None of them matched up to my own grind until I ran across these. Emeril's Big Easy Bold is the first I have found that make me want to brew them instead of my own grind. Excellent!

Nice for after dinner but not a real waker upper

I normally like most coffees, this one is exceptionally bad. I must have received a bad batch, it seems that the batches are very inconsistent.
