review/summary: Kitchen Smells Like A Chinese Canal With Dead Fish In It
review/text: I bought this product at Wal-Mart. There was no outstanding, bold notice on the box that it contained SHRIMP PASTE in it, which is whole shrimp, legs, heads, tails, all ground to mush, and is extremely fishy-smelling.<br /><br />I followed the instructions - add water to fill line, then add all of the packages, which are not labeled, then added the noodles. I microwaved this product in the company kitchen break room, and now it stinks like a Chinese canal full of dead fish.<br /><br />After cooking the product as directed, I peered inside the open box. UGH. It looked like a bloody red concoction of fish innards. The odor was incredibly BAD. Instead of tossing the box into the kitchen trash I had to toss the box in the outside dumpster.<br /><br />While I do enjoy seafood, this horrible prank of a product stinks really bad. If you really enjoy the foul odor of dead fish, buy this product. Or, if you want to play a rude practical joke on your co-workers, go for it.

review/summary: Not bad at all.
review/text: I just ate a package of these noodles. And that's all you get - noodles, with a series of packages that turn into a sauce. I followed the microwave instructions. At the end of the process, a few of the noodles were a bit firmer than al dente, so next time I will either lengthen the second microwave step or stir and let them sit a couple of minutes or so.<br /><br />Flavor was good. I added pepper, but I like things spicy. I didn't check, but I suspect a high sodium level. Well . . . .<br /><br />If you are looking for a balanced meal, you will need to add meat, vegetables, and share with a friend or two. If you're looking for something quick and filling and don't mind a few (!!) carbs, well, go for it. It isn't authentic Thai, but it isn't bad. Plus it's gluten free, and my wife has celiac disease, so it's another choice for the quick meal section or our pantry.

review/summary: Really Delicious Pickled Onions.
review/text: I picked up a jar of Haywards Traditional Onions at a nearby Fresh and Easy store. They're a British company and have all sorts of interesting English imports. I guess that's what these are, although I can't decipher the address. Well, no matter. They're some really delicious pickled onions. I can't say that I've ever had any better. I can't figure out why. It might be the vinegar or the "spice extracts" as listed on the label. Well whatever. They're a bit expensive but, my, they're really good. And, of course, they've only got 11 calories per serving and no fat. Plus, the sodium is low which is good for a pickled product. Yum!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Delicious sweet tea and great price!
review/text: When I was pregnant, I was looking for a way to help stay hydrated because I was getting tired of drinking so much water.  So I bought a can of this at my local grocery store to try and it did the trick - one glass a day helped me break up the monotony of drinking water all the time.  This tea is made with sugar, which I prefer because I don't like the taste of sweeteners.  The raspberry flavor is delicious and I enjoy it more than Snapple which used to be my favorite raspberry tea.<br /><br />It's extremely easy to make and the powder dissolves pretty well (it's a little harder to get it to dissolve if the water is extremely cold, so I typically use cool water and then add some ice cubes to it after I've stirred it).  I found them at local grocery stores (Publix and Winn Dixie) for about $8/canister, so you're basically purchasing two and getting the third free here on Amazon.

review/summary: THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA
review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING "REAL BREWER'S YEAST" -- NOTHING ADDED<br /><br />This "Genuine Brewer's Yeast" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

Interestingly, the larger vendors tend to have fresher product, and this is evidenced by the expiration date on the jar which typically gives you about 2 years on these vacuum sealed containers.<br /><br />THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE:<br /><br />[WE AND I ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE SALE OR PROMOTION OF THIS OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT -- I SIMPLY BELIEVE IN BREWER'S YEAST AND THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF ABOUT 4 BRANDS THAT I HAVE ALWAYS PURCHASED FOR OUR PERSONAL CONSUMPTION OVER THE YEARS]

review/summary: B Vitamin Bonanza
review/text: I first encountered brewers yeast when pregnant.  It kept coming up again and again as the perfect food based nutritional additive.  Since it is food based and not a suppliment, it is easily absorbed.  However, it is known for its unpleasent taste.  A serving is two heaping tablespoons, and at first I could not find something to mix it in that I liked well enough, so I gave up on it temporarily.  It kept coming up in my researches for a healthy pregnancy, and so returned to it and it has remained part of my daily routine.  The mix I found I like quite well is the two heaping tablespoons mixed into about 5oz of Pom pomagranite juice.  This mixture is actually quite pleasent.<br /><br />I have tried a few different brands, and I am fond of Twinlab for the more palitable taste and the balance of the B vitamins.  The "subscribe and save" deal on Amazon puts it at a very good price.

review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPUPSS">Brewer's Yeast</a> is for my cats. Every day I sprinkle a little onto their food. They like the taste of the yeast and regard it as a special treat. The yeast provides them with extra B vitamins.<br /><br />One of the vitamins in the yeast is vitamin B1, thiamine. Many people believe that thiamine repels fleas. This has not been proved. However, since the cats like the yeast, they get in on their food. One 18 ounce bottle seems to last forever. Also, they do not have fleas.

review/text: I ordered this as what is said to be a more bio-available source of chromium and B12, as well as essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals and trace elements, vs most of the peddled chromium supplements. I haven't tried sprinkling it directly on food but I have enjoyed adding it to my shakes and the flavors it imparts. A blender helps when adding to liquids as it seems to mix about as well as powdered cocoa.

review/summary: Good taste, bad solubility
review/text: I started taking brewers yeast because the large amount of chromium in it is supposed to be very good for your skin, especially if it's acne prone. I've been taking it since the end of January and my skin still breaks out a little bit, but I stopped taking it for a couple of days and my face broke out a lot so I suppose that it is having some sort of an effect. An online review I read said that most people's skin cleared after eight months in an study, so I am staying positive.<br /><br />I started out by taking Swansons' Brewer's Yeast Powder, and mixed it in smoothies and grapefruit juice. I tried mixing it in orange juice, which was pretty bad, and even just having it with water, which was horrible and made me gag. Because I wasn't crazy about the taste, I read some reviews and decided to try this product next. The taste is much better, it is much less noticeable, especially if I add a little bit of peanut butter or grapefruit juice to the smoothies. The taste is also not at all noticeable in warmed apple juice. I don't have the courage to try it in plain water, though.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is that it does not dissolve well. I cannot stir it in any cold liquid without getting clumps (hopeless when stirred with a spoon or knife, somewhat works when stirred with a fork but little clumps remain), I can barely dissolve all of it in warmed liquids, and if I put it first in my blender when I make the smoothies, a lot of it remains at the bottom. In that respect, I liked Swansons' Brewer's Yeast better. This one is a little bit high maintenance because if I want to just have it in grapefruit juice, I have to put it in the blender first and when I make smoothies, I have to make sure that it's one of the last things to go in. I would, however, buy this product again if I can't find a brewers yeast that has the taste of this product with a better solubility.

review/text: this stuff is ok.  I was hoping it was the flakes but it's a very fine powder, like a flour consistency.  Which makes it kinda turn pasty when sprinkled on veggies or sprinkled on popcorn.  The taste isn't bad, not really great either, but not bad.  I think the yeast flakes would be better, more texture.  But since it only comes in the 3 bottle package, I have 3 bottles to get through now before I can buy the flakes!  If you're not sure you'll like it, try to find it in a single bottle first.

review/summary: I love Lea & Perrins Traditional Steak Sauce
review/text: This is a wonderful sauce who's value I would put at about the same value per-ounce as A1 Sauce. I would even pay a slight premium more if you love it as much as I do but not a huge premium.<br /><br />For burgers this is hands down my absolute favorite topping.  A properly seasoned beef-patty w/ lettuce, Swiss cheese and Lea&Perrins Traditional Steak Sauce make a perfect burger.  This sauce is has great tangy, well-seasoned, slightly spicy-sweet flavor that is very unique.  I recommend every one try it.  Right now, a few local restaurants around me have it on their tables.  If you see it in your area, you really should try it on anything beef. Also, you can substitute this for any A1 Sauce flavor to try it out.<br /><br />In my opinion, Lea&Perrins has a done a very poor job of marketing this wonderful product in the U.S., and are really short changing themselves and their Customers. Way too often, I ask for this sauce in a Restaurant or Grocer and they'll say they have it. But, they are always thinking of the L&P Worcestershire Sauce and are always confused there could be anything else. L&P really could have named the product better too to make it very distinct from their truly "traditional sauce" which is, of course, "Lea&Perrins Original Worcestershire Sauce". Their Worcestershire is great in it's own right, but these two sauces have very different flavor profiles.  This is the second time this product has become commonly available in the U.S. and I am really hoping they do a better job of getting the word out this time.<br /><br />I love this sauce and I'm sure you'll at least like it a lot.  Try it and let me know what you think.  Thanks.

review/text: I am the sort of mom who likes to bake my own cookies because 1) it's fun, and 2) I like to know what goes into them.  However, when that is not practical I buy these ginger snap cookies.<br /><br />I don't mind giving them to my family because they are mostly organic (70%) and they don't contain hydrogenated oils nor corn syrup.  In addition, they contain iron - from the molasses - which is  something you don't often find in a snack.<br /><br />Four Stars.  A superior product in my opinion.  The whole family loves them.  Even my extremely picky son.  The flavor is zingy with a definite bite and each cookie is only 26 calories.  One of the few store-bought treats that I have no problem handing out to the children.<br /><br />Pam T~

Product of Canada.<br /><br />Update:  I placed my order about 6-months ago and finally worked my way through the 12-pack.  They are not as fresh tasting now, of course but they still go great with my coffee and I consider them a healthy snack.  My sister thought they were too spicy but I love that ginger spice and just placed another order.

review/summary: Good cookies!
review/text: These cookies have a clean, crispy chocolate taste -- without the chemical-laced aftertaste of other commercially produced cookies. They are all-natural and made with canola oil, as opposed to the oils that can add to cholesterol problems. The ingredients are mostly organic and they are sweetened with dehydrated can juice, as opposed to the less-healthy commercial alternatives.<br /><br />Now, for the problem: I have never found these cookies in a market near me, and we have only purchased them through Amazon. Because these wonderful cookies are not pumped-up with weird chemical preservatives, the necessity of purchasing them in such big lots means that you are going to be eating a lot of cookies in a short period of time, or going in with a friend on sharing the case! However, given the high quality of this product, you should have no problem splitting up the order.<br /><br />Yummy and highly recommended!

These are great with peanut butter.  Yum.  I also like to crush them up a little in my mortar & pestle & mix them into my granola.  They also make good cookie crumb pie crusts.  There are so many great uses for these including of course just eating them out of the bag.

review/summary: Crunchy Little Cookie - Delicious
review/text: My order for Mi-Del Ginger Snaps arrived a few hours ago and I tried my first one ... okay, I'm on my 10th cookie now.  My first bite of one I noticed it had a hard crunch.  I like crunchy cookies, others may not.  I read here that you can leave the top opened on the bag overnight to soften them.  The cookie is about 3-4 bites worth.  On my first bite I could feel a little tongue tingle.  Each subsequent bite produced the same warm tingle and THAT is what puts this ginger snap in a class of its own, never losing that 'bite'.  It's not too overdone or underdone on the spice, it's a perfect little cookie.  Not to mention they are 26 calories each, and ingredient that are pronounceable, this makes for an excellent little treat with coffee, tea, or vanilla ice cream.  Excellent product that I will purchase again.<br /><br />Note: Expiration date on the bags are December 17th, 2010 but I don't think they will last that long.<br /><br />--Sailor Hill, CA

review/summary: Well worth the money
review/text: I originally bought the Mi-Del cookies at a local odd-lots store over a year ago. I felt a sense of loss after the store stopped carrying them, since no other local grocer stocked them. So I was glad to see that they were available, albeit in bulk quantities only, via Amazon. I love these cookies, and best of all, they're about as healthy as you can find anywhere. I have to watch my intake of saturated fats, and per 5-cookie serving, the Mi-Del snaps have zero grams of sat-fat. They're delicious, with a nice, somewhat subdued chocolate flavor and a crunchy snap. I keep them in the fridge and they maintain their freshness for MONTHS. Twelve packages may seem like a lot, but I look forward to devouring every one of them. I've also tried the vanilla and lemon snaps, and they're equally outstanding.

review/text: This is the cookie that is the bain of my existence. I absolutely love it.<br /><br />They taste best when they are really fresh so if you buy this 12 pack dont wait 6 months to eat them all ... they dont have a long shelf life ... they get hard and loose flavor even if you never open the bag. This is probably because they are made with natural ingredients and dont have the preservatives found in other cookies.<br /><br />But honestly i love these cookies they are sweet, crisp and very gingery ... even my sister and brother in law who don't eat anything "healthy" or "organic" because they think it wont taste good, where impressed with the taste of these cookies.<br /><br />Now they are hooked too and buy them all the time.

review/summary: A Great Dunking Cookie
review/text: This cookie stands up very well to dunking in milk (about three dunked bites per cookie), and with mostly organic ingredients is about as guilt-free as possible in a cookie. We like a crisp ginger snap, and while the bag isn't self-sealing it seals well if you have a clip. We find the ginger level to be just right -- not overpowering, but definitely there.<br /><br />One correction to the ingredient list posted on this site -- there's no grape juice concentrate in the cookie, according to the bag I'm looking at right now and the Mi-Del website.<br /><br />Per serving size of 5 cookies: Calories 140; Total Fat 4g; Carbs 22g; Fiber 1g; Sugars 11g.

review/summary: So good people are taking them from me!
review/text: These cookies seemed to be a pretty good deal when I saw that there was a special offer on them. I LOVE cookies (who doesnt??) but am kinda picky about texture. I dislike soft mushy cookies although if desperate...but I know that "snap" cookies are usually not soft so I took a chance and ordered a case!  I live alone so a case of cookies was, at once, both frightening and decadent---but I think I am going to have to order another case!  Everyone who tasted these asked me "so where did you find these?"  Of course, since I am the online shopper from hell, everyone figured I found some obscure website and paid a fortune. "Natural" and "Organic" are buzz words for "gonna cost ya more" but the price was great per bag. After I told my friends and family who tasted them that I ordered a case---the bags started disappearing pretty fast! I got hit with guilt---What are YOU going to do with 12 bags of cookies? (duh--eat them!) and everyone was very happy to lighten up my stash by taking a bag so I dont overeat! Dont I have the BEST friends and family??? LOL  Seriously--I was happy to hand them over! I enjoy turning people on to new finds. I gave a bag to my Parcel Post guy and my UPS guy (after all--they lug all the boxes to my apartment!) and they were happy! And there is a method to my giving-away madness (especially to the carriers)! Less dropping and throwing around of MY boxes!<br /><br />Ok--they are nice and lemoney (?) but they could even be a bit more lemon-like for me! They are made with more healthful ingredients (no trans-fat) so even though I am pigging out on cookies--I dont feel nearly as guilty! And at less than $2 a bag--I think they are a greal deal! Plus it never hurts to have extra cookies in the house because a cookie emergency can happen at any given moment!  So--order them!  I think you will be pleased!

review/text: Mi-Del Old-Fashion "Swedish Style" Lemon Snaps are a crispy, chewy, lemony delight! If you are always in search of healthy snacks that aren't short on flavor, these are the cookies for you.<br /><br />These Lemon Snaps are made with organic unbleached wheat flour, canola oil and natural lemon flavor -- there's no artificial "lolly-pop" lemon taste here. You can just imagine squeezing the lemon into the mix, yourself.<br /><br />Five cookies have 140 calories, so it's not too much for a little something to get you through your day, or after dinner as a light dessert without the guilt.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I like the fact that the Mi-Del cookies are low-fat and use some organic ingredients.  I love the Mi-Del lemon and vanilla flavors, and their ginger snaps are ok -- BUT these chocolate snaps are no good.  I'm a chocolate lover, so this is rather disappointing.  The taste is similar to the ginger snap, but it's off quite a bit - slightly bitter.  It's as if they didn't put enough sugar in these snaps to counter the bitterness of cocoa powder. It also has a poor aftertaste that's slightly bitter (the lemon snap aftertaste is awesome keeps me wanting more).<br /><br />Gotta give it 1 star - yeah, I ate 10 of these to give them a chance, but I threw away the rest of the bag. The crunch and texture is the same as the other Mi-Del Snaps, but the flavor is off.  Not Recommended.

The triple braid was very flimsy, usually much thicker.<br />My dogs have been plowing through these because of the thin woven braids.Also, I do not consider these low odor. They stink and I need to keep them in the basement because of the smell. Overall I will not order these again, they are too expensive<br />To be going through them as fast as we have been.

review/summary: High odor and short lasting but dog loves them
review/text: My 50lb Australian Shepherd loves bully sticks, so I decided to purchase these because they are described as low-odor, thick cut, and are significantly less expensive than bully sticks I've purchased else where. With Amazon prime, they arrived promptly and were all approximately 12" and thick cut as described.  However, these sticks smelled much worse than others I have purchased that were not described as low-odor.  I would also note that they aren't long-lasting.  My dog isn't a voracious chewer, and one of these sticks will hold up for about an hour of chewing- about the same amount of time as the single cut bully sticks I've purchased in the past.  Taking into consideration the short chewing time and higher odor, I would rate these average.  I will give these to my dog as an occasional treat, but they are too expensive for regular use.

review/text: On Amazon.com the braided 12" bully sticks thick select specify "low" odor.  Maybe someone from Amazon ought to go into the warehouse, open a bag of these bully sticks, and see if they too get knocked over and nauseated from the extremely strong odor.  Amazon seriously needs to consider changing the verbage on this product, or check their resources to see if the item is being stored properly in their warehouse.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012UK4BM">Braided 12" Bully Sticks Thick Select Low Odor, 10 pieces, Made in USA</a>

review/summary: Doesn't last long
review/text: I read reviews about how long these lasted but I'm not sure if those dogs have teeth. I have a 90lb German Shepard and a 70lb puppy husky mix. They would have one of these gone in under 30 minutes. They didn't smell and they were not messy but not worth the money when they just don't last as lone as an old raw hide bone. I can get the big ones of those and they last 12 to 18 hours.

review/summary: A bit loose but workable
review/text: The braided bully sticks were a bit thin and loosely woven together. In my case this is exactly what I wanted as I have two small bichon frise dogs. To give them a whole would be too much. I cut them in thirds and unravel the  braid easily. This way each dog gets a portion to chomp on.

review/summary: From a loyal and nostalgic consumer
review/text: My grandmother always had Mr Mustard in her cupboard for my visits more than four decades ago, and I've religeously bought it for myself throughout my adulthood.<br />Now all of a sudden, it's nowhere to be found.  Thank goodness for the internet, but I don't appreciate the fact that I have to pay for shipping for something I used to find right down the street.  I hope the lack of marketing on the company's part now isn't an indication that this product will go the way of the dinosaur in the near future.  If so, it would be a real shame but not a surprise; to depend upon people like me who would actually spend $20 on two tiny jars of hotdog dressing is surely a recipe for business disaster.<br />This is great stuff- just the right subtle combination of flavors, and there's nothing comparable out there on grocery shelves right now.<br />Mr. Mustard, take note!

review/summary: Couldn't be happier with it
review/text: My son was 18 months old when he was put on this drink. He had a mild to moderate allergic reaction to cow's milk protein, which caused him throwing up quite often. It's always been a struggling for us, as a parent, to keep the weight on him (he's always on the 20th percentile). Then the dietary specialist recommended this drink to us and said if he can drink 5 cans per day he'll gain weight even without eating anything else. This is the only milk (soy/cow milk) that provides 30cal/oz.<br /><br />It took a little bit time to migrate him from cow's milk to soymilk. We started out from 1oz then gradually added up, now we mix 4oz can with 4oz regular SILK. He goes through 2 cans per day. And he's up to 50-60% on weight at 2 years old and he's not thrown up since then, nor has he been sick either. We highly recommend it. We hope to be able to buy it from the regular grocery store though.

review/summary: A total lifesaver!!!
review/text: My son was diagnosed with Failure to Thrive (FTT), he is 17 months old and currently weighs 18lbs. About 6 months ago we discovered he has a severe allergy to diary, eggs & peanuts - among other things. We had been giving him regular soy milk for awhile but I was looking for something a little more nutritious that would supplement his diet and help him put on some weight when I found this product. Believe it or not this is the only soy-based product of it's kind which I just don't understand - there are so many kiddos out there with dairy allergies!! I even found an article online praising Bright Beginnings for developing this sort of product, they were able to tap into a huge market that even Pediasure hadn't touched. My other options were all dairy-based or EXTREMELY expensive so we decided to try this. Let me just say that within a month's time, I have ordered over 12 cases just to make sure we don't run out. It has been a total lifesaver for us. My son loves it and I feel good knowing that on those days when my toddler is too busy to eat as well as I think he should he's still getting a lot of nutrients from this product. My son put on exactly 1 pound in exactly 1 month thanks to this product.<br /><br />A big THANKS to Amazon.com for carrying this product!!! Not only is it cheaper here than anywhere else they ship it so quickly which I really appreciate!!!!

review/summary: walmart makes the same drink, cheaper!
review/text: I ordered this drink for my son who was diagnosed with milk allergy and failure to thrive at almost 2. Before purchasing I read the other reviews and wanted to share they were helpful. Like the others my son likes this drink a lot and he doesn't like any thing a lot. I wanted to share that like many others I was concerned about the cost. While picking up my baby supplies at walmart I took a look at their selection on pediatric drinks, they have the same product! Its a vanilla soy pediatric drink. It is about 30 cents cheaper per can so about 2 dollars per 6 pack. Im not sure if every walmart will carry it or if its free shipping online. But I wanted to share that I found another option. My son doesn't seem to notice the difference between the drinks.

review/summary: Good Product and Source
review/text: Our two-year-old son was diagnosed "failure to thrive" at nine months old and shortly after diagnosed with eosiniphilic esophagitis.  He has major allergies to egg, dairy, peanuts, several tree nuts and a mild wheat allergy.  He was getting all these things through my milk and his body was unable to get nutrients from it.  With the help of treatment, food avoidance, and Bright Beginnings as his major calorie source he has not only gained weight but grown substantially and is now "thriving."<br />We live in a very small town where we have to travel nearly an hour to the nearest store that carries the Bright Beginnings drink.  Last month I ordered it for the first time from this source and while paying only for normal postage had it delivered to my door the next day for the same cost as driving the distance to the store to buy it.  I am thrilled to now have this easy method of ordering so I don't need to worry about running out anymore.

review/summary: Amazing product
review/text: I have tried everything to put weight on my kiddo. He has multiple food allergies and this finally worked. He only has 1/2 a can per day and he gained a pound in a week and a half. If your kid will not take the vanilla flavor straight add some v8 splash to it or smoothie. Then it's like juice. He has been hospitalized for not eating dehydration, every time he gets sick. I am keeping my fingers crossed but I think this might be a miracle. Just be aware it has a lot of sugar, like formula so you might have a spazzy kid. Could just be he is getting stamina from being so thin. Better than being below the fifth percentile for everything!

review/summary: Apparently delicious.  Maybe too delicious.
review/text: The only problem I have with this drink is that it's so sweet and yummy that my little one refuses to drink anything else.  It got to a point where he would even refuse to eat and just wanted to drink this all day long.  We started giving him this drink because he was a picky eater to begin with, and he got much worse in terms of variety of foods he would eat when he knew this drink was in the house.  So we had to wean him off this drink for fear he would never try new foods again.  This is not entirely the fault of the drink of course, but it was just counterproductive for us unfortunately because it's so sweet.  It was absolutely great to have this with us on the go and to be able to give it to him when he skipped a meal because of his pickiness.  In the short term it certainly helped with weight gain, but in the long term it seemed to make him even pickier.

review/summary: Contains BPA!
review/text: I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better.  We already have enough cancer in our family.  I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen?<br /><br />Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products.  Let me know if anyone finds BPA free tomato products, such as tomato paste, diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes...by responding to this comment--I will get an email.<br /><br />I have young children and I will not feed them anymore BPA!!!

review/summary: Not for everyone
review/text: These have a very strong, distinctive taste that I think is more burnt and sour than tomato-y.  I am going to have to find someone to give them to, because I find myself not making dishes including tomatoes in order to avoid using them.  This is a matter of personal preference, and if you like them, great.  They aren't for me.  I prefer a milder taste that allows the tomato flavor to be the star.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I ordered these because finding canned Organic Tomatoes in bulk around my area is hit or miss. I went with the fire-roasted instead of plain and they are truly delicious. So far I have used them in Beef Stew, Chili, Enchilada Casserole and home-made Tomato Basil Soup. The roasted flavor really adds a lot to the recipes without being overpowering. I am really glad to have found these.

review/summary: I don't like tomatoes much,
review/text: But I eat these straight out of the can with a little salt and pepper.  So good.  Flavorful and robust taste.  There is nothing like these.  You can't compare these to even the name brands in the store. Buy them.  You'll love them.  They are of course great with everything from stews to gumbos.  Yummy!

review/text: I use these fire roasted tomatoes for salsa, chili, sauce, bruschetta, soups and anything else that calls for ordinary canned tomatoes.  The smoky flavor makes all of my recipes taste great.  You should buy these.  Plus, they are organic - hooray!

review/summary: Muir Glen Organic Tomatos
review/text: Best canned tomatoes ever!  Since I was able to buy in bulk (12 cans or a half-case), I realized significant savings over the price of the same item in local supermarkets.  I live in the Northwest where tomato season is very short and having good quality canned tomatoes brightens up the bleakest winter day.  The fire-roasted version adds an additional layer of flavor.

review/text: These fire roasted tomatoes are wonderful.  I use them for many different sauces and soups.  They add a nice sweet smoky (but not strong) flavor.  I love that these are organic and you can tell a real difference in the taste.

review/summary: Great for plant based diet
review/text: Muir Glen's products are great.  A year ago I switched my diet to be very strict to Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn's plant based diet guidelines so I wouldn't have a heart attack.  In today's processed food kingdom, it is hard to find products with NO added sugars, NO added oils; but this product fills that void perfectly.  I combine this with the thicker Muir Glen's tomato sauce, small can and simmer it down and it is really nice.  Dr. Esselstyn's book and the other Muir Glen products land right on my doorstep thanks to Amazon.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583333002">Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure</a>

review/summary: You Won't Find Any Better Canned, Roasted Tomatoes!
review/text: My wife and I use a case of these tomatoes every month.  The taste and quality simply can't be beat - unless my wife fire roasts our home grown tomatoes!  These are much easier than roasting our own on the BBQ.<br /><br />I send a couple of cans to my 89 year old mother periodically and she simply heats them and eats them.  It took considerable coaxing to get her to try them initially because she feared that "Fire Roasted" meant that they would be spicy.  Of course they aren't spicy in the least.<br /><br />We have subscribed with Amazon to have a case delivered monthly.  Of course being an Amazon Prime member means that shipping is free for these heavy cases of mouth watering tomatoes.  The automatic delivery makes our lives just a little simpler.

review/summary: Manufacturer Says No Longer Using BPA
review/text: The manufacturer says that it has been transitioning out of BPA cans and completed that process with the fall 2011 harvest. I don't know what the shelf life is for canned tomatoes, so I don't know whether what's being sold in June 2012 might have been packaged pre-September 2011. But at least you have a shot at a non-BPA can with these tomatoes!<br /><br />Oh, and they also taste good. Very adaptable, since they aren't strongly seasoned but the fire roasting brings out even more tomato flavor.

review/summary: Excellent Quality Tomato Products
review/text: Muir Glen has the best quality tomato products on the market. They are a bit more expensive than the cheap brands at the grocery store, but well worth the difference. Since I "subscribe" to regular shipments of Muir Glen tomatoes, from Amazon, it is less expensive to have them shipped to my home, than to buy Muir Glen at the local stores. Since not many stores carry Muir Glen anyhow, it is, by far, much better to buy these delicious tomatoes from Amazon.com.
