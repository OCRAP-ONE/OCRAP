review/text: It is a very nice milk powder. I don't have any allergies in particular but I am genetically lactose intolerant. If I have more than 2 glasses of milk in a day, my stomach will feel all acidic. I don't face that same problem with this milk. I drink this over the liquid one sold at stores because this has more value for money and has got folic acid in it. Be warned though, if you don't like the smell of goat meat, you might not particularly like this since it has a bit of that smell. It mixes very well with hot water and not so well with normal water. Despite all of that, I love it and use it to make my milkshake.

review/summary: All that and less $ than our local store
review/text: Thanks a-lot for the Review Starflakes.  We haven't made ice cream with it yet, we will be trying it.  Our daughter is now 3, and is also allergic to cows milk and soy.  We found it works well in recipes that can support the heavy cream or buttermilk flavor, like pancakes and mashed potatoes.<br /><br />To the person with the bad review, We had a lot of trouble transitioning to other milks.  We currently mix the whole can plus a quart of fresh milk to make a gallon and a half (weaker concentration than suggested).  Our daughter also demands that we heat it to at least lukewarm (45 sec in microwave).  I thank starflakes again for the explanation that it does taste better warm.<br /><br />We will also sometimes add in a pint of goat yogurt in our blend (usually to the half gallon portion).  We bought a few cans of the condensed for emergency use, when we tried to use the can on a trip, she wouldn't drink it (though we didn't have the normal to blend it with).<br /><br />Even blending it with a quart of fresh milk, we go through 2-3 cans a week, and started buying it by the case when our local store couldn't keep up with our demand, even then we frequently buy them out waiting for the next case.  Hopefully the online supply is more reliable in addition to costing less.

review/text: I do not drink cow milk and was on soy which was sinking me further into estrogen dominance.  Remembering that I had liked goat milk when I had the opportunity to drink it fresh from the goat in my home country.  I started to do some research online to see if it would be a good substitute and what do you know, it was.  Yes it is not fresh straight from the goat milk, but being able to have it again has been a blessing.  Thank you Mayenberg for both the powdered and evaporated milk.  Thank you Amazon for offering it a price that is not breaking my purse.

review/summary: a little sour but great for baking with
review/text: I don't find the taste of this goat milk very pleasing if mixed to use in liquid form; I've had fresh goat milk and frankly, this does not come anywhere close even with reasonable expectations because of the powered form. It does however have its use in my kitchen in baked goods where the flavor even if slightly sour can be of use. Certain bread, pancakes and the like do very well if I add this mix instead of other milks or water. Good to have in the pantry for those "just-in case" days.

review/summary: Dry mixed with evaporated? Why and how much?
review/text: I've been drinking/using the fresh Goat's milk for years. I've recently bought the dry milk<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZTS">Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk, Vitamin D, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a> in hope of saving a little money. It does taste a little powdery. I can't drink it straight, where I used to with the fresh. I noticed on the Amazon page where it says....customers who bought this also bought....evaporated goat's milk<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EY5COG">Meyenberg Evaporated Goat Milk, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. I'm wondering if this makes it creamier or taste better. I hope to get some feedback from those who have tried combining the two and what quantity of dry to what quantity of evaporated? I'm trying not to give up on the dry yet.<br />Thank you, Vicki

review/text: This stuff apparently has a shelf life of many weeks, even after opening. And it tastes ok in tea and coffee, once you get used to it, which is more than I can say for soy milk.<br /><br />But, I give it just 4 stars because it's so hard to mix. Now, if they added some modern chemicals to allow easier mixing, even if it caused an allergic reaction, I still wouldn't vote for Newt Gingrich.

First, she tells me that THEY HAVE NO ANTIBIOTICS BUT the FDA won't allow them to put it on their can.  I said "lots of companies put no antibiotics on their label".  Then she said we are making a new label.  I felt a definate flippant attitude.  I felt like she just wanted me to get off the phone.<br /><br />Well, I just canceled my autoship for their goat milk. I am now looking for another goat milk that puts "no antibiotics" on their label.  I know that there are some good goat milk companies that do this.

review/summary: Yummy Cheesecake Dessert
review/text: This is great for a quick, easy, versatile dessert when you don't want to heat up the oven. Although it doesn't taste exactly like cheesecake, it's a pretty good cheesecake-like dessert for the price. I like to make the mini-cheesecakes suggested on the box and top them with fruit. One note of caution: Amazon's cost per box is a little high. In this pack of 12, each box of mix costs about $2.30, but a box costs around $1.80 in my local Target. So, I recommend this product, and I suggest buying it at a local store.

review/text: I'm rather conflicted about this product. Granted, it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea (like the ones you get at dim sum places) when brewed hot, however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar. It doesn't taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it's iced and combined with sugar. The tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light. I need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then I'm pretty much done with the entire canister. Too pricey for me.

review/text: After recently having a chance to try out all the flavors of these brand new David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans, I have to say the Pomegranate is by far my favorite. The flavor is just perfect. Sweet, but not too sweet. Not tart or overpowering in flavor. It's mild and the taste is just right. The beans appearance is even beautiful! With their rich red color and shine, they look like little glistening rubies that catch the light. You can even taste the difference in how these are made using natural ingredients and coloring. They actually have a fresh taste to them. Not hard, artificial and stale tasting like so many other brands. These are a truly gourmet jelly beans.

review/text: First thing in the morning it is nice to have a hot cup of coffee to wake you up while you watch the news.  We have always drunk Maxwell house coffee and even when I was a child my parents used it.  It is one of the best coffee brands available.  As we have gotten older we needed to consume less caffeine and we actually brew a mixture of part of this coffee and part of the Maxwell House Decaf blend.  It helps us reduce our caffeine and we still get to enjoy our coffee in the morning with just a little kick in it.<br /><br />The price of the coffee here is about the right list price but the shipping is a killer adder.  On sale at a local store we get it for less than half the price and no shipping.  This is a very good product and I recommend it to you.

But it has also been much harder finding the right kind of great tasting cup, and that does definitely come well with Maxwell House and the simple Original Roast Blend. The taste is definitely simple and not too string for most new coffee drinkers, but elequent enough to get your mornings off to a great start with each and every savory cup. While there aren't many great brands of coffee that've shown that test of time, Maxwell House has been one that hasn't lost its shine. I absolutely recommend this brand each and every time.<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Taste: B+<br /><br />Overall: B+

review/text: Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix is very, very good.  However, know when you order in the small packages you are not getting the baking mix.  You are getting individual (or for two people) servings of pancake and waffle mix.  This formula is different than that for the larger packages of Baking and Pancake Mix and does not make biscuits, muffins, or other short breads very well, too sweet for my taste.  If you are looking for great tasting pancake or waffles in a smaller package, then this is for you.  If you are looking for a great baking mix as well as pancakes and waffles, then get the larger packages.

review/summary: Great packaging, great taste!
review/text: The package arrived with all the cans inside of a cardboard tray that was shrink wrapped.  There was no damage to the cans and they tasted just fine.<br /><br />As far as V-8 itself...<br /><br />I enjoy using V-8 as a meal replacement (replacing a greasy breakfast).  Think of it as tomato soup with a little less flavoring.  It was an acquired taste for me that I have since come to enjoy.  If you find that the original is a bit on the bland side, you can try the spicy flavor as a nice alternative.  The only drawback is that spicy has a bit more sodium.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: I ordered two 24 can packs of 11.5 oz. V-8 juice, which were boxed together and filled with inflated plastic to buffer. When i opened the box, although all the flip-tabs appeared to be intact, one can had leaked some of it's contents and the juice was all over the other cans and inside the box. I weighed the cans to find out which one/s had leaked and that's how i determined which one to throw away.(the weight of the cans varied, but the variance was consistent, except one can was a few ounces short)  I am hoping it was just from the one can and i don't turn up with salmonella down the road. Since this was a UPS delivery, i am kind of surprised that amount of pressure was put on this package. Usually get superior service from them. I have ordered like this in the past, and the product arrived in perfect condition, so as i said, i was disappointed this time.

review/summary: Great Substitute!
review/text: I have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have a meat eating husband.  For years, I have been looking for a good ground beef substitute.  I finally found one.  This one had a good taste and texture when cooked.  My meat eating husband is even happy with it when I use it.  One of the things I love is that I use this to make meatballs, and they stay together.  In the past, they never stayed together.  This is a great product, and I'm happy I found it.

I made stuffed green peppers with it just as you would a traditional recipe substituting the mix. My husband, who is a avid meat eater really enjoyed it and said he would not mind eating more often. I also made the sausage style in an omelet with peppers and onions and it was tasty. I ordered a pack of six of the burger mix right here on amazon!

review/text: I have been a Vegetarian for about a year now, so I am relatively new to the meat substitute market.  But this is by far the best Veggie burger mix I have tried.  Far better then any of the frozen patties you can get in grocery stores.  An added bonus is the versatility of the mix.  You can use it for many different things instead of just being stuck with patty form like the frozen variety.  My meat eating girlfriend really likes this as well, and she tends to be pretty picky.

review/text: Some of my family are vegetarians but the rest are die-hard meat eaters. This is one product that the whole family will eat.  We like it as burgers but we LOVE it as meatloaf and meatballs in spaghetti.  We like that it keeps a good texture even when simmered in sauce.  I love that it has the texture and 'bite' that hamburger has.  As an extra bonus, I'm on Weight Watchers and it's low in points!

review/summary: Mixed review: convenient, okay taste, bad stomach problems
review/text: I bought this mainly because another review (can't remember if it was on Amazon or another site) said it was better than Morningstar Farms crumbles and because it is GMO free. Now, I've been a vegetarian since I was thirteen (and that was decades ago), but I am the sort that DOES want fake meat resembling meat. I've little interest in a mushroom-quinoa burger; I want a meaty-yet-vegetarian burger with mushroom quinoa on the side. Also, I'm a professional chef, so I'm very picky about the foods I eat.<br /><br />I'm saying this because I think it is important to know what the reviewer likes to eat when you base your purchase on a review.<br /><br />Tonight, I used the Harmony Valley hamburger mix in lasagna alla bolognese. I also did the same recipe with the MF crumbles to compare. Two things I was curious about:<br /><br />1) flavor: they're *kind of* about the same, especially considering I was adding a browned mirepoix, marmite, and veg Worcestershire ... I guess I should fry up a patty of just the HV mix, but I did eat a raw spoonful and it was okay, but blander than MF<br /><br />2) texture: MF wins. It just does (sorry, MF haters). It has larger pieces with a more meat-like texture. Plus, even after absorbing water in the fridge and then simmering on the stove, the HV was too wet.<br /><br />Now, the reviewer who also liked it better than MF also said something about it holding together on its own and that MF doesn't. Well, that's true. This was thick and stuck to itself, much more like the texture of ground meat - if you were to puree it. I use MF often in meatballs, and it holds together when bound with eggs and cheese. I guess that's the difference; I don't just want to thaw or add water and *poof* have dinner. I expect to cook with an ingredient, the same as I would with real beef.<br /><br />So I wasn't bowled over in those ways, but I liked it. HV hamburger mix is good and I'm sure it will be useful, which is also a plus - no worry about not having bought a bag of frozen crumbles, you've got a half dozen packets at home. I have a tiny little freezer for someone who cooks for a living, so it is always an issue for me to be able to keep ingredients at home. And although I've seen some reviews complaining about the 15-20 wait for the HV mix to absorb water in the fridge ... really? Those people can't wait half an hour for a burger? If you want an instant veggie burger that can be microwaved in the time it takes you to grab the ketchup, buy a frozen burger. I think this mix will be good in better handmade veggie burgers and I look forward to trying!<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />After eating the lasagna made with the HV mix, both my husband and I experienced horrible stomach bloating and pain. I'm apparently a glutton for punishment, though, because I decided to give it another try and made meatballs with it yesterday. Not only did they not turn out as good as my usual ones (made with MF crumbles and Lightlife sausage), they had a sort of rubbery texture that I really did not care for. But, blander and texture I can overlook, except AGAIN, the product gave us both the same horrible stomach bloating pains and gas. Ugh!

review/text: I have tried almost every kind of "fake meat" product out there. While I really like the Morning Stars and the Boca "ground meat" you can't really make them into anything.<br /><br />This product was great. Soak it for 15 minutes in water, and viola you have a really good ground meat you can make something out of,  The only problem is that it tends to be a little saly for my taste, so be carefull when you are seasoning it.

review/summary: Helps with Fat Smash Diet
review/text: I'm not vegetarian, but I'm on the fat smash diet by Dr. Ian. The 1st few days he suggest going meatless before building a foundation and reintroducing chicken, fish, and then other meats. I made chili with this. It doesn't taste just like meat or anything like that, but the texture is spot on when u mix in a bunch of other things. I'm not sure how it would turn out just on a bun. If I go that route I will have to season very well. Before making the chili I was a little worried so i cooked up all my veggies and seasoning in a separate pot. Browned this "beef" in another pan and added it into the mix later. Cooking this alone it smelled funny, and I was worried it would taste the way it smelled. I'm very sensitive to smell and taste of things. I can taste this in the mix of things but not so much. More than anything I'm busy looking for a taste. One thing I can say is the texture is pretty good for the consistency of meat except its much lighter and thinner less clumpy than real ground beef. If I had to give up beef for the rest of my life and pick this I wouldn't but if cows disappeared off the face of the earth I would be fine with taking this as a substitute.

After years of it being it the 140's or 135's my blood pressure is now like a young person and I am in my sixties.  I had been monitoring my blood pressure at home and it was good but usually when I see the doctor it shoots up because I am nervous but not this time.  My doctor was thrilled.  I totally believe that this tea has lowered my blood pressure and I will continue drinking it.  I steep it for 10 minutes.  I have two cups after breakfast and one cup after dinner.  It tastes good and I don't put any sweetener in it.  I highly recommend it as it did work for me.

review/summary: Hisbiscus Tea and Blood Pressure
review/text: I have been drinking hibiscus tea off and on since 1984.  When I went to Germany in 1984, my mother told me that it is quite popular there for blood pressure issues, so every day while I was there I drank it.  When I came back to the US I found it and drank it for a number of years.<br /><br />About a year ago my husband's blood pressure became elevated because of health problems he is experieincing.  So, I went to the local co-op and got some hibiscus tea.  Ever since he started drinking it his blood pressure has been in the normal range -- well under 120/80.

I also taking it myself, I like all kinds of Tea, Green, Triple Leaf Tea, this one has a very deep purple color and nice Fruity Flavor, I really like it. Hibiscus Tea is the combination of two herbs. Hibiscus is cultivated throughout the tropics, its flowers are highly prized for making Jams, Jellies, sauces and Beverages<br /><br />Lemongrass is a sub-tropical herb known for its strong citrus flavor and aroma. It became a popular edition to Tea blends in the 1970s and was quickly accepted in Europe. By blending these tropical flavours together, they have created a tart and fruity Tea that is Kid friendly and truly wonderful hot or cold. I also like the fact that this Tea does not contain any Caffeine, that usually keeps me up, no problem with Hibiscus Tea. It tastes Great! Thank You

Kudos to Celebration Herbals for delivering the tea one day after the order was placed. I followed instructions on the box and used spring water which was  steeped for approximately ten minutes. Although the primary reason for drinking the tea was medicinal, I also wanted a flavorable tea. Sadly the taste of the tea was unexceptional. Accordingly, the next box of hibiscus tea that I purchase will not be from Celebration Herbals.

review/summary: Awful taste! Don't buy it!!
review/text: I bought this tea cause I had consumed the one from the bottle and I like that one.<br />However in tea bag is not just tasting totally and completely different, but additionally tastes really<br />horrible... believe me, I even tried to give it to my co workers for free after they tried it and they did not accept it.<br />In my opinion It tasted like Serum :s. Now I have 100 tea bags wasting space, probably soon they'll go to the waste bascket.<br /><br />It's sad... I thought it would taste like the bottle or at least close, but totally a disappointment.

review/summary: Great boost!
review/text: I love this stuff!  I sit in front of a computer all day at work, it's easy to get tired, not to mention I've always had trouble sleeping, so I never get a full 7 or 8 hours of sleep, more like an average of 4 or 5 hours per night.  I was surprised at how quickly it boosted me but I certainly didn't feel the shakes or jittery at all.  I felt more awake, and I didn't crash from it later.  It wears off gradually after a few hours but it helps to get through the main part of the day.  I don't use it every day but on occassion when I need a boost.

review/summary: This is their best bar by far
review/text: Santanders 53% semi-sweet dark chocolate bar is by far their best bar in my opinion. The 65% is pretty good also, but it's more smooth and balanced, whereas the 53% is just goodness from start to finish and has a wonderful creamy flavor.<br /><br />I've tried their 53%, 65%, 70% and also their espresso 70% one - the 53% is the best (by a long shot), then the 65% comes in 2nd place. The others are very good too, but don't quite have the amazing overall rich/creamy wonderfulness of the 53% bar.<br /><br />If you are not sure which bar to buy, the 53% bar is an excellent choice. If you like See's candy and/or Godiva, then you'll be right at home with this bar. It's one of the single best dark chocolate bars I have ever had in my life.

review/text: Wolfgang Puck recently changed their Chicken soup. The old stuff is excellent. The new stuff is watered down, not filling and doesn't taste as good. The image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup. The soup I received is the new stuff. Being a food item, returns are not allowed. I feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased.

review/summary: Bland and disappointing..
review/text: I was familiar with a few of Wolfgang's recipes before I tried any of his soups. First I tried a different flavor a year ago, but can't remember anything except it being bland and slimy.  I decided to try it a 30 minutes ago because I was desperate for something healthy and convenient because I was a tad sick and could not make my own unprocessed meal with the ingredients I had home. I bought it for about $3 and hoped I just had a bad can of soup the first time, but this was just awful. No taste, slimy, and hardly any chicken (probably 3-4 tiny pieces). I can see why they added such little chicken. It's just tasteless and dry; tasted nothing like chicken. I'll go try another can of soup that can make me feel a bit better. This sure didn't do it. I have never had soup that tasted bland even after adding salt and seasoning. I see positive reviews that make me thing I had another bad can because I still can't believe it had absolutely no flavor.

review/summary: OK for storm food
review/text: As we all know.....any canned soup, organic or not, should be avoided or at least limited.  It does work for storm supplies due to its easy medium term storage and it being infrequently or never used.  It will end up in a hunting camp for a few days of quick meals toward the end of its shelf life.  Everything tastes better in fresh air and this stuff isn't bad.  Again, its use is very limited.<br /><br />Don't like the BPA issue either.  I did speak to Wolfgang Puck about PBA and their plans.  Like most, they are treading water to see what the government (friends of the fda) does or does not do about it.  What's a little more poison added to the current mix in processed foods.<br /><br />Ever notice that most of the Wolfgang Puck soup ingredients here on Amazon end at "Contains 2% or less of the Following"........?<br /><br />As I indicated above, we did try this soup, and it tasted ok, nothing special.  Try adding a little more sea salt. It is better than the MSG enhanced, preservative laden Campbell's brand crap, a brand we would not buy regardless of circumstance.  One never knows who actually made this soup.<br /><br />We consider the organic versions the lesser of (insert remaining cliche), and have a case......in case.

review/text: In court, as I understand it, you're not supposed to testify about anything where you don't have direct experience.  You can discount this review if you want, since I have only second hand experience with this soup.<br /><br />I gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student (I worry about her starving).  She never mentioned whether she liked the soup, so I asked.  She finally admitted that it was, to quote her, "The worst thing I've ever tasted".  Apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well.  While my friend is rather picky, her boyfriend has a much wider culinary range, so if they both disliked the soup, I'm inclinded to think it's not very good.

review/summary: Top 10 Super Food
review/text: Wow, organic lentils, how great is that! Lentils are one of the planet's top 10 super foods, extremely high in protein and fiber, extremely low on the glycemic index and inflammation scale. This is one food I try to eat everyday. I live in a pretty unsophisticated town in the central valley of California, and you'd think our "high-end" supermarket, Raley's, would carry organic lentils, but of course, they don't, and even if they did, I'd have to pay an arm and leg for them. Amazon is my lifeline for quality organic foods and other products. Incidentally, I don't make the typical lentil soup with these. I simply cook one bag (16 oz.) with about 7.5 cups of non-fluoridated bottled water (fluoride is extremely bad for your thyroid), salt them to taste, and only cook them for 25 minutes. This way, they don't get mushy. They keep their firmness without being too chewy, more like a bean, and then I keep them in the fridge for a week, and have them with a little organic shredded cheese on top. YUMMY!
