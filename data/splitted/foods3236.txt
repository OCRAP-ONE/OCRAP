review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: I admit it, I am a self-proclaimed "seasoning/flavoring/condiment snob." I have come across numerous products that have left me flat in the dust/powder. That being said, this product is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I use it on just about everything! Egg whites, toast, broccoli, for additional cheese factor on mac-n-cheese...use it anywhere where some cheddar cheesy goodness is desired!  Yes it is bright, orange hue that cannot be missed but IT IS cheddar cheese flavoring, NOT cheddar cheese. ;)  That aside, this product is a definite staple in my pantry!

review/summary: This is the Century Theater butter flavor
review/text: I have been looking for this flavor for several years to complete my home theater.  I am very serious in my popcorn and use a professional theater kettle with coconut oil and using Great Northern popcorn at the moment.  I've tried all the usual butter flavor oils; Super Kist II by Odells and Mor Gold by Lou-ana are probably tops in flavor next to this Odells Popcorn Butter.  Most theaters use a variation of Super Kist type of soy flavored like butter oils.  But, if you have ever eaten popcorn at a Century Theater where the little symbol on the bucket says "made with REAL butter" and you always remember that distinct buttery taste but can never replicate it at home, then here it is!  The other butter flavored soy oils just don't have that special real butter taste.  This Odell's Popcorn Butter is EXACTLY that flavor used at Century Theaters.  It reminds me of a clarified butter and has a very light (real butter like) yellow tint, not heavy died yellow like some oils.  If you are unaware of that special flavor of a real butter mixture used in Century Theaters, then you won't understand, and you should buy the Super Kist II and enjoy that flavor, which isn't bad.  It just isn't the same as the Original Popcorn Butter and folks who can recognize the flavor will know on the first bite.  I use both flavors depending on my mood.  I think the soy oils are a bit healthier.  If you are accustomed to using the butter at theaters where you pump your own butter on your popcorn, then you are familiar with the Super Kist oil flavor and this original type would be a waste of money for you.  Century Theaters always control the butter pumping because this Original Popcorn Butter is much more expensive than the regular oil flavored varieties.  I love the flavor of the original and the only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the cost.  I think $17 for three little 10oz tubs is kind of expensive.  Whereas, A gallon of Super Kist is $20.<br /><br />BUt hey I just ordered three more tubs for the holiday season and all the 3D movies :)

review/summary: Closest you can get to movie theater taste, and it's REAL
review/text: I've been on a quest, as many popcorn lovers are, for a topping that tastes like movie theater "butter." I've tried several, including real, clarified butter I've melted myself, but this topping from Odells is the best yet. I ordered the three-pack, and got it today. We popped a batch of Amish baby white in our Whirly-Pop using coconut oil and popcorn salt (the famous yellow kind, name slips my mind), then melted a scant two tablespoons of this concentrated butter to pour over the top. There was no artificial oiliness or orange dye, just a very nice, natural buttery feel and taste. That small amount of topping barely made a dent in the 10-oz tub, yet it was more than enough for an entire large bowl. The two of us ate it clear down to the last kernel - it was that delicious.

review/summary: the real story
review/text: other reviewers are right and wrong!<br /><br />Right the packaging sucks. all 3 of my little tubs came flattened and semi-crushed. Luckily they had a thin plastic seal under the lid or I would have had a slimy mess. Surely you guys could pack this better! Right the product is almost tasteless and looks like old Crisco.<br /><br />Wrong to some about the taste on the corn. I thought it was delicious. It woke up each salty nugget and helped them to slide right down. By itself no taste, in concert with the corn, perfect! Tasted just like theater butter to me. I did get a feeling of major vessels closing down a little with each bite, I was tinged blue and short of breath when I finished. But what do you expect it's fat poured over salty corn, it is supposed to kill you.<br /><br />Anyway I'll be ordering more.... after my bypass :-)

review/text: We have been buying Odell's Popcorn Butter for many years and absolutely love it. We originally tasted it back in the 70's when the Sears stores used to sell popcorn and we would stop by there every day after work to get loads of Odell's Butter on top of the popcorn. I asked Sears where they got their popcorn butter and they told me. We've been buying it ever since. By the way; my husband is a chef and he uses it in his cooking all the time. It is fabulous.

review/summary: HEY- IT'S REAL BUTTER AND GREAT ON STEAKS
review/text: For all you folks who say that it doesn't taste like butter- GET REAL. This is nothing more than clarified real butter. The difference between the two is that melted butter will make the popcorn soggy. O'Dells won't. Yes, it is more expensive than making your own, but the convenience is worth it to me. After I pop my corn in my commercial popper, I can stick a tub in the microwave and pour it over the popcorn-return the tub to the refrigerator (not necessary). I truly believe that quality  popcorn with O'Dell's Popcorn Butter is as good or better than any theater popcorn I've had. If you say it doesn't taste like your melted butter, you are probably comparing it to melted "salted" butter. If you like your "salted butter",  use a very small amount of FLAVOCOL.<br /><br />HOWEVER, My favorite use of O'Dell's is on steaks. I sear my "CHOICE" steaks on the highest heat (3-4 minutes) after coating them only with a nothing more than a little olive oil, kosher salt, and fresh ground pepper. I place a small amount of O'Dell's in the bottom of the plate, then drizzle a small amount of O'Dell's on top of the steak. Cover with tin foil and let it rest for at least 8 minutes (it will absorb the butter). If you like your steak medium to well-done, stick them covered in the oven at 400-500 degrees.I like mine med-rare, so mine don't go in the oven. I would compare my steaks to any of the top steak houses and all my guests agree. Steve

review/summary: EXCELLENT!  The taste that was missing!
review/text: First, let me say that I love my popcorn.  I really love the taste of movie theater popcorn.<br />I have tried a bunch of toppings to get the "taste", but this stuff is the best!<br />Here is what I use:<br />Whirly pop - popper<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SU35">Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a><br />Great Northern pop corn, 8 oz. portion paks:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PDY3P0">Great Northern Popcorn, 8-Ounce Portion Packs (Pack of 24)</a><br />This stuff is great...more pricey than doing it yourself, but worth it, for no hassle.<br /><br />Just the combination above, works fantastic.  I felt it was missing, just that "extra" flavor.<br />I first used topping oil...ok, but not great.<br />Then I tried Whirl buttery flavor cooking oil.  This stuff is good, almost there.<br />Then I bought the Odell's.  Wow! What a difference!  Sure it's expensive, but worth it.  You don't need much.<br />The tubs come in a 3 pak, pretty small, but sealed in the tub, so no leaking.  You don't need to refrigerate it, even after opening.<br />The popcorn is a little more salty with this topping, so keep that in mind in your usage.<br /><br />Good stuff!

review/summary: odell's popcorn butter
review/text: I was a little skeptical when I first saw this product. I wanted some topping that would at least come close to duplicating the sinful buttery taste of theater popcorn or popcorn-shop butter popcorn. Adding this stuff comes close to satisfying my needs. My only complaint is that I have to liquify the butter first--I can't just spray it on or pour it on, but that's just a minor gripe.

review/summary: Do not get this butter for popcorn
review/text: It solidifies after melting.  It is like margarine, you melt it, and pour it on your popcorn, then it re-solidifies.  This is no good, particularly when it tastes like canola oil.  You end up with canola oil solids congealed on the side of your bowl and the few kernels that it happens to land on.  Movie butter is a liquid and you pump it onto your popcorn and you can swish it around a metal bowl to coat evenly.  This was a failure, even if it tasted good which it doesn't.<br /><br />It comes in three tiny containers that are over priced.  I urge you to check out my review of the last butter I used faithfully.

review/text: I have this kit in primary fermentation right now. The directions are wonderfully clear, and the kit includes all ingredients that you need to produce 6 gallons of this wine. These kits are a great value, especially if you order them through the subscribe and save program. If you enjoy the wine, let it send you another in a few months. If you don't like it, cancel the subscription. The minor effort involved is more than worth it for the 15% discount.<br /><br />The kit contains two different packages of juice. The larger is added during primary fermentation. The second is added after fermentation has finished to enhance the flavor of the wine. You also get labels, corks, additives, etc. Just need some basic equipment and 30 empty bottles.<br /><br />I will try and update this review as the wine progresses. Fermentation seems to have started nicely at this point.

review/summary: Absolutely Amazing
review/text: I have made 5 batches of wine so far from the kits here on Amazon and all I can say is this one by far is the most amazing one. I love the fruity wines and this is absolutely delicious.... The directions are extremely clear and easy to follow. The wine cleared up extremely well and I love the labels that are included they are super cute!!! I am placing an order for the pear chardonnay and the raspberry merlot right now to try those as well... Needless to say these kits are 1/2 the price compared to my local winery and are just as great tasting!!!!

review/summary: Great Flavor!
review/text: This kit has everything but bottles and the instructions are easy to follow. Once complete it has a nice sweet flavor. It holds well, I kept a bottle for a few months and recently opened it, the flavor got more defined after it aged a bit. It is good served at room temp or chilled (unlike most Merlots). I have another bottle on reserve for New Years and can't wait to see what it tastes like then. I have never had a White Merlot before but am not a fan of the traditional Merlots, however this has made me want to do some sampling of other brands.

review/summary: WAY too sweet for me...
review/text: The wine showed great potential until it was time to use the strawberry packet.  I only used about half of the strawberry, because I tasted it first and recognized it as a LOT of strawberry syrup (I used the rest to flavor my made-from-scratch watermelon wine, which GREATLY needed the help). Even with using only half, the wine finished WAY to sweet--think of alcoholic strawberry punch, not so much wine.<br /><br />Still, it is a good tasting drink, we will just save it for summer barbecues and the like.  I ended up ordering the White Merlot kit (not the strawberry) for next time.

review/summary: Too Sweet - Instructions were only in French
review/text: I was very hopefully when I purchased this wine kit.  I have make wine from over 20 different wine kits and I was very disappointed in this kit.<br /><br />1.  Received instructions only in French.  Contacted manufacturer and they send me an email with the English instructions.<br /><br />2.  After following the English instructions I found out the Wine created was way too Sweet.  I expect some sweetness but not this.  I cannot consider this wine.  I expect something like Boones Farm Strawberry Wine.  I am considering throwing this away.<br /><br />REVISED. Give some to my neigbor -- He loved it. For me too sweet.

review/text: Hello first of all I if you haven't already seen my star rating for this item, I've rated it 4 stars. And I meant every one of them. However this is just the opinion of one person (myself).<br /><br />When reading reviews something to consider is the fact that we all have different taste buds. While this product may taste great to me, it may taste like garbage to you. That being said here is my critical review of this product.<br /><br />1. Does not taste exactly like chicken, however it is a great chicken alternative that taste somewhat like chicken. It does taste good.<br /><br />2. The consistency is excellent. It's just the right thickness that you can easily cut with a fork.<br /><br />3. Flavor is good by itself, but for those of you who require a little bit more, I suggest using "Seasoning Salt" and some "Black Pepper" or whatever you prefer... Garlic maybe?<br /><br />4. Taste best with rice or noodles.<br /><br />There's my review. Please consider...

This chik'n has been a real hit, both as a meat-substitute item for a main dish (just thicken the gravy a bit), and chopped for turning into casseroles and rice dishes.<br />The prices on these products are excellent compared to buying single hard-to-find cans on a grocery shelf.

review/text: I love vegetarian food and have tried basically everything out there. Although I eat meat when I'm visiting someone, I prefer the taste of veggie/vegan foods. However one should never expect real meat and meat analoges to taste exactly the same for the simple fact that they not the same thing. In my oppinion, Fried Chik and other Loma Linda foods are the best around. They have a large variety of foods for a variety of tastes. It's also worth it to try Worthington, Cedar Lake, Morning Star, Vibrant Life...

review/summary: What Happened to the Flavor?
review/text: I used to buy this all the time & I grew up eating it & a lot of the other Loma Linda/Worthington products. It seems somebody has messed with the recipe for this one, again! It never did taste like real chicken, but it always had a very good flavor for what it is, a meat analog. Unfortunately, this last case I have just received is missing something...The flavor! We have already tried 3 cans of it, thinking that maybe it was just a fluke for one or 2 cans, but apparently it's the "NEWEST" version because each can is the same, tastless! The gravy is a lot thinner too & also missing the flavor! We went through this a couple years ago when the manufacture basically ruined our favorite meat analog, the Loma Linda Redi-Burger! Our last 2 cases of the Redi-Burger was nothing but a mushy, odd tasting mess, nothing like it used to be! It went from being a solid product that you could slide out of the can & slice to a disgusting, Sloppy-Joe consistency that tasted bitter & weird.  Now I guess the manufacture is determined to ruin the Fried Chik'n too! This last case of the Fried Chik'n has about the same texture as it used to have; sort of chewy; but the flavor is totally gone! I suspect the manufacture was trying to reduce the high salt content, but the flavor went out the door too. I don't think we will be buying this one anymore & I'm going to cancel our subscription to it. For the high price these items are, they are so not worth it any more! VERY DISSAPOINTING!!!

review/text: I bought a case of this vegan alternative to fried chicken, then tried cooking it in a variety of styles, methods, and venues--and always it came up short. That is to say it tastes NOTHING like chicken, fried or not. Each of the 5 pieces in a can resembles a flat drumstick, but that's where the similarity with real chicken ends. It tastes more like compressed dough dipped in a beefy gravy, more reminiscent of bland cat food than K.F.C. (not that I ever tried bland cat food). I would recommend passing up this entr&eacute;e and look for something more palatable like...real vegetables!

review/text: Based on the other two reviews I was expecting more of a classic sweet and savory experience.  My experience with these was that the spice overwhelms the sweet, while the salty is almost too faint to notice.  The heat from the chili spice lasts way too long for a product advertising itself as sweet and savory.  These really are more of a spiced nut than sweet and savory.  If you like heat with a trail that lasts for minutes, this is your product.  If you don't, try something else.

review/summary: Okay coffee....
review/text: I believe in promoting fair trade coffee.  I run a farm shop and was giving this away to customers.  I am not sure myself, if the taste was that great though.  It is so hard to choose a coffee without trying it first because the taste, strength vary so much on brands and where they come from.  I would not say this coffee was too strong but obviously stronger than a store bought brand.  I also thought the after taste left my mouth very dry and I am not used to that.  I seem to keep going back to Yuban coffee for myself but for my farm shop, I might try a different type of coffee and see if the taste is a bit better.

review/text: These chips are great! Love the hearty taste. My only complaint is that the photo shows the Sweet Potato Tortilla chips, while the title stated that they are Potato Chips. We did receive the Potato Chips and are enjoying them, I was just a bit disappointed because I was going by what was pictured.

review/text: I am very picky when it comes to Indian food - and I have a lot of choice, being in NYC.  But this stuff is THE BEST.  Natural, very easy to prepare and incredibly delicious.  It beats most of what I've had in restaurants (and even my dishes made from scratch).  Do try this, you won't be disappointed!  I'm going to try some of the other varieties now...

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Lived in England briefly and developed a taste for Indian Food.  This mix is very, very good and very easy to make.  It's not too spicy (the tikka masala version is very spicy!) and for some reason the chicken turns out more tender than with the jarred sauces that I order from a British company.  Yay for being able to find this on Amazon cause I had looked everywhere else and couldn't find it!<br /><br />It looks a little weird when you open the package, it's lumpy and funny colored.  But when you stir it in the water it melts pretty quick.<br /><br />Quick and easy to make, just stir fry some chicken, add the sauce, then in about 10 minutes add cream.  Make a pot of basmati rice and some Naan bread (you can get it at most of the big 'green' grocery stores and you've got an awesome meal.

review/summary: Excellent, Authentic Butter Chicken
review/text: I almost didn't try this because of the negative review.  Then, because I've enjoyed Curry Tree mixes in other varieties, and a local store had single packs of Butter Chicken, I decided to give it a try anyway.<br /><br />I'm glad that I did.  It is excellent, and very authentic.  A friend and co-worker, who is from India, tried some when I had it for lunch one day and said it was better than most Indian restaurant foods in the U.S. and that it reminded him of his mother's cooking.  He was quite surprised it had been made from a mix.  He's from Delhi, where Butter Chicken originated and where Tandoori Chicken reached a high-point after the partition of India and Pakistan, so I guess he knows what he's talking about.<br /><br />This may look similar to Tikka Masala, but it tastes quite different.  Rich and pleasantly spicy but not too hot--I can enjoy it as a fairly mild yet very flavorful dish but a S.O. who blanches at hot food can enjoy it as well with a bit of extra yogurt mixed in hers.  I highly recommend it if you enjoy Indian food.  Butter Chicken is one of the three most popular Indian dishes in the U.K. and the U.S., and this spice mix from Curry Tree allows you to quickly prepare it at home.<br /><br />I'm glad to see it on Amazon because it is hit or miss finding it when I'm travelling--and the price on Amazon is better than what it usually sells for by the single pack when I do find it.

review/text: But you might like it. I spent 1968 in India and do not remember having anything called Butter Chicken (but all my British friends are familiar with it and like it). But the flavor profile was immediately familiar. If you don't want a curry or spicey dish, then this may be for you. I prefer the Tandoori and also the Tiki Masala. Probably just a matter of taste. These are all excellent products.

review/summary: Hot at first,but..
review/text: I used the Las Palmas mild enchilada sauce because neither my wife or I are big fans of extremely hot dishes. People often mistake hot and spicey. Spicey doesnt mean it has to be so hot you can't enjoy the flavor of the food. Now, after making my cheese enchiladas I have to say that the Las Palmas mild sauce was exceptionally hot. I mean really hot. If you want a comparizon it's like comparing Taco Bell mild sauce to Taco Bell hot sauce. I was really surprised and like the others, felt like just tossing the meal in the trash. But, I hate to be wasteful so I just figured I would keep them and eat them for my lunch during the week. to my surprise, the next day I heated some up for lunch in the microwave. They were still hot, hotter than what I would deem a mild sauce to be. However, the amount of heat had surprisngly subsided somewaht to a tolerable level.  The flavor of the sauce is not "up there" in my list of favorites. It's okay, just not really exceptional. I'll keep looking for my all time favorite sauce recipe.

review/summary: This tea MESSED me up
review/text: I started drinking this tea 7 months ago and I would drink it every night. During that time my anxiety sky rocketed and depression set it in. I did not even question the tea for this because it kept me regular and my weight balanced, I instead blamed my anxiety on stress. One day last week I was sitting with my mom and she asked about the tea and the ingredients which I never really looked at, I then looked up the plants and herbs used in the tea and they had side effects for anxiety attacks, depression, moodiness. I found the culprit! I immediately stopped drinking the tea and JUST THE NEXT day my anxiety was gone.<br /><br />This tea was literally making me go insane and I realize now I'd rather do it the natural way and that my mental mind and happiness is definitely better than some slimming tea. Gym and keeping a balanced diet is the way to go! Anxiety and depression is not worth it at all.<br /><br />I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TEA!

review/text: I'm giving this tea, 3 stars, because it doesn't work for weight loss on eveyone, I don't have much weight to loss, but it's always nice to know that you could drop 5 lbs, if you do what you should, but it may work for someone as part of you weight loss plan. Good luck!!!!!!!<br />I've been taking this tea for a 4 days, it really works. It doesn't have a bad taste at all. If your system is sensitive to any kind of laxatives, make sure for the first wk, you're able to get to a bathroom; after that your body will get use to it. Your system will get into a daily routine. The instructions say that it helps w/weight loss, if you eat healthy food and to exercise. I don't know that it works for weight loss, I've not lost any weight, even though I only eat organic food and exercise. If I noticed any weight loss later on, I'll re-write my review. IT WORKS FOR CONSTIPATION :)

review/summary: Ultra Slim Tea
review/text: I started drinking this tea about a month ago. I had tried others and have to admit this is the best one for me. It is not harsh on you. I started out with one tea bag to see how it worked. It was okay, but I find if I drink it for lunch and then for dinner, it works best. You have to find out what is most effective for yourself.<br /><br />Other tea bags used to make me urinate like crazy at night this one doesn't do that. So I am happy and sold to this product.<br /><br />Also I have lost a few pounds with it too. I have been on a diet and it has been a slow process for me. I wouldn't rely completely on it to loose weight, but it can help you out. It has a program with it, but I am going to what I have been doing which is just eating less and more sensibly and that seems to work too.

review/summary: Best Dog Food for a small dog
review/text: My dog is over 14 years old, and has been on a prescription diet for years.  After she eats, her belly has always been bloated and she has acted uncomfortable.  She's had issues with diarrhea, so I finally decided to fore go my vet's opinion and try her on a high quality dog food.  I looked for something that had the lowest phosphorus level along with being easy on the digestive system.  My dog loves it!  She is excited about eating again, and she seems to be feeling more comfortable after she eats.  I don't know if she has a long time left to share with me, but at least I know she is enjoying the most important parts of her day.  Right now, I am mixing it with her prescription food at a ratio of 3 parts prescription kibble to one part Grandma Lucy's.  So far, I am really pleased with the results!

review/summary: Sophie Girl actually runs to it!
review/text: My beagle has so many allergies i have spent hundreds yes hundreds of dollars on all diff foods canned dry organic raw etc there was always some kind of problem. Then in my research i read about this and i was skeptical because never heard of it and how sophie would like a consistancy of oatmeal. As i was getting it together and poured the water in i was like hmmmm looks like another waste of money well soon as i started mixing it she smelled it from the other room?? it does have a good aroma def nothing like you ever saw/or served your pet for sure lol.....it smells like something you would be making for your family def NOT dog food! well she came running up actually clawing on my leg and stretching her neck trying so hard to get to it!!! im thinking yeh sophie smells good but the consistency.....well i hesitantly put it down and DANG if she didnt devour it like you gave her filet mignon!!! when she finished it ..in like a minute....she actually lol...picked up the bowl in her mouth....carried it into the dining room and continued to lick the bowl till there was a hole in it!! lol i could not believe it!!!<br />however i have to tell you how i served it..... theres TONS more of thepowder then there is the dehydrated chicken! i was disappointed with that part. so i took out ALL the chicken keep in a seperate contaner and each time i make up a serving i take out some of the chicken (when you get the bag all the chicken is laying on the top of the bag theres no way you could get equal amounts of chicken in each serving unless doing as i did. the chunks are also large. and very dry i soak them in warm water while im putting the the other ingrediants in her bowl. I know this is soundingvery involved...but truly its not yes more to do then opeing a can full of processed yak but just like you do your best to fix your family dinner your companion should get the same time and energy i believe (because they r your forever friend love you UNCONDITIONALLY) more then you can say with some humans lol well since my sophie is a gulper and would just swallow the chicken and not chew it if i mixed it in the veggies so "I" cuz im a nut.....after shes done with the veggies i pull the chunks apart and hand give her piece by piece cuz like i said she gulps!! and.... i love it cause im feeding her and we re bonding.... lol yup shes my life saver for real and i owe her all i got!! i feel great i am giving her totally all fresh food no fillers NO MEAT BY PRODUCTS (didnt you ever google meat by products? have a barf bag ready to use after reading!!....theres no wheat soy corn no grains to be allergic too. all pluses in my book!<br />I choose the artisen one the other one has sweet potato in it and shes allergic to that. it makes tons of food too. my only con is i wish there was more chicken. but i give her a few times a day very healthy treats thats all chicken also from grandma lucys. so she is getting her protein. sorry this was so long.... but i totally love this.....and i think you and your companion will too!

review/summary: Makes him eat
review/text: We'd been having trouble getting our greyhound to eat in the mornings.  At night, he was fine eating his presented kibble, but couldn't eat more than 2 cups at dinner, so he quickly started to lose weight from skipping breakfast.  He is exercised regularly, not given many treats, and is otherwise healthy; we concluded that he associated eating in the morning with me leaving, as he has recently been improving/able to cope with ongoing separation anxiety.  So, while he can now tolerate me being gone and can remain at home calmly and quietly without hurting himself or the house, it still would make him lose his appetite at the thought of me leaving since it was part of the routine.<br /><br />We bought this food to give it a try and see if it would help him eat more and keep weight on and generally be happier.  Wet food (of the high quality stuff) didn't help too much because he could pick out the pieces around the kibble.  I wanted a mix that I could mix with his kibble that he'd adore.  Well, that's exactly what Grandma Lucy's is!  From day one, he's loved and looked forward to breakfast time.  At night, he still only gets kibble soaked in water, but eating at night was never an issue with him since I'm always around.  Grandma Lucy's is an excellent product.  I'll admit, it doesn't really look to appetizing to me, but there's no denying that my dog adores it.  As I mentioned, I don't use it as a sole diet; I mix 1/2 a cup (pre-water) with his kibble and it makes a mushy slop, but he gobbles up every last drop.  Even after having a fair amount of it, he had normal stool after the first day; this is not typical for him, as it normally takes his system a week or so (even with gradual food introductions) for him to not get stomach upset.<br /><br />Grandma Lucy's is the best deal I've seen for dehydrated foods, especially if you buy 10lbs at once (I've seen it for $65 on here) which would make it a little over a dollar a pound. For the way I use the food, this works well for me.  Not sure what it does for their teeth, being so mushy, but I brush my dog's teeth daily so this was not a concern for me.  Great product; I'm sure your dog will love it!

review/text: saw it on the food network and wanted to try it.  It does taste good, basically like hersey's syrup or quik to make chocolate milk but coffee flavored.  sure it would go well on vanilla ice cream too.  pricey, but since you can't really get it from anywhere else, nice thing to get once in a while.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: It is a shame that I can only purchase this item on line. The stores in Miami, Florida does not sell it. My husband was born in Rhode Island and remembers it from his child hood days. Besides it being good in milk it is excellent over ice cream. It would make a good adult coffee syrup for over ice cream or in a milk shake.

review/summary: Can't get coffee milk in Florida
review/text: I used to have coffee syrup back home in Boston. Thank goodness you can buy foods on Amazon so I got some Autocrat. A little swallow told me it is the best. Its the best because nobody else makes coffee syrup. I want to try it on Vanilla Ice cream sometime.

review/text: I was very hopeful based on the other reviews.  Alas, I found that it didn't taste very much like coffee at all.

review/text: Coffee milk was a childhood favorite of mine.  I knew we could only get in in Rhode Island then, but God bless the internet.  My son is now a huge fan and I get to share my childhood memories of this stuff with him.

review/text: ...I didn't realize it was such a small bottle... The same size bottle costs $2.99 in Rhode Island (where we're from). My boyfriend laughed at me when he heard I paid $10 for such a small bottle of Coffee Syrup. :-/

review/summary: Red dye in cat food ruins carpeting - don't buy
review/text: Made the big mistake of buying Meow-Mix.<br /><br />Cat vomited (as all cats sometimes due) after eating Meow-Mix. Unfortunately the cat vomited on carpet. Usually unfortunate but no big deal - just clean it up. WRONG! Meow-Mix has red food dyes that will not come out - even if you start cleaning right after the event. We have tried three different cleaners and a carpet machine. We still have two big red/pink stains in the carpet.<br /><br />I called the MeowMix customer service number and asked for some help on how to clean their red dye out of the carpeting. They told me to use a carpet cleaner - Really? Wow. Insightful.<br /><br />I asked them why they put in apparently un-cleanable red dye in the cat food when they know cats are virtually color blind (for reds apparently) and when the cat pukes it is going to ruin their customers carpet. They said market research indicated the human buyers prefer to see a red, meaty, color and their was nothing they could do about it.<br /><br />Yeah, how about not putting the red dye in or using another red dye?<br /><br />Through almost and entire 25lb bag of MeowMix out in the trash and purchased Iams which is no issue to clean up.<br /><br />Thanks for reading. Don't buy MeowMix unless you live outdoors .

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: Sencha Kyoto Cherry Rose - Sept 2011
review/text: This is a delightfully light and flowery tea product.The amazing thing about this tea is that it did not have that bitter after taste most herbal teas seem to have. I looked around at some of the Tea Houses popping up around town and there version had that bitter after taste. I was glad this one did not. I am not an avid Tea drinker nevertheless this tea comes with a high recommendation for those of you trying to get Green Tea into your diet.
