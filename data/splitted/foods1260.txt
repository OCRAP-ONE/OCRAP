review/summary: My highly-rated vet uses these treats in her office
review/text: I found these treats via my vet's office (it is a very highly rated vet in Tampa, FL).  They keep a jar of them in each exam room as treats to give the pups during or after shots and exams, etc.  My 6-month old Pomeranian reacted in a much more exciting manner than with any treats I had at home, so I found out what they were and went hunting for them on Amazon for a better price.<br /><br />The treats are in the shape of a 1-inch square shape and are semi-soft and kind of thick, so I tend to break off a piece here and there as a treat for my little guy.  An entire square means he's been VERY good.  These things smell AMAZING, just like beef jerky I'd eat.  The smell is strong enough where you will attract any dog who is within a few feet of you.  You will also want to wash your hands after handling the treats... the yummy smell will stay on you.<br /><br />Lamb is just YUM! My pup gets bored of beef and chicken products... probably because his food is beef, and lots of his other treats or toys are beef or chicken flavored.  Something different like this lamb flavor really makes it a special treat.<br /><br />The best part about these are that they are made with real lamb & are healthy for your dog. I don't feel guilty giving him these.  They are all natural, holistic and do not contain any chemical preservatives.  "Solid Gold is an industry leader in the use of revolutionary foil "barrier" packaging for all our food products, which means we don't have to use chemical preservatives or flavor enhancers. Barrier packaging keeps food fresher longer, maintains palatability, and helps to sustain the potency of valuable vitamins and other nutrients, which may deplete over time with conventional paper bags."  ---- The packaging is terrific and these do not dry out like some of my other resealable packaged dog treats.<br /><br />Some additional info from the package:<br />Protein, Min. 12%<br />Fat, Min. 5%<br />Fiber, Max. 3.5%<br />Moisture, Max. 30%<br />Carbohydrates N/A from Manufacturer<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Lamb, Brown Rice, Oats, Lamb Meal, Tapioca Starch, Lamb Liver, Brown Sugar, Glycerine, Molasses, Salt, Garlic Powder, Natural Smoke Flavor, Phosphoric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Mixed Tocopherols, Cinnamon, Rosemary

review/text: I get these for my shepherd mix & boston terrier.<br />They fit in the kong goodie bone (with the star shaped slots). You have to squeeze the end of the bone a bit & the treat slides in (nice tight fit).

review/text: I absolutely love this coconut Sap sugar!  It has such a low glycemic index compared to other 'natural' sweeteners.  I use it for making desserts, and when you mix it with other extremely healthy coconut products, the pleasure of indulging your sweet tooth while doing something good for your body, is heard to beat.  For the price, I think it is a very good quality product.  I bought some coconut sugar at Whole Foods before I found this on Amazon.com, and the WF product was more expensive, and less volume.

review/summary: Best dog food Ive used
review/text: My Irish Setter was always a difficult eater. He also had repeating issues with diarhhea and vomiting. He started on Inova, then we switched to Science Diet. The vet thought he might have food allergies and recommended this food. After 2 months there have been no issues with his stomach at all, and for the first time in his life he actually has an appetite. Also his coat is much better. This is great dog food.

review/summary: Healthy and good for food allergies.
review/text: I've had a lot of dogs over my lifetime. For the first time though, my lab has a number of food allergies. She had a really bad ear infection that was so bad she needed surgery twice. The vet recommended a Science Diet dog food that was just way out of my price range. Besides, I've heard that Science Diet really isn't always best, as they want you to believe. In fact, vets get a percentage of the payments you make if you buy that food.<br /><br />I'm a human nurse and it reminds me of Tylenol. Their tag line used to be "what hospitals use most". Yeah, that's because they sold it to the hospitals for cheap, so of course they'd use it! Just keep that in mind.<br /><br />Going back further, my vet in Alaska was the one who told me to try Natural Choice when it first came out. That was before the allergy thing. The vet said that this food was more digestible and so left less waste. Also, it didn't smell nearly as bad. I switched and that's been about 15 years ago now, I think. I had two dogs back then (one small and one really big) that have since passed away, and I now have a (nearly) 5-year-old lab/GSD mix (all of mine are rescues/adopted). I recommended it to all my friends and most switched over and those that did, loved it to.<br /><br />My girl now though developed an ear infection in 2011. The vet we have now (in Alabama) believed it was food allergy related. So! We switched to this particular food, the venison and potato. Knock on wood, she hasn't had another ear infection again, which is good news because the cost for her two surgeries plus treatment was at such a great expense that I do not wish to repeat it. On the other hand, it (naturally) doesn't deter her environmental allergies. In fact, right now she has a hot spot from summer environmental allergies. Poor thing. :(<br /><br />All in all, I trust the brand and I trust this particular food as well.<br /><br />Now, one more thing I want you to know. I buy the big bags, like this one. When I open a bag, I put it in a large airtight container. There was one time that we opened a bag and all was well, but then after a few days it started to smell very badly. I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to my girl, so I threw it out. Granted, she had already eaten it for those few days and didn't have a problem, it just still bothered me and I had to get rid of it. I bought another bag and it didn't have a problem. I've not had another bad bag since.<br /><br />I never reported it because it never happened again. I only mention it here because if it has a strong bad odor (let's face it, dog food doesn't smell good to begin with, so the keyword here is STRONG), there is something not right. It should NOT have a strong smell. That's the ONLY bag I've gotten that had a problem in fifteen years, so that I think, speaks for itself.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago I got a bad can of Campbell's soup. It's a rarity, but does happen.<br /><br />All in all, I give it the five stars I feel it deserves.

review/summary: Convenient soup; also for seasoning whole grains
review/text: This soup is convenient to have on hand, and it's reasonably good.  I probably should have tested it first by buying one locally, but I was already a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5A04">Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix, 19-Ounce Units (Pack of 2)</a>, so assumed I'd love this one as well.<br /><br />It will probably be excellent in the traditional onion dip.<br /><br />We tried it so far using it as flavoring when making <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJNAXI">RiceSelect Couscous Variety Pack, 4-Container Set</a>, and we probably used too much for the amount of couscous we cooked -- it had a slightly off taste (we tried a whole package's worth to one cup of couscous, and add an extra cup of hot water, just as we do with the vegetable soup which is delicious that way -- with this one, we'll try half a package worth's the next time or will double the amount of couscous).  We will also end up trying it in flavoring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJRGQU">RiceSelect Whole Grain Lover's Sampler, Rice and Couscous Variety Pack, 4-Jar Set</a>.<br /><br />We also tried it just as a plain onion soup, following package directions and adding a ton of freshly grated Parmesan, and it first it seemed surprisingly bland, with again just a touch of an off note.  But when we added a large dose of freshly ground black pepper and just a few drops of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004M0XA6">TABASCO brand Garlic Pepper Sauce 5oz.</a>, it suddenly became wonderful -- no off taste at all, just vibrant and delightful.<br /><br />Given the season ahead for hearty dishes and wonderful soups, we will probably end up reordering, as long as we keep enough peppercorns and Garlic Tabasco on hand and remember to cut the amounts used in flavoring whole grains!  :)

The person I am getting these for will not eat anything out of marked date. Looking at the reviews I see I am not the first to report receiving old candy from them. One of the Cadbury Dairy Milk Mint Crisp had its wrapper mostly off and the foil was broken.<br />The company did agree to refund the Curlywurlys but not the Crunchies or Dairy Milk so poor customer service as well as poor inventory control. I would not purchase from them again.

review/text: Keebler Graham Crackers are without doubt the BEST graham crackers available. Some store brands are tasteless or even unpleasant, the most recognized national brand is okay, but Keebler makes an absolutely delicious graham cracker. Why the stores around me in Houston stopped carrying them is a mystery and very frustrating. While the Keebler website indicated Fiesta Grocery stores carry them, the only stores in Houston that carried them were not the two near me but only ones that were along drive away - on the outskirts. Thanks to Amazon, a couple of clicks and a short wait and now I have a stash that will last quite a while. Keebler Grahams are great alone, great with peanut butter for added protein, and make superior crumbs for baking. Thank you, Amazon, for making my favorite grahams available so conveniently.

review/text: I needed to go Gluten Free recently and have found this product really made it much more enjoyable. Buckwheat is not a grain or cereal.It is a flower seed and has a lot of health benefits in addition to its great taste. So many flours like rice and tapioca are like baby powder and a lend a strange crumbly texture to baked goods. Adding this to the mix yielded dense moist flavorful breads, pancakes, waffles, muffins, cookies...<br /><br />I also purchased Bob's Redmill Creamy Buckwheat "Cereal" and the Raw Buckwheat Groats. While I have not yet found a good way to prepare the Groats, I can also highly Recommend stone ground Buckwheat cereal.

But i think all grains should be avoided and you can use carrot waste and celery waste from your juicer to make bread, that way you are recycling and it tastes just like bread. So i say if you dont mind eating alot of dehydrated bread, then get this. IF you want 100% optimum health, then i would not buy this as you should avoid grains and dry food. The only bread i will make after i run out of this buckwheat is banana/walnut bread(tastes just like banana bread) or breads made from juicing pulp trash-celery, carrot, mixed with herbs and flax or chia seeds or both. thats the great thing about dehydrated raw bread...you can pretty much use anything in any ratio-whole flax only, or 50/50  with carrot pulp, or ony chia seeds, or a combo of many things- so pretty much, the world is your oyster. conclusion....this product is not needed if your goal is to have good health and make dehydrated bread...but it works great and tastes good in bread. order a small backage to see if you like it before getting alot.

review/summary: The only food I will feed my dogs!
review/text: I have two senior dogs that were on a raw natural food diet for many years.  I had been hard pressed to find something that would fulfill my pets nutritional requirements while being comprised of healthy ingredients.  This is it!  Even my vet, a fierce advocate for raw food, approves of this.  My dogs love it, I no longer have to mix my own ingredients together, and I have peace of mind knowing my beloved pets are being fed high-quality food.  They devour every last particle!

review/summary: My Yorkie Likes It, So I Like It
review/text: My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: This is the ONLY food my dog will eat
review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/summary: Great for hiding medication.
review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

review/text: I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

Wish I had tried Wellness foods before but better late than never.

review/summary: Good value and fast shipping
review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

It's a great deal buying from amazon compared to buying it at a pet store.<br /><br />The only down side is this food does dry up after leaving it out for 5-10 minutes.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/summary: Super Tasty Hot Sauce
review/text: The label on  Frank's Hot Sauce says "The Perfect Blend of Flavor and Heat" and I must say this is an accurate description of the product.<br /><br />Frank's Hot Sauce is outstanding.  It's a Cheyenne Pepper based hot sauce that is not too hot, not too sweet, but has just a perfect blend of "flavor and heat."  It's not like Tobasco sauce which is very hot and you sprinkle on items.  It's a different kind of sauce (I love Tobasco).  Frank's is a hot sauce you can use more liberally to your liking because, while it's hot, it's not so hot you can't really dig into it and enjoy the rich flavor and spices.<br /><br />I like to use this sauce to dip chicken tenders in, but you can also use it too cook buffalo wings, put it on eggs, French fries, burgers, whatever you like.<br /><br />I highly recommend this hot sauce.

review/summary: LOVE Frank's RedHot!
review/text: I used to be hooked on Tabasco, but when the whole "Buffalo Wing" craze started, I HAD to know what that sauce was... !!  And, when I found out it was Frank's RedHot mixed with a little butter, I was in HEAVEN!  I make hot wings at home for hubby and me (with a side of celery and homemade bleu cheese dressing!) every couple of weeks and always have a bottle of Frank's in the pantry.<br /><br />But, when I read about Frank's RedHot Sauce in Cook's Illustrated magazine about 5  years ago (I've been a subscriber since the magazine's inception) I decided that it needed to see more use than just hot wings.<br />Cook's tested it against other hot sauces, one of which was Tabasco, and Frank's came out #1 (To quote CI: "Tasters liked Frank's "bright" and "tangy" notes and potent heat when sprinkled atop a portion of steamed white rice. The full, tomatoey complexity and "luxurious" body of Frank's was also a high point for many tasters. One taster put it succinctly: "Tabasco is an ingredient, while Frank's is a condiment."") and Tabasco came in last... "Tasters said the searing heat masked any other flavor in the sauce, and most found the thin, watery body to be unappealing. "Bitter, like pepper skin," said one taster. Our recommendation is to use Tabasco for its heat, and that's all."<br /><br />The CI review opened my eyes!  I couldn't agree more and now I use Frank's in place of Tabasco with great success!  We love our food spicy, so now it's Frank's and Sriracha (which is a little more garlic-y and a little sweeter)... and maybe some Tabasco added if I want a little MORE heat!

review/text: For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Frank's Redhot Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others and has become a favorite.  It is the hot sauce that I always have around as a basic staple.  It is not too mild and not too hot and has an exceptional flavor.  I especially like using this sauce with pizza, hamburgers, and rice. This is a recommendable hot sauce.

review/summary: A Diluted (mild) Hot Sauce with a heavy dose of vinegar. There are better options
review/text: Franks is a diluted/mild hot sauce containing cayenne pepper along with a fairly heavy dose of vinegar. If you are just looking for a hot sauce that can be liberally applied then Franks might hit the mark, assuming you like this much vinegar.  The diluted nature of Franks makes it quite forgiving.<br /><br />However, you could purchase a small bottle of Tabasco (5 oz) and dilute it and achieve the same results. Better yet - buy a "small" bottle (17 oz is their smallest size) of Huy Fong Sriracha Chili Sauce ($6.00) and add a lot of water and you'll have a diluted hot sauce that tastes much better, at a fraction of the cost of Franks.<br /><br />While the name hardly rolls of the tongue - Huy Fong Sriracha Chili Sauce - is better than Tabasco or Franks! You can make gallons of diluted hot sauce for a fraction of the price that Franks charges and it will taste far better too.<br /><br />If you are the least bit curious then I suggest you try something else. You might be pleasantly surprised. Obviously, no reviewer can encompass the myriad of tastes that Amazon customers have. What a reviewer can do is suggest alternatives that might appeal to others.<br /><br />Try one of these:<br /><br />a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic.  Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section!<br /><br />b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section<br /><br />c) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.<br /><br />d) Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce - a well know national brand. The Chipotle pepper is smoked and has a unique flavor. Commonly available but the taste of this smoked pepper is not for everyone.<br /><br />e) El Yacateco Green<br /><br />A good hot sauce might begin with Franks but it hardly ends there. I'd give Franks 2 stars, Tabasco 2 stars and the others listed 4 or 5 stars.<br /><br />I can't encourage you enough to experiment and enjoy the process!!!!<br /><br />PS: There are a number of people who have settled on a single product (such as Franks) and hate the fact that anyone might suggest an alternative. These customers view any Amazon review that contradicts their beliefs as threatening and down rate it accordingly. That is unfortunate.

review/text: Having been born and raised in south Texas with most of my family from south Louisiana, I grew up in the company of hot sauces.  Now, in my fifties, I tend to use them as my family has for generations: as an accompaniment for different dishes, as well as a mixer in certain other recipes.<br /><br />I didn't discover Frank's until around 25 years ago, as it doesn't come from the South.  However, I fell in love with it on first taste, and it has been in my kitchens ever since.  The unique ingredient that Frank's has is its infusion of garlic.  Not strong, but there.  The motto that this sauce adds flavor and not just heat is quite accurate.  I like spice in and on foods, but my measure for hot sauces is whether I can put some in a spoon and taste it without having to rush for a glass of cold milk.  Frank's passes this test; in fact, I've been known to take a nip when I'm just wanting a taste in my mouth!  It seems to be much better distributed in this part of the world than when it was done by Durkee's.  Hard to say whether it's my favorite, as they are all different.  I don't buy the tiny bottle or the huge one; the in-between is the right size for mine.  Just great stuff, and not overpriced like some others.

review/summary: The only hot sauce I've tried that makes you want to vomit
review/text: Frank's hot sauce is the worst hot sauce I've ever had, and I like virtually everything spicy.  I agree with the other 1 star review, that not everybody will like this stuff.  The flavor is very bitter and strong, with a very bad after taste.  It doesn't add that salty/pepper kick that you want.  I find Louisana Crystal or Pepper sauce better for that.  Frank's made the food a lot worse in my opinion.

review/summary: The real stuff!
review/text: If you are looking for a real salami this is the product you want to buy. Having traveled and worked in Italy, I can say this salami is as good as its get, considering it is crafted in the US! We are from Switzerland, living in the US for the last 10 years and often brought back Salami from Italy when we were in Europe (well, we know how the guys at the border control would respond to our treasures...). So I was very pleased to find a "legal" source in the US to buy a GOOD salami. But on the other hand, you need to have the taste-buts for this kind of sausage! Enjoy!

review/summary: Top Notch Dry Sausage
review/text: WOW, WOW, WOW, this is the Best Dry Sausage/Salami I have ever had in my Life!!  This is the BEST, and I have tried them from throughout the whole of Europe!!  I have traveled all over the world and have tasted these from Peru to Italy and you can feel very confident with buying this product. I am a collector and connoisseur of Fine Dry Cured Sausages.  This is one of the absolute best I have ever tasted, and is a "must try" for any Dry Cured Sausage enthusiast.  I will be purchasing these amazing cured meats, for as long as they sell them...

review/summary: American-made rival for European salamis
review/text: This salami matches and exceeds any that I've had from artisan salami makers at street markets anywhere in France. The salami is tender and meaty. That it comes from humanely-raised pigs was a critical factor for me. It also is a relief that the maker has skipped the filler, sticking to meat and flavoring. The source told me when I inquired about estimated shipping that they had turned back an earlier batch for quality reasons. The salami that they shipped was worth the wait. I'm overjoyed that I don't have to buy a plane ticket to Europe to get a product like this.

review/text: Great salami. If you like Oscar Mayer -- stay away. If you like really, really dry, authentic salami, give Fra Mani a go. Make the slices really thin, which is easy since the salami is so dry. :-) (I just wish they made a spicy dry salami!)

review/summary: Tried to impress my boyfriend with this California treat
review/text: my boyfriend is from California and complains that he can not get Italian Dry Salami in Wisconsin.  So as a surprise I ordered him this salami.  (the customer service, was remarkable)  When the salami arrived it was still very moist, so we hung out to dry.  About a week later my boyfriend - eyes aglow - cut it open and was extremely disappointed at how much more fat there was in this salami than the ones he remembers or the ones his brother occasionally sends him.<br /><br />he ate the salami.  but he said it was, eh, nondescript.  About two weeks later his brother sent him dry salami, and he cut it open for me to see.  The salami should be dry right away when you get it, and he was right there seemed to be a lot less fat in the second salami - and it had a lot less greasy taste.

review/summary: It has a very strong, bad smell.
review/text: In short, it stinks. It's coated with mold on the outside of the casing which may be the cause of the smell. It's chewier, and less salty than American styled salami, which is good. It tasted okay, good even. Not $16.99 good though. Eating pork in any form is an event for me, but I was curious based on the reviews. Curiosity is satisfied, I would not order it again.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

review/summary: Even though I couldn't enjoy them, others did
review/text: I bought these cookies thinking that they were certified kosher (there are other Keebler products that are). I love sugar wafers, so I ordered them. When I received them, I checked the package and there was no kosher certification on it. i figured that I would just return it, but Amazon said it would only give me half my money back because of the reason that I wanted to return it.<br />I knew that there would be a reason that all this happened. I live in a nursing home and I was on my last day of physical therapy. I decided to treat the therapy department to a special treat. When they saw the cookies, they were so excited and so grateful for the gift. They loved the cookies, and it made me so happy, and it all worked out at the end.
