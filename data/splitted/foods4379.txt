review/summary: Celestial India spice chai tea k-cups
review/text: I brew this in a keurig 60 model, i like this tea, its good any time of the year. It is on the spicy side and will leave your pallet with a spicy after taste. But oh so good late at night. Good tea for every once in a while, i could not drink this every day as is a little on the strong side.

review/summary: My favorite tea!
review/text: This tea is the reason why I bought a Keurig. It's my absolute favorite. I make a cup each morning to take with me to work (anyone who works a 9-5 needs a pick me up!). I usually re-order two boxes every couple of months, and my package always arrives quickly. I'll be buying these k-cups as long as they're available!

review/summary: Very weak taste.....
review/text: I have purchased the Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea tea bags in the grocery store, and was impressed with the flavor. So when I saw they had them in the K-cups, I immediately jumped on them and ordered a box. I was so disappointed in it. It tastes nothing like their regular tea bag version. Weak is a word I would use. And I'm not sure what kind of spices they put it in, but it's nothing like any other chai tea I've had. I do not recommend this brand. If you're a regular chai drinker, you will notice the difference and likely be disappointed.

review/summary: Potent!
review/text: This stuff is surprisingly strong and potent. I've always had a problem with chai tea bags because they brew such a dilute cup of tea. But with the Celestial Seasonings Keurig chai, the tea is dark and opaque. I got a huge buzz off of the caffeine. Best of all, it's pure tea and spices, unlike the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte, which is full of artificial ingredients.

review/summary: Couldn't even finish one cup
review/text: I'm an avid chai drinker--many different varieties of both lattes and straight black tea.  We purchased this product because we noticed that the Cafe Escapes chai lattes--a sweeter, creamier blend--did not actually have much black tea in it, and we still wanted our morning caffeine.  Neither my husband nor I could finish one mug of this stuff, and we will end up getting rid of the box.  It was that awful. There was none of the subtle spice blending--just a watery slightly clove-tasting flavor undercut by a bitterness that almost had hints of coffee. Adding a little milk, as we usually do, didn't help at all.  If you enjoy chai, I'd recommend Bigalow or Tazo and skip this one.

review/text: I stumbled upon Celestial Seasonings Green Tea k-cups at my workplace, and since have fallen in love.  For a nice, quick cup of green tea, I haven't found any better solution.  I have fancier or more old fashioned tea brewing methods that I use when I have more time, but I default to this green tea when I need a quick fix.<br /><br />Now about the tea specifically - I have tried other green tea k-cups (competing brands), and none have been as clean-tasting and crisp as Celestial Seasonings.  I will continue to purchase this brand for my green tea needs.

Most of the k-cup assorted coffee produces light, watery coffee at 7.25 oz., but this green tea has  good color and taste even at the max. 9.25 oz.  I would recommend this green tea k-cup.

review/text: I enjoy chai tea very much and my partner drinks only tea, no coffee. So when we purchased our Keurig, we wanted to try several varieties of chai to find the perfect one. I shopped on amazon and bought several types with  reviews, cost, recognizable brand and speed of shipping being accounting factors ( in that order).<br /><br />Pros: Quick delivery<br />  The description is accurate and you get exactly what is advertised<br />  Known brand<br />  Fresh<br />  The price is moderate<br /><br />Cons: I mention price here again because it is cheaper in other forms ( tea bags)<br /><br />I prefer a non milk based Chai and so this was the ideal for me. I added sugar some days and drank it plain others and both were satsifying. My partner and I both enjoyed it above all the other flavors and I will reccomend and share with friends and family. I will continue to shop and attempt to find a better price, but would pay this again because it is worth it.

review/text: I tried this because I can't seem to find the Gloria Jean Serenity Tea which I liked very much.  The Celestial Seasonings was very very bland.  I even tried it on the smallest cup, and it made no difference.  There is no authentic flavor here.  I was brought up drinking green tea.  I especially like the Yama Moto brand green tea, but wanted something quick and easy in a k-cup. I like the Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice so I thought I would try the green tea.  I realize that coffee and tea are a personal preference.  For me, this green tea missed the mark completely.

I had a rebate deal that sent me 2 boxes of the Celestial Seasoning tea K-Cups and I've been hooked ever since!<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings is much smoother than the Bigelow.  I hadn't realized how bitter the Bigelow was, I can't drink it any longer!!  I'm a purest when it comes to my black tea, I don't like too many other flavors superseding the tea.<br /><br />I wish I could get this in tea bags too (to carry in my purse when at restaurants, at friends houses and what not)!<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast is just an super-enjoyable cup of tea!

review/summary: Wonderful hot or cold!
review/text: This is my favorite of the K-Cup Chai recipes. The spices are balanced though fairly strong allowing this tea to hold up well with the additions of honey (or sugar) and milk. It's wonderful served hot or cold. For the cold version, add your honey (or sugar) and milk, stir, and then pour over ice. When doing the iced version, I find it works best brewed on the 6oz size and then poured over ice in a 24oz glass. I prefer this to the Chai Latte K-Cups because I can control the amount of sweetener and milk.

review/summary: good, but...
review/text: If you've never tried this chocolate before, you'll be surprised how good the unlikely combination of chocolate with a bit of grainy sea salt can taste. It is considered dark chocolate but its 47% cocoa content is less than most darks - so it might be overly sweet if you're a fan of really dark chocolate. It has a bit of a milk toffee flavor. It's good enough that it's still one of my favorites. In comparison, Ghirardelli Intense Dark Sea Salt Soiree is similar but even better in my opinion...it uses more fully-flavored chocolate as well as almond bits.

review/text: Is it as good as a restaurant? No. Is it as good as food in Thailand? No. But it comes in a box and takes 3.5 minutes to make. Is it still good? Yes! We thought it tasted great. It is gluten-free, is easy to make and is tasty. My daughter (who is 4) loved it and she is a super picky eater. To find something quick for her to make, that is confirmed gluten-free (she has celiac), and that she likes is truly a relief for me. I bought them to test to see if she would eat them. I got this Peanut flavor and the Pad Thai. I sort of liked the Pad Thai better, but both were yummy (the Green Curry was too spicy for me). The portion is just right for one person. She ate her box, and I ate mine. We were both happy. I thought it was a successful test.

review/text: I was a bit skeptical, because most "sexy" costumes tend to fit a bit snug. But I'm a size 14 and the  large costume fit me perfectly! It is flattering and super fun with the buttons and ruffles. There were a few strings hanging off and the costume is a little shear in some places, but it's pretty good quality for a bag costume. The wig looked like a hot mess at first, but after fussing with it for a bit, I put it in tiny pigtails and added a fun bow and it looked super cute. I am 100% pleased with this costume and can't wait to wear it to my Halloween party this weekend!

review/summary: 100% Juice
review/text: The first reviewer complains that this is not 100% Cherry Juice and that the provider is lying.  When I buy a product that has Cherry and Grape in the name, my expectation is not that it is 100% Cherry with no other fruit juices.  I would carefully analyze all the facts before I resorted to accusing anyone or any company of lying.  (I do not work for Welchs, sell their product, or own stock.)<br /><br />I have gout and depend on natural products that can help me.  I have never had the positive results that others have had from eating fresh cherries and drinking cherry juice.  But, this beverage seems to help.  I suspect the secret is in the grape seed extract.  This is a by product of wine making and is reportedly very high in antioxidants.  It is one of the few products that contains grape seed extract.  I may try the grape seed extract as a stand-alone nutrient in the future to determine if that is the trick.<br /><br />BTW - The beverage is delicious.  I really enjoy my daily refreshment with this product.

review/summary: Too acidic in taste, not at all what expected
review/text: My wife grew up in the South Caucasus where walnut preserve was a staple.  She got tempted into buying this product because the jar was big and the price affordable.  She said the taste was nowhere close to what she was used to back at home.  The taste of the syrup was too acidic, and it overpowered the taste of the walnuts.  The walnuts themselves were tiny and on the mushy side.  Both the syrup and walnuts were honey-yellow in color, whereas the real syrup is supposed to be much darker (dark brown, almost black), and the nuts should preserve their original nutty flavor and a nice crunch with the soft interior. If you have ever tasted the real walnut preserve from the South Caucasus' regional cuisine, you will be disappointed in this product.

It isn't powerful enough in larger recipes (like ice cream and cookies) even if I use entire droppersful so I've had to put in chocolate stevia and carob as well.  I do like it in peppermint tea along with chocolate stevia, very yummy.

review/text: Great coffee if you grind and prepare it properly. I set my Kitchen Aid Burr grinder on the grind (7.5) one step down from espresso grind so it's very fine but not powdery. When I tried to grind it more coarse the coffee didn't taste good. Then I use my drip coffee maker with a cone (not basket) filter and make a full pot. I found if you make only half a pot the coffee doesn't devolop the same aroma. I use a heaping half cup of whole beans, grind them for a 12/8 cup coffee maker (average size coffee maker).<br />This coffee hits the spot 100 %, no complaints. No burned bean taste, no bitter taste, just a nice, smooth cup of coffee.

Lavazza is the sweetest, most delicious coffee I've ever had in my 53 years of living.<br />Not a bit of that nasty acidic aftertaste, even if you leave your drink out overnight! Something I tend to do, when on the 2nd cup.<br />Lavazza gran filtro is the best coffee in the USA, in my humble opinion.<br />You will not be disappointed, you'll be amazed after you partake of this delicacy.

review/text: This is my preferred coffee.  I drink this daily.  Strong but smooth and never bitter.  I like this particular packaging since it gives me enough coffee for 3 to 4 weeks.  So I can order it via Amazon Subscribe and Save.  These bags are pretty large, so make sure you have some good air-tight containers to store the beans in once you've opened the packaging.  One issue I have is that some of the time, the bags arrive without the vacuum seal intact.  (Normally the beans will be vacuum-packed and you can see bumps in the packaging caused by the tight fit over the beans.  Like in the picture.  I have not noticed this detracting from the flavor though I expect it does somewhat.

review/summary: moderately priced first-class coffee
review/text: We have enjoyed the coffee of the brand without recognizing what kind coffee it was at a hotel we stayed before. Now, we recognized the name remembering that it was the one we had  at the hotel room, and purchased it. The sample of it in the hotel room worked to get us as a customer. We enjoy it every morning now at home.

review/summary: The best coffee ever!
review/text: If you are looking for rich, 'coffee' flavor taste, this is the one that you are looking for. I tried two the Lavazza coffee, but this is the richest, bold enough to enjoy, but not acidic with full-body taste.<br />You probably want to wake up in the morning to drink this coffee.

review/summary: good for French press too
review/text: These beans make a nice, full-bodied French press coffee too, and they don't gum up my burr grinder like some oilier beans tend to. This is my second time buying this item. It's a great price for Lavazza!

review/summary: Not consistent
review/text: We've been drinking this coffee for quite some time (have it shipped automatically each month from Amazon) - for the price and quality, it's almost always been very good.  The most recent shipment, though, is undrinkable (both bags).  Not only are the coffee beans of a lower quality, but there is a chemical taste that's very worrisome.  We're canceling our "subscribe and save" today.

review/summary: Somewhat disappointed
review/text: We'd gotten these beans before, and they're excellent quality with fine taste, particularly for the cost per pound.<br /><br />However, for some unknown reason, the most recent order just chews my wife's stomach up. She also says they taste acidic to her. I drink my coffee with milk, so they taste fine to me and and I've had no problems, but I have a mostly cast-iron stomach anyway.<br /><br />So they're sitting on the shelf right now and we're drinking other kinds of coffee that don't give my wife nausea, pain, or heartburn.<br /><br />If you have a sensitive stomach, be careful. If you don't, give 'em a try.

review/summary: Yuck . . . ick . .  yuck
review/text: I was so excited by the positive reviews here, so I gave this a shot.  I have a decent Krups drip coffee maker that makes good coffee using lots of other brands (I usually buy my coffee at Trader Joes or Whole Foods).  I grind my beans just before drinking and experimented three times with this Lavazza Gran Filtro.  At first I thought I made the coffee too weak; then too strong; then assumed I had not ground the beans properly.  All three pots were horrid.  The strongest brew had a weird chemical after-taste that would not go away even after chewing gum.  Yuck!<br /><br />Anyone want to buy my unopened second bag?

review/text: I would be much happier with this product if it was not made in China. Although my dogs love Happy Hips I do not give them to my 5 dogs as much anymore now that I have discovered they are made in China where many unsafe dog products are manufactured. I have received emailed cautionary warnings about chicken jerky for dogs that is made in China causing liver and kidney damage so I give these only as a rare treat.

review/summary: Scared for my Sheba
review/text: we have been giving our dogs Happy Hips Chicken treats for a few years with no problems, however my dog recently started getting tremendously sick out of the blue.  She started drinking tons of water, having accidents all over the house and stopped eating her food.  My Vet has done a X-Ray, ultrasound, blood work etc...they have no idea what is going on.  My poor German Shepherd is on the brink of dying and everything seems to point to these chicken treats.  All of her food is top quality made in USA food, I always trusted what Dogswell said about testing their treats extensively, now I am not so sure.  I just read an aritcle on Fanconi Syndrome caused by treats from China, I plan on calling my vet first thing in the morning, wish us luck.  :(

review/summary: Made my dog sick!!
review/text: From just two days of giving these treats to  my dog she started having bloody diarrhea, less appetite and that's when I googled information about chicken jerky and was horrified about what I found. I can't believe I bought this at a Wholefoods store. I did not realize they were made in China, but now I see the correlation with other products that have been recalled. DONT BUY THESE PRODUCTS! I just trashed the bag I bought, which wasn't cheap by the way, but after seeing what it did to my dog I am not buying this again from any store.

review/summary: Made in China
review/text: I threw away my bag of chicken jerky after hearing about the FDA warning on chicken jerky products made in China.  Looking on the back of the bag, it says this product is made in China so I will not be buying it again.  It's not worth the future health of my pet, despite how much they may love their jerky treats.  I'm on the lookout now for a USA made alternative.  Put your pets first, not you wallet.  It may cost more to buy USA made, but it is worth it in the long run if your dogs avoid dying an early death that could have been avoided.

review/summary: WARNING MAKING DOGS SICK
review/text: I have been feeding my dog Dogswell pet food for years without any problem, she loves the food, and has been very healthy. I decided to try the dogswell brand jerky, and she began having very loose stools and eventually blood. I researched online and discovered unlike the pet food, the jerky treats are manufactured in China, a country the United States doesn't allow the importing of chicken for human consumption.<br /><br />Please do NOT feed your dog these, there are many reports of these treats causing the same symptoms in other dogs and in multiple cases resulting in death.

review/summary: Dogswell rocks!
review/text: I usually DO NOT buy ANYTHING sourced from the PRC, either for myself or for Maggie, my Bull Terrier.  (I came to this decision after numerous issues with poor quality, odd appearance and slightly "off" smells emanating from PRC-sourced products.  Maggie also puked several times when I tried some generic Costco PRC-sourced chicken jerky treats.)  However, as I have had great experiences with other non-PRC-sourced Dogswell Happy Hips treats for Maggie, I was willing to try their Chicken Jerky as well.<br /><br />Maggie LOVES these treats, and will do just about anything, for anyone, when she thinks it might end-up with a piece of this chicken jerky.  She seems to view these as very high value treats, which has been very helpful in periodic training exercises; and I feel very good about giving them to her due to the added glucosamine and chondroitin. (Bull Terriers can be susceptible to hip dysplasia and other joint problems.)  In the usual Dogswell fashion, these treats are made from cage-free chicken raised without antibiotics, added growth hormones or added steroids.<br /><br />While it may change in the future, the current Amazon/Entirely Pets price of $20.00 for a 2lb bag is better than the Costco price for a similar amount of other Dogswell Happy Hips treats.

review/text: My dog likes this treat. I'm not sure if it really helps her hips because we do not give them to her on a daily basis, she is on other joint related products daily.

review/text: My 13+ year old American Eskimo had slowed down.  All his life he's been very active.  This situation was sad for us and for him.  A friend brought a treat for him which included some Happy Hips.  The treats were gobbled quickly.  Over the next week or two we began to notice a huge change in our Eskie's behavior.  He was more energetic.  He seemed to want to go for those long walks again.  We have bought Happy Hips twice now.  I'm getting ready to order again.

review/text: 3 Years ago, a friend of mine recommended Happy Hips for my dog, Blue.  Blue is now 11 years old, an 85-pound Lab mix, who is perfect all the time and whom I love dearly.  He was having trouble during the winter getting up stairs and seemed to hesitate when he got up from a lying-down position.  I have been giving him Happy Hips for 3 years now and they have helped him immensely!  He gets 3 a day as treats and they keep him moving with ease.  Additionally, he feels like a very special Good Boy with each treat.  He loves them!

review/text: It was a rough year for my pooch with a torn ligament in his left leg.  Trying to get the glucosime pills down him everyday was a struggle.  Then I found a small bag of Happy Hips in a local store and I didn't have to ask bobolicious twice if he wanted one.  It's prescribed to adminster one piece for each 15lbs. Since then I have bought two large bags and the most recent purchase was delivered within a couple of days.  Much to boblicious' delight. He's on the mend thanks to Happy Hips.
