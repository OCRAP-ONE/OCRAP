review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I am  a huge fan of this hot cereal, and I buy it by the bucketload. A serving of the cereal, with a pat of butter, some sweetener, a pinch of salt (my secret ingredient), a few berries, and some nuts, makes for a delicious breakfast that doesn't spike my blood sugar, and is terrifically filling. It's not beautiful -- the chia seeds in the mix make for a....uh, call it an unlovely consistency -- so I wouldn't be feeding it to guests, but the taste is great, and I am big-time picky.

review/summary: Not terrible but not worth a reorder either
review/text: The flavor is ok but not mind-blowingly great and how can you claim the product has no sugar when its primary ingredient is Invert Sugar Syrup (a mixture of glucose and fructose). Lord help you if you are diabetic. Read the ingredients .. this is basically sweetened vanilla extract with added vanilla seeds added and thickened with the Gums. It appears that some people really like this stuff but its not for me. I'll stick with the real beans.

review/summary: Vanilla paste is so lovely
review/text: In all honesty, this is similar in potency to vanilla extracts I have tried.  There are benefits to using the paste, however.<br /><br />There is not much alcohol in the paste, so it's great to use for a true vanilla flavor without the bitter aftertaste (keep in mind it does contain some extract so I'm guessing there is a minimal amount of alcohol in this).  This is certified kosher and is gluten free for anyone who might be interested in this info.  Also, the vanilla specks create visual flavor...after all, people taste first with their eyes.  I'll admit that I tend to overdo vanilla in my recipes, which is why the paste is so much better for recipes where the amount of liquid does matter (whipping creams, ice creams, creme brulee, etc.).<br /><br />Be aware that the paste isn't really a paste.  It's more like a syrup.  I've tried other Lorann products before (mostly their emulsions), so I'm glad that this product meets expectations.  It's comparable in price and potency to vanilla extracts, but I'll be using this paste almost exclusively for the reasons mentioned above.

review/summary: Vanilla Paste For the Best Home-Made Ice Cream
review/text: Well, yes of course vanilla beans would be even better. But I can't afford them. And this is the next best thing. I went through the 3 jars in no time this summer, making the best vanilla ice cream we ever had. And Oh, the strawberry made with seascape berries. MMmm, good! I bought vanilla paste at Trader Joe's but this is a much superior product in flavor. So I just reordered in time for holiday baking. I have not tried other LorAnn extracts as I usually buy organic. For this great product I make an exception. It delivers the goods to your baked goods and custards.

review/text: My wife was tired of just using vanilla extract in her recipes, and she was wanting to make some creme brulee, which requires vanilla beans. I don't know about you, but once I priced the cost of vanilla beans I told her that she would never be making creme brulee. I saw this vanilla bean paste on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. The creme brulee came out tasting just as good as at any restaurant. That was two years ago, and I've purchased many bottles of this stuff for my wife. I highly recommend it!

review/text: I love vanilla!  This brand is pretty good, but the favor is not as intense as the Nielsen-Massey brand and is only a bit cheaper.  It is a bit less viscous but doesn't disperse as well; even in very hot water you have to wait and stir a bit.  The plastic bottles lend a bit of plastic taste to the product, so I will not purchase again.

review/text: After Purchasing my Cusinart Ice Cream/Yogurt/Sorbet Maker on Amazon,I realized I was running low on Vanilla Beans..I usually make my own extracts however my mouth was watering for homemade Vanilla-bean ice cream. I checked out my usual Culinary Sites and was unimpressed, so I logged back on Amazon and checked through the extracts.. I came upon Lorann Extracts, specifically. NATURAL, Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste. I thought, why not? I enjoy checking out new products and I love small businesses, especially in the Culinary Arts..<br /><br />Us Foodies, need to support each other. (I applaud, Amazon for  always introducing;unique businesss, intovative products and helping to market small businesses!!)<br /><br />Honestly, I was not even remotely<br />anticipating anything extraordinary. Boy, was I in for a Joyous Surprise!! Okay, I was Blown away and thrilled beyond belief after making my first batch of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream with LorAnn's Vanilla Bean Paste, truffles & white chocolate.<br />My Husband described  the experience (after devouring half a quart of ice cream), as another "foodgasim"!!!<br /><br />I am now a Loyal Fan of Lorann Extracts. Yes, I think I am addicted to their Vanilla Paste.. The Price of three four ounce bottles??? Truly, inexpensive especially regarding the outstanding quality..<br /><br />Can you keep a secret? &lt;Whispering> I'd pay twice the price!!! Shhhhhh.. Just "Our" Secret, Okay???

review/text: This coffee is more than just a hyper-caffeinated gimmick. Although it's caffeine content really isn't that much higher than other blends you might be drinking (~150 mg per cup: Definitely not deserving the hyper-caffeinated name; extra-caffeinated maybe but not hyper), it still is high and I can feel the difference.<br /><br />But the real thing that you're probably concerned with, as I was when I first ordered this coffee, is the taste. The taste is bold and a little earthy, and really quite good with only very minimal after taste. I have had a few friends ask me what blend (thinking Starbucks) I was brewing; it was good enough to make them want to go get it.<br /><br />And the best part considering the great taste is the price and convenience. At this price per pound, Shock hyper-caffeinated coffee is comparable to pretty much any other whole-bean quality coffee you might be buying (but probably a little cheaper is my guess). And with free shipping in a 5 pound bag to your door, you don't even have to leave home to buy your coffee.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more Shock Coffee soon.

review/text: I cannot really tell that this has a higher caffeine content than other brands, but the coffee tastes as as good as any I've ever had.  I am not a fan of dark roasted coffee, being more of a proponent of full city roasts.  This dark roast is full bodied and aromatic.  It takes less sweetener than other brands with a similar dark roast.  We use it in a drip coffee maker, a french press, and a vacuum coffee maker.  You get a subtle difference in taste with the different grind, but all are excellent.  We set this up for a monthly subscription with Amazon.

review/text: I can't comment on the 'hypercaffinated' aspect as I'm a heavy consumer of caffiene going through 2-3 pots of coffee a day and other caffinated beverages.  But the flavor of this coffee freshly ground is quite good, especially considering its price.

review/summary: First Time Buyer
review/text: Just finished my first bag. Lasted 5 months. The coffee tastes perfectly fine, in fact better than most store bought coffees I've had over the years.  My primary reason for purchase was for the extra caffiene.  I noticed no difference in the 'caffiene kick' comparing this coffee with any other but it does taste great. Bottom line, I'm purchasing my second bag. If you're unsure, my advice, buy a bag. You can't go wrong with the price and taste.

review/text: I used this in my espresso machine and can honestly say it has a kick compared to other Stary named espresso roast coffees. It has a rich non bitter taste, served with half and half with a bit of chocolate it makes a tasty cappuccino. Just make sure to get a nice air tight container and keep the beans in a dark place<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHYB9E">OXO Good Grips POP Big Square 4-Quart Storage Container</a>. When buying in 5lb bags this stuff can go rancid quick unless you are serving multiple people a day, so keep it fresh.

review/summary: Chock full of ROCKS
review/text: I usually buy Coffee Bean Direct Sumatra Mandheling, but I decided to try Shock Coffee after reading some of the reviews.  It is strong and dark, like Sumatra, though not nearly as earthy or complex.  I haven't noticed any real difference in caffeine levels compared to other coffees.  If brewed too strong, it can taste a bit burnt.  Still, brewed correctly it is quite palatable, especially since I use adulterants in my coffee (cream and sugar.)<br /><br />That being said, I am afraid that I cannot recommend this coffe to anyone, because it contains foreign matter that can seriously damage your grinder.  I found this out the hard way.  I had to repair my old Baratza Maestro twice, and I even ordered a new Capresso grinder from Amazon, just to have a backup.  I sorted through the remainder of the bag, bean by bean, and found some things that--although they appear to have been roasted--they were most definitely not coffee.<br /><br />I cannot afford to order this stuff again, because coffee grinders aren't cheap.  I'll be switching back to Coffee Bean Direct.

The best part is the high caffeine kick - I usually drink 4 shots of espresso in a nice latte first thing in the morning, but with this stuff - I only need two shots and I'm in orbit for the rest of the day...<br /><br />It doesn't give you a crazy caffeine buzz either - just a nice awake feeling...  Worth every penny and I recommend it to my friends all the time.<br /><br />As soon as I run out, I'm buying more...

review/text: Morton should be commended for producing this wonderful salt product. On my Sodium Chloride Saltiness of Salt Scale (commonly known as  SCSSS) this product ranks a full 10 which puts it right at the top of its class. And the packaging is first rate. I mean, a cylindrical box with a metal pull up spout -- it just doesn't get any better than that! I no longer use a salt shaker since it's such a kick to sprinkle it straight from the box. A dinner guest erred once and dumped about 4 tablespoons on her fillet mignon steak but it was her fault for not paying attention and being careless. I no longer date much as it has taken me years to recover from this trauma.<br /><br />This salt has a great salt flavor. It is especially good when you want to add a salty taste to food. If you want to prepare a salt water gargle then just add some of this salt to water. Works every time!<br /><br />GREAT SALT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

review/text: I had always bought the store brand salt. One day the only store brand available was of the free running variety. Because, like most Americans, I live in mortal fear of the dreaded goiter I thought "What the heck? I'll throw caution to the wind and spend the extra 10 cents." What a revelation! The metal pour spout has lasted through many pours-- a claim I cannot make of the lesser salts.<br />But it is not only that that makes this salt superior. I was delighted to find on the back of the package tips for being "salt savvy". Let's just say, I'm more prepared to "salt responsibly".<br />The package also promoted their other varieties of salt. I do find the claim that the sea salt is "harvested by the wind and the sun" a bit dubious. Really? No heavy machinery involved?<br />Morton salt was well worth the splurge. It gives me a little taste of how the 1% lives. A salty taste, that is! (Still, I would not go so far as to pay the roughly 1600% mark up of the salt listed here.)

I absolutely love how salt energizes and enhances flavor in foods, so I'm a big believer in MORTON IODIZED SALT.  Why iodized?  Because it contains iodide, a "necessary nutrient."  Well. . . .okay.<br /><br />Most foods these days are precooked or "heat & eat."  They are already loaded with sodium.  I save the Morton's for fresh foods.  A baked potato.  A piece of lean ground beef.  Corn on the cob.  Oh, yeah.  Just pull up the nifty metal tab on the circular 26-ounce container and pour into your favorite salt shaker, then sprinkle away for a flavorful feast.  But please:  In moderation only.  Your ticker will thank you later.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/text: I bake gluten free and use a lot of brown rice flour for breads.  I have always used the Bob's Red Mill variety.  I used to buy the small bags (24oz) from the store but I was constantly running out and forgetting to buy more.  These larger bags (48oz) are much easier to get a measuring cup into and scoop out the required amount of flour, and since I use so much it is handy to have a larger bag (I have never seen these big bags at the store).  Subscribe and save makes this a great value and ensures I never run out. The box that this ships in though is quite heavy, so you might want to keep that in mind before ordering!

review/summary: My new go-to flour!
review/text: Having only recently come around to baking gluten-free, I had grown accustomed to the hearty richness of darker flours. There was a time when I substituted whole wheat pastry flour for all-purpose flour in every recipe, to give a little extra color and fiber without compromising the performance of the flour in the recipe. Brown rice flour gives me some of that color that I've grown to expect when I look at something I've baked. Some of the flours or starches are so bright white...it makes the final product look a little "pasty." The Brown Rice flour from BRM really helps give some depth to my baked goods. I love the value in the 4-pack as well!

review/text: Cadbury's is by far my favorite brand of chocolate. I've tried all different types of chocolate from organic stuff, to imported stuff, to exotic stuff, to domestic brands to the very expensive stuff so it's funny that it's the proletariat everyman's Cadburys, which is in my humble opinion the best tasting.<br /><br />It is not widely known, but Cadburys did not used to be available in the US. We had Hersheys and England had Cadburys, but fortunately Hersheys brought Cadburys over here, and I'm glad they did, because Cadburys chocolate is better than Hersheys. I think Cadburys is sweeter and smoother. But I think Hersheys changed the formula a little because I had a friend mail me a bar of Cadburys from England, and their Cadburys is a little less sweet and darker.<br /><br />Cadburys with almond is one of their 3 regular offerings. The other two are Milk Chocolate and Fruit and Nut. Fruit and Nut is my favorite and Almond is next. I like the Almond bar because the nuts are crunchy; I have yet to eat a bar with spoiled nuts (which you sometimes do if you eat chocolate with peanuts) With the crunch you not only get gustatory pleasure but you get a textural pleasure from the mixture of something crunchy as well as something soft in your mouth. I have to admit that Cadbury's, which is tailored to the American sweet tooth is a mite too sweet and it isn't dark chocolate, which is "good" for your health. But who wants to live forever anyway? Chocolate is for pleasure, it's a hedonistic pleasure, if you're into health you should be eating sprouts and doing yoga, not eating this.<br /><br />But taste is in the end subjective, all I can do is to ask you to try it. For me, Cadburys is the best.

The difference that we see between the Mondo Bully (24 to 36 inches) and the regular bully (6 to 12 inch) is that the Mondo is a larger treat (circumference).  Our dog seems to prefer it to the regular bully stick.  There are some issues with Merrick products.  In this case the 36" mondo has become the 24" mondo without a price cut.

review/text: So, you can buy much shorter stix at the pet store that cost about 1/2 as much, and they last about 1/10th the time. This is by far the absolute best value in bully sticks. If you have a saw, you can cut them into smaller piece, if not, you can give even a smaller dog this size of a stick and they will take care of it. My coton who loves to chew on these sticks and is only 14lbs can be kept busy for over a month with one stick, now that's value!!! I highly recommend.

review/summary: 2nd box and still gooooood
review/text: As I stated from my other review I really enjoy these tasty treats.  I get a long lasting treat instead of a quick gratification of guilt. Sugar Daddy's have been around for a long long time and it's because they offer a great combination of sweet with caramel.  I have backed off of eating one every day because I know it's not good to do so but when I do indulge I am completely satisfied.  If I had only one change it would be for them to be a little softer so you can take a little bite and just chew the caramel taste  for a while.  A great treat but look at the price these days, I can remember when they were a nickle a piece well I am old as the hills :).

review/summary: The people at Hawaii Roasters know this is good coffee.
review/text: Kona coffee is world reknowned as being some of the best in the world, and I can speak with experience knowing that this domestic blend compares favorably with some of the best.<br /><br />However, I only ask those in Hawaii who farm and roast these beans to forgive me for saying that I think Konas are a bit overrated in the world of coffee.<br /><br />Yes, these beans have a lot of flavor.  The body is unrivalled.  Everything is balanced in a way that is unique to the Kona bean, but there are no subtle undertones prevalent that make me like the Sumatran and Ethiopian beans so much better.  The beans are aesthetically perfect in every way, and I only have to use about 2/3 the portion of what I would use to make my favorite brews, but this is where it gets touchy for me.  I pay about $12-13 a lb for coffee that might not be better than Kona coffee, but I like it better.  Hawaii Growers makes a mighty fine coffee, one of the best Konas I've ever tasted, but it isn't worth more than $25 a lb.  No coffee is worth that to me, and I've tasted the world's finest.<br /><br />Hawaii Growers is very competitively priced compared to other Konas, so if Kona coffee is the drinker's coffee of choice, then Hawaii Growers is a great choice.  For someone who prefers coffee from other regions, Kona still stacks up well, but a purchase for me was to simply try something new rather than to look for a new regular.

review/summary: For lovers of strong dark roasts only
review/text: I'm a dark roast lover, but this was too strong for me - regardless of how I made it.  I gave it to a friend who thought it was fabulous.  So here's my advice: don't make it too strong - it becomes bitter, and if you're not sure you like dark roasts....go with the light roast here.  Kona is traditionally very smooth coffee, and this is, but it's truly for strong dark coffee lovers.

review/text: Don't know about you, but I don't always get things right. However, sometimes I get things smashingly right, so when I ordered this HAWAII ROASTERS 100% Dark Roasted Whole Bean 16 Oz Bag, and a "Toastmaster" Coffee Grinder---another Review on Amazon.com---the results were slamm'in, producing a cup of Dark Kona that was so smooth. When I topped off for a refill, adding a couple Tablespoons of "Patron Citronge", two Teaspoons of Organic Raw Turbinado, and Organic Half & Half, I got treated to a cup of Dark Roasted Kona that was sexy succulent!<br /><br />The classy attractive colored semi-aluminum type bag contained rich aromatic, lusciously fresh oily Beans that entice you into wanting to transform them into the delicious beverage they yield. I can hardly wait for Breakfast tomorrow...<br /> --GBJ

review/summary: 5 lbs later, still a happy customer
review/text: After buying a pound a month for 5 months, I can comfortably say that my experience with this brand and product has been totally consistent. Hawaii Roasters dark roast has always arrived with a very recent roasted date to us, and the appearance and ensuing flavor have also been consistently awesome.  My wife and I go through 2 pounds of coffee a month, so after the pound of Kona is gone, we usually get a pound of dark roast (French, Italian, or Verona) from Starbucks, or occaisionally look for an organic company to buy from.  All in all, the coffee experience is superior to us with this Kona, and we enjoy freshly ground strong coffee.  It seems no matter what other brands of coffee we try, opening up the bag reveals less aroma, and more bean bits and pieces.  With Hawaii Roasters, its all whole beans with very minimal bean breakage.  Our tastebuds like it, and I won't be venturing very far from this bag of beans until I have a bad experience or taste something better (which I don't see happening soon)!

review/summary: A wonderful brew and brand
review/text: I normally steer clear of dark roasted coffee so I didn't try the Dark Roast right away after it was given as a gift. A short time later I opened the dark roast Kona, ground it and brewed it in my French Press and I was amazed.  Absolutely no bitterness, no lingering heavy aftertaste.  It had a touch of sweetness and its depth was so very smooth, yet still very rich and satisfying. Even after sitting a couple days it was fresh and full of aroma.  What I've learned is to make sure there's no air in the package to maintain its freshness. It's worked beautifully and weeks later I'm still relishing the best dark roast I've ever had!

review/text: This coffee hits you like a sledge-hammer. I do not recommend this coffee to those with high blood pressure.<br /><br />The coffee tastes smooth. It goes down well. But within 10 minutes, you will feel a kick unlike any coffee you've tasted. What's more, the kick remains for a long time.<br /><br />That's good if you like that. Not so good if you are looking for a gentle pick-up.<br /><br />After drinking this coffee, I decided to work-out and I became nauseated and sick. I don't have such problem with any other coffee. I do not recommend rigorous physical activity after drinking this coffee.<br /><br />This is a terrific high quality coffee if you are looking for the strongest caffeine kick possible. Maybe not as good if you are looking for a gentler blend.

review/summary: Fourth order foul BUT HAWAII ROASTERS FOLLOW-UP EXCELLENT
review/text: FOLLOW-UP TO THE BELOW REVIEW:<br />Two days later:<br />4 STAR RATING:  I also contacted Hawaiian Roasters and they immediately got back to me. They found out that Amazon had not thrown away a batch of coffee back in September and I had received a bag of it. While I have received a refund from Amazon, Hawaiian Roasters is also sending me a replacement bag of coffee. Excellent customer service.  I received the new bag and it was very good.<br /><br />ONE STAR RATING:  I first ordered this coffee during the 2010 Holiday Season and liked it so much that I gave several pounds as gifts.  In fact, we liked it so much that we decided to do the automatic order every other month.  I would have chosen every month, but at almost $30.00 per pound, I just couldn't quite justify it.  My February order just arrived and I anxiously opened it up.  Where is the rich coffee smell that should be permeating the kitchen?  It just isn't there.  It actually has that old, rancid smell.  You know the one; like oil that has gone bad.  Upon close inspection of the package, I found out why it has this smell.  The dark roasted date on the bottom of the package?  June 15, 2010!!  This coffee was roasted 8 months ago!<br /><br />Needless to say, I immediately contacted Amazon, demanded a refund and canceled any future orders.  This is really too bad because when this coffee is fresh, it is delicious.  What a shame that they believe they can foist old product off on supposedly unsuspecting customers.  They should know that people who pay this much for coffee probably know old coffee when they smell it.  Get a clue, Amazon.

review/summary: Good Joe, but...
review/text: I purchased this coffee specifically for use with my French Press as I had been told that coffee from the Kona Coast was "the one".  I picked the dark roast because I love a good strong, dark cup of coffee... Although this was a good cup of coffee, I did not find it to be "dark" or particularly "strong".  It may be just me, maybe I'm brewing it wrong, as I am a novice when it comes to the French Press process as well as Kona coffee itself.  I have yet to use it with my drip coffee maker, but am planning on purchasing another pound of whole bean for that purpose.  The verdict is still out.
