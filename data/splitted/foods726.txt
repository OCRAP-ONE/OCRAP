review/summary: This was awful
review/text: This San FranciscoBay Coffee, Rainforest Blend, smelled so bad we cound not keep it in our kitchen even sealed in the plastic bags.  I caould not drink it either.  The grounds went right through the netting into the mug.  The entire experience was just awful.  I tried to give it away at work, but noone wanted it. Sorry, please try another brand. I have and was more fortunate.

review/summary: Unusual for me to not like a coffee
review/text: I really like Blue Mountain coffee the best..Great flavor acid profile is great, and I grade others based on that.  I like breakfast style most, high caffeine light roasts. I will drink almost any good coffee.  Dark Sumatra's ,, medium roasts, I will drink them and if I don't love them they are still ok to pretty good.  Then we get to this coffee. West coast coffee is on my least liked list, although I drink Starbucks with no problem.  This coffee smells bad to me.  It's organic, and I like organic, but it's like too organic.  makes me think they got some organic compounds from the fields in the mix.  Must just be too strong for me.  After mixing my cup well there is a heavy precipitate on the bottom of the cup that looks like chocolate syrup.  I don't like to waste stuff I buy but I find myself grimacing when I think of drinking a cup.

review/summary: AWFUL -  WATERY - NO REFUND ALLOWED
review/text: I bought a box of 36 Fog Chaser and a box of 36  Decaf.  Both are so weak, too weak even for people that like weak coffee. I really mean watery.  The water just flows right through the filter giving you a cup of slightly brown water.  I am very disappointed that I cannot return them.<br /><br />There is no label on the packaging and no label on the box. I thought there were label laws.  No instructions or anything with my purchase.  The pods come in a clear bag in 3 sets of 12. Once you open The clear bag you will need to find a container because they will be exposed to air.  Why no label on the bag?<br /><br />I like the concept but maybe the filter should be thicker so the water stays in longer or maybe you could make a stiff filter that gets punctured by the Keurig machine. Use unbleached filters please.<br /><br />I'm confused if this is organic coffee. On the San Francisco Bay web site it seems to be organic but it does not say organic on the pod.<br /><br />Thanks for your attempt but I would like a refund.

review/summary: Great cup of coffee
review/text: I decided to give the San Francisco Bay Rainforest Blend Organic Arabica onecup a try this morning.<br />When I open the box I notice a similar smell as the Fog Chaser blend but not nearly as strong.<br />Oddly I find the description on the Box exactly the same as that of Fog Chaser.<br />Their Website shows this as Reguler Full city Roast and describes it as follows :<br />Our certified organic, Rainforest Blend is an artful mix of coffees from Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, and Indonesia that produces a smooth, yet full-bodied taste with lively acidic notes.<br />The onecup brews perfectly in my B70 and like it smelled befor brewing produced a more delicate cup than the fog chaser but still very flavorful when brewed.<br />Maybe this is the same blend of coffee beans only roasted alittle lighter?<br />The wife and I tend to favor the Dark Roast extra bold Kcups and on occasion Medium roasts as well.<br />This Rainforest Blend is alittle light for me but it's really flavorful and wins me over all the same.<br />So far I'm really liking these offerings from Rogers Family company and would purchase them again if the price remains competitive to Kcups.<br />I was originally concerned by the fact they are not individually sealed for freshness.<br />The wife and I normally drink 2 cups a day so we can polish off a box of 12 in three days once opened so the coffee does not lose much freshness.<br />The downside is we need to drink only these for three days in a row instead of mixing it up depending on how we feel each day as we currently do with Kcups if we want to keep them as fresh as possible.

review/summary: Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig
review/text: As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup.  Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon.  Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!

review/summary: Great Taste - Less Waste
review/text: Local BJs had this on sale for $28 per 80 cups.  Thought It would be worth a shot.  Well, after getting it home, I was pleasantly surprised on a couple notes.<br /><br />First, the coffee is delicious.  Good body, bright flavor.  Really nice cup of coffee. (I don't use cream or sugar.)<br /><br />The second surprise is that the K-cups aren't full cups. Plastic is only used for the rim to provide rigidity so the cup will hold up under the pressure of the brewer.  My guess us that they use about 66% less plastic - less waste, less mess for the landfill. Aside from the rim, there is the filter material, which seems to be a better filter than in the full plastic cups.<br /><br />Finally, I've used the Eco-Cups over the years and really liked them, because I could use my own coffee.  The only problem is that cleaning them is not easy.  I had tried the MyCaps so I could refill the original K-cups with my own coffee.  While they worked well, cleaning the cups was messy (hence switching to the Eco-Cups).  These cups work GREAT with the MyCaps, since they are so easy to clean out and not messy at all.  Instead of trying to rinse out the used coffee, I now just peel the foil, and push the used coffee into into a container so I can compost it.  Then, with a simple rinse, it's ready to refill and pop on a MyCap and brew again.  What's great is that the coffee, itself is excellent and you can reuse the filters over and over with your own coffee.  Now, I keep a box of this coffee around for when I don't have time to do a refill, and refill when I want a little variety.  Best of both worlds.<br /><br />By the way, refilling them with the same grind-your-own, whole bean coffee also saves money (a lot of it).  You can do that by buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RO5M1Q">San Francisco Bay 100% Organic Coffee Rainforest Blend Whole Bean 3 Lbs</a> from Amazon. How can you go wrong?

review/summary: A Good Cup of Coffee
review/text: This is a nice, somewhat mellow but rich cup of coffee. I like the packaging because I have had more than a few normal K-cups either explode or backfire in my Keurig. With this type of cup, the water has no place to go but out through the filter. It's pure genius if you ask me. I do prefer the Rainforest Blend to the Fogchaser from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company. I found the Fogchaser much more acidic and, though it could be a coincidence, my heart rate went to about 120 after 2 cups of Fogchaser. Of interest, the pack of 3 I received did not come in boxes with any descriptions on them. They were just 3 thickish cellophane bags with 12 cups in each, which I thought was strange because when I ordered the Fogchaser, each pack of 12 was in a box and I was able to give one as a gift to my coffee buddy at work. As for the coffee getting stale as others are concerned about, well.....coffee doesn't last very long around here. 12 cups goes in much less than a week and I have not noticed any staleness by storing these in my upright Keurig carousel. That's probably because this particular carousel does not leave the bottoms of the cups exposed to air. I digress. I do recommend the Rainforest Blend -- it's a great cup of coffee at a really good price. And less packaging to boot.

review/summary: Great Concept & Taste
review/text: Truthfully, I ordered this because of the potential cost savings and after receiving the shipment and brewing a few cups, I was very pleasantly surprised. I had previously ordered the Timothy's Rainforest Blend to brew as an espresso shot (smallest setting) and as a flavorful cup of coffee (on the largest setting). They taste almost identical...with this version getting my vote as the best of the two. It's roasted just short of the burnt tasting French Roast, so it has flavor without the biter, heavy, overpowering taste some of us don't like...so you STARBUCKS PEOPLE, YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS and may call it weak...you guys have to stop basing all your reviews on that flavor profile as being 'correct'. This is a coffee brewer created mostly on convenience...you can't base a decent K-cup review as a direct comparison to a freshly roasted, freshly ground, drip cup of coffee! Base your reviews on how CLOSE we get to that...not that it's bad if not achieved.<br /><br />The folks caught up in the design difference are confusing to me, all it is is different. It has a solid plastic rim with the standard foil top, with a mini paper filter basket full of ground coffee attached to it...that's all it is. All I did was clean out the detachable basket that the cartridge sits in on the machine to get out any grinds that may have collected in there from previous K-Cups and everything from that point on was exactly the same...other than having to store these unique cartridges in a zip-lock baggie to keep them fresh. To me it was nice to get that coffee aroma once again similar to making a fresh pot of ground coffee...it's a sensory thing with me that I enjoy before brewing.<br /><br />This quality of coffee is a keeper for me and I have since put it on the auto ship program. To get 80 cartridges for $28 delivered (.35 per cup) is tough to beat...like before wholesale coffee prices went through the roof a year & a half ago! To all the Keurig owners out there, definitely give this brand a try in a roast you like...I promise you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: I have to admit up front that I selected this product for trial on price alone.  I hadn't read the previous reviews very carefully and was surprised when I opened the box and found a bunch of very un-K-cup looking K-cups.  The second thing that hit me was the great coffee aroma, something missing from K-cups in general.  What the hell!  Skepticism aside, into the brewer went the first one.  Cut to the chase - great cup of coffee!  I expected a dripping mess when I removed the K-cup.  Not so.  It leaves a perfect little disposable piece.  No mess.<br /><br />In addition to the Rainforest blend I also have now tried the French Roast Decaf.  Also a treat.

review/summary: Weak at High Setting
review/text: This product is an interesting cross between a Keurig cup and a pod.  They work in my old B-70, but just from looking at it you can see that it contains less coffee than a typical k-cup.  As a result, it brews a decent cup of coffee on the lower setting, but it's weak as a grande.  That may work for you - at the current subscribe-n-save price it's cheap for a k-cup.<br /><br />The flavor is perfectly ok - I'm not a coffee purist, but I'd call it a dark blend more akin to Sumatran than Colombian, i.e. not so smooth.<br /><br />There is one thing I guess I should add - these things have a pod-type body, i.e. a filter-packet holding the coffee, instead of the k-cup's all-plastic body.  Typical pods come in individual sealed packets to preserve freshness, but all 12 k-pods in each SFBay box are in a single, non-resealable plastic envelope.  This means that once you've opened the envelope, you're losing freshness faster than usual.  Again I'm no purist, but this would lead to staler coffee if you're not brewing these in a hurry - or resealing them somehow?  The box offers no advice or directions.

review/summary: Spoiled batch made me shake my head and say "bleh!"; Very Strong Coffee
review/text: First the good:<br /><br />The lack of K-cup and packaging in small plastic bags allows for a one-way valve, which releases the gas that builds up around coffee while keeping air out, this is an awesome idea. Because of this you should NOT put the coffee into a zip-lock-bag, but instead keep it in its own plastic bag and use a paper-clip to keep it air-tight.<br /><br />Further, the lack of 'cup' for the K-cup allows the water to filter through the coffee in a more natural-way. This means that in order to make up for the lack of directional k-cup they use more grounds. More grounds is awesome because it avoids picking up the bitter parts of the coffee.  This perfected style of coffee brewing is why there is little in the way of bitter in the coffee.<br /><br />These are the two stars.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />It tastes like sipping petrochemicals. The danger of not burning the bean with a very dark-roast is that you get to taste more of the bean. The problem with these beans is that they taste like gasoline. All of the work and benefit of creating the most flavorful cup of coffee, which is what SFBay has done, is totally lost because the beans they use are not to my taste. I can only offer my own opinion of the matter, as taste is not an objective trait, whenever I drink the coffee it makes me shake my head and say "bleh!"<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Despite how bad the coffee tasted I drank through the first package slowly; now I'm on to my second package. It is VERY strong coffee, but not rancid. I would revise up to four stars given the quality of coffee I'm getting now, but since I was clearly sent a rancid pack of coffee I have to drop it to three stars.

Therefore the coffee wont stay fresh and while you could put it in a ziploc or other storage container, the coffee is going to be exposed to air and go stale a lot faster than a k-cup.  They also dont fit well into a k-cup holder.<br /><br />I wont buy this brand again.  One of the main reasons why I like k-cups is they keep the coffee a lot fresher than regular coffee in a bag.

review/text: I purchased the SF Bay "OneCup" without paying much attention to the use of the phrase "...for Keurig K-Cup Brewers," so I was surprised upon opening the first box of SF Bay OneCups. I didn't connect with the carefully chosen description which never called the product "K-Cups".  They probably would have liked to call them K-Pods, if it weren't for potential trademark issues.  Another reviewer remarked that they are a cross between K-Cups and pods.  I echo that.<br /><br />The pod units fit perfectly in our Cuisinart K-Cup, and are dimensionally similar, with the top being pretty much a K-Cup twin, and the pod material provides the filtration.  No post-brew drip issues either.  Since they aren't hermetically sealed, you will find a zip lock bag or other airtight container handy.  I'm guessing that the pod material is more biodegradable than a real K-Cup, and probably worth the trade-off, requiring more care to preserve freshness.<br /><br />If you are looking for a medium bold blend, try the SF Bay Rainforest Blend. Funky pod brews a nice 8 oz. cup.  I will be ordering again.

review/summary: Impressed doesn't cover it!
review/text: I saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. I've been looking for a delicious dark roast organic coffee that wasn't bitter. My first shipment was scheduled to arrive on June 6, but to my surprise, arrived June 4. I opened up the box, and was pleased first off to see that the pods were packed into bags of 8, in order to keep them fresh longer. This was a plus, because no one wants stale coffee that has lost it's 'umph', and I had wondered how I was going to manage to keep all of the pods fresh until I used them up. The exposed filter had concerned me, but with the amount of coffee I drink, they won't have time to go stale opening one of the small bags at a time.<br /><br />My curiosity about the coffee couldn't stand any more, so I cut open one of the bags. The smell was amazing! Before I had even brewed my first cup, I knew this was going to be good. There was no 'burnt' smell to the coffee, just pleasant, rich aroma. Although I had already had my normal 4 cups for the day, I just had to have a cup immediately to see if it tasted as good as it smelled. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was quite impressed.<br /><br />The coffee is rich and bold without the bitterness of many dark roasts. It's very smooth and just begs you to drink more. I'm not an expert, so I won't try to rate the acidity, flavor notes, or anything like that, but I am a life long coffee lover and 4 cup a day drinker, so for me to say that this coffee is impressive means that at least I have some experience with different tasting coffees and it has passed my personal tests. If you prefer a 'weaker' cup of coffee, you can even brew twice from the same pod into a larger travel mug. It's good either way, I just personally prefer strong coffee.<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee for it's flavor, it's value, and on top of those, the fact that it's organic and produces less waste than typical K-cups. If you are looking for a smooth, dark roast coffee, by all means give the San Francisco Bay Rainforest Blend a try. You'll be glad you did.

review/summary: great value!
review/text: I have been using Coffee People Donut Shop for over a year and have no complaints, so I was hesitant to try something new.  I like a decent cup of Joe, but I am no expert.  I prefer a medium roast, something that tastes like coffee without knocking me over.  After reading all the reviews I picked this variety and I really like it.<br /><br />The non-cup kcup looks weird but it works just the same.  I keep the extra ones in a plastic ziptop bag that has been configured to fit in my kcup  drawer.  Even after a week of being open an resealed , the coffee still tastes great.<br /><br />This product is significantly cheaper, but it is not because of the taste or quality.

review/text: I don't normally write reviews on Amazon, however, I do really like this coffee.  It fit perfectly into my Keurig, though I looked at it quite skeptically when I opened the package this morning. The coffee itself brewed a very nice, balanced cup of coffee.  I am giving it 4 stars only because I'm concerned that without it being completely sealed in each kcup/pod hybrid, how will the coffee stay fresh over any extended period of time.  I usually keep my kcups in a bowl, in order to grab, brew and go quickly.  We'll see how it does over time.

review/summary: Pods work well in my Keurig brewer, but taste is too strong and acidic
review/text: Picked the Rainforest blend up at a local big box wholesale club because price was almost $10 cheaper (for an 80-count box) than my favorite Green Mountain brand, Colombian Fair Trade. I have been drinking the Green Mountain Colombian for several years, love the smooth, yet full bodied flavor. These San Fransisco Coffee Company pods were bitter and strong tasting and left me with an acidic stomach condition which I hadn't experienced in years. I will be returning these and continue to use my Green Mountain Colombian Fair Trade k-cups. I had high hopes for these less expensive pods, but to me it is all about the taste and I don't like the taste, period!

review/summary: STRONG!!!  But so good!  And "relatively" inexpensive...
review/text: I tried out this coffee because very few fair trade & organic subscribe and save options out there and it was almost half the price of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5XUGK">Coffee People, Tree Hugger, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA30XC">Green Mountain Coffee, Colombian Fair Trade Select K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers, 50 count</a> when ordered through Subscribe & Save.  That said, the truly price sensitive among us will point out that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RO5M1Q">San Francisco Bay 100% Organic Coffee Rainforest Blend Whole Bean 3 Lbs</a> allows you to make a whole pot of coffee for about the same price, or use a MyCup/eKobrew if you still are in love with the single cup thing.  (I'm forbidden from using MyCups because I can't seem to use them without getting some coffee grounds all over the place and my wife considers coffee grounds on the floor to be grounds for divorce.)<br /><br />First, the actual cups themselves are fascinating.  I think they are able to get the lower price because they are using a K-Cup compatible packaging without actually having to pay a licensing fee to Green Mountain (which has a patent expiring in late 2012).  Green Mountain is apparently suing them for infringement, so that may end up having an effect.<br /><br />These alternate cups are smaller and I suspect a bit more environmentally friendly than K-Cups, but not by a huge amount.  They have coffee filters holding the beans in, instead of plastic.  The downside of this is that they can dry out, so they come in plastic bags holding a six or so each.  The filters don't work quite as well as K-Cups, so I have ocassionally found some grounds in my coffee.  It's not a huge deal to me, but might be for you.<br /><br />They also advertise that it works in various non-Keurig systems, but I was a Keurig early adopter so I haven't tried any of the others.<br /><br />Okay, for the coffee taste test, this stuff is STRONG.  All the fair trade, organic, eco-friendly, hippiesh vibe (complete with a photo on the side of the box of the whole extended family smiling in front of rustic commune looking backdrop) does not prepare you for this.  This is coffee that drinks you back.  It's smooth without tasting burnt or overly bitter, but full-bodied doesn't really begin to describe it, unless that body was of a heavyweight boxer... and this coffee was a boxer, it would be Joe Frazier.  If this coffee was a spaceship, it would be the Death Star.  This isn't some coffee that gently wakes you up after being mixed with foamed milk and maybe a shot of flavored corn syrup, this is coffee that wakes you up by beating you over the head and shouting at you like the Drill Instructor from Full Metal Jacket.<br /><br />Okay, so maybe I'm a bit jacked up from my two HUGE mugs this morning, but this stuff has the caffeine to back up that taste, and with a newborn and a toddler, it's the only thing that gets me moving at this-clock-has-to-be-broken-it-can't-really-be-that-early AM.  And keeps me moving, because it leaves me with a mild case of the shakes.  Three will have me wired all day.<br /><br />So after singing the praises of this coffee, why would I rate it only four stars?  As much as I'm a huge fan of this coffee, my wife won't even go near the stuff... for precisely the reasons I listed above.  She'll stick to her sweet donut shop concoctions.  So YMMV.

review/text: I love the convenience of my Keurig, but HATE the waste that it creates.  I've tried the reusable baskets, and haven't enjoyed the resulting coffee much.  The format of these is fantastic... I store them in a mason jar in the dark, and after using one, it's really easy to rip open the filter material and add the coffee grounds & filter material to my compost.  Then, I'm recycling a small plastic ring and some (much lighter-duty than a regular K cup) foil, rather than adding the whole used plastic cup and coffee grounds to a landfill.  I tried to do the same with a regular k-cup, but it was much more difficult and messy to open and empty them.<br /><br />Rating a four because I really like the coffee blend, I don't love it.  I will definitely try other varieties in this format though!

review/summary: San Fran k-cup all the blends
review/text: Since we have found the San Francisco brand of K-cups for Keurig brewers, we will NEVER go back to the enclosed K-cups.<br />We love ALL the San Francisco blends.  The French Roast is perfect for a bolder cup, it also seems to be the only one in Decaf which my husband uses...I like either the Rainforest or Breakfast Blend for a softer cup in the evening.<br />We live above 7,000 feet elevation in Colorado and had trouble with the enclosed cups because of the pressure created inside so we had to puncture the tops with a toothpick before placing them in the machine, otherwise the grounds would shoot up into the water spout and cause it to clog up...<br />With the mesh type cup of the San Francisco brand, this never happens and I have noticed there is no more coffee ground residue to be cleaned out of the cup area either.<br />I only put a few at a time in the 'coffee basket' each day and keep the rest in their package, folded and clipped to keep them semi airtight..<br />We LOVE them all and they have solved any of the functional problems we occasionally had with the brewer.

A $10 difference lower in price for the 80 count box as compared to Newmans or Green Mountain bold 80 count coffee. What a pleasant surprise. Great taste, rich flavor at small & medium setting. Who cares what the container looks like??? It tastes good and its much less expensive that comparitive brands. Most medium to full flavor coffee in the K cup or pod version are weaker when pushed to the Large setting.. This one is as well. Obviously the more water processed through a medium blend of coffee in a premeasured container the weaker it will be...Make two cups at medium setting and you should be happy.

review/summary: Best and Cheapest K-Cup Option I've Found
review/text: These k-cups are cheap because they don't have the plastic cup base. That means that they don't keep as long, but frankly I haven't had an issue with that. They are delivered in 12-pack bags with most of the air pushed out of a valve. I immediately put them in the freezer except for the current 12 I'm using. I drink about 3 cups a day, and keep the open k-cups in a sealed plastic bag on a shelf. Quality has not degraded to a point where I've even noticed.<br /><br />A few notes:<br />- This is apparently the same bean mix they use in Fog Chaser, but it clearly is a lighter roast. I find it suits my taste preferences better than Fog Chaser, and my understanding is that a lighter roast means more caffeine.<br />- A normal k-cup has a plastic base, the filter basket with the grounds, a plastic ring to hold the basket in place, and a metal foil seal. These are significantly cheaper in part because they don't have that cup. This leads to my storing the 12-packs in the freezer until I need them. I would suggest trying the ones with the full cup first to figure out if this (or Fog Chaser) can be your regular coffee, and if so, definitely get these.<br />- One issue that I don't care about, but others do, is that the cup isn't there to catch the really fine grounds. You will end up with some grounds at the bottom of your cup. If that bugs you, don't get these. The grounds are very fine and don't affect the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />Oh, the taste: it's a medium roast perhaps on the lighter side of the spectrum. If you like a darker roast (e.g., that popular coffee chain that burns their beans to ashes, IMHO),  then you'll like Fog Chaser more probably. The acidity and bitterness are well-balanced. I drink my coffee straight black, which is how I like it; if I kept the same taste but switched to cream and/or sugar, I would go with Fog Chaser. The thing I like about this blend/roast is that it has excellent flavor with a hint of nuttiness. It doesn't have a ton of body, IMHO, but that's just what I've found to be the case with the Keurig. I'm thinking about the K2, but I'll wait for more pod choices.<br /><br />Finally, I'll be honest, I don't buy these for eco reasons; I'm too picky about my coffee. However, there is less waste and, if I was the sort of person to compost, it would be very easy to separate the basket from the ring and compost the grounds.

review/summary: Best Coffee Ever!
review/text: This is the best coffee I have ever tasted.  I have tried all of the K-cups and mostly enjoyed Paul Newman's and the "Donut Shop" ones (the one with the doughnut on it and the one with the baker guy on it).  One day I saw the 80 count in BJ's for twenty bucks and I thought hmmm...'ok, it's a good deal but it must be awful...what the heck, I'll try it".  THIS IS THE BEST COFFEE I HAVE EVER TASTED. I never did see it in BJ's again?! so I searched online for it!<br /><br />Hot or simply poured over ice, hands down, my favorite.  I can't drink any other.  I am constantly recommending it (and reluctantly parted with some samples to prove it) to a few people and they ALL agree.  We are all hooked.  It is also great because it is environmentally packaged (no plastic cup)....I bet the lack of 'plastic' makes the taste better.  You can't lose.  I drink two to three cups a day (Rainforest) and each sip is as good as the first.  In fact, I am going to make a cup right now.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TGDXMK">San Francisco Bay Coffee Organic One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend, 80-Count</a>

review/summary: Tastes Great! Less Filling! (less filling for the landfill that is)
review/text: I will say I was skeptical.<br />I had my vacuum packer all ready to seal up all these cups since they wouldn't benefit the way the coffee in the k-cups do being sealed away from the air.<br />I opened the box, cool, 10 vacuum baggies!<br />They should really list that in their description!<br />So never fear, unless you only drink a cup a week your coffee won't go stale!<br /><br />Anyways, on to the coffee.<br />First off, something I've missed... the smell of ground coffee.<br />OMG! I cut open the bag and was knocked back back a beautiful and incredibly tempting coffee aroma!<br />This had a really good flavor, nice and full, not bitter.<br />After trying it at 10oz, i then re-brewed (@6oz) the same pack to fill my 16oz cup.<br />The filter held up extremely well and the coffee still tasted delicious and not watered down.<br />There were no chunks of bean in my cup as I finished, some fine powdery grounds, but I get more when i double brew a k-cup.<br /><br />So pluses:<br />Coffee tastes good<br />Slightly less trash than a K-Cup<br />A WHOLE LOT cheaper than K-Cup<br />Organic<br />Sealed into small quantity packs<br />To be able to smell your coffee beans<br />Multiple roast strengths and decaf are available.<br />Did I mention it tastes good?<br /><br />Cons:<br />Still pricier than bulk coffee<br />Sealed in 8 count pouches, so if you don't drink frequently you will have to re-vacuum.<br />Storage, it is a little more inconvenient than being able to stack the k-cups in the drawer, but I have plenty of room.<br />No selection of flavored coffees (yet, according to their website they are coming soon)<br /><br />I applaud the manufacturer for improving on the k-cup, and for producing a finely roasted bean!<br />I cannot remember the last time I actually thanked a company for their product, but I will now!<br />Thank You San Francisco Bay Coffee!<br />You have a new fan!

review/text: Like some other Keurig coffee maker owners, I have been buying less and less coffee because the price of K-cups has been going up and up.  I was for a time ordering all kinds of k-cups online but it just got so expensive that I quit ordering and started buying those little boxes of 12 at the grocery store when I needed more coffee.  At last I have found coffee at a really good price!!!  This San Francisco Bay coffee is not only affordable, but it tastes like a good cup of coffee should taste!  I ordered 72 cups and when I tasted the first one I ordered 72 more!  It smells good too when you open the package.  I was about to give up on my two year old Keurig coffee maker because the k-cups were getting just too expensive.  Thanks to San Francisco Bay brand, I think I'll keep using it.

review/summary: A great brew
review/text: This product had earlier gotten mixed reviews and I held off from ordering it, but it was on sale w/ more positive than negative reviews and I took a chance on it.  This is w/o question the best "K cup" type of coffee I've ever had.  Yes, it does come in a non-resealable bag, but I just took the whole bag and put it into a zip lock.  No problem at all.  The aroma when you open the orig. bag is outstanding.  This coffee maintains that aroma until the last cup is gone.  The flavor is really superb and tastes more like regularly brewed (drip or percolated) than the original K cups.  Not only is it a great coffee for aroma and taste, but it's a more degradable product thus making it more environmentally friendly.  Still not as good as just grounds, but an improvement over the other single brewing products.

First of all I was pleased to see instead of a plastic cup, it was in a little bag with a plastic ring....still plastc but much less.  But the important thing is we all liked the coffee better then the other brands.  I am on my second order.  I am trying to determine how much we use so I can place an automatic order.

review/summary: good coffee, not as convenient
review/text: ordered this based on reviews, and of course, price. quite a bit less than k cups. initially thought coffee was too strong, but, after a couple tries i now actually enjoy the rain forest mix. packaging does make it less convenient - for most the k cup machines are bought for convenience, so, you will need to weigh that against the price. these come in a vacuum sealed package per 12. once opened you will need to move them to a reasealable bag to stay fresh, no biggie. my biggest gripe is the water, when brewing, tends to shoot down the back side of the front of my machine and the holder also drips water for quite a while after brewing. this is because these cups are not really cups at all but filters with a top. like the inside of the regular plastic k cups. so, the machine is just shooting water through a filter - the pressure is not really doing much as it does with the k cups where the pressure actually drives the water through and out of the sealed plastic cup. the coffee seems to taste fine even though it is working more like a drip coffee maker with a turbo boost. for my machine at least - i need to do a quick wipe down after brewing or there are some puddles around. so, less convenient. however, once my regular k cups are finished up i will switch over as the price justifies a bit less convenience. hoping they come out with some more flavors.

review/summary: Ive tried them all, these are the best - for flavor and cost
review/text: I was starting to get bummed about my fancy Kuerig machine because I was getting tired of the cost of K-cups all the time...it adds up!  Especially with shipping!  I tried these just the one time to give it a whirl, and I say, they are so delicious.  I do the monthly renewal for $13 (I think?), it is so inexpensive.  I am a starbucks addict and my husband is very picky about his coffee (we live in Seattle - that should say alot lol)  These look different that K-cups being the bottom is open and not a plastic cup, but it brews perfectly.  The only thing is I no longer use my kcup carousel because since the bottom is open to air and not the cup you dont want them getting stale, so I went and purchased an air tight container for the counter top. NBD tho.  Hope you try them! You will be happy!

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: The first thing I loved about this coffee was how quickly it was shipped and I loved the different type K-Cup. While I realize that some people were upset because it wasn't like the regular K-Cups...I actually like this style better. This style is more compact and much easier to store, once I opened one of the 3 bags, I just placed the open bag in a zip lock storage bag to maintain freshness. I hate bitter, strong, dark coffee and that is always my biggest fear when ordering an unknown. In my search for something that appeals to me I have found many that were too strong or too weak. At first taste, I thought OMG..this is the one!! Not too weak, not too strong and I could actually taste a nice flavor but about half way through the cup, I started to notice an aftertaste. So, while I won't have any problems drinking what I bought, I probably won't buy it again even though the price was awesome. I'll keep my fingers crossed that once I get used to it, I won't notice the aftertaste

review/summary: Hands Down The Best Bold K-Cup of Coffee!
review/text: I stumbled across these on Amazon, and since I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the usual 50 cent K-Cup, I figured I would give these a try - Am I glad I did!!<br /><br />For me at least, one of the issues with the Keurig K-Cup is that most make a cup of coffee that is too weak, especially if you want a larger cup.  This Fog Lifter brand does not.  The flavor is perfect, no bitterness and the strength is even good at the highest setting on my Keurig (travel mug size).  I only add a little heavy whipping cream to my coffee and it is the best (if you have never tried "heavy whipping cream", give it a shot), you don't know what your are missing, yes, it has fat, but no carbs, no sugars.<br /><br />Anyway I knew these were not traditional K-Cup, but who cares, in fact, I think this design is far superior.  The filter material is a bit thicker than the normal K-Cup paper filter, so the fact that the coffee does not drip through a single hole, does not matter, the flavor is still great.  The only thing that would make these better would be if they came in resealable bags, but then the price would go up.  I either just cut the corner off of the bag, then seal it with a plastic chip clip, or lately I have been buying Davidsons Tea.  The tea comes in a large foil-paper resealable bag. When my tea ran out, I started dropping my Fog Lifter cups in these bags, works great.  Both type of bags (the tea ones and the original ones that these K-Cups come in), have a small one way valve to get all the air out.  Super find, super buy

review/summary: Great Alternative
review/text: I was skeptical when I ordered these, but couldn't resist the opportunity of a lower cost alternative to K-cups.  When the box arrived, I ripped it open immediately and brewed my first cup.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that while it's a much lighter blend than I prefer, it was good coffee!  My husband is the light blend coffee drinker in the house, and he gives it his full approval.  I've moved on to the SF Bay French Roast. I'm now a happy Subscribe & Save customer of both blends.<br /><br />I have noticed more than one post concerned about the amount of coffee in these OneCups as compared to a typical K-cup.  While I haven't gone as far as actually measuring, I will note that the bottom half of all K-cups is in fact empty space.  The filter and foil top construction of a standard K-cup looks nearly identical to the SF Bay OneCups.  The SF Bay OneCups have simply eliminated the plastic "cup" part of the K-cup.  Yes, that plastic part is what keeps the coffee fresh.  This is easily resolved in the OneCups, as others have stated already, by storing the coffee in an airtight container or bag.

review/text: I was rather stunned when I received the SF Bay Rainforest Blend Coffee.  They are in a very different little packet than I was accustomed to with the regular Kerig type cups.  I decided to give it a try.  I really  like it.  You can, just like with the other type, run as much water through it as you want and thus make it as strong as you want.  I really see no difference in that part.  In addition, I really like the "flavor".  Try it -- you'll like it, I believe.

review/summary: Great Price, Great Taste, Great Company
review/text: We have been drinking this Rainforest Blend for a couple of weeks now and I personally enjoy this blend! My husband likes it, but it isn't his favorite. We have some good friends who come over to visit and the husband loves it so much he's going to start ordering it when he gets his Keurig back (a recent move has much of their belongings in storage temporarily). Taste is soooo subjective.<br /><br />Here's my take: I am not one who likes dark roasted coffees (they all taste "burnt" to me). This one is bold and strong without tasting burnt! I love that! I also don't like a bitterness in my coffee. I use very little sugar (about a half a teaspoon) and just enough cream to get a dark caramel color (like one - two of the little prepackaged liquid creamers). I want to taste the coffee, not my condiments. I enjoy that with this coffee blend!<br /><br />I'm ordering the Breakfast Blend now to find one that both me and my husband will like. We have generally liked the Breakfast Blend from most coffee makers. We want it to be bold enough without being an overly dark roasted bean.<br /><br />About the packaging. Their packaging is great, using less plastic with a filter for the casing. One thing my husband pointed out is with the whole bottom being the filter, the water really spreads throughout the whole "cup" instead of burrowing a path to the exit like most of the traditional kcups do. How smart!<br /><br />Another thing I am quite pleased with is their business practice for being good to the earth, fair to the growers, and making a difference with the community efforts in the lives of those people. That is awesome!<br /><br />I'm hooked on San Francisco Bay Coffee, now just working on finding the one blend that works for me and my husband.<br />Catherine

review/text: I have really come to love the San Francisco Bay Coffees. They have a great robust flavor, and their packaging is so unique, and so much nicer than the hard little plastic other K-cups. The way they are separated so you don't have the whole 36 cups exposed to air at one time getting stale is genius. Can't wait for new flavors to come out. Great price too.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee!
review/text: This is my every-morning coffee!  I really enjoy it.  I drink it black which is very strong.  Other people in my household did not care for how strong it was.  So just know you need to like a dark strong coffee to enjoy this one.  :)  enjoy!

review/summary: Great design, not so great flavor
review/text: I wanted to try something new and this is new alright. While I love and appreciate the design, the flavor is less than desirable. It's too bitter. I drink my coffee black and really enjoy a strong cup of dark roast, but after discovering I didn't care for the flavor, I tried to disguise it with the flavor of creamer I knew I'd like (coconut cream, yum) and still the flavor of the bitter coffee was just too much.

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/summary: Sugar free AND naturally-flavored? Naturally!
review/text: For those seeking sugar-free products without all of the chemical sweeteners like aspartame, this sugar-free Roasted Pecan Syrup from Blackberry Patch is a natural solution. A rich pecan flavor with hints of vanilla, this syrup is sweet without being cloying. The thick, slow pouring syrup offers a nice mouthfeel similar to that of "regular" pancake syrup, a nice switch from the watery, too-thin textures of some sugar-free products.<br /><br />A special bonus is the natural flavoring--no off tastes, no strange chemicals!<br /><br />It's important to note that the sweetener here is maltitol, a "sugar alcohol" that can, for some, create gastrointestinal discomfort in large amounts (20-30 grams/day). I don't have this experience (perhaps because I don't consume such large amounts), and I appreciate that maltitol is not carcinogenic... A little online research from credible sources may be useful if you're concerned about this issue.<br /><br />Blackberry Patch makes a number of delicious naturally-flavored sugar-free syrups; experiment and find your own favorite!

review/summary: "A full serving of vegetables in every bowl?"
review/text: haha OK, whatever you guys say.<br /><br />This stuff does make for a beautiful dish, the flavor is very pleasing<br />and I'm not going to argue the nutritional claims. It makes for an very<br />aesthetic dish, it also cost more than traditional pastas but if its worth<br />it to you to put this in front of your guests, by all means.<br /><br />Not happy with Ronzoni though because they had a Garden Delight Fettucini<br />that was also tri-color, but they made a change and now its brown. Yes,<br />brown pasta. Its hideous and I should take it back but I ate it, I just<br />closed my eyes and gulped it down. I liked the red and green stuff better.<br />Thankee.

review/summary: GREAT FOR COLD SALADS.
review/text: Cold pasta dishes need this splash of extra color and nutrients.<br />  I undercook the pasta a bit, cool it in the fridge, add a can of chilled tomatoes in sauce (the noodles absorb the extra liquid), a bit of mayo (but not much, as adding canned tomatoe), some onion, celery, real bacon bits and re-chill it...VOILA.<br /> If you don't have celery on hand it still tastes great, even with dehydrated onions it taste fine.  I may add grated cheese, chicken or tuna.

review/summary: Great Product, Great Value
review/text: These buttons were definitely what I was looking for.  Larks Candy/Amazon offered the best price/shipping combo out on the web at the time. The sugar was not super hard like some other sugar decorations I have tried. They were actually edible enough to where you didn't feel like you were biting on a "jaw-breaker".  The only complaint I have about these buttons were that the colors on the web are slightly misleading compared to the colors that I received.  The colors that I received were more neon or "hot" than the softer colors posted on the web.  The best part about them is even though I was a little unhappy with the colors they were still a big hit for the "Cute as a Button" themed baby shower that I got these for.

review/text: This product makes a great buttery topping for popcorn, without all the fat. We use a stovetop popper and Molly McButter (plus other spices), and our popcorn is a healthy snack with low calories and high fiber - and none of the scary chemicals found in microwave popping bags. Much cheaper, too!

review/summary: Yummy, addictive, can't just have one!
review/text: This has been a "corner store" staple for this Southsider of Chicago for years and years. As those years have passed, very few stores carry them. The lemonheads are a bit more popular, depending on where you live. I had to get some from a friend of mine way out in Riverdale at a gas station. Two boxes were not enough. The mix of sweet cherry flavor and slightly tart kick had me wanting more. I went to endless corner stores until something told me to come to Amazon. A simple song of praise is not enough to describe how INCREDIBLE these candies taste. If you open them, prepare to eat and suck and chew and want some more. Try to contain yourself because you might have to be strapped down to do so. I LOVE THIS CANDY!!!
