review/summary: Response to the 2-star review...
review/text: To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

review/summary: It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.
review/text: Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like "chicken" or "chicken meal" and  you do not want things like "meat byproduct."  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the "Holistic"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.

review/summary: For a dog with sensitivity to chicken...
review/text: Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is "bulkier," too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change.

review/summary: Great food for a dog with a sensitive stomach
review/text: My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!

review/summary: Best for my dog, K-9 first responders use this
review/text: I researched for the healthiest, least filler type food.  I live in the Washington, DC area where there are lots of police K-9 dog owners.  They recommend the Holistic.  It turns out that you can serve much less for the same amount of nutrition as all the other popular brands so 30lb. goes for two months for my 45 lb dog!  I keep ordering online from Amazon and my ordering records show an order every two months.  Shows up in two days delivered! The veterinarian always comments on my dog's healthy coat and leanness. I only wish it could be on the subscription feature so that it would automatically be ordered and worry free, but there are more important things in life to worry about, right!?

review/summary: Less meat in new formula
review/text: I've never used this product before, but had a coupon so thought it would be worth trying, I looked at their site and checked to make sure that the protein was still adequate (which was 28%), when I got to the store, they received new bags, which is now only 22% protein, which is not enough meat to grain ratio. Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from "itchy butt" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.

review/text: Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.

review/summary: Excellent Quality; my dogs LOVE it!
review/text: I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.

review/summary: Works for My Dog and Me and Try Their New Treats
review/text: My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods. After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or "like" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>. The treats I bought are not yet offered on amazon. They are called Holistic Select Wheat Free Holistix with Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples & Blueberries Natural Biscuits for Dogs. They are easy to break in half for using as rewards.

review/summary: Has solved our dog's alergy and GI tract problems 100%
review/text: Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and "prescription" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it.<br /><br />Then researched Eagle Pack and moved him onto this as it was heavily fed by Northern dog racers with similar breeds to ours.<br />"Eagle Pack" was prior brand name before it changed over to "Holistic Select" - but same product.<br /><br />GI issues went away, and our troubled-eater, barfer, bloody-diarrhea pooch is now healthy, happy, and has a great appetite and energy. Yes, it is more expensive, but if you compare the ingredients they are top notch.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this dry food for solving these issues. My review applies specifically to the Anchovy/Sardine/Salmon recipe.

I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.

review/summary: Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS
review/text: We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.

review/summary: Super for my Shiba
review/text: My little Shiba just can't handle chicken or grain byproducts. I love the ingredients, I love that my dog is enthusiastic about the food and I love that I can buy it on Amazon.com and have it delivered.<br /><br />The tiny kibble is great for smaller mouths but is on the harder side when it comes to dry. I have used pro-plan in the past and notice the shredded mix has much softer/grainy kibble. I sometimes moisten the food with a little bit of pet-friendly topping.<br /><br />The mix is nutrient and calorie dense. You may have to tweak your volume, depending on what you're switching from.

review/summary: Breeder recommends but dog rejects
review/text: We have a corgi and this kibble is one of the only two things that the breeder recommended. Unfortunately our dog does not like this food. He would NEVER eat a pellet on its own. We always have to mix it with real food and even then he sometimes refuses to eat it. On top of that none of the pet shops in our area carry this food so overall big PITA.<br /><br />We are still ordering from Amazon but looking for an alternative.

review/text: Ingredients and reviews look good. However, this is the first time I've ever found mold in my dog food. I have a specific container that I put my dog food in so it doesn't get any moisture. It's even air tight. This could be the best dog food out there, but if the quality control is bad, I won't be buying it. I'll add pictures of the mold or whatever is growing on the dog food.

review/summary: Very Pleased
review/text: I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years, and I have been very pleased!  Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from "chronic" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!  I would recommend this dog food to anyone!

This is the first food in her 4years that I have been able to keep her on for more then a couple months.  I buy the large bag and have two dogs that it will feed for almost a month before needing more and both my dogs look and feel healthy and happy. No more chewing paws or stratching like crazy.  Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product. Best thing I've done for my dogs outside of rescuing them :)

review/summary: Content means less than names
review/text: I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, "Holistic",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or "natural" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?

Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.

review/summary: Great product. some squishing in shipping.
review/text: This is one of those things that comes along every so often that you wonder how you managed without. I hate having to go back to peanut butter and a spoon because its messy and takes three times as long. I can stretch these to last longer if I have to by flattening them and rolling the pill into a third of a pocket (I have 3 dogs).  The dogs love them. Even the one that manages to always extract the pill and spit it out behind the sofa loves them. No more finding half dissolved pills in the carpet.<br /><br />UPDATE: June 20, 2009<br />The first shipment I had problems with, detailed below. Subsequent orders did not have the same problem so I'm guessing one slightly problematic order out of three isn't bad at all. The other two orders have been perfect.  It is my guess that the first order was damaged by the shipping company and left in too hot an area here in Tucson, and not a reflection on the product or store. I conducted a test and left one of the packages in a hot cupboard. I'll know the result in a few weeks.<br />END<br /><br />The only issue I had was five out of the six packages had been squished enough during shipping that the pillpockets all crumbled or were flattened.  This is how I got the idea to stretch them out in the first place so its not at all a bad thing. I can't quite figure how they got so squished because there was no damage to the box and the packages are a big air bubble.  I'll try another order and see if I get the same results.<br /><br />Don't pass this by. This is the best price I've found on these.  The local Petco sells them for $14. I can buy online with shipping for less. This deal makes it all that much cheaper.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: Pill pockets are wonderful for giving dogs their daily medicines, especially distasteful ones.  I have tried everything from cheese and meat to coating pills with soft dog treats, but pill pockets are the best!  They are flexible and easy to get around a pill.  I buy the large ones and can use one pill pocket to coat the medications for 4 dogs.  And my dogs love them and don't know they are getting pills or medications at all.  If your dog is finicky, then give a tiny piece of pill pocket, followed quickly by the coated pill, followed by a tiny piece of pill pocket, along with excited treat comments, and the dog will just swallow and not chew, thus not knowing they just took their pill.  Great for old dogs on daily distasteful glucosamine pills.

review/summary: Great product, but do your math to find the right size/volume for you!
review/text: First, Pill Pockets are a GREAT product that really works... before Pill Pockets, I only had a 50% success rate getting our three dogs to take their pills when we used hotdogs and even steak leftovers. With Pill Pockets, the pill always goes "down"! [Note: DON'T waste your money buying Pill Pockets for cats if you have dogs. I read a review (listed under another seller) that stated that it was more economical to buy the PillPockets for cats because you receive 45 instead of 35. Well, the reviewer failed to notice that the Pill Pockets for Cats only weighs 1.8 ounces, and the Pill Pockets (Small bag) for Dogs weighs 3.5 ounces!]<br /><br />Buy the bag that, per ounce, is the least money. The Pill Pockets are like Beef Playdoh, and are easy to tear in half (we tear each one in half and wrap 1/2 around the dog's medication). Do a little research, and you'll save money. BTW, the multi-bag deals online at Amazon are not necessarily a good deal, be sure to divide the total cost by the number of bags you receive to see if you're saving $$.<br /><br />NOTE: The size listed on the Pill Pocket's bag indicates the size of the pill pocket, not the dog. Large meds require larger Pill Pockets; small meds like phenobarbital require only the small or a piece of a large pill pocket. These things are great, and go down my dogs easily.

review/summary: Veterinary approved...
review/text: As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those "duh" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of "treat."  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it "makes pills a treat to give!"<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger "capsule" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help.

review/summary: Use a little planning & get 2 or even 3 pills in a single pocket!
review/text: These pill pockets are the perfect answer for my dog! She hates pills or capsules. And at over 65 pounds, my gentle giant's jaw muscles are stronger than my hands when it comes to trying to open her mouth the way the vet showed me. So I have been using the large pill pockets for over a year now. They are not cheap when you are giving your dog up to 3 capsules twice a day though. But I found that I can actually manage to get one single pocket to work for 3 capsules! What I do is to first place a single capsule in the hole of the pocket. No big secret there! But the I just sort of press the other two capsules on opposite sides of the OUTSIDE of the pocket They stick to the very malleable pocket quite easily. And then I just sort of pull the soft pocket sides around the ends of the outside capsules to even better secure them. You may or may not need to work at concealing the capsules with the pocket material. I find that my dog never even stops to taste the pocekts. She loves these meaty looking and smelling and tasting pockets and sits at my feet drooling while waiting for me to get the 3 capsules positioned as I want them. And when I give her the very poorly concealed capsule/pill pocket combo, she just gulps the thing down without really even trying to bite it or chew it. So I suggest that you give these pockets and this method a try if you have to give your pet more than a single pill or capsule at the time. Oh, and I have even used the smaller pill pockets with these same 3 very average size capsules and I find that I can accomplish the same thing, though it takes more effort on my part to "conceal" the capsules. But again, remember that the pills/capsules probably don't have to be anywhere close to completely hidden...at least that is the case for my dog.

review/text: This is a great buy compared to buying the same product from a local pet store.  My only reason for not rating it a "5" is that the pockets do not seem to be well formed.  It's almost as if the manufacturer got all the partial pockets together to make a "seconds" product line.

review/text: Our elderly dog always took his pills well.  Several months ago he stopped taking them.  No matter what I put on the pill (cheese, bread, jelly, anything!) it was a struggle...and he takes several pills a day which are very important to him. I decided to try the pill pockets.  Frankly, our two previous dogs didn't care for pill pockets but our dear 16 year old dog looks forward to getting his pills now.  He loves the pill pockets!

He chews everything over and over and over again so if I put a pill in here it will break apart and he will spit the whole thing out. I bought some of these pill pockets (chicken flavor) and he enjoys them as a snack, but I can't put the pills in here

review/summary: Fabulous product at a great price!
review/text: I use these pill pockets for my dog who has to take 7 pills in the morning and 5 at night.  Rather than trying to hide them in food or shove them all separately down his throat, I stuff all the pills into the pocket, seal the end over and give it to him.  He gobbles them down like a treat.  When he was really sick a few months ago, he would not eat them on his own, but they were still a life-saver as I would just stuff the pills inside and shove the entire pocket down his throat (he's a big dog). The pockets are very soft and moldable so you can shape them and squish them into any shape you want to accommodate the pills/capsules.  I use the capsule-sized pockets so I can fit a bunch of pills into them. Also, the pet stores charge $10 for each bag, and these end up at about $5.50 per bag.  For a dog that will have to take pills for the rest of his life, that saves me a lot of money over buying them at a retail store. I would highly recommend this product for dogs who need multiple pills daily, and even for dogs who won't eat them because they are so soft they are easy to shove down the throat if need be. The review says they were $54 but they were only $34.

review/summary: These are great and convenient!
review/text: I have a very old dog that was having trouble with my usual method of administering pills, peanut butter on a spoon.  As she has aged she has become less interested in food, and some of the tricks like PB I use with the younger dogs seem not to work as well.  These are great, I keep them right beside her pill bottle and she swallows them with no problem. The design seems to make it more difficult for her to separate the food from the pill as often happens with cheese or meat.  Although, a tricky dog may still do it so don't hold that out as a scientific claim.<br /><br />Some of what you are paying for is convenience, and a piece of cheese or other soft treat probably work just as well if your dogs eat anything in sight.

review/summary: Best Price & Best Way to Medicate a Smart Dog!
review/text: These are a life-saver for us, as we have a sweet, neurotic and super-picky BC who needs medication twice a day. She is so OCD & nervous, she won't take any treat from a stranger, turns up her nose frequently at new kinds of treats at home and wants nothing to do with the free goodies they give out in pet stores; our other dog LOVES it because he's always getting double! Before finding Pill Pockets, it was miserable for all involved to have to try tricking her, or eventually have to end feeding by shoving the pill down her throat after she'd eaten everything else around it, leaving it punctured & essentially wasted in her bowl, or spit out on the ground after having tasted the powder inside as she ate the rest of her food or whatever it was 'hiding' in. Since our dogs aren't given "people food" as a rule, shoving pills into cheap & preservative-filled meats like sausage or hot dogs wasn't an option for us. We tried hiding capsules/pills in everything from expensive cheese to steak, even mixing the medication in with her food and coating it in fish oil, only to end up time after time watching over her bowl until she was totally finished eating; wasting a whole lot of our time, expensive pills & her trust about what was going to be hiding in her bowl each day.<br /><br />But, she LOVES these, gobbling down her pill before she even starts with the rest of her food, and the really cool thing with the Large Beef pockets is you can actually cut them in half and still easily conceal a regular sized human capsule or pill(she gets a medication that is also used for people). While it's great to have something that works, buying the Pill Pockets at the pet store was getting really expensive & they only come in 25-30 pocket packs; we couldn't find any store that would give a case/quantity discount & had issues with ordering from the bigger pet specialty websites, even though they were cheaper. We'd even started using one half pocket in the A.M. & one in the P.M. to make a pack last longer, but after finding them for far less per pack on Amazon & still cutting them in half, now we get even more bang for our buck! Pill Pockets are frequently sold in retail/pet stores in our area for up to $10.99 per L-sized bag. They make smaller sizes and different flavors, but over the years we have learned that the L Beef pockets are the easiest to work with, are more moist & shape better around whatever pill is being given than the other flavor/ingredient combinations, particularly chicken. They are also available for cats, dogs, limited ingredient diets, etc. So, save yourself time, money & daily feeding hassle by getting a six-pack of these & maybe even set them up on the auto-ship program so you don't run out. We recommend these to all our friends!

The pill pockets have turned this into a treat time for her, she loves getting them and scarfs them right down without investigating what's smushed inside! It's such a relief to not have the struggle of shoving all those pills into her mouth.<br /><br />The other great thing about these soft pill pockets is that they can easily be formed around multiple pills if you have many to give at one time, or split to stretch the pack for any smaller pills. This particular set is also much less expensive than what could be found at my local pet stores.

review/text: My cocker is having liver issues and has to take a lot of prescriptions. I was using cheese around her pills but she caught onto that quick and wouldn't eat the cheese or the pills. I was having to put each pill down her throat which we both hated.<br /><br /> I had never heard of the Pill Pockets but when I had her at UT vet. school they used the Pill Pockets and that was six months ago. She still loves the taste and I have had no trouble getting her to take any of her pills. She has quite a lot of prescriptions but can't eat them fast enough as long as I have a piece of the pill pocket around the pills.  I am thrilled I don't have to put her pills down her throat twice a day.<br /><br />The product is soft and you can pull a piece of the Pill Pocket off and just use as much as you need to cover each pill or put two or three pills in each piece of a Pill Pocket. It is a five star produce as far as I am concerned. I found it was much cheaper ordering the Pill Pockets from Amazon, as well as many other medications I need for my cocker.

review/text: These Pill Pockets are such a great, and simple, invention! My dog takes multiple pills everyday and is very picky about what he eats. Cheese used to work, but he learned pills were involved and can longer be tricked with the cheese. We were driven to the point of forcing the pills down his throat, which wasn't fun for dog or owner. Since getting the Pill Pockets, medicating him is no longer a task. He enjoys the flavor and takes his pills without problems. They are a little pricey, but if you buy them through Amazon you'll save a lot of money. The cost is well worth the results that you receive with these Pill Pockets. Great product that does exactly what it claims!

review/summary: save yourself the headache, buy these!
review/text: My dog loves these things. I was having difficulty getting her to take her medicine in cuts of meat, cheese, peanut butter. She'd eat the good stuff and spit out the pill! Plus my vet told me that cheese and peanut butter are really not great for dogs anyway, the fat content is not good for their tummies. These pill pockets are great, definitely one of those inventions that make you think "why didn't I think of that?" Lola just loves these things, no more problems getting her to take her pills. She wags her tail when she sees I've got one for her. Little does she know she's also taking her medicine. Ha! Take that. Owners and dogs both win on this one. This is a really good deal for them as well, I pay almost $14 for a single bag at petsmart, 6 bags for just over double that? Score!

review/summary: Pill Pocket equals medicine magic!
review/text: I've used Pill Pockets to help medicate our cocker spaniel for several years.  It makes giving pills to Maggie so much easier and more pleasant.  She gets at least 12 to 15 pills per day so this has made life much easier than the alternative...poking pills down her throat. She actually enjoys pill time now. She's happy-we're happy.  WIN-WIN!

review/summary: Pill Pockets are Perfect
review/text: When I started using these my dog had become wise to just about every other trick (cheese, hot dogs, peanut butter, etc.) and did not cooperate when I opened her mouth and shoved the medication down.<br /><br />These were a lifesaver.  She now follows me to where I keep them and eagerly awaits her 'treat'.  You can't imagine her delight when she gets 3 at once!<br /><br />I buy them from Entirely Pets via Amazon and they get here the next day.  I love it!

review/summary: Makes giving pills a TREAT!
review/text: These pill pockets are amazing.  My two dogs must have medication every day, and I always dreaded trying to give it to them.  However, with these pill pockets, my dogs practically have a fit waiting for me to put their meds in so they can have their "treats"!  I have used the chicken before, but they really go after the beef.  Both are great.  The price is small compared to the retail stores.  I just would not be able to purchase them if it were not through Amazon.  Thanks so much for offering these.

review/text: We have 4 dogs that all take some sort of medicine.  We have used these for years and the dogs LOVE them.  We used to try every possible option from bread and cheese to peanut butter.  This is MUCH easier, less messy and the dogs do not even try to get pills out.  They love them and makes giving their meds very easy!

review/summary: Soooo much easier, but I prefer the beer flavor
review/text: These are great.  I buy them by the six pack for my two miniature schnauzers to give supplements for skin issues.  One of them got smart to the pills, so I act like I am waiting to give him another treat, and he wolfs it right down.  I do like the texture of the beef more than the chicken. The chicken flavor has an oily feel to it that I don't like on my hands.

review/summary: GREAT product
review/text: I have used pill pockets for several years now. I am a pet sitter and have 4 dogs of my own, so there is always medicine to be given. I used to have to push a pill down my dogs throat. Now, they think they are getting a treat. They are :0) :0) Amazon is the best price I have found and even better because I get free shipping.

review/text: This product is worth every penny. My boxer now takes his medications with no problem. I bought the large pill pockets and had to also give my Boston Terrier some smaller pills so I just cut the large ones in half and he took his pills with no problem. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

review/summary: Great time saver dispensing pet medications
review/text: Tired of stuffing medications down your pet's throat, especially dogs?  These beef pill pockets are a tasty dog treat into which you insert the pill medications and they are readily "wolfed down" by the pooch.  Our Golden Retriever, who gets several medication a day for certin ailments, gladly takes the pill pockets (with pills inside)- end of story.  Simple, clean and fast.  I just wish grooming her was that simple...:)

review/summary: Great Price
review/text: I have two small dogs that both require medicating 3 times a day.  This product is a life saver.  They stand at the counter and bark to remind me when it is time for their medicine.  The pill pockets are pricey, but at Amazon you can save a bundle compared to buying them at the vet's office.  If you opt for standard shipping, plan on a good week's time for your order to arrive.

review/summary: Great for my old, spoiled dog
review/text: My elderly (soon-to-be 17) beagle is super picky about what he eats.  Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound. Being older, he requires multiple medications multiple times a day.  He refuses to eat peanut butter (which I used in the past to give him his medications) due to the undesirable texture that makes it difficult for him to handle and swallow.  The soft, moist texture of the pill pockets allows me to smash it into the ball of medications so that Dakota is not able to separate the unwanted medications from the tasty pill pockets and spit out the meds -- like he has done with other similar items.  The large size allows me to administer multiple medications per pill pocket.  Being a picky eater, Dakota will occasionally refuse the med-filled pill pocket, but that's usually when he's not feeling well and won't eat anything anyway.  I assume he likes the taste since he'll more often than not voluntarily eat the pill pocket; however, he doesn't seem to voraciously eat the pill-filled pockets like he does with other treats that he really likes.
