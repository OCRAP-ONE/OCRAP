review/text: I was so excited to receive the box of cookies.  Shortbreads are my favorite and I love to use them in gift baskets.  I was shocked and horrified when I opened the box and 99% of the cookies were broken.  Cookies taste good, packaging is horrible.  Major disappointment.  I took pics and sent them to Amazon along with a letter stating what had happened. However, I never heard back from them.

review/text: I associate Kraft Caramels with Autumn:  going back to school, days getting shorter, the approach of Halloween and Thanksgiving.  My mom used to make caramel apples in the fall and it was a REAL treat to come home from school and find those waiting for us!  They were a staple in our Halloween bowl for handouts too.  Lots of good memories packed into those little bites of caramel!

review/text: For some time now, I've wanted to re-live my childhood with some Kraft Caramels.  They were my favorite when I was a kid.  I couldn't find them in stores anymore, but found them online through Amazon.  Although they're not quite as good as I remember them, they're still great!  The difference may just be due to a faulty 40-year old memory.  My purchase went smoothly, and I am very happy with the experience.

review/summary: convenient & economical, easy to store
review/text: This product has made it so easy to feed my dogs a wholesome raw diet. it is great to not have to buy and puree a whole bunch of fruits and vegetables and supplements to add to my protein source.  I use it a little differently than the directions, mixing up a blend of much more meat to the amount of SOJOs. I also simmer it a short time, but never strain it to get all the nutrition.  One of my dogs has trouble digesting the small pieces and it comes out whole on the other side.  It has much more powdery dust coming off it from the new calcium source, so I am careful about not breathing it in.  That is the only thing I find a little less pleasing.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.

review/summary: Excellent Taste (from a long-time Splenda user)
review/text: This review is provided in the context of Splenda use in my coffee and not as a sugar substitue in baking.<br /><br />I have to say I first thought the fiber angle was a gimmick.  While there is no doubt more fiber in your diet is good for you, do we really need it in a sweetner?  Well, I guess I will take it where I can get it, provided it is cost effective and does not alter the taste of my coffee from what I have become accustomed to with original Splenda.  This product does an excellent job in that regard.<br /><br />While we all interpret taste somewhat differently, I found Splenda with fiber to be an excellent substitute to Splenda without fiber in regard to taste.  In fact, I believe it taste better than the original, more akin to raw cane sugar in your coffee, which I like but you may not.  So, in short, I can increase my fiber intake while making my coffee taste better. The "sweetness ratio" is about the same- packet for packet.  So, if you are using 3 packets of original Splenda in your coffee, you will more likely than not (depending on individual taste), use the same number of packets with this product.  Currently, the price point is not too far off original Splenda so I find this alternative reasonable.  Not sure how it would work out in baking however.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Splenda Essentials with Fiber
review/text: I have used Splenda sweetener for years.  It is, I think, superior in taste.  I use the granuals for cereal and the powdered packets such as the Essentials for coffee everyday.  The thing I love best about this product is that it not only tastes good, but now it includes something that is good for you.  This particular version contains a gram of fiber.  Hey, nothing wrong with getting a little extra fiber in your diet.  The other thing that I like about this product, and it may sound kind of insignificant, which, I suppose it is, is that the packets are strong and flat.  Unlike some other sweetener packets which are in tissue-thin paper, these seem much thicker.  So what?  Well, this allows the packets to be stacked in a dispenser much nicer and evenly.  Plus, I'm certain that it helps keep the product fresher longer.

review/summary: Women 21-25, Men 30-38 grams!
review/text: That is the recommendation of the Mayo Clinic for the daily intake of fiber.  Sometimes the food with lots of fiber just is not to our liking.  High fiber food like split peas have 16.3 grams in a one cup serving, while food like a carrot have only 1.7 grams.  I have noticed that some bread has 0 grams.  The Dr. recommended I increase my fiber intake after my last colonoscopy.  So, I have been trying to be more aware of what I eat and make sure I come close to what I should get.  Splenda has been in our house for a long time as pre-diabetic conditions exist.  We use Splenda on cereal, in ice tea, coffee etc.  When you consider that each little pack contains one gram of fiber, well, you can see how it can add up on the daily total.  Like most other reviewers we were concerned if the taste of the Splenda would be effected---it is not!  Always have some concerns when trying something new.  Quite pleased with this product, especially with the extra kick of more fiber.

review/summary: Tastes exactly the same as the regular Splenda
review/text: The addition of extras in our regular foods has been around for ages - Vitamin D in our milk, more vitamins added to our dry cereal, fluoride to our toothpaste, and now fiber to our sweetener.<br /><br />I use Splenda every day in my coffee and iced tee, so I expected to be able to tell some difference between the regular stuff and this new version, but I can't. The flavor is exactly the same, it dissolves into hot and cold liquids the same.<br /><br />The only difference I can see is the packaging. The regular package is paper, this new package is foil-lined, making it a bit more difficult to shake the contents down, and more difficult to rip open. It's not a huge issue, but I really wish they'd used the regular paper packets instead of these new ones.<br /><br />If I was lacking fiber in my diet, these would be an easy way to add it back. Since I eat a ton of fiber anyway, I probably won't purchase these again. If the packaging and pricing was the same for both, then I'd seriously consider buying these over the regular Splenda, but with the added hassle of the foil-lined pack, I'll stick with the regular Splenda.

review/summary: Excellent sweetener, just like regular Splenda
review/text: Splenda with fiber is an excellent sweetener, if you're one who enjoys the taste of regular Splenda.  Side by side, they taste pretty much identical.  The sweetener dissolves completely in your coffee or tea, along with the fiber.  I'm guessing that it's the same kind of fiber as in Benefiber which dissolves completely in your beverages.  It's important to note, however, that this won't replace the need to take in additional sources of fiber.  It's only one gram.  However, if you drink a few cups of coffee or tea, or, like me, enjoy it mixed into cereal, it'll gradually add up.

review/summary: Much Better Texture
review/text: I only really use Splenda for sweetening cold beverages, such as iced tea or iced coffee, and very occaisonally for hot beverages. I've used the "regular" powder kind you find in coffeeshops, restaurants, etc. for years, and been more or less happy with it. This version, with the added fiber, has a bigger grain to it, and for whatever reason, seems to disolve better in my iced drinks. I haven't done a side by side comparison, but my guess is that the lighter powder version tends to hit the surface and start disolving immediately, creating a kind of fizzy film on the top of the drink that takes very vigorous stirring to blend. This heavier version with the fiber seems to sink before the dissolving really kicks in, which means less of that sweetener scum/foam at the top of the drink. And it may be purely psychological, but I think it tastes more like cane sugar. That may just be due to the chunkier appearance, but, whatever, I'll take it. Good stuff!

review/summary: Tastes the SAME as regular SPLENDA, just BETTER for you ...
review/text: I am a HUGE FAN of Splenda.  I have been using it for years.  Many years ago, I used to ONLY use sugar (and a lot of it).  I have a real sweet tooth.  Anyway, I tried the pink and blue packet artificial sweeteners and did not like the weird after taste they left.  Once I tried Splenda, I was hooked.  I gradually weaned myself off of sugar and only use Splenda (and Jay Robb spoonable granulated Stevia).  I REALLY like Splenda to sweeten my tea and oatmeal.<br /><br />When I saw the SPLENDA ESSENTIALS (basically Splenda with a BONUS, something good for you ... fiber, antioxidents or B vitamins), I decided to try ALL of them.  I really like the SPLENDA ESSENTIALS.  They all taste the same to me ... the same as regular SPLENDA.  The ONLY difference I noticed is the packaging.  It is not that THIN, yellow packaging.  It is a thicker (almost like a wet-n-dri wipe) package.  Other than that, I wouldn't have even noticed a difference.  I now use all three of the different SPLENDA ESSENTIALS (fiber, B vitamins and Antioxidents) to sweeten my tea so I can get the nutritional benefits of all three.

review/summary: Every little bit of fiber helps
review/text: If you're not familiar with Splenda, it's a very sweet sugar substitute.  It tastes very much like sugar, but the main ingredient doesn't break down in your digestive system.  Therefore, it's zero calories.  I've been using Splenda for years, and love it.  They started adding fiber, and vitamins to the product.  I say, why not?  I know it isn't much fiber, but many of us don't get enough, so every little bit helps.  The most important thing is that the taste has not changed.  When they first starting adding fiber to the product, it sometimes clumped up in the single serve package.  But they must have changed something, because I haven't had that problem in a long time now.

review/text: I have used Splenda brand sweetener for as long as they've existed.<br /><br />I don't have a medical degree, so I won't address any issues around artificial sweeteners and health.<br /><br />This stuff works. It adds that same clear sweetness we've come to expect, but it is bound to a fibrous material.<br /><br />You get one entire gram of fiber in every packet. And there's the problem with the product.<br /><br />It no longer allows the manufacturer to put the product in paper only packaging. It is lined with some sort of metallic foil and then plastic (to keep the fiber from clumping or absorbing moisture).<br />.<br />This makes the packets really thick and a bit unwieldy.<br /><br />One star off for not putting them in those long tubes, which are easier to handle and tear. Otherwise, works.

review/summary: Tastes like regular Splenda
review/text: If you like Splenda, you will like this and you'll get fiber as a bonus. If you don't like Splenda, you won't like this.<br /><br />I stopped drinking sugary drinks over a year ago and it took a lot of sugar alternatives before I found one that I like (Stevia product). I tried all variations of Splenda (baking, too) and the tastebuds can't adapt to it. I had hoped I would like this since I'm now used to drinking sugar-free products. Unfortunately, I don't like the taste as it's exactly like regular Splenda.<br /><br />Good news is that if I use three packets of sugar sub -- I can use one of Splenda with fiber plus two of the Stevia I like. The Splenda doesn't dominate. I don't like the drink when it has more Splenda than Stevia. I haven't experienced any side effects.<br /><br />So if you don't like Splenda, but you want fiber -- you may be able to use this along with your favorite sugar substitute.

review/summary: Damp Sticky clumps in some packs
review/text: The Splenda Essentials with fiber came in individual foil lined package. It's a great concept getting fiber with sweetener with a cup of coffee or tea. I purchased this for my long backpacking trip because I tend to not eat healthy while traveling. Upon receiving the shipment, I immediately opened the box and dump everything into zip bags. That's when I realized a lot of the small packets were kind of glued together and many of them was solid like a piece of rock candy inside. Usually I would have alerted Amazon right away since Amazon customer service is always number one. However, since I was leaving for the trip, I just salvaged whatever I could for the trip.<br /><br />Aside from the product quality issue, this sweetener is actually not too bad. It dissolves when poured hot liquid over, or with a few stirs. (The ones that turned hard inside the packet would not dissolve). The taste it not bad neither. And the fiber IS there. Trust me. It works! However, unlike regular Splenda, it does not dissolve easily with cold liquid.<br /><br />If it were not for the quality issue, I would have given this a higher rating and purchase this regularly. Hopefully Splenda took note of all these comments (from other reviewers here as well) and improved upon their future products because it's a great idea that just needs better execution!

review/text: This new Splenda with fiber is a great thing.  It tastes just like Splenda and doesn't change the texture of what you're drinking at all.  I add it to my morning coffee every day and add sweetness and fiber.  Always need more fiber.<br /><br />Only one down side to this.  If you're going to a coffee shop, wait to put the packets in your cup when you arrive.  I've noticed  that in my coffee cups, even if they have only a drop of water in them, will start to make the splenda with fiber start to make a gummy like paste.  It mixes in fine when adding more fluid, but it's kinda slimy looking.<br /><br />Also be prepared for  things to smell a little funky.  This is added fiber, works wonders for the insides, but not for the smell.

review/text: Overall would say that it is very much like regular Splenda with one main exception - does not dissolve as easily especially if trying to do so in 'shorter' drinks such as espresso, macchiato, etc.<br /><br />It will clump at the bottom of the drink and stick to the spoon instead of dissolving completely which effectively limits the usefulness of the product for me since that is primarily what we drink. I have yet to try it in cold applications such as iced tea, but would guess that it has similar problems.<br /><br />Unless you really, really need the fiber, I would just get the standard Splenda.

review/text: I don't know how much difference the added fiber actually made to my fiber intake; I didn't notice any dramatic changes in areas usually affected by increased fiber.  What I did notice was a tendency for the product to clump up in the little packets, something I haven't noticed in the plain Splenda.  I also noticed that if I open the packet and pour it into a hot beverage, there tends to be little crystally formations on the edge of the packaging; I assume this is product being affected by the heat of the drink and crystalizing, thus not actually going into the drink.

The foil-lined packet is slightly harder to tear open than the regular packets, but it's not a problem.  It is true that the Splenda inside is more clumpy than standard Splenda.  I'm withholding a star for this because, while this Splenda dissolves easily in liquids, it is not great for sprinklng on things like fresh berries. Too clumpy for that.

review/summary: Splenda + Fiber
review/text: As other reviewers have noted, the Splenda + Fiber tastes exactly the same as Splenda sans fiber.  It turns out, this preparation has been used commercially for a long time now (for example in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M09BTS">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Weight Control</a>) so its not exactly a new idea. Now, it's just available in little packets. The fiber is more or less a "bulking" agent and will slightly thicken the consistency of whatever food product you add this to. In terms of the flavor: it's exactly the same Splenda as before.  My own two cents: processed food manufacturers know headlines like "High Fiber", "No Trans Fat!" and "Low Calorie" sell their products. The "Fiber" line just looks like a way to seduce buyers at the supermarket.  But, hey, what do I know? Hopefully, nobody actually thinks this product is "healthy" because it adds 1g of fiber to your diet each day?  Unless of course you are going through 25+ packets a day....

review/text: I have used Splenda for years now every morning in my coffee...this kind with fiber seemed like a good idea.  I honestly cannot taste any difference between this fiber-added version and regular Splenda.  The only drawback would be the more expensive cost of the fiber Splenda...I use about 4 packets a day, so I only use 2 of the fiber packets and 2 regular, to save some money and to avoid getting just WAY too much fiber all at once!  (That can cause some digestive issues if you're not used to it).<br /><br />So go slow...don't go crazy if you're not used to a lot of fiber!  Your body will adjust, but don't go crazy and start by adding like 5 packets of these to your coffee all at once (that will not be a fun day!)  ;-)

After a while, you get used to it and save yourself 30 calories over using the comparable amount of sugar.  With this version of Splenda, you also get a gram of fiber without even noticing it.  These packets seem to be "industrial strength" which I assume will prevent the contents from caking due to moisture in the air.  A little harder to open but worth it to have a fresher product.  All in all- what's not to like?

review/summary: Great Sweetener, Even Better!
review/text: The best got even better with the addition of fiber.  The additional fiber is something that certainly can do nothing but help a diet, so I welcome this change to this product that I already use.  I think of it as the best artificial sweetener on the market.  I do not use sweetener often. but on cereal, it is the best.  Tastes like sugar to me.

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: I'm not a big fan of artificial sweeteners, but I have used Splenda before, and I prefer it to other artificial sweeteners. The taste of this version is indistinguishable from regular Splenda, which is awesome. That this version comes with just a little bit of extra fiber is kind of a side benefit, though the amount of fiber it comes with is fairly low....1 gram per pack. But, if you're someone who needs lots of fiber in their diet like me, any extra fiber is good and getting it this way is painless and easy.

review/text: this is just the same as the regular splenda as far as taste & there is no way you will ever know if the extra is really working or not. It is nice to have it in the little packets so it's fresh when you add it to your coffee or tea. I don't bake with splenda as everything I've tried with it goes flat when you use splenda instead of regular sugar, even if you use half regular sugar & half splenda.

review/text: Like many others, I've been making a conscious effort to eliminate as much sugar as possible. After trying quite a few sugar alternatives, I now solely use Splenda in coffee, tea or any other time I would have reached for sugar. The taste is good, sweet, but not overpowering, with no icky aftertaste.<br /><br />I don't notice much of a difference from the addition of fiber, but most of us don't get enough in our diet, so I'm happy about the addition.

review/summary: Great taste -- with one small caveat
review/text: I am a regular user of Splenda. It is one of the few sweeteners that does not give me a headache. This new Splenda Essentials with fiber tastes exactly like regular Splenda to me. There were only two differences I could find: one is that the packet is much thicker and slightly harder to tear and for some reason it seems more powdery and less granular than regular Splenda. Neither of these things is material in the slightest in my opinion.<br /><br />As noted there is a caveat: if you are a person who uses more than a couple packets of this per DAY then you are going to want to be careful with this product which has the fiber. Fiber is a good thing - but there is such a thing as too much -- which has an effect that you might not desire. I'm sure I don't have to spell it out but all of you who eat bran for breakfast, use a fiber product in your OJ, etc just want to note that this adds yet more fiber. So just take that into consideration -- and adjust accordingly. Make sure you drink plenty of water as well!

review/text: Not surprisingly, Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with Fiber, tastes just like regular Splenda. The packets have a little more weight to them and a tendency to cake more than the standard Splenda but they dissolve completely and blend right in to hot or cold foods and in baking. If you are looking for a way to add more fiber to your diet in an unobtrusive manner, this is a pretty good way. After all, getting fiber from your morning coffee, with no determinable change in taste or texture, is a good thing in my book.

review/text: Sarah Delany said, "Life is short, and it is up to you to make it sweet."<br /><br />You can make it sweet without the calories by using "Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener" 0 Calories, 0 Fat, 0 mg Sodium, 2g Total Carbs and 0g Protein. This product also packs 1 gram of fiber into each packet.<br /><br />The nice thing about Splenda is that you can use it in recipes that require high heat -- sucralose is heat stable up to 450�F (232 �C).<br /><br />I did this, using Splenda to replace one third of the sugar in a lemon bar recipe. This recipe -- Shortbread Lemon Bars (just google it -- it's near the top of the search results) -- called for nearly three cups of sugar counting the crust, filling and topping; too much for someone who is watching her sugar and carbohydrate intake. The lemon bars baked up beautifully and tasted scrumptious.<br /><br />My husband, who hates the taste of artificial sweeteners, liked these lemon bars and said he could barely perceive any artificial taste.<br /><br />I used this Splenda Sweetener in homemade lemonade by the glass, adding one packet to 2.5 cups of water and the juice of a small lemon. This was super. I also used a packet in a cup of hot tea with splendid results.<br /><br />The box states that it has 80 packets within. My box had 82 packets. I used 80 in the lemon bars, 1 in the lemonade and 1 in the tea. If you prefer a less labor-intensive afternoon than I had, standing at the counter opening 80 packets, Splenda is also available in a 1.2-pound bag.

review/summary: A new idea to boost sales maybe?
review/text: This new idea Splenda has come up with seems to be more of a gimic than anything else but I guess adding "B" Vitamins or Fiber can't hurt. I did notice a slightly different flavior in my morning coffee but not enough to be turned off by it. Now this new Splenda with added vitamins is packaged in a foil/paper wraper, this keeps it fresher and less likely to become stale or wet. I'll keep using Splenda but not sure if this one is worth spending more than the standard product. I have used the generic Splenda and have to say it's hard to taste the difference.<br /><br />* One other big point, the Packets are hard to open given the new foil liner, I wish they added a pull tab or at the very least score the edges so you have a starting point to help open each packet, who wants to fight with your Splenda before your first cup of coffee?

review/summary: Same as regular Splenda but with one gram of soluble corn fiber
review/text: This product is exactly the same as regular Splenda but one gram of soluble corn fiber  has been added to it, making the total volume much like that of a packet of sugar.  A gram is very small, 28+ to the ounce, and about the weight of a smallish paper clip.<br /><br />There is no RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) for fiber but 20-35g a day is a suggested minimum intake depending on age, gender, and the authority making the recommendation.  Soluble fiber is the kind that dissolves in water and which may help you feel full, regulate blood sugar, and lower blood cholesterol levels.<br /><br />The listed ingredients are soluble corn fiber, maltodextrin, and sucralose.  There is no information about whether the corn used is genetically modified or not.  The box does state that it is made of 100% recycled paper fiber with an average of 35% post-consumer waste.<br /><br />I think that if you use artificial sweeteners, this product is an easy way to help increase your intake of soluble fiber.  It dissolves completely and is not detectably different from regular Splenda when used in a beverage.

review/text: Splenda's attempts to add benefits, along with subtracting the negatives of added empty calories is a welcome idea.<br /><br />In this case, the addition of 1 gram, roughly 4% of an average's person's requirements for fiber, per measured packet, is a worthy attempt at adding to the diet value.<br /><br />While this sweetener additive is certainly not enough to drastically subtract a person's calorie intake or add fiber, it can be a part of a more healthy dietary lifestyle.<br /><br />For this reason, this Splenda product is heartily recommend.

review/text: Doing a low carb no carb type thing? Morning cream in your coffee adding unwanted carbs to your count?<br /><br />Well. Step right up friends. If you are eating a low carb diet then you are probably using heavy whipping cream for your coffee creamer. That's good stuff but it does add 1g carb per tbs. That is what makes Splenda with Fiber so dang excellent. You get net zero carbs per cup of coffee!<br /><br />That makes a big difference in your day if you are shooting for very low carb intake. So, not only do you make your morning joe neutral you also get fiber that you need anyway. Win-Win.<br /><br />I cannot tell any difference at all between this packet and a regular packet. Coffee taste exactly the same and I am real picky about the taste.<br /><br />It is expensive. I bought mine box at the local big box store which is a little less expensive that the current price at Amazon but not that much difference. Free shipping and always available more than makes up for the small price difference.<br /><br />Love it. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Splenda Essentials No Caloried Sweetener with Fiber
review/text: I've used Splenda for years, so I was eager to try this new Splenda.  The taste is fine.  In a single cup of tea I didn't notice any difference from regular Splenda.  However, when I used a teapot with my usual 3 cups  of water and 3 packets of Splenda, the tea wasn't as sweet.<br /><br />Didn't taste any difference on cereal.<br /><br />The individual packages can spill Splenda if not carefully opened.  The added fiber, (which is good), makes the serving size larger, and it's packed into a very tight package. It's sealed on three sides, rather than just the top and bottom.  There's no room to give it a shake and have an empty area to tear open.<br /><br />If you use it for single cup servings, I doubt that you would sense any difference from regular Splenda.<br /><br />If you feel you need more fiber, this is an easy way to get a little.

review/summary: Innovative benefits but obviously more expensive
review/text: This is an interesting new product from the makers of Splenda and quite frankly I'm surprised it took so long for this combination to come out on the market.<br />Splenda, in general, is used by many health fanatics to cut down on soluble sugar without sacrificing the sugar taste since it's made from actual sugar instead of aspartame or saccharine.  Add a gram of fiber to each packet since fiber is another critical ingredient to healthy living and ridiculously hard to come by (Often 1 gram per slice of bread and you should have 24 grams per day) if you're actually paying attention, and you have a recipe for good sense and taste.<br /><br />This product tastes the same as your usual Splenda and is highly soluble in hot beverages.  The thing I like about Splenda is that it is typically soluble in cold liquids as well, however you have to stir for a while for this to dissolve in cold beverages.  In fact, if you're drinking clear cold or translucent cold liquids, once you add the Splenda with fiber, you might think there is gunk and debris in your drink.  Since the packet contents looks just like Splenda with fine powdery sugar, I thought my drink was contaminated after I poured it in my iced tea, since random chunks appeared in my drink.  After about a minute or so, it finally dissolved and looked normal again.<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, if you like to throw packets of sweetener in your purse or pocket, the packaging for each serving is very durable.  The inner contents is lined with an almost foil so the light paper packing doesn't rip or tear accidentally.  This is handy if you carry your sweetener with you for travel purposes.  Overall, it's a healthy and convenient combination, especially if you're looking to add more fiber to your diet.  The only thing where the jury is out on, is if price point reflects the innovation since it is more expensive than standard Splenda.

review/summary: Sweet!
review/text: I am not sure how I feel about the whole idea of putting nutritional extras (Vitamin B, antioxidants, fiber) in Splenda.  I use artificial sweeteners to make things sweet.  However, I was curious how they would affect the taste, if at all.<br /><br />I am happy to report that this Splenda tastes great.  Normally I use the pink stuff in my coffee and iced tea, and I never found that one packet was as sweet as 2 teaspoons of sugar.  Splenda also says that one packet = 2 tsp., and in this case it's true.  My morning coffee was exceptional today.  The research is ongoing but at this point Splenda seems to be healthier than some of the other artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />On the down side, yeah, it's pretty expensive.  You can probably find other ways to get 1 gram of fiber pretty easily.  Also the individual packets are lined in foil.  If you are conscious of over-packaging this might make you crazy.<br /><br />In the final analysis this is a 4-star product.  Mainly, it does what it is supposed to - sweeten food and beverages.  The added fiber is just a little bonus.

review/summary: Would be great, but packets not sealed.
review/text: While quite expensive compared to sugar, I think this is the best artificial sweetener product out there. The sucralose used in this product is superior in taste to any other artificial sweetener, and does not appear to have any health issues. Sucralose is also very heat-resistant and therefore suitable for baking, though that is not such a factor in the small packet packaging in question here. Since the pure sucralose compound is like 600 times sweeter than sucrose sugar, the actual quantity needed to sweeten a cup of coffee is almost microscopic; therefore it makes a great deal of sense for Splenda to add soluble fiber to bring up the bulk to a more normal and convenient-to-handle level. And of course the fiber is good for you. This product, though sorta powdery, sinks below the surface instantly and dissolves quickly even in cold water if you stir it a bit. It's great stuff.<br /><br />Now,the big problem I have found with this product is in the packaging. About a third of the packets in the box I have are not perfectly sealed along one edge. All in the same location on the same edge. I "suppose" the product (being non-nutritive) would not become infested with bacteria or bugs... I "suppose" nobody put poison into the packets... but out of principle I ended up throwing all those unsealed packets away. This is probably a freak short-term problem, but Splenda better get their packaging act together if they don't want to ruin the reputation of an otherwise fine product.

review/text: I wondered if there would be a big difference between regular Splenda and Splenda with Fiber.  I tried Splenda with Fiber in both hot and cold beverages.  It dissolved just fine in both.  There was no difference in taste.  The package is slightly larger and a little heaver.  The fiber appears to be from corn so should not cause any problems.  One gram of fiber is not a lot so unless you use a lot of Splenda you will not get that much of a fiber boost but will get some.  All in all I liked the product.  I did not like the price but hopefully that will come down.

review/text: Splenda has been my go-to sweetener for quite a while, so the premise of added fiber worked for me. I was just concerned that Splenda Essentials would lend a chalky taste to my drinks, but my worrying was for naught. I used one packet in my afternoon cup of hot tea and found it to do just what I wanted: sweeten it! The taste was no different than using regular Splenda. It worked well in my iced tea, too.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, it's not really a cost-effective way of getting more fiber into your diet -- but if you're on the go and want to "multi-task," so to speak, I'd recommend these little babies. I've already slipped a few in my purse.

review/text: Splenda, an excellent sweetener, now has a version containing fiber. That's right: fiber. Does a sweetener NEED fiber? That's the $64,000 question. It's just as sweet with or without the fiber, so why add a new line? Why not just put fiber into regular Splenda? In other words,  this seems like an unnecessary line extension. But if you wish extra fiber on your bran flakes, I guess it can't hurt. I just can't see the point, and neither, I'm afraid will many other consumers.

review/summary: Taste Good, But Misleading Marketing
review/text: Focusing on taste/texture alone, I'll have to say Splenda Essentials with fiber is pretty good. It doesn't have the aftertaste that many other artificial sweeteners do. From that point of view, it's a very pleasing sugar substitute.<br /><br />What irks me is the way they package this chemical, artificial product. The box makes it appear that you're getting a healthy alternative to sugar. The name alone, Splenda Essentials, makes it seem like it's a product you NEED to have a healthy diet. Then, instead of stating what it IS, a chemical, artificial sweetener, it says 'no calorie sweetener'. Still sounds healthy, right? The ingredient list even fits what a lot of people consider healthy - just three ingredients - Soluable corn fiber, maltodextrin, sucralose. Diabetics, primarily, do well to give up grains entirely. SO why use a product when the first two ingredisnts are grain derived?<br /><br />Here's what maltodextrin is: a polysaccharide that is used as a food additive. It is produced from starch by partial hydrolysis and is usually found as a creamy-white hygroscopic spraydried powder. Maltodextrin is easily digestible, being absorbed as rapidly as glucose, and might be either moderately sweet or almost flavorless. It is commonly used for the production of natural sodas and candy. It can also be found as an ingredient in a variety of other processed foods.<br /><br />In further research, I found that CORN SYRUP is being relabeled as, yes, soluable corn fiber. What's the point of using an artificial sweetener that's touted as healthy, yet contains a product that's worse than sugar? Very messed up, indeed!<br /><br />Why did I give it 3 stars instead of 1? Because it DOES taste good. I'll give it that. Also, with a type 1 diabetic in the house, we do use an occasional artificial sweetener. We all hate fake tasting ones, so I think it deserves a 'like' for flavor. That said, it gets a big fat 0 for misleading marketing and labeling.

review/summary: Excellent Stocking Stuffer
review/text: This is the perfect stocking stuffer for the type of person who has a little bit of everything (or for someone who is into Anime, comics, Japanese culture, etc).  The boxes are pretty tiny (and I actually individually wrapped them to put them into a stocking this past Christmas) but the taste is great.  As with most bubble gum the taste is short-lived, but what do you expect.  Kids will love this, even the big ones.

review/summary: the worst of the three
review/text: I bought these, and while I'm glad I tried them, I wouldn't ever buy them again.<br /><br />I'm serious about my bacon, and I've tried all three of the available maple bacon lollipops: Man Bait, Lollyphile, and Roni Sue, and of the three these are the last ones you should buy. They're tiny, taste nasty (both of the other two brands are delicious), and it's clear as to why they're the cheapest option. Google Roni Sue, a small company out of New York that infuses their maple bacon lollipops with tea, or Lollyphile, who makes giant lollipops that taste like maple and bacon. Both of them are more expensive, but real bacon freaks will be glad they went with quality.

review/text: I ordered these as a funny treat for my bacon loving friend.  Was thrilled when they came so fast I couldn't believe it.  Then I counted and found I had gotten three extras.  I was sure there was a mistake but was told that the company always sends an extra or two as a bonus treat.  I immediately ate the salty caramel,  It was good.  The bacon lollies will have to wait till Christmas, but there was a fight over who got the orange pomegranate and the lemon ginger.  Good lollies, good service and who doesn't like something for free???

For 50 cents and 2 dollars to ship, I really expected a little bigger than what I received. I don't think it's worth the total 2 bucks to ship this but I do appreciate the extra flavor I got.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: I like bacon dipped in maple syrup and thought that these might be a great way to get that flavor without all the calories and fat.  However, they taste nothing like bacon.  More like the smoke flavoring used in curing bacon.  OK when they are in your mouth, but if you take it out and smell it then it is like smelling the bottom of a beef jerky bag.  Also, tried the company's caramel and salt ones and I think they are great.  I guess it is just probably a matter of taste.

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty!
review/text: I bought these after seeing them reviewed on an episode of "Brad Tries" on thatguywiththeglasses.com. I got a few thinking I could try one and give the rest out to people for laughs if I hated them, but... these are REALLY GOOD.<br /><br />I would say they taste like butterscotch with a faintly salty/smokey/bacony undertone. It's not at all unpleasant, the balance of sweet and salty is perfect. If you like butterscotch or Werther's hard candies, you'll almost certainly like these. It says they're made with real bits of bacon... true, but the bits are so tiny they don't make the texture so rough that it slices up your mouth or anything like some hard candies do, and they're not... hard. They don't create weird jagged edges or anything.<br /><br />Basically... as "weird" as this product is, it's surprisingly satisfying if you're a fan of more savory treats and that sweet/salty combo you get in caramels and butterscotches and even some types of yoghurt pretzels I've tried. I'm DEFINITELY ordering more of these just to keep around since I haven't managed to find anywhere I can buy them in stores where I live. I absolutely recommend that you at least give this product a try. Whoever figured this recipe out gets a five star rating from me for taking something that SHOULD be nasty as heck and making it unexpectedly awesome!

review/summary: Good Cold Shipping by Amazon
review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

I love its silvery sheen mixed in with the green, with its dangling, delicate looking shoots. I've missed having one.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to order from this seller again. The only thing I would suggest is sending a little cheat sheet on the care of the plant (though instructions are detailed on this page, above). I started to fluff up the plant & tried to find vines I could drape over the edge of pot, however I decided that was not a good idea. Better to let the plant take its own course!

They pack plants so carefully. I love the exotic plants they have. I have ordered seven this month. I am surprised that the plants come looking as pictured.Hills Gardens is the place to buy. Sincerely, Wanda , Waskom, Texas.

review/summary: More than I expected
review/text: I ordered a 6 inch rosary vine.  The plant store I used to get them from is no longer in business here, and neither one of our huge nurseries can order them.  I looked at this site, they looked like decent plants, and when I received mine it was healthy, packed very carefully, and a very nice specimen!!  The only negative comment I have is that it took awhile for the hanger itself to straighten out-big deal.  Had it been really bent, I would have repotted it and tried to find another way to hang this plant.  I didn't need to.  After hanging a little over a month in my kitchen, my plant has almost doubled in size and looks great.  I might be ordering another one pretty soon.  I also liked the price!  It was less expensive than the plant store that was here would charge.  It also arrived much quicker than I expected!

review/summary: Rosary Vine Purchase
review/text: I was wondering how a plant would ship. The shipping time could not have been quicker. The plant arrived intact. I was disappointed that it was not as full as pictured. I am sure it will eventually grow into a nice plant. It is like seeing a Burger King advertisment for a Whopper on TV. When you get it, it is not quite like it was pictured.

review/summary: Very Healthy Plant!
review/text: I recently purchased this Rosary Vine and had it shipped to Illinois from their greenhouses in Ohio.  The plant has grown significantly since I received it and was very surprised to have it blooming..  The plant is much large and in tremendous health..  It has probably grown a few feet since I purchased it.  The vines are very full with many shoots and flowers.<br /><br />Great specimen for the species, wish I could take the credit for growing it up to this point..  Now to show it off!

review/summary: I love this sauce
review/text: I use this sauce instead of soy sauce in various dishes.  I also use it to dip potstickers I get from Trader Joe's.  It has a good, but not overwhelmingly, garlic taste.  I haven't been able to find this in my grocery store in awhile, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.

review/summary: Delicious.
review/text: I don't know what possessed me to buy this; I think I was just tired of drinking water.<br />So I bought it, and.....I like it.<br />It mixes instantly without leaving any nasty clumps.<br />It tastes just like orange. Maybe a tad tangier but it's still good.<br />I recommend throwing in a shot of vodka with a little diet Mt. Dew for a little extra fizz.<br />Double yummy, just don't do this when you're at work lol.<br />Orange Crystal Light comes....<br />Recommended

review/summary: orange juice substitute for diabetics
review/text: This makes sugar free orange drink with 100% of vitamin C. I used to get it in grocery already made in bottles. It wasn't bad at all. Then I couldn't get it anymore since most people buy real orange juice. I got the powder, then even that disappeared from the shelf. It is good and the company says its always avilable. As a diabetic it doesn't affect my sugar. I enjoy it in the morning.

review/summary: My Picky Dog LOVES WeRuVa!
review/text: After I adopted my dog we purchased about 10 different brands of canned and dry dog food over the course of 6 months (e.g. Nature's Balance, Merrick, Nature's Variety, Tripette, Royal Canin, Acana, Orijen, etc.)  Every product was a high-quality brand similiar in price to WeRuVa, but my dog would turn his nose to all of them.  At one point he starved himself for over 3 days and would only eat grass or treats.<br /><br />I told a local pet store clerk about how I had to start making homemade dog food because he would only eat "real" meat and none of the products we tried looked real.  He asked if I had tried giving him WeRuVa because the meat looks like real human quality meat.  He popped open a can and my dog inhaled all of it, licking the can totally clean.  I bought a few more cans to try out at home and sure enough, he LOVED it.  He's been eating WeRuVa for over a month and it's the first time I've ever seen him get excited when I open a can to pour in his bowl.<br /><br />Also, his fur is becoming shinier and he's shedding less.  I'm so happy to see him excited for food.  They have a great selection of flavors, which is nice to give my dog some variety so he doesn't get bored.  Another nice perk is that the food smells pretty good too. The chicken smells like chicken noodle soup, which is nice because some of the brands we tried smelled horrendous.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater or just want to treat your dog to some great high-quality food, try WeRuVa!

review/text: Last week i gave Candy Mafia a 1 review.  My order should have arrived by the 2nd of August but on the 4th it had not.  I had checked with my apartment manager several times before the 2nd of Autust, and after, to no avail.  TODAY I went in to the mailroom with the manager and there the package was.  It was mailed in plenty of time to reach me by the 2nd of August.  It was to Candy Mafia but others that delayed my receipt of my order.<br /><br />My apologies to Candy Mafia.<br /><br />Flo
