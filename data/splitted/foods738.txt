review/text: I will order Puffins because I have tried it and it is only at Target here.  PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE THE PLAIN.  I don't like fruit, honey, peanutbutter, cinnanamon or other flavored cereal, but like puffs.  I have trouble with alot of cereal because of dentures.  For years and years I got Quaker Corn Bran but they added cinnamon and I don't like it.  Of, course, I want fiber, low sugar, calories.  Thank you

review/text: Barbara, if you read your reviews, please listen.  Your cereal doesn't taste the same as it used to.  I loved the original Puffins.  Slightly sweet in milk, nice flavor, great organic nutrition. Then your packaging changed [to a blander boring beige, BTW] and your cereal changed as well.  It is now completely tasteless.  I have tried the new version 3 times from 3 different stores and they are all bland as your new packaging.  I am sorry to say, this will be the last box I ever buy.  Please bring back your old cereal---you changed something, please change it back.

review/summary: Not a good substitute for Quaker Crunchy Corn Bran
review/text: I am a fan of Quaker Crunchy Corn Bran and have been having trouble finding it in stores for the past few years, so I was overjoyed when I found this cereal on the shelf of my local HEB. It sure looks like exactly the same cereal!<br /><br />Well...it isn't. I just finished a bowl of the stuff, and while it's not _bad_, it's not great either. These corn bran puffs are not as well-milled as the Quaker version, and it shows: I've got bits of fibrous "roughage" stuck in my teeth. They also don't absorb milk very well, which is good if you hate it when your cereal gets at all soft, but is kind of bad if you actually like it to soften just slightly without getting soggy -- something the Quaker Corn Bran did very well. These Puffins are also not as sweet -- I mean, I don't like super-sweet cereal, but I thought the Quaker variety hit that balance just right. With these, by the time I was halfway through the bowl I regretted not having added a tiny sprinkling of sugar.<br /><br />So, on the whole, Barbara's Puffins (Original) aren't terrible. They are a decent cereal. They are just not a good substitute for Quaker Crunchy Corn Bran, is all -- so if that's what you are looking for, just go ahead and order the real thing online.

review/summary: Disappointed by omissions, replacements, and quality
review/text: I ordered this gift package on extreme sale, and I still don't feel it was good value.  Many items were omitted or replaced -- I don't have it in front of me, but I don't believe I got the skeleton gummies, cotton candy, pretzels, or caramel corn.  No name-brand candies ("Tootsie rolls, Hershey bars, Skittles, M & M's and more!") were included; this was replaced by a bag of Breyers chocolates (a dollar at any drugstore).  "Pumpkin shortbread" and "pumpkin chocolate" cookies were pumpkin-shaped, but not pumpkin-flavored.  The coloring set and pumpkin-carving sets were dollar-store quality.<br /><br />The box was packed securely in Amazon's shipping box, but the bottom of the cute box was broken out and wouldn't pop back, so the contents slip out.  Unfortunate, since it's a nice design.<br /><br />I'm very glad it was shipped to me and not directly to the gift recipient.  I would have been embarrassed and I would never have known how much wasn't included.  You could easily make a better version of this gift box for under $10 at a dollar store.

review/summary: Supremely Delicious!
review/text: This is the second time I have purchased this 5-pound bag of Larry's Beans Fair Trade Organic Coffee, Frenchy French, whole beans so I can grind them myself.  Don't let the name throw you, it's not like a usual French roast, bitter with oily double-cracked beans.  It's supremely smooth with a moderate intensity of flavor and no bitterness.  I make a ball jar full by the drip method through a cone.  I have a cup with honey and whole milk in the morning and the remainder gets cold; it's even smooth when cold!  That's the sure sign of a great coffee -- it's when the professional coffee tasters sample their coffees, when they're cold.  So don't hesitate on this one.  Take it from someone who searches for the perfect cup of coffee, and has finally uncovered the great devise.  That it's fair trade is an added bonus.  Organic is essential!  The foregoing is no exaggeration!

It's medium at best. I like my coffee dark & strong.  That said, this has a good flavor & if I use extra beans, I can live with it, but it's not a nice deep dark roast like expected.  I might try Larry's Espresso...

review/summary: Good, but not great.
review/text: TLDR version:  While a pretty decent bean (-1 star), this IS NOT A FRENCH ROAST (-1 star).  This is why it only gets 3 stars.<br /><br />Original version:<br /><br />I recently picked up these and the Larry's Decaf Espresso beans at 57% off.  See my review of the decaf for an idea of the value of that purchase.  The price comes out to somewhere south of $5/lb.<br /><br />These beans were worth the price, being significantly better than any comparable beans you can buy at the store for anywhere close to the same price.  However, they're not the quality you'll find at your favorite coffee shop.  These are 2nd shelf beans, and at the price I paid, that's ok!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good freshness - fragrant and oily.<br />Grind well - smell engages the nose.<br />Good crema depth of color.<br />Good flavor - reminiscent of ripe blackberries and cream with roasted chile undertones.<br />Expected mouth feel - viscosity is thick, but not Turkish coffee.<br />Low acid.<br />Consistent Roast.<br />Excellent packaging - won't get damaged in shipping.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not French Roast!<br />Not "boutique" as the price would suggest.

review/summary: Tastes Great and packs a punch!
review/text: I was skeptical about Walden Farms products when I first saw them, but a co-worker raved about them so I decided to try a few. I picked up a bottle of the Thick and Spicy at my local grocery store but boy was I surprised when I tasted it. It was great! It has the rich sweet taste you expect in a BBQ sauce (thanks to Splenda) and packs quite a punch. The thick and Spicy is definetly for people who are a fan of spicey hot BBQ sauces.<br /><br />I would definetly recommend this product to anyone who is following the low carb diet or is just watching your calories.<br /><br />I don't often rate things 5 stars, but for zero calories and high on flavor and kick this deserves it.

review/summary: Yum!...
review/text: Yeah, yum.. If you like candied liquid smoke. I've never tried Walden Farm's before but the idea of 0 calorie, scratch that, *TRACE* calories and zero carbs. Wait, there's Splenda and it has half a carb per serving, plus tomato paste which also has carbs and other things on the ingredients that you can't de-carb.<br />Anyways, I digress, the idea of very little calories and very little carbs sounded too good to be true and yep. I drizzled it onto a grilled chicken wrap and bit in. Oh my god. The first thing to hit was a overly sweetness and not a real one, the chemical kind, bletch. The next thing to hit was a smokey taste, and again, not a very good one. It was way too strong and chemical tasting.<br />It ruined my wrap. I should have tasted it separately, but I thought for sure it couldn't be that bad, plus the taste of the Cajun seasonings on the chicken would help hide the taste. I was wrong. By the time I got to the end of the wrap where the liquid fool's gold had collected and bit through, it was way too much. I spit it out and threw the rest away. And all this from a small drizzle down the middle, after all, I was trying it.<br />I couldn't imagine pouring this on something and grilling that nastiness into it.<br />The other reviewers who gave it 5 stars. I don't know what they were thinking. Or maybe Walden Farm's changed the recipe but I didn't get spicy at all in this. It was a bottle of chemically candied chemical smoke flavor.<br />Absolutely horrid. I'd advise staying away unless you like wasting money, not just on this bottle of septic tank juices, but anything it touches. I must now to gargle Listerine and brush.

review/text: I took one sampling of this barbecue sauce after opening the bottle and immediately threw it away.  The taste is really disgusting, nor is the consistency anywhere close to "thick."  Using this product with any type of meat (pork, chicken, beef, etc.) will absolutely ruin what you're eating.  I should have done a better job of reading the other reviews, since they are dead-on.  You can find a number of low-carb barbecue sauce recipes on the web - I'd try that instead of this product.

review/summary: HcG Diet Phase 2 MUST!!!
review/text: I am currently doing the HcG Diet and cannot have anything extra with calories, fat, or sugar.  This barbeque sauce is perfect!!!  I used it last night and WOW! It tastes so good!  It's not thick like traditional bbq sauce, but it is for dieters.  It's sweetened with Sucralose which is an HCG diet no-no, however I didn't stall.  It is tangy, sweet, and barbequey.  I couldn't ask for more.  I have tried Walden Farms Balsamic Vinagrette (which is good), the Honey Dijon (yuck), the Sesame Ginger (so-so), the Ranch (yuck), Peanut Spread (sweet, but not peanut butter tasting), and the Blueberry Jam (good) and I have to say that so far this is the best that they have to offer for dieters.  I don't understand the 1 stars people are leaving (they probably aren't really dieting!).  My coworkers who are also doing the HCG Diet along with me LOVE this bbq sauce, they almost stole my bottle.  I am ordering more now so I don't run out!!!

review/summary: Chemical aftertaste
review/text: Give Walden Farms credit for making a no-carb sauce. It's just a shame it doesn't taste better. Still, I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content. However, the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth. This product cannot begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft's low-carb barbecue sauce. Mostly, I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste, but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined. However, if you are on an extreme low-carb diet (such as Dr. Bernstein's) this may be the only product that fits.

review/text: When I purchased this sauce to aid in my Atkins diet, it was shown CLEARLY to be a 6 pack.  The title said it, the photo had one of those little text bubbles on it that said "6 pack" and the shipping weight was listed at like 5 pounds or something.  TITLE AS LISTED: "Walden Farms Sauce Barbecue Thick Calorie Free, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)"<br /><br />One (1) bottle arrived, so I called the shipper who said the listing was wrong, and not their fault.  They said Amazon writes the listing (Lies) and to contact them.<br />I called Amazon, they said no, they couldn't possibly be responsible for the misprint on the ad, as they sell millions oof products for tens of thousands of companies, and each company writes their own ads for their own products. (Truth) and that I should make every attempt to resolve the conflict with the seller.<br />After several more "going nowhere" calls with the supplier, they said the only way they would do anything is to submit it for resolution with Amazon, and I'd probably get my money partially refunded.<br /><br />Amazon ended refunding all of my purchase price and shipping.<br /><br />I can't wait to never buy from All Star Health , ever, ever again.  I hope my review inspires you to look elsewhere as well. Bad, poor, lousy, unpleasant, untruthful customer service.<br /><br />By the way, the sauce is good, and I have since found it available in my local CUB Foods grocery store in their diabetic section.

I, however was pleasantly surprised to find the Original Sauce to be very tasty.  The spice level was well balanced with the acidity and sweetness.  No chemical aftertaste of Splenda.  I am a foodie, but my doctor has me on a ridiculously low calorie diet for the next few months.  After the past three weeks, I was desperate for variety and this fit the bill perfectly!  Bare in mind, this is NOT regular barbeque sauce though.  It is thinner, but what would you expect from a no calorie, no carb sauce?  If you are needing variety in your menu, give this a try.  You might just find an unexpected delight!

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: I haven't purchased this item here, I get it at my local grocery, however, I love the stuff.  I do not use it as BBQ sauce though.  I agree with some of the comments stating that it is a bit thin, and not really BBQ flavored.  However, I do use this more as a condiment, instead of catchup or 57 sauce - for THAT purpose, with zero cal,carbs, etc...it is an awesome product! :D I also really enjoy the flavor.  But taste is completely individual.  It is def. worth a try if you are watching carbs or looking for easy places to cut a few calories from your diet. :)

review/summary: Welcome taste relief in my diet
review/text: I am on a low carb and sugar diet, and needless to say I have been craving some of my old foods. My expectations were medium to low, but I am very surprised by this stuff, it helps me so much. Its a bit runny which sort of stinks, but the flavors are pretty good considering it has no calories and is made out of some suspect stuff. I season my protein more to kick up the flavor a bit more, but I enjoy it. Its not the best BBQ sauce ever but for not having calories it rocks. I like this the most of all the walden farms stuff I have tried. Look at a grocery store for a price cut; I got mine at Albersons.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE Walden Farms' salad dressings.  However, this product was not appetizing to me after the tasting it and it has a very unpleasant, lingering aftertaste.  I tried to doctor it up a bit so that the aftertaste wasn't so undesirable.  Nothing really worked.  Additionally, the smell is unappealing.

review/text: There is only so much grilled chicken with spices you can endure before you start losing your mind and your will to keep dieting. This sauce suprised me on its flavor. It was nice and smokey and sweet. It is thin, but, do you want that many chemicals in your food to make it thick? Great change of pace!

review/summary: Sugar Free Part is Okay, But the Recipe Isn't
review/text: I buy sugar free products a lot, and it is hard to find sugar free barbecue sauce.  I held out hope for this, and indeed did use the whole bottle.  I hate to waste things, and I am generally very easy to please.  I won't buy another though because the stuff just doesn't taste like barbecue sauce.  In my opinion, it has nothing to do with the artificial sweeteners either.  Whatever they are doing with the rest of the recipe just isn't getting the job done.<br /><br />If you have NO other choices, maybe you could give it a try yourself.  I do see some others love it, so maybe you would, too.  However, if you have a choice, choose the other brand(s) first before bothering with this.

review/text: I don't like BBQ sauce that much, but my husband loves it. Our diet doesn't allow us to have the caloric stuff anymore so I thought I'd try this one out.

review/summary: Nice Smokey Maple Flavor
review/text: I just bought this at Wal-Mart today. I put it on some nice pork I had cooked in my crock pot looking for that "shredded pork with bbq sauce" effect. It is thinner than your typical sugary sauce but that's nice because a little goes a long way. The flavor is smokey with an unexpected but nice maple flavor. I think I am going to try to add a little hot sauce next time. It's not exactly like a thick gloppy sugar laden sauce, but it does help the craving. I plan to buy it again.

review/summary: I'm hooked
review/text: ====================<br />HERMIT REVIEW<br />====================<br /><br />As a professional sweet tooth, cookie connoisseur, and general baked-goods aficionado I can wholeheartedly recommend the Cinnamon Hermit.<br /><br />I tried my first one a few months ago and have been hooked ever since. I was strolling through the grocery store looking for something new when the Hermits caught my eye. (They look like something my grandmother used to make.) I normally don't buy organic cookies, and these seemed a little pricey (almost $5) - so this was a total impulse buy. But I'm glad I gave them a try. Within a week these replaced my nightly bowl of frozen yogurt (which is a net tradeoff/savings of more than 150 calories.)<br /><br />Hermits have a very unique taste, so it's hard to compare them with something else. But the main characteristics are:<br /><br />1. OUTER COMPOSITION: soft, slightly moist texture juxtaposed by a light coating of crunchy granular sugar<br />2. INNER COMPOSITION: dense, almost chewy consistency and a generous amount of plump, sweet, ripe raisins<br />3. DOMINANT FLAVORS: dark molasses; cinnamon<br /><br />And like so many other foods from the Newman's Own brand, the Hermit also has a fantastic "harmony of ingredients." When you bite into one, you just feel like you're eating an American classic.<br /><br />====================<br />AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEW<br />====================<br /><br />In addition to all the great taste qualities mentioned above, this particular Amazon.com product (the 6-pack) has the absolute lowest *price-per-cookie* that I've been able to find anywhere. Single packages at grocery stores run between $4.75-$5.95. But at $21.60 (+ free shipping) this 6-pack comes out to $3.60 per package. (Or $3.06 if you do the "Subscribe & save" thing, which I did.) So it's a no-brainer.<br /><br />But try them out first; grab a single package next time you're at the store. Just make sure you get the Cinnamon kind. I haven't tried the other two yet (Original and Ginger), so this review is specific to the Cinnamon Hermits.

review/summary: Love Hermits, but these were dried out!
review/text: I love these Newman's hermits. They are like fig newtons but way better and more indulgent, at 80 calories per piece. This variation is delicious.<br /><br />Problem is, I ordered 6 packages of these cookies from Amazon and they are way more dried out than the ones I bought at the store locally. I suspect they have spent too much time in a warehouse.<br /><br />I want to buy as many groceries as I can from Amazon, but this huge difference in quality between supermarket and Amazon makes it harder to do so.<br /><br />I recommend heating them up in a microwave oven for 5-8 seconds to restore their moisture, right before you eat them.

review/summary: Very good packaged cookie
review/text: This was my first time trying a hermit cookie and my first Newman's Own cookie.  We really like them.  It is a rectangular shape, a bit bigger than a Fig Newton.  It's a softer cookie and held together with each bite.  Inside the soft cookie are bits of raisins.  All I could think of with each bite is how awesome it would be with a 'Christmas spice' added to it.  I just found the Ginger Hermits and ordered those, I think they will be just as good.  I can only liken the taste to a soft, oatmeal-type cookie but without the oatmeal.  I've never had a cookie like this so it's hard to explain for me.  I would order them again and I don't eat a lot of cookies...they are that good.<br /><br />A thought: you could put a white icing glaze on top and some sprinkles to dress them up for a holiday occasion - people wouldn't know you didn't bake them yourself.

review/text: I have the world's pickiest dog. (Well, judging among dogs who've been raised on dry food and not, say, fresh shrimp.) He's turned his nose up at dog biscuits since puppyhood, but I've never given up. Earlier this year, I found these on sale at a local store (that, alas, carries them no longer) and picked up a bag on a whim for my now nine-year-old fellow to try. Voila: the magic dog biscuit. Since then I have also tried him on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009UKVPU">Newman's Own Organics Chicken Treats for Dogs</a>, and he will happily devour them both, though he seems to have a slight preference for the peanut butter. I don't know what it is about these that he finds particularly enticing or tasty, but I'm glad to have finally found something he enjoys.

review/text: I received these the other day and was very impressed with how they looked and how easy they were to break.  Unfortunately, "Joey" wasn't.  He ate them, but they made him sick and he only had maybe 1 1/2 of them over a 24 hour period because I was continuing his other treats to make a smooth transition.  I then ordered and tried the turkey and sweet potato formula and had the same reaction.  Maybe it is just too rich for him.  I wanted so badly for these to work for him too!  As usual, Amazon was ready to help me.  I don't think you can go wrong ordering from Amazon because of their superb customer service and products.

I wish I knew when our dog adopted us what I know now.  If I had been feeding her as I am now she probably would never have developed this liver problem.

review/text: Our puppy got one of these just as we were leaving the house as a change from his stuffed Kong.  They kept him busy so he wouldn't fall apart about being alone and were one of the cheapest alternatives to the Kong.  No digestive problems, no chunks to worry about like you would get with rawhide.  And no smell.<br /><br />If they lasted longer than ten minutes, they'd be perfect.

review/summary: Made in the USA.  Or at Least Some of Them Are
review/text: My two pups, a small (15 pound) JRT-mix and mid-sized, 25-pound Poodle, both liked these chews.  They are fluffy (puffed actually) and easily chewed, which is both good and bad from a human perspective.  The good part is that a wide range of dog sizes should be able to enjoy them, and bad because they don't last all that long. Depending on your pup's mood, just a few minutes.<br /><br />So Summary Time:<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />--liked by both of my dogs<br />--I think even very small dogs, who might not be able to deal with Bully Sticks, might enjoy these<br />--very little smell<br />--not messy<br /><br />THE BAD<br />--don't last long<br />--sort of expensive, given that they don't last long<br /><br />OTHER POINTS<br />--The Lambs' ears I purchased at the grocery store were made in the USA.  This, of course, is because many people -- us included-- wouldn't think of buying a food product, even for our pets, from China because of their lack of regulation and low standards.<br /><br />However I think this is a recent change, and I don't know how any of us are going to be able to tell if Amazon has the 'good stuff' or older stock that was made in China.<br /><br />Recommended with caveat.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom and fur-mom

review/text: My dog loves these, and he is an 11 year old corgi shelti mutt.  He likes the puffed base of the ear part the best and leaves the very ear tips behind. They are usually about 5" long by 2.5" wide.  They don't smell bad and are small enough for him to eat as a snack in one sitting.  He could probably be done with one in 30 minutes (leaving the ear tips),<br />so this is a treat, not something that will keep him busy the whole evening.

He loves them, but in spite of his worn teeth, he can finish one of these in about 1-2 minutes--tops!  They are rather small and of a puffed, crunchy texture.  Easy to chew, but don't last long.  So far, no stomach/allergy issues from these.  Don't leave stains and not much of a smell.  Rather expensive.  Wish they came bulk for a much cheaper price.  Would buy again, if the price is better.

review/text: I think my dogs jaw line never fully fused together in the front so I can see it flex when he's chewing on hard bones. Since I can't afford to put him through surgery I did some research on what people give older dogs with dental issues and these lamb ears were mentioned several times. My little guy loves them and it takes about two days for him to eat the whole thing. I can see the ears soften up as he's slobbering on them and that gives me a little peace of mind knowing he's not putting excess pressure on his jaw like other bones did.

review/summary: Cheese lover
review/text: My husband I recently ate at an outside cafe in Geneva, IL.  It was late afternoon so we just wanted something light to eat with a glass of wine.  We ordered a cheese plate that include a choice of three cheese.  One of the choices on the menu was a blue cheese listed as "Pointed Reyes Original Farmstead Blue".  It was exceptionally good completly outshining the sharp cheedar and the mild Wisconsin Gouda. So much so that I asked to take a copy of the menu home so I could order the cheese on the internet.  Not as easy as I thought, but I did find it on Amazon and ordered it, after I corrected the spelling to "Point" Reyes rather than "Pointed" Reyes Blue Cheese.<br />  It was delievered in a couple of days intact and as delicious as I remembered. This really is a standout blue cheese especially if you like a tangy sharp blue cheese.  It is creamy but not overpowering and does not have the musky taste that some blue cheeses do. The only downside was the cost of shipping.  The cheese was $18.00 for a pound but the shipping was unexpectely high at $26.00.  The combined cost makes for a very expensive cheese.  I'm sure I will enjoying eating this blue cheese and make certain that I perserve every valuble bite of it until it is gone.

The level of the saltiness was as expected.<br />The dispensing mechanism worked well and its adjustability made it easy to control the sprinkle of the product. The size of the package was perfect for a small household to use at table. The only negative was the placement of the bar code sticker which completely covered the ingredient and nutrition information.  SO, there is no way to know the actual sodium content or other additives. Think this was a sloppy placement of the Amazon product code sticker.

review/summary: Healthy Alternative to Kibble, Canned or Raw Diets
review/text: Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing.

The bag of Sojos was almost one year old and there was no way Amazon kept track of that.  I got a refund from Amazon with no question and very quickly, but Amazon needs to keep control of the "use-by" dates of food they offer on their site.

review/summary: picky puppy...
review/text: I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test, I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with, as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula), which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well, I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original, he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days, I would play with and take his food away, so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans.

review/text: This product is a very health snack for your pup as it is made of 100% beef liver. My puppy does all of his tricks to get this treat. It is a little pricy but the container is large so it should last a long time as long as you don't overfeed.

review/summary: Dogs Love These!
review/text: My girls love these. I cut them up smaller and use them for training. Definately able to keep the dogs attention when they know something yummy and tasty is coming their way. The price was right too for the amount. As long as the price remains perfect I plan on having a steady supply of this great product!

review/text: I have one dog that is a picky eater. I crumble this liver treat into her food bowl and she loves it. If you have a dog that doesn't eat, try this, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Golden loves them!
review/text: My Golden can get picky and eating is not a priority for him. I was worried during training he was going to be too anxious to not eat any training treats. Well...these he will eat and I am very great-full! However, they do not have the best smell (definitely not something I would eat). :) Will be purchasing more.

review/summary: Corgi Cocaine
review/text: We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!

review/summary: Save the best for training
review/text: I have two German Shepherds. I use these as training treats. I also use them when I brush them, which they don't enjoy so much but know they will get treats. We have tried every treat available. These are the best.

review/text: Extremely big bucket of yummy treats for training! This is a great value. The pieces are large, but I cut them up into smaller pieces for regular training purposes.
