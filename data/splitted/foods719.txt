review/summary: Sees is the best around
review/text: My mother's favorite flavor is Chocolate, mine being Butterscotch. These lollypops are extremely delicious and they last for quite a while. The shape of the lollypops are unique and they are as savory as I can remember. I highly enjoy all products from Sees candies, the only downside is they can't ship you a sample chocolate like they give at the store!<br /><br />Quality products, quality service, quality through and through.

review/summary: Satisfying lollipop
review/text: This lollipop is not one that you can chew or break with your teeth, you have to suck on it til the very end.  So, if you're one that likes to chew on your lollipop, these are not the lollipops for you. This is the kind of lollipop where you taste the flavor and want just a little more so you just keep it in your mouth until it's gone.  Kind of like a Cheeze-it where you get a taste of cheese, not quite enough, and it leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />This might sound like a bad review but it isn't.  I like lollipops that aren't sugary tasting and have enough of the right flavor to keep me interested.  Frankly, their addictive because you get the chocolate, butterscotch (my fave), latte, etc. flavors in a long-lasting treat.<br /><br />Also, found this to be an alternative treat to sugary alternatives like processed cookes and candy that just don't taste good like they used to when I was a child.

review/text: The last time I had these lollipops was when I was a kid and when I went looking for a treat for myself and saw these I was excited to get them. I bought a box of all chocolate ones because those are the ones I like and they are just as good as they were years ago the last time I had them. The flavor lasts all the way down to the last piece and because these lollipops are made with hard candy, it lasts for a good long time.

Peace contributes to very worthwhile charities with each box sold. This is a cereal to buy if you like to eat healthy and save the Earth! I plan to buy other flavors as well. I have already bought the Raspberry Ginger flavor and the Walnut Spice flavor. I suggest checking the box size. 11 ounces goes fast. A great cereal for starting your day or enjoying anytime!

review/summary: Just ok, too much sugar. Not organic
review/text: I wrote a similar review for the other Peace cereal that I tried recently. I liked the flavor of this one less than the walnut flavor. My main complaint that this cereal has a large amount of sugar (13g) for 2/3 cup serving. This cereal is marketed as "healthy" and this amount of sugar is not "healthy" in my opinion. Not to mention the fact that it just tastes too darn sweet for my liking.

review/summary: The heart shapes died
review/text: I got the plant in good shape however the the center bamboo and heart shapes started to turn pale and brown. I gifted it to wife who changed the water and washed stones very regularly. She even kept it in indirect sunlight when it was turning pale no use. Ultimately we have to cut the Heart shaped portions of bamboo, the rest of the plant so far is green but not sure how long. I even used bottled water as Chlorine in tap water may be bad for this. Very disappointed at this purchase.

review/summary: Mindblowingly Good
review/text: It wasn't until I bought a bag of these when I finally learned what good potato chips taste like. It's sort of like the epiphany you have when you think American cheese is the best cheese you've ever had until you actually try smoked gouda. I know that sounds like an overstatement, but that's how good Herr's Heinz-flavored ketchup chips are. Once you try these, all of your previous favorites will start to pale in comparison.<br /><br />"What's so darned great about them?" you are probably wondering. What's gotten everyone in such a tizzy? Why the rave reviews and the almost cult-like devotion to these chips? It's not just because they taste good. It's because Herr's is one of the few snack makers that bucks that shady practice so many of them engage in now, especially Pringles. You know what I mean-- that cute, little trick of advertising their chips as literally bursting with flavor, when in reality the chips are so lightly dusted that there's barely any flavor to them. Herr's philosophy in terms of chip-to-flavor ratio couldn't be more different. Open any one of their snacks-- especially this one-- and the chips are so covered in powder that it's impossible to not have it cake up on your finger tips without constantly cleaning them. These Heinz ketchup flavored chips are so heavily dusted, in fact, that you'll wind up with red-stained fingers for a few hours after gorging on them. It makes for a messy experience but in the end, getting a moutful of flavor with each bite makes the hassle of cleaning up all worthwhile!<br /><br />Sure, this excessive powder doesn't exactly make Herr's the healthiest of snack choices, but what snack is? It's all gonna kill us, anyway, so really-- all this really comes down to is choosing our poison. My poison happens to be these chips, and will most likely be yours once you taste them and subsequently become hopelessly addicted like me.

review/summary: Great flavor, Ketchup Chips
review/text: First time trying Herr's brand Ketchup potato chips, really love them. Its just as good as other brand catsup chips that I've tried in Canada. Glad these chips are available here in the U.S. and uses great flavoring with Heinz brand ketchup. Many think it may seem odd to have ketchup on chips, its similar to eating normally fries and ketchup. It doesn't have that strong of a overwhelming ketchup flavor on the chips, which is great, reason many of my friends like them<br /><br />If really want a stronger ketchup flavored taste, I personally recommend get a bottle of Heinz ketchup and dip your ketchup flavored chips into some actual ketchup, like you would with fries.

review/summary: what a flavor!
review/text: When these Herr's ketchup-flavored chips first hit the market, I remember I was taking some assembly in high school and a worker from Herr's was trying to convince the class to take a free bag of chips.  Everyone was either disinterested or disgusted by the thought of ketchup chips, and I regret following suit and leaving with the classmates while ignoring the free miniature bag samples in the box.  I strongly regret it in fact.  These chips are *awesome!*  I highly recommend them.  Don't just ignore them because the thought of ketchup on a potato chip sounds unappealing- they're actually really good.

If this is 42 1-ounce bags, then that would total 11.2 regular bags, or $11.20 ($12 rounded to a full bag).  The official site is just as bad wanting to sell a box of 15 normal bags for $25 before shipping.<br /><br />My local store is running out, but I don't want to be paying this much for wholesale.

review/summary: Ketchup chips are great, but these aren't them
review/text: There is currently a problem with this item entry in Amazon.  The description that comes up in a search, before you get to this page, is "Herr's Potato Chips, Heinz Ketchup Flavored, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 42)."<br /><br />I ordered this and got a 42-bag variety pack of various other chips like BBQ and regular, not any ketchup-flavored ones.  Upon closer examination, the description that is on this page just lists "Herr's Potato Chips," in contrast to the other description.<br /><br />I was able to return the item, but was informed that there are no Herr's Ketchup-Flavored Chips available.  (And I really don't get that.  If the ketchup-flavored chips are so popular and in such demand, you'd think that Herr's would do something about ramping up their production accordingly, and maybe ramping down some of the other flavors, because these chips are pretty much NEVER available.  But apparently I'm talking crazy talk.)<br /><br />Oh well.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: A couple of years ago, my Wal-Mart carried large bags of these for a short time and I was instantly hooked but when they stopped, I couldn't get them without ordering directly from Herr's site which was a bit of a hassle. Now that I can get them from Amazon, feeding my addiction is easier and more convenient.<br /><br />Although I generally like BBQ and spicy foods, most BBQ flavored chips and jalepeno/salsa/hot flavored chips taste somewhat bland and very artificial to me. It's not that I can't taste the flavors; it's just that they don't seem to resemble the actual taste of BBQ or peppers or salsa, etc. But with these chips, it really tastes like eating crisp french fries smothered in ketchup, and licking my bright red fingertips clean is half the fun!<br /><br />Packaging was a little excessive. Looks like Herr's ships their standard store-delivery box (already well padded) to Amazon which puts the entire Herr's box into an Amazon box for shipment to you. Net result is that you get a huge box with a whole lot of tape, plastic, and cardboard between you and the chips.

I used to buy these in the Kosher market where I lived but I couldn't find them when I moved to Massachusetts. I have ordered three boxes from Amazon in the past year and they have all arrived fresh and crisp with minimal broken sticks.

review/text: Trust the bad reviews - they are right.  I got these pretzels because my favorite brand is no longer carried by Cost Plus, but remembered these from Trader Joe's....now I know why I did not keep buying them.  These have an off taste and are stale, really awful.  Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Not Even Edible
review/text: Pretzels have been improperly stored and/or prepared with poor-quality ingredients, they have an off taste like rancid vegetable oil. I gave two stars instead of one because Amazon did try twice and refunded both times. Interestingly, I have bought this product before when it was available in the Seattle area and it was excellent. There is obviously a quality-control problem going on somewhere along the line.

review/text: After seeing the Good Eats show about how Alton lost so much weight, me and my b/f were very interested in the Sardine sandwich he makes in the show that calls for Brisling Sardines<br /><br />You can find the recipe here<br />[...]<br /><br />So we went to the super market and the only brisling sardines we can find in oil was King Oscar Sardines but it was almost 5 dollars a can and we needed two of them, well okay whatevers we got it.<br /><br />We got home and made thie recipe... and for someone that hasn't ever had sardines before it was super yummers!  My b/f has had sardines before and said yup brislings is the way to go.  BTW if you were try this recipe at home, they say prep-time is 5 minutes which it is but there is a 1-hour wait time while the sardines soak in the sauce that you have to prepare for, we wanted to eat it right away and it was still pretty good, but since then we have waited and it is better if you wait.<br /><br />Anyways being kind of a frugel person 10 bucks for protein is not what I call a low cost meal for a dinner for two.  Usually with that much chicken we can eat well for a week!  So I was like got to find Brisling Sardines cheaper... and that's where Amazon comes in.<br /><br />This is a great deal for about half the price you can find it at local super markets and free shipping really knocked it out of the park for us.<br /><br />I ordered this early last week and got it before the weekend.  I made the recipe this weekend and yup very good, I would say just as good as King Oscar Sardines.<br /><br />Happy eating!

review/text: For at least a year Amazon has been shipping me two dozen cans a month of Crown Prince Two Layer Brisling Sardines. I happen to love sardines, at least the northern-based sardines, such as from Norway or Scotland. Hence my continuing order from Amazon. However, suddenly, with this month's shipment, the quality seems to have changed, for the worse. The sardines this past shipment are darker in color and with a salty flavor. It's as if the packer has changed his procedures or the fish have come from a different place. I'm going to accept my November shipment to see if it was an aberration, but if it wasn't, I'll cancel my order.

review/summary: Good Value, better than most.
review/text: As a lil' squirt growing up the thought of eating whole small fishies packed in a tin of oil was less than appealing dare I say gross, as I suspect it was to most of my peers at the time as well.<br />Fast forward a few decades and a matured palate with a desire for nutrient packed natural foods, I rediscover the wiggly little shimmering fish that seems more like bait than a real seafood meal.<br />Having tried most of the grocery store sardine fare I was less than impressed with the low dollar mushy chum offerings, many of which (*ehem cough* Beach Cliff, Chicken of the sea) I would think twice before feeding my Calico Tigger.<br /><br />Crown Prince is a good product. The small tail-on two layer Brisling are fairly neatly packed in a standard olive oil bath. They are firm, meaning they were fresh when processed and not overcooked as many other brands often are.<br />These are smoked and as such are a bit on the high side for sodium. The smoke flavor is noticeable and not subtle in the least. This can be a good thing if you aren't looking to taste as much of the natural fish flavor, though if one is looking for a quality strong smoked fish at a bargain price I would suggest Polar 6oz kippered herring.<br /><br />By and large you get what you pay for when it comes to fish in a can. Price is high (a bit more more than double) by comparison with the low end offerings, though less expensive than some top drawer brands like Barr Harbor and King Oscar. The best prices for canned fish can be found at WalMart and Big Lots though here on Amazon you can get a fair price if one of the aforementioned retailers are not near you.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want a good quality bristling sardine but can't either afford or find King Oscar, then by all means give this very good alternative a try.

Perhaps the near-arctic waters' brislings have been depleted...or the fisheries don't want to spend the money on the diesel fuel to get them there?

review/summary: tasty, but 1 can was received damaged
review/text: SHIPPING: I received the crown prince sardines quickly, 2 day total shipping time in a nice cardboard case nicely packed by amazon in an additional box,<br /> however the box that royal crown ships the sardines in had a oily spot in one corner, upon opening the package I found 1 can arrived had begun leaking oil at somepoint, I threw that can away.  the rest of the cans were afaik undamaged. -1 star for damaged tin.  and for the record this is a non returnable purchase.<br /><br />THE TASTE: This is hard to judge since I have only tried 2 Tins so far, but I tried using alton browns sardine toast recipe with avocado, and it just did not taste that good to me.  I actually ended up feeding half of the dish to the dogs. I had made the sardine toast before with store bought brisling sardines and they tasted much much better, I loved it that time and I hoped that this would be equaled in flavor and taste, unfortunately that was not the case.  -1 star<br /><br />I will update the review with my current opinion as I try more of the tins.<br /><br />EDIT: I tried a can by itself with nothing else, eating it slowly with chopsticks today and it turns out the fish was actually quite tasty.<br />I finished the entire can with ease. :-)<br />I am going to attribute the bad flavor of the first two cans I tried to using the wrong type of vinegar with the sardine toast that I attempted to make.

The first thought I had about it was, "where's the flavor?" and then as I ate more and more of it, buyer's remorse crept in as I knew I couldn't return these and I was stuck with 23 more cans of it.<br /><br />So, I was pretty disappointed with the flavor, or lack thereof and will probably stick to getting the King Oscar kind.

review/text: I've always liked sardines. I guess a lot of people don't. Their loss. So, last week I picked up a few cans at my local Fresh and Easy Market.  They were Crown Prince Brisling Sardines packed in extra virgin olive oil. They were a bit more expensive than the last brand, but they were worth it. Delicious! Nice wood-smoked flavor, but not overly strong. They were high in oil, but it was olive oil with a good content of Omega 3, a type that is healthy and good for you. Wild caught, not farmed. Attractively packed in two layers. And, it's a product of Scotland, not China. Excellent sardines!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

He was allergic to every dog food on the market. I finally resorted to a home made all natural diet I found in a book at a health food store. After years of tweaking he finally got tired of that too. So back to store bought?  Yes! Finally companies are waking up and giving us good quality dog foods to choose from.<br />What I love about the Avoderm wet foods are that they have huge chunks of carrots,peas,blueberries,potatoes. They aren't just veggie powders they are the real thing.<br />Right now my pup is going through Chemo therapy for bone cancer and has  a low appetite at times.  He loves this food.<br />It's a little "gooshy" so I put in the fridge for a more firm easier food to work with. ( he doesn't like "gooshy" either)<br />My only gripe is that it is hard to find locally and I have to order it online but a HUGE thank you to Amazon for carrying it at a very reasonable price.<br />very happy with Avoderm hope this helps someone out there.<br />Becky

review/text: I just ordered this for my brother for his birthday. I love Arriba, and so does he. He moved to the northeast about a year ago and lamented the lack of salsa, peppers and anything to make salsa up there. Though he appreciated the gesture, one of the three salsas exploded on the way from Texas to NYC. He was left with two jars of salsa, rather than three, and a box that leaked red salsa goop. Needless to say, it was not the most successful birthday present.

review/summary: BEST SALSA outside of homemade! Plus a recipe...
review/text: I usually make my own roasted salsa, and this is the ONLY jarred salsa I think is worth purchasing. Plus, it's $6.50 a jar in my local stores, when I can find it, so this is a GREAT DEAL!<br /><br />RECIPE: Best Quick Guacamole<br />- 1/4 cup of this salsa<br />- 2 ripe avocados<br />- dash of freshly squeezed lime juice<br /><br />Dice avocados; stir in salsa and lime juice, mashing avocados slightly but leaving small pieces for texture. Season with pepper and your favorite hot sauce if desired.

review/summary: Great Salsa!
review/text: Great salsa! I prefer the Red Salsa to the Chipotle. I have bought whole cases to bring back with me from Houston. I wish it was cheaper, but it has become something to enjoy now and then. I've brought it to parties and most people think it's great. Some of the bad reviews lower on the page show that many people are unaccustomed to actual salsa that has more of an ethnic flavor. If you prefer your salsa to be made of something more than just tomatoes and corn syrup, check this out.

review/summary: Great Salsas
review/text: I debated purchasing this salsa because of the low ratings. But I went ahead and did so anyway. My opinion?<br /><br />It's the best salsa I've ever tried! It says "fire roasted" and I thought of giant black chunks of charcoal in the salsa. No, but there are small specks of it that really do give an authentic smoky flavor. I'm not sure why the one review says it's watery - it's the same consistency as most salsas or slightly thicker. "On sale" at $11, it's a great purchase, but at $30 or $60, it's *much* cheaper at a regular store instead of online (and I won't buy it at those prices either).<br /><br />My only regret? That I can't stock up on it at the moment. I went through it lots quicker than any other salsas I've ever used (because it's good, not because of quantity).

review/summary: Weridest Salsas I've tasted
review/text: I just got the Arriba Red Salsa and the Chipotle Salsa today and boy do they taste weird. The red salsa is not too chunky which I like but is not spicy and tastes more like chili than it does as a salsa. The red salsa tastes like a chili without chunks of anything in it that a chili normally does so it was an unexpected flavor for me in a chili, although I love roasted salsas just not this one. The chipotle chili was awful. When I opened it the smell alone was suspect, it smelt like a farm with cattle or like a horse stable with a distinct hay smell. When my husband and I tried it, it tasted like it smelled like hay. It was almost like we had just walked up to a cow or a horse and licked its side or something. I love my salsas and have tried so many, but these two do not make the cut. I paid $4.69 in store for them at Shoprite. I can recommend some good salsas like Mitch Williams Mild or his Wild salsa. It is really chunky, has a good spicy kick, and a nice picante tomato salsa flavor (One of my favs). Margaritaville makes a very fresh tasting salsa; I think it's the garden one. It is a chunkier salsa like fresh salsas normally are but has some sauce to it and a very nice cilantro flavor. This salsa is definitely a favorite when I want a fresh "clean" tasting salsa. A more run of the mill salsa, that is easier to find, is Pace's picante salsa. Pace is good tasting overall with a little bit more chunks than I like but has a good strong tomato and spice taste.  Hope this helps!

review/summary: Watered Down Salsa - Not Worth Buying At All
review/text: I just got this 3-jar set today and tried the salsa. I was excited because I had been reading reviews from other Amazon buyers that said the salsa was excellent! Normally, Amazon's reviewers are quite accurate in their recommendations but this time they were just flat out wrong. The salsa is very watery - right away as you tip the jar back and forth, the salsa runs around very quickly and I was suspicious that it would not have enough chunky goodness that makes a salsa tasty. I was absolutely right. The salsa has a thin watered down flavor. There is a muted spiciness that is not worth spending money for. The fire-roasted detail was worthless - it just meant that you would see black flakes from the grilled vegetables swimming around in the watered down salsa. You can get a better salsa at any supermarket - just tip the jar around to make sure that its contents move slowly and look for salsa that markets itself as having won awards at salsa fairs or by chefs. Even boring Pace makes a better salsa than Arriba!

review/summary: Ummm...Interesting, but BE WARNED!
review/text: I am unable to remember exactly how I came across these, but try them I did. When you hit the fruit flavors you are readily reminded of Jelly Belly jelly beans. Given that Bertie Bott's Beans are made by Jelly Belly, your taste buds would be correct. So, what makes these particular Jelly Belly jelly beans different from regular Jelly Bellys? The bizarre flavors, of course.<br /><br />I think I had a vomit bean in my box, but I did not think it was that bad. I also had dirt, which tasted like I thought dirt should taste like. The sardine flavored beans tasted just like fish; strongly like fish. Unfortunately, I got too many of the sardine flavored beans, so I think I have had enough of those. The grass flavored beans tasted like grass. I was able to reasonably handle all these flavors except for the earthworm, which is just gross. I have had real earthworms before, and they did not taste as bad as these jelly beans did.<br /><br />I am amazed at how authentic the Bertie Bott's Beans tasted. I warn you that they taste so authentic that you may wish you had not eaten them. For children, who often like such things, these candies may be a perfect gift, especially for male children. These candies may be great for someone interested in some sort of a contest. However, if you are past the phase where getting grossed out by nasty tasting stuff, then I recommend you pass these by.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

Its greasy-spicy and I think the only thing I can do with the other 5 packets is to add one packet at a time to a batch of rice in the rice cooker.

review/text: Kitchens of India has an overall great line of Indian foods. Unfortunately,the Kashmiri pilaf is mediocre at best. It ends up incredibly dry.... and while it is surprisingly spicy, it's best paired with a cucumber raita or anything yogurt-based to cut the burn. One isn't forewarned on the spiciness. Even salsa bottles are more instructive.<br /><br />On the upside,a CD of Indian classical music accompanies the meal. It's an hour's worth of music with Ustad Amjad Ali Khan on the sarod. It's beautiful and contemplative. The meal is forgettable,but the music is worth keeping!

End result is really good though the nuts (almonds and cashews) are not at all crunchy. I like them slightly crunchy but its prepared food. You can get it good only so much.

review/summary: Absolutely horrible.
review/text: These meals are greasy, disgusting and actually made be feel woozy for a few hours after eating. I would not recommend eating this. I can't return it but want to give it away. Perhaps i will find a homeless man to give it to.
