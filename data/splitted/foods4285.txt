review/summary: Choking hazard
review/text: Seemed like a great idea, and my dog loved it, but when she began choking on the treat, I threw them away. She's a 40-lb lab and loves to chew on anything she can get. It only took her 5 minutes to figure out how to get the treat out of the ball. She's fine. I was able to immediately dislodge the treat from the back of her mouth, but the scare was enough to decide I wouldn't let her have them again. She does still enjoy playing with the ball.

review/summary: not so everlasting
review/text: my german shepherd went thru this in less than 20 mins. I was very disappointed. Everlasting must be a good tasting treat, or perhaps a smaller dog could make it last longer? who knows for sure.  So, although I personally didn't taste this, my german shepherd plowed thru in record time.

review/text: I have been using these for years to distract my dog when I leave the house and he loves it, it keeps him busy and gives him something to chew that I do not have to clean up when I get home (he eats every crumb).  I usually buy him the chicken and also the liver flavor, they seem to be his favorite and it keeps him busy for a long time.

review/summary: Not Round? But dogs seem to love them.
review/text: If you mistakenly think these are round, they are NOT. My wife put them in my cart, told me they were treat balls that we could leave in the yard for the pups to play with... or not, lol. The dogs do, at least, seem to enjoy them, one won't let me get within ten feet of him. I don't think I would trust leaving the treat holder around them, so I guess it's just not a treat for me to give my dogs in the future. But, again, to each their own.

review/summary: winner winner chicken dinner!
review/text: My dog LOVES these.  She loves to chew on things and this is the first toy that she has not destroyed within the first week.  We have had the ball that these treats insert into for over 2 months and it still is like new.  The chicken flavor appears to be her favorite so far.  They will last several days if we don't take the toy away, longer if we limit her exposure or rotate toys. She will lick and lick and chew and chew for hours.  Inserting the treats is a bit difficult but not too bad. We have not had any problems with her removing the treat as others have described, my guess is that they are not getting the treat set into the ball correctly.  This chew toy is a keeper!

review/summary: The Fifteen Minute lasting treat.
review/text: I got this for my Cairn terrier puppy when I first got him and I have to say, the idea is a good one but execution is poor. There are two basic problems with this toy.<br /><br />1) My dog just licks it until the treat gets smaller and then manages to pull it out and finish it. This takes maybe fifteen minutes at most.<br /><br />2) Even if he didn't do that, after about three uses the rubber became loose around the treat, so that now it basically just pops out by itself.<br /><br />So save your money and invest it in something more durable.

review/text: My 6 year old Shiba Inu loves these.  This is the only toy he won't destroy or devour completely in a matter of minutes.  He will basically drop whatever he's doing when he sees one of these treats come out of the package and cry until it goes into the everlasting treat ball.  He plays with it on and off for about a week before it's finally devoured.  It's really cost effective for us and we're happy knowing he won't break the treat ball and swallow non-food parts.

review/text: my dogs LOVE this treat. They also love the fact that they have to work to get it out but they get it out of the plastic cover in less than 10 Min!! I have three Jindo dogs and they are all about 55-60 lbs. I know they're smart but i just didn't think it would take them so quickly to figure out how to get this treat out. I will probably continue to buy it for them but I was a little disappointed that it didn't last longer.

review/summary: Easy Way to Add Nutrition to My Smoothies
review/text: I have tried several of the Peter Rabbit Organic Smoothies and several of the Purees. Obviously the Smoothies taste better, but I use them to add to my breakfast smoothies which usually have frozen peaches and frozen dark sweet cherries, so with the purees I add a bit more Splenda to compensate for the lack of sweetness in the puree, whereas with the smoothies, I don't need to do that. I like the fact that all of the Peter Rabbit products are simply fruit and / or vegetables with nothing else added. So it is an easy way to vary the nutritional values in my smoothies from day to day. I never have to worry about preservatives or other additives with Peter Rabbit food products, which is important to me because I have migraines that are often triggered by food additives. Peter Rabbit products are simply pure, excellent, quality foods. Thanks Peter and thanks Amazon.com.<br /><br />JP

We're so glad we didn't have to wait until Easter rolled around again to enjoy this Cadbury staple and how clever of Hershey's to wave their magic wand over this Easter favorite and transform it into a Halloween offering!

review/summary: Delicious AND nutritious
review/text: These muffins are delicious, nutritious, and (best for me) very easy to make! Banana was not overly sweet and didn't have that "fake" banana taste.<br /><br />They are choc-full of all those really healthy ingredients that should not taste good together, but they do. They may *seem* pricey, but I've tried creating muffin-like-thingees like this on my own and it wasn't cheap. And it wasn't easy. And they didn't taste this good.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit they don't taste like the muffins grandma made. But these won't contribute to heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, either.<br /><br />These are very filling and can hold you as well as a meal in a pinch.  Very fiberfilled! Since we are on a diet, we take them on trips to curb those crazy eating habits away from home.<br /><br />I've tried both the Splenda & the Xylitol versions and they are equally good.  Splenda is sweeter but Xylitol is slightly more moist.<br /><br />Be sure to let the wet dough "rest" for 10 minutes per the instructions. I suspect this may be the reason one of the other reviewers reported that his muffins were hard as rocks.

review/text: So first you saute some veggies, say, in some peanut oil in a skillet or small wok, and then you add some scallops, say, or maybe shrimp, and then you turn off the heat and follow the directions on the box (using the microwave).  Then you add the noodles, flavor pack and the UNBELIEVABLY fantastic Sweet Korean Chili sauce to the skillet and toss to heat through.  Maybe you add some almonds or peanuts, say, after you add it all either to a bowl or a plate, and then you consume with some moderately sweet wine, like White Zinfandel, say.  An absolutely fantastic meal.

review/text: This noodle bowl was delish! I'm Korean and loved the taste of it. Bummed that it is high in calories since it is considered 2 servings, but it is wonderful it doesn't have MSG (which gives me headaches). I would eat this again and again if it weren't so caloric and carb-laden. It isn't that spicy - it's sweet and mildly spicy. Even if you follow the directions to put the dry packet and then the noodles and then water, some of the veggies do go down the drain when you are draining the water out. I'm going to buy some more! Great deal here as it is $3.20 at our local grocer.

review/text: I am in the process of trying all of the Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls and Soup Noodle Bowls. I really liked these. They had a great flavor. Really spicy but to me that is what made them so good. The sweet flavor and the spicy flavor together make these really good. They are the perfect size for a light supper or a lunch. I have tried a couple of other noodle bowls and so far these are my favorite. I saw in one review where the person said they were too sweet, well duh !! They actually are not too sweet. They have a sweetness to them yes but this goes with the spicy perfect. I will most surely be buying these again.

review/summary: The Best Instant Noodle Meals You Can Buy!
review/text: Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that "crunch" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)

review/text: I have not had noodles from this company that I did  not like; they are all excellent! And to the reviewers saying that it is tricky to prepare, I would like to say: just follow the instructions, with common sense. If you put the dry toppings at the bottom and then place the square-shaped noodles over the top (a square shaped top), the noodles act as a barrier when draining. Just make sure you keep your hands near the corner of the lid so you don't let the lid open up.<br /><br />However, they are kind of pricey, at least for me (in college). I only get them when my local grocery store has them on sale. Even from Amazon in bulk, they are more expensive than I paid today for mine.

review/text: I loved this Annie Chun lunch. Great blend of spicy and sweet. I added a hard boiled egg, for more protein. I was also able to skip the microwaving part and just let it sit longer in the hot water from my kettle. No problem draining it and keeping the spices in. My one issue is that the calorie count for HALF a bowl is 320 calories. That's a high caloric count for my lunch, so I can't justify this on a regular basis, as great a packaged lunch as it was. It seems the others who turned this into a dinner, maybe even for 2?, were on the right track.

review/text: (ASIN: B00006IFMQ)  This is not for the faint of heart.  During and after I have consumed a bowl of this, my upper lip vibrates and my teeth itch.  But my oh my, it is so worth it.  I do switch around the cooking order, allowing the spices to rehydrate and release the fullest flavors possible, but that's because I really don't mind if the preparation exceeds two minutes.<br />Ingredients seem to be of excellent quality, and the bowls are bio-degradeable.  If the Annie Chun foods get along well with my digestive tract, they won't hurt anyone else's either, despite the presence of the chili flavoring.  Check the box for recommendations as to what other goodies you can add, vary the recipe if you dare, take the phone off the hook and let yourself go!<br />Unless a local supermarket has one flavor or another on sale, and you have coupons, this is the most economical way to make your purchase.  Try one from the market, to see if you likes it and it likes you, and then go for the six bowls for $XX.XX, delivered freight free because of Prime, or the you-know what encumberance which otherwise would attach to its purchase.  Once you have decided you like it, put it on the 'Subscribe and Save' program Amazon offers, which automatically lowers the overhead some more.  All you have to do is answer your door for UPS or Ensenda, bring the carton in and prepare to be bold.  And now, please excuse me.  I have worked up an appetite for, you guessed it, 'Annie Chun's Korean Sweet  Chili Noodle Bowl.'

review/summary: The tastiest instant noodles EVER.
review/text: Firstly I should start off by saying that I can not get enough of these noodles. They are a bit pricey where I live but much better than any other instant noodle bowls out there including any Simply Asia flavor. The Korean Sweet Chili is the best and only flavor I love or even like in the Annie Chun line.<br /><br />I find that there is a trick to heating it up. Using a pretty small whole cup of water, microwave, let sit with water for a minute and then drain it out by just leaving one corner slightly barely open while the rest of the lid is tightly closed turn it carefully upside down and it should be able to easily drain the water out with very little to no ingredients pouring out and less chance of burning hands. I also keep the same mini cup around filed with 1/4 cup of water to gradually pour in after the sauce is put in if I was too impatient to let the noodles soak in the water for a minute after microwaving.<br /><br />Another great thing about this noodle bowl is that it is vegan, so I don't have to worry about fish oils being used!

review/summary: Need a LOT of doctoring
review/text: I bought these noodle bowls based on other reviews and my (limited) previous experience with the brand.  As a quick, portable lunch these are good, although the noodle bowls are slightly less easy to deal with because you have to drain the noodles, and in doing so you lose some of the dried bits of the topping mix.  The soup bowls are great in that you keep the cooking liquid, which makes for fewer messes.  The soup bowls tend to be lower in calories, as well.<br /><br />That said, the first time I tasted one of these bowls I was disgusted.  With zero additions, the sauce is sweet, syrupy, and hugely reminiscent of soy sauce.  The next time I doctored it with a lot of sriracha sauce and it was better, but only slightly.  Still not edible.<br /><br />Today I tried something different that actually made it pleasant to eat.  I added about one-and-a-half tablespoons of crunchy peanut butter and a cup of leftover sauteed zucchini and onions.  The zucchini and onions add heft to the bowl, needed when the whole thing is just a big mess of sticky noodles.  The peanut butter took a while to stir into the sauce, but removed the overly sweet, syrupy taste.  I can even tell that there actually IS a bit of a spice kick to the sauce now.<br /><br />Of course, all that doctoring makes it much less simple to prepare, so I won't be buying this one again.  It's easier and cheaper for me to just make a batch of noodles and vegetables in peanut sauce and portion it into lunch-sized servings.

It is filling and, like many of the other reviewers, I find it to be mild and quite appetizing.  Trying this one has inspired me to try other Annie Chun's bowls but, this one is my go-to favorite after trying around 4 or 5 of the flavors.  With subscribe and save, it's a great value at 'around' $2 per lunch.  That's hard to beat for something as filling as this, in my opinion.

review/summary: Good Flavor But *Tricky* To Make.
review/text: ANNIE CHUN'S KOREAN SWEET CHILI NOODLE BOWL has a sweet and spicy flavor and uses fresh noodles--not the dried out kind like in most instant noodle dishes.<br /><br />It's not too spicy if you like hot stuff, but I find it a little too sweet for my liking...but it isn't bad.<br /><br />As another reviewer pointed out, the tricky part is making it. You add hot water to the noodles and the dried garnish mix, put it in the microwave, and cook for one minute. Then you take it out and using the lid, drain the water out.<br /><br />I tried putting the mix on the bottom of the noodles but they still came out when I poured the water out. And I agree with the other reviewer that the lid isn't the best way to strain the water out and that's why I deducted one-star. Maybe next time I won't add as much water or something.<br /><br />From there you just add in the sauce mix and the noodle dish is done.

This product is excellent, the whole beans are fragrant, but we don't use the bags or metal clips to store the beans after we've opened the bag.  I highly recommend using an air tight container (like a ceramic pickling jar with the rubber ring around the lid) to continue to keep the fragrance and freshness of the beans.  Enjoy!

review/text: This is definitely one of the best deals out there for Kona Coffee beans. In Cincinnati, I can end up paying 50% more for beans that have been sitting on a shelf for who knows how long. As for the beans themselves, if you have not yet tried Kona coffee then do yourself a favor and give it a shot, though make sure that you have a solid grinder (preferably conical burr) and a french press. The coffee itself is incredibly smooth and for whatever reason reddish in color; it's not a dark coffee by any means, at least in my estimation. Of course, the ultimate experience would be to go to the Kona region in Hawaii and have them make a fresh cup for you, but if you're kind of poor, like me, then this is an excellent substitute.

review/text: This coffee is decent enough, but the actual taste always seems like a big disappointment considering the time and money spent in acquiring it.<br /><br />Kinda like when your looking up at a awesome roller coaster, anticipating how fun and exciting its going to be, but after the ride is over, you ask yourself, "was that it?"<br /><br />Some how all the buildup and hype ends in an anti-climax...<br /><br />If I was drinking this in Hawaii, it might get a five.

review/text: I see that someone using my name is advocating Annie's Shells and White Cheddar Cheese!<br /><br />This is way better. Let's QUICKLY go over the advantages; I know you have better things to do:<br /><br />1. This is macaroni, not "shells." When you want "macaroni and cheese," do you ask for "shells and cheese?" Not likely.<br /><br />2. The cheese is yellow, not white. Maybe if you like white chocolate over brown chocolate, you'll go for the other kind. In my book, this cheese should be yellow. Enough said.<br /><br />OK, so it's not completely organic. It's still natural and tastes good. AND--this is microwaveable!<br /><br />Res Ipsa Loquitur.

review/text: Seems I was the only one buying this ketchup locally, since our stores stopped stocking it.  My husband, on a 2 gm. sodium diet has always "doused" his foods with salt, ketchup, mustard.  The salt is now off the table,but he can enjoy himself with his ketchup.  Helps him maintain his restrictions and tastes the same as the "regular" ketchup.

review/text: Never in a million years I would have thought to leave a review about a ketchup, but believe it, it's that good! Those who watch their salt intake or those who simply care to have their food with a ketchup guilt free, should look into this one. Taste is as good as a regular ketchup's. Also, the fact that the salt substitute is based on natural and harmless ingredients minus the fake taste, makes this one a winner!<br /><br />The bad part about this whole Amazon selling, they are selling it in a pack of 12. An average New Yorker probably will not be willing to stock up that much, no matter how much they swear by it. I wish they shipped it in a pack of 4 or in a similar quantities.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: Sardine aficionados know that there are many different types of fish and preparation that go into the cans of different brands. Some fish are larger, others tiny. Some firm, others soft. And some bland, others spicy in different ways. This can has the larger fish (so only 3 - 4 per can) and the flesh is delicately soft (though not watery, as it can be in other brands). This is the Spanish / Portuguese way of preparing sardines, and it is excellent. Mildly spicy (peppery) -- but definitely not "hot".<br /><br />You can have this fish just as it comes out of the can, or enhance it. A recommended way of serving it is: Break the fish up into smaller pieces, and add lemon juice as well as any (or all) of the following: thinly sliced scallion or onion, parsley, chopped olives, oregano. Voila -- a quality mediterranean antipasto dish. Great with beer or white wine for those so inclined.<br /><br />Note also that this particular brand goes by more than one name: "Blue Galleon" appears as the "brand" on many online sites -- but does not appear on the cans. The cans show the brand as "Bela". Which can cause confusion.

review/summary: Creamy and Tangy
review/text: I love Duke's mayonnaise. Recently, it has become available everywhere in Houston, but it wasn't that way a year ago. I used to order from them directly by the case, and I was delighted to find out a few months ago that amazon now carries it at a a very competitive price. Unlike one of the other reviewers, the expiry on the mayo isn't for almost two years, so I am confident I will be able to finish the four containers well within that time frame.<br /><br />Taste. I think people tend to like the mayo that they ate as a kid. I certainly didn't have Duke's as a kid (miracle whip!), but the taste to me is second to none. It has a rich flavor with a tangy kick to it. My mayo of choice before was Hellman's, but this kicks it out of the park.<br /><br />Texture. This is thicker and richer than any other mayo I've ever had. The closest in thickness was Hellman's.<br /><br />Check out Hellman's ingredient list: Soybean Oil, Water, Whole Eggs and Egg Yolks, Vinegar, Salt, Sugar, Lemon Juice, Natural Flavors, Calcium Disodium Edta (Used to Protect Quality).<br /><br />Duke's Ingredient List: Soybean oil, eggs, water, distilled and cider vinegar, salt, oleoresin paprika, natural flavors, calcium disodium EDTA added to protect flavor. Contains: Eggs<br /><br />Water comes later in the ingredient list of Duke's, and is completely evident in the mayo.<br /><br />I am happy that Duke's is now available locally, but Amazon is my go-to when I want to stock up.

I had never had "bought mayonaise" until I was in high school, as my Mother always made it at home. I also never dreamed how hard it is to make, keeping the perfect drop by drop of the oil, steady, constantly beating it into the beaten egg yolks, salt,pepper, dry mustard-then gradually adding the lemon juice, then in a nano second-it goes bad--and you have to start all over! Dukes gives me my Mom's mayonaise in all its creamy, tart, glory--Thank you, Dukes!

review/text: I make mayonnaise once in a blue moon.  It's really not hard in a food processor, but it's so much easier to pull a jar out of the fridge.  A friend insisted Duke's was the only bottled mayonnaise worthy of a homegrown tomato sandwich--the standard by which all mayos are judged. He was right.<br /><br />Duke's has the depth of flavor, the creamy tang, the slightly oily texture and ivory color of homemade mayonnaise.  It's simply sublime.  I caught my raised-on-Miracle Whip husband eating it out of the jar.  There is no higher praise.

review/text: I grew up on Best Foods / Hellmann's. I've tried others in the past few years but they simply could not convert me. I loved Best Foods however I think they may have changed something because it doesn't taste as great as it once did. Or maybe MY tastes have changed. It's still my first choice however just haven't enjoyed it as much.<br /><br />I saw this on sale, read the reviews, and thought I should try it. Am so glad I did. It is very neutral, not sweet, and not salty like other brands. I made some burritos the other day and decided to make a chipotle mayo with this. Opened a can of chipotles grabbed a couple (careful they are spicy), mashed them up then added some mayo, mixed it then strained it to get all the chipotle seeds and skins out. You can add a little sour cream or Greek yogurt and lemon to heightened it even more. Unfortunately I was out of sour cream and fresh lemon, however it was still good. :)<br /><br />Can't wait to make a honey mustard sauce with it next for some baked chicken tenders in panko bread crumbs. Yummm.<br />Will definitely buy this product again as long as the price stays decent.

review/summary: I don't get it?
review/text: Everyone raves about this mayo, saying it's the "best". Some have said it's like the way Hellmann's used to be before they watered it down. Well I bought the 4 pack of 32 ounce jars and had high expectations. When I received the order, I opened the first jar and dipped the tip of my butter knife in to give it a taste sample. I did not like it at all. It tasted almost sour. It sort of had a mustard like after taste. I tried it on my favorite deli roast beef, and in my opinion, it ruined it. The after taste is unpleasant. I even tried to use it for tuna salad. It was awful! I don't get it? My jars are not out of date. I guess I just don't appreciate this brand like many others do.<br /><br />I have recently rediscovered Kraft mayo and I am happy that they reverted back to their older recipe. It is creamy and delicious. I will stick with that.<br /><br />I have three jars of Duke's left, that I will donate to our local food bank so that it doesn't go to waste. I know I will probably get a lot of heat from Duke loyalists, but what can I say? I just don't like it!

review/text: So I've been toying with the idea of using Amazons "Subscribe & Save" feature for our mayo for some weeks now. I'm a Ga. Low Country G.R.I.T.S who grew up on Dukes. No other mayo surpasses it in flavor, taste, or quality. I was nervous though. I mean mayo through the mail, really. What if it gets hot or the experation date is past? So I continued to purchase it in store until two weeks ago. I walk in the store and find out that the price was $4.99 for a 32 oz. jar. I think in my head about Amazons price for 4 jars and that I could set it on a three month cycle. So I did it and I am so glad I did. The mayo came to me fresher than in the store. It doesn't expire till well into next year. My ony complaint is it gets sloshed a bit in shipping. The jars wheren't upright in the box. Do the subscribe and save yourself a bit of cash.

review/text: Without question, Duke's is the best prepared mayonnaise you can buy. The trick is, it's generally not available in groceries outside of the Southern US. Thankfully, the Amazon grocery department carries these 4-packs of the quart sized containers of Dukes. [There was a time earlier this year it appeared to be discontinued on Amazon - glad to see it back]<br /><br />Sure, it's great on sandwiches, burgers or hot dogs - but where Dukes really shines is in chicken salad, egg salad, and the crown jewel - pimento cheese. Use it once and you'll taste the difference. Thanks for carrying it, Amazon.

review/text: Love the fact it is sugar free! Tastes just as good as my former favourite brand. Please stock it in stores to the north.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LPSKPS">Duke's Mayonnaise, 32-Ounce Jars (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Hold the Mayo!
review/text: If you love mayonnaise with a cheap, high school cafeteria twist, then this is the one for you. Absolutely no pep! It totally disappears on sandwiches. I have had it within my household three times (not my doing), and the third time was definitely not a charm. Go for Hellman's if you want that perfect tang.<br /><br />Update on 4/8/12: I was recently informed that this mayo has no added sugar.
