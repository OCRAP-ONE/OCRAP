review/summary: Not a good idea for my dogs.
review/text: Thought this sounded like a great idea for my two little dogs....In fact such a good idea I purchased two packages--one for each dog. No way would my dogs touch them.  I even tried soaking in beef broth.  All attempts in vain. They would not try. A bad idea for this household.

review/summary: My dog almost choked to death on this product!
review/text: I have two yellow labs, ages 12 and 11.  The 12 year old nearly choked on one of these "treats" whole.  I had to reach down into her throat and retreive it.  After chewing on it for about 15 minutes she tried to swallow it and it was still very whole and got stuck.  I don't recommend these for any older dogs whose teeth may not be able to handle chewing these.

review/summary: Choking Hazard
review/text: Please be careful with this product. My pug almost died today choking on one of the dog chews. I assume that the larger and smaller ones are fine, but my pug who weighs about 16 lbs (within the 11-25 lb suggestion) could not swallow the chew and got it stuck in her throat (after she chewed it until the point when it got wet and pliable). Thank god that my wife and I were in the living room to witness the accident. My dog fell over in convulsions while choking and my wife physically yanked the chew out of the dog's mouth. I think that this sized chew is very dangerous and you should think twice before purchasing it. If you do have a similar dog and want to buy this product, please supervise him/her!

review/summary: My dogs love this...and it's good for them too
review/text: A former vet tech of many years, we recommended CET chews to our clients. Back then, they didn't contain chlorhexiderm, but were quite effective as a dentrifice for dogs. With the added chlorhexiderm, they've only improved! My dogs find them just as palatable, but with the added benefit of anti-microbial properties most chews don't contain, it's something I can feel good about giving them.<br /><br />My dogs really enjoy these treats. I don't give them daily, just a few times a week. I strongly suggest pet owners be present when pets are using a chew. These should not be used a pacifier when you are away. Supervision is always a good idea as you never know if choking could occur.

review/summary: Poison
review/text: POISON "Chlorhexidine" POISON<br />We have two beautiful Saint Bernards. After using these for some time, it began to be a routine that they would BOTH have to go outside to vomit after their supposed morning treat and dental care. We investigated this chemical that the package warns you about, "Chlorhexidine" and stopped using the ignorantly designed dog hating treat. No more sick dogs.<br />If anyone likes their Dog at all, they will READ the package. Notice first the ingredient,  "Chlorhexidine" then the warnings.<br />There's good vets who don't sell these, and BAD vets who like the profits.<br />Of course, Pharma and all their "vet/doctor" salesmen will say this product has been tested, used for years, found to be safe in thus and thus quantities, and on and on.<br />Well, the chemical Chlorhexidine is used to KILL bacteria. GOOD AND BAD!<br />It's used pre-surgically, washing the body and prescription only mouthwashes.<br />Your dog, like all living beings has a body especially a digestive tract, FULL of very much needed bacterium.<br />The company knows this, and to protect themselves even warns that "serious" problems may occur, especially if your dog "licks" the surface first? Wow, and how is a dog supposed to NOT lick a dog chew he's sucking on for hours and yet consume it?<br />Do some research on what this stuff WILL do to your dog people. Unless your trying to euthanize your dog with a long, painful, and; "conveniently- racking up a massive vet bill to diagnose" and non treatable death sentence, STOP FEEDING THEM THIS POISON.  And YES, they are the same "intellectual scientists" who've managed to put half our nation on "safe for you" psychotropic drugs.<br />Ironically, "prolonged use of this poison will cause tooth discoloration," leading to possible other side effects of tooth decay."<br />Japan stopped using "Chlorhexidine" on catheters and other medical devices in 97' after many became sick and one died.<br />Causes numerous (still discovering more) problems with cats. Deafness, respiratory problems, in 96 in Mitchell South Dakota they discovered it was the cause of a plethora of severe issues with cats and had to stop using it. The believe it was from the cats "grooming" it off their coats after surgery. Too many problems to report here, do your dog a favor and do your own. And don't look get your information from the doggy sites. Look up the problems with the chemical. Is it like declawing your animal? "And they tell you it doesn't hurt them when they rip the dew claws out at the puppy age?" Yeah, I'd like to declaw a few vets (Pharma salesmen) and have them give me a report?<br />Most importantly, you do not want to kill ANY bacteria in your dogs system. PERIOD, that's why they've generally for so long, been so healthy, let's not screw that up as we have our own body's with infections causing Irritable bowel diseases etc.

review/summary: Great for Dogs Teath
review/text: My Vet recommended these for my dogs.  They completely remove the plack from the dogs teath and eliminated very expensive cleaning of the dogs teath.  It also eliminates putting the dog to sleep while cleaning the teath.  I take my dogs in about once a year and my vet looks at the teath and just says they look great - no cleaning required.  Before I found these, the dogs teath had to be cleaned about every 2 years.  Plus my dogs love the flavor of these.

review/summary: Please be careful.  These chews pose a strong CHOKING HAZARD.
review/text: These chews come in a wide range of sizes and thicknesses which means some chews will be easier to chew than some of the others.  I have a German Shepard/ Lab mix and she is now almost 4 and is a really strong chewer.  I really wanted this product to work because keeping my dogs teeth healthy and clean will help her living longer.  My dog choked on this so badly that she couldn't clear her own throat and luckily I was watching her to notice that she needed help.  I reached into her throat and pulled it out.  Stupidly, I thought this would be a one time deal so I gave her more of these and just a few chews later she ripped off another large chunk and choked on that again.Since it was so far down her throat I could only shove the piece down and it cleared her throat.  She laid in my lap for 30 minutes after that incident.  I threw the bag away and wrote a review and there were many other similar events like mine.<br /><br />Please be cautious and watch your dog if you think these work for you.  All it takes is one treat to choke on to create irreversible damages.  The manufacturer has very minimal consequences if your dog dies because of their C.E.T. chews.<br /><br />I have purchased the other types of these exact chews, but this company creates different listings for the same exact product because the other listings have poor reviews.  Also, if you look at most of the reviewers who give this product 5 stars only have 1-5 reviews...that makes me suspicious of those reviewers as it seems they are some how motivated to give this product a 5 star review.  Most of those 5 stars reviews are not even confirmed as actually purchasing this product.

The dogs didn't care for them and they don't last but a minute.  I tried both the plain ones and the HEXtra Premium with Chlorhexidine.  They like both of them but I think prefer the taste of the ones with Chlorhexidine.  And, they don't cause the problems that the rawhide chews do...I recommend.

review/text: My dogs love these and they are great for the teeth and breath!  However, they have an odd smell when the dogs are working on them -- kind of like a not-so-great-smelling beef stock.  Kind of icky.  So having this scent in my living room for the period of time it takes them to chew these is rather off-putting and I am looking for another chew for this reason.  If the dogs had a doghouse or were going to chew them outside, it would be five stars from me, all the way!

But I had to travel quite a distance to my Vet. So I scanned Amazon to see if I could get them anywhere else.  Luckily, Amazon had it listed with a double pack (30).<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, especially since it it Vet recommended and my picky dog loves them.

review/summary: Highly recommended as "treat" with added oral benefits
review/text: I have 2 male Cavaliers, ages 5, 25lbs, and age 2, 11 lbs. My 5 yr old dog gets yearly cleanings but he was still getting bad breath type issues; the little one just turned 2 and he doesn't have these problems - yet. I decided to buy this product because it can be substituted for treats and contains Chlorhexidine which the Vet said is a special added ingredient needed for good teeth and breath.  I strongly believe the chews have substantially improved my dog's breath.<br /><br />Besides the oral benefits, the dogs are very happy when I ask them if they want "chips" (which is what I call the "chews".  The dogs lick them all over and I'd say for every 2 out of 3 they will keep at the chip until gone.  It takes over a few hours for the bigger dog to finish one. Be advised that these chips have a really strong, pungent odor but absolutely do not leave stains on fabric which is really important. Over time I've come to like the odd smell.<br /><br />The only thing I strongly dislike about the product is its really hard for me to open the bag; it is sturdy plastic with a resealable plastic zip but its so tight near the pull apart zip that it's hard to get to open.<br /><br />I recommend this product and order two bags at a time. The Amazon pricing is good and I'm a prime member (which I love).  I hope this review helps.

review/text: I purchased this type of enzymatic chew to help control tartar build up on my dog's teeth.  I even verified that the additive Chlorhexdine is safe by contacting my Vet. I must say that my dog loved these chews  but they made her very ill for several days after just the first one.  She suffered from runny bowels and vomitting. The clean up alone was dreadful and so time consuming.  Of course, she's worth it, but I would never want to put her through this kind of debilitating experience again.

They said I have to buy them at the Veterinarian's Office. My chihuahua and I are very happy to be able to buy them through Amazon for a better price, and no hassle. Delivery was unbelievably quick. Yes, my dog is small, but he can chew like the best, and the "small dog" size just doesn't do it. I also like the idea of having that extra (hextra...very clever) ingredient for his teeth, as I hear that small dogs tend to get more tarter than bigger dogs. Milo is one year and NO tarter!!

I've tried playing with it to entice them but to no avail.<br /><br />The reason I give it 2 stars is because obviously, not all dogs like the flavor. Also, when my dog chewed it the first time, it turned the fur around her mouth and paws yellow... ick.<br /><br />From other reviews, it looks like most dogs take to it pretty well but I just know the potential drawbacks.

However, when I received them each chewie was half the size and paper thin.  These were not fit for a very small dog, let alone a medium dog.  I threw them away as I would not take a chance that my dog would choke on them.  I then decided to call the company.  I was told that they were aware of the problem and needed to do something with their quality control.  I ask her where they were made and she told me Mexico. BE WARE.

review/summary: Great oral hygiene , bad smell
review/text: I ( my dog ) have been using CET chews since we got him.  Previously was using the smaller stick when he was a puppy, but needed something bigger now that he is older.  Like the other CET sticks, he has great oral hygiene, good breath, nice white teeth, and no problems at the vet.  The only downside of this particular product is the SMELL.  My dog likes to sit next to me and chew it and I have to cover my nose.  It's an odd, nauseating odor that can fill the entire house.  I probably wont be buying these again for that reason, but will go back to the sticks without the odor.

review/summary: Great Chews..but watch out!
review/text: I have been purchasing these chews for our two American Eskimo dogs (miniature and a toy) for years. My dogs really enjoy them, as soon as I go for the package they become excited. One thing to watch out for: particularly thick chews. Usually there are 2-3 chews that are thicker than the rest and very hard. I didn't catch this and one of my dogs broke one of their teeth on it. I still buy them, but I go through the entire bag and remove the thick ones.

review/summary: Poor quality control
review/text: My vet recommended them for my dogs which are around 20 pounds each and just will not let me brush their teeth.  They love them.  As with any rawhide chews, I only give them to the dogs when I am around to make sure they don't choke.<br /><br />I have two dogs, so when I came out with only one chew at the end of a package, I started counting the contents of each package.  I have found between 28 and 31 chews per package. There are almost never 30 chews as stated on the package.  I thought that perhaps they were packaging them by weight instead of count but that turned out to be not true.  The weights of the various packages were considerably different.  I called and they just said to return the short packages to my vet for a refund.  I did this once and as a result the vet opened and counted the three packages she had on the shelf -- they had 28, 29 and 31 chews each.<br /><br />There is also a large variation in the size and color of the chews.  Some are very light and some are quite dark.  I currently have one chew that is 1"x1.5" and paper thin, one that is 2"x3" and 3/8" thick, and one that is 2.5"x4" and 1/4" thick.  Some packages had mostly large ones and some packages had mostly small ones.<br /><br />I don't know whether they really help the dog's teeth or whether the chemical is bad for them.  But I do know that they have a serious quality control problem at the location in Mexico where they are produced/packaged.

In addition, I brush their teeth with C.E.T toothpaste 2 to 3 times a week.

review/text: I did not realize that these Chews come in two different versions, one is flavored and one is not flavored. This version happends to be flavored/scented. They smell like ass. They also make my Bulldog vomit a disgusting slimy mess. They do not seem to adversely affect my smaller dog. The smell alone will prevent me from purchasing this product in the future. I will be certain to  order the ones that do not read HEXtra and contain Chlorhexidine.

review/text: These chews were recommended by out vet.  They do the job of cleaning dogs teeth and of course my two dogs love to chew.  I think these are better than the standard plain rawhide chews you find at any pet supply store.  The enzyme does seem to make a difference in helping keep the teeth clean.<br />The only negative is that all three bags I received had more small-sized pieces than medium.  If you have an avid chewer -- like my beagle -- get a mix of medium and large chews.

We are having some pretty good success with diverting our new pup's chewing/teething habits from our furniture to these doggie treats. They are also good for the dogs, unlike the cow hide chews that sometimes cause torsion in dogs or the ropes that also cause intestinal problems.

review/text: I have a schipperke and what is supposed to have been a schipperke and they both love these.  It takes them a good 10-15 minutes to chew them apart.  The only downside I'd have to say is the horrendous smell.  I can only describe it as a rotting pumpkin stench that I get to endure each time I open the bag. I had bought this type of the CET chews by mistake as the bag looks very similar to the ones in the plain white bag when you're not looking closely to the image and when they arrived I thought maybe the company had just changed the packaging.  That thought was gone the moment the bag cracked open.  If pungent odors are an issue for you, you may want to look into the CET chews without the chlorhexidine.

review/summary: Not sure I can keep giving these to my dog
review/text: I have a German Shepherd puppy (14 weeks old) and bought the medium sized ones because I thought she would be forced to chew them and not swallow them whole.  I was wrong. She chews on them until the flavoring on the outside is gone and then swallows them whole---regurgitating it until she is able to swallow it.  So now that I know that, I take them off of her when I start to hear it and throw them out.  I probably shouldn't give it to her at all but Im hoping that eventually she will just chew them completely.  I don't want to waste the whole bag, which is pretty expensive. But technically my dogs loves getting these.....<br /><br />On the other hand, I have an adult yellow lab that loves the large ones.  She is used to chewing raw hide and pig's ears so she just chews it right up with no problem.

review/text: I always buy the Dingo brand mini bones. My dog loves them. She gets one after dinner every night. I never let her have a rawhide bone unless someone is with her. My Vet told me that I should give my dog these instead because they help reduce plaque build up on the teeth. The Vet even gave us one of the larger size strips. My dog did enjoy it and had no problem chewing and swallowing it. I found these on Amazon at such a good price, I ordered a bag for medium dogs. After chewing on one for a short time she started swallowing a large piece, choking on it, throwing it up and then starting over again. I took most of it away from her, but she still had a small piece that seemed to be a bit stuck in her thought and it took her a while to get down. She was fine; I didn't have to rush her to the vet butafter this experience, I will never give her these again.  We are back to the Dingo mini bones.

I have older dogs, and one had almost no teeth, but she *loved* chewing on bones.  So, I tried these, and she was a happy camper, because she could gum the chewie right along with the other two dogs--no competition or feeling left out :)

review/summary: Great product
review/text: C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews with Chlorhexindine, Medium Dogs was recommended by our vet because our dog was beginning to have some tarter on her teeth.  He sold us a small package, & the dog loved them. We were able to get a package twice as big from Amazon for only a couple of dollars more. Our dog still loves the chews, & her teeth look very clean.  We have recommended the chews to two other dog owners and their dogs have been as happy with the chews as our dog.  I would much prefer to purchase the chews than have the dog put to sleep to have her teeth cleaned.

review/summary: Skinny, Boney, and Juicy (Lemon That Is)
review/text: In the politically correct age in which we live, "skinless and boneless" sardines have invaded supermarket shelves promising an appropriate and civilized eating experience. If that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. These are the real thing.  And as they are definitely the anthesis of skinless and boneless, I guess we need to name them for what they really are, tell it like it is, and refer to them as skinny and boney. While this may sound a bit rough around the edges, well, what the heck.<br /><br />Before going any further I have to disclose that I eat sardines every day for lunch. I've tried `em all, and these plump pilchards are right up there among the best.<br /><br />Generally I've operated from the premise that Portuguese sardines are superior, but these are increasingly expensive and sometimes hard to find. So when the local gourmet food store forgot to place my order I looked for an alternative and came across this Spanish substitute. At this juncture my knowledge of geography stood me in good stead as I realized that the Atlantic waters off of Portugal are contiguous with those of Spain, and clearly the fish know no boundaries in between. How different therefore could they be at less than one third the price?<br /><br />This seemed too good to be true and when I noted that they are packed in a combination of soy and olive oil rather than olive oil alone, my suspicions were aroused. Subsequent research into the matter uncovered the finding of the American College of Chest Physicians that soy oil contains omega 3 fatty acids. Sardines themselves are rich in these most beneficial substances so immersing them in more of the same could only seem to make a good thing better. And, with the addition of lemon (a real lemon slice right in the tin) the eater also benefits from the intake of vitamin C.<br /><br />Anyway, to cut to the chase I'll simply say that these fish taste great.<br /><br />I do, however, perform a quick dissection prior to indulging.

review/summary: flavorful, delicious, amazing
review/text: recently, my husband brought home one can of salt-free sardines in water (can't remember they type, but none of the brands listed here).  i had been watching the BBC Blue Planet series recently, and all that footage of sardine feasting by the various ocean predators must have lodged somewhere in my subconsciousness, because i eyed his can of sardines for 2 days before i could take it no longer, and i just wolfed it down by myself (so selfish- i know).  Even though i have always liked canned sardines, i just had stopped eating them years ago due to my unfounded fears about mercury levels (turns out sardines have among the lowest levels in the ocean for an omega-3 rich fish), and just plain laziness/ life getting in the way/ other things to eat....anyway, i digress.<br /><br />i looked on amazon and found a case of reese skinless boneless saltless in water (my husband is on a health kick), and roland skinless boneless saltless in water--both the cheapest on subscribe and save.  after ordering these two cases, i thought, well- i actually like oil packed. As an accommodation to my salt-avoiding husband, i also ordered the crown prince brisling oil/no salt.  BUT, just to round out my midnight sardine buying spree  (that one can- or maybe the Blue Planet series- really wet my appetite, i guess), i also ordered these Viga oily, salted, skin and bone fish for myself.<br /><br />ok. well.  i've eaten nearly (my husband stole some of one can as i was scarfing) 4 cans of the viga since yesterday when i got the shipment..... i know it's not good to have too many omega-3s, so i'll try to control myself now.  But,  YUUUUUUMMMMMM!!!!!!  i went back on-line today, and ordered what turns out to be the last case... sorry folks.  i'm really hoping Amazon brings these back.  i can't believe how delicious these Viga lemon are.  the slice of lemon (in the can, as noted by one reviewer) is similar to the moroccan preserved lemon (i love moroccan food)-very soft, very mild, nearly sweet lemon slice.  the flavor of the fish is a thing wonderously oily and richly satisfying- as only skin and bone can add, i believe.  Although I also liked all the other sardines i bought, the no oil, no salt, no skin and no bones....well, it's a health thing i guess- but i prefer those with hot sauce or onions or mustard, etc.... the reese and roland also tasted like tuna in a can- not bad for that kinda thing- i was thinking i'd need to actually mix them with mayo for a sardine-fish sandwich - again, not bad- still feels good after eating, but not something quite i'm craving-- unlike this viga with lemon.  i think i could eat this everyday, easily.  quite delicious.  Re: the brisling crown prince variety, i think those who like the size/shape and lightly smoked "traditional" flavor will like the crown prince.<br /><br />I enjoyed one review (can't remember which sardines) from a guy who mentioned that he started his cat on sardines, and that his cat is like a "new cat."  I love these so much--- i wonder if i'll become like a new cat?<br /><br />anyway, if you like, as another reviewer said, "the real thing,"  i would highly recommend these.  Since i'm not an expert on spanish sardines, i just don't really know if these are not as complex as yet another reviewer noted (see other non-lemon Viga reviews)-  but, all my Viga cans and boxes were clean with expiration dates (unlike the reese) and, i thought they were just super scrumptious fabutastic.  if these are the less flavorful /less complex types of spanish sardines, i really will make an effort to try other varieties!

They actualy taste pretty good.<br /><br />Nine cans to go, and quickly.

review/text: I spent considerable time in Spain and became accustomed to the fine tinned seafood from Galicia.  These sardines fit the bill.  They are not the tiny brisling sardines, but larger fish.  While olive oil is better, the oil used for these is deliciously light.  I add a squeeze of lemon juice to enhance their delicate flavor.  I'm hooked again.

These are lighter in flavor, and the subtle taste of lemon is nice. I will likely order these again.

review/text: I purchased the Vigo Sardines in oil with lemon based on the reviews in Amazon.  They are quite good.  The Sardines are tender and there is a bit of actual lemon in the can.  I love the fact that they smell a lot better than sardines I am used too.  From what I have read the difference is that these fish are canned soon after they are caught.  I usually have them for lunch at work and my office does not begin to smell like a fish market.  The fish have an almost salmon like color on the inside which is visually appealing.  I have already purchased 20 more tins!  And the price is right.

review/text: Product information says it's in olive oil -- not so; it's soy oil, which is very different indeed (far less attractive: soy oil isn't healthy; olive oil, naturally, is). Other than that, it's very tightly packed with fish, and the fish is very firm (I've never seen such hard sardines). The taste is nothing special, not smokey as sardines usually are. Someone below says it's boneless -- the guy must be blind, 'cause it's very much with bones (as canned sardines should be). Overall, it's an OK product but not quite as good as I expected. I may or may not reorder.

review/text: I was hoping to find a gluten-free gravy comparable to traditional gravy for my own personal Thanksgiving dinner (I'm the only one in my family who is gluten-free, and I couldn't ask the host to make a wheat-free gravy just for me). My own attempts from scratch have been okay in flavor, but lacking in appearance or consistency (they either looked like white gravy or were lumpy), and the gluten-free mix packets have been a flavorless disappointment. So when I found this pre-made gravy, I was ecstatic. I thought it had to be better than the packets and my previous attempts. I toted it to my sister's house on Thanksgiving and heated it just before dinner. Before I was about to slather it all over my Thanksgiving plate (I LOVE gravy. LOTS of gravy)...I grabbed a spoon and took a pre-dinner taste-test.<br /><br />OMG, I'm glad I did. It is absolutely disgusting. It resembles NOTHING of real gravy except the color. The taste is a cross between Elmers glue, melted plastic and candle wax. I couldn't allow it to touch any part of my plate and went the entire holiday gravy-less (and was not happy about it).<br /><br />I don't write many reviews, but I can't believe anyone thought this stuff deserved a package and a price. I threw the entire box out, and I am better for it.

review/summary: One of the best
review/text: For those who don't know, cacao nibs are small pieces of the cacao beans from which chocolate is made.  They are roasted much like coffee beans, and even have a somewhat similar nutty flavor, in addition to being chocolatey.<br /><br />If you like dark chocolate and you like it crunchy with nibs, this is one of the best.  It's like the gourmet version of a Nestle Crunch bar.  The nibs are evenly distributed at a density level that adds the perfect crunch without being overbearing, and provides a snap of darkness that contrasts somewhat with the sweetness of the chocolate in which they are embedded.  My other favorite from Endangered Species is the 88% dark panther bar.  This one is a little sweeter than that, since it's only 72% cacao, so it should be more palatable to people who find that level of darkness to be a bit too much.

review/text: I've long been a fan of the Endangered Species Chocolate company, and have tried all of their dark chocolate bars, and several of the milk chocolate.  This one, though, has the all-round best chocolate flavor of the line, and honestly, of any dark chocolate I've ever tasted.  I wouldn't necessarily call it intense . . . it's a full, nicely round, not-bitter-at-all, dark chocolate.  The cacao nibs lend a lovely little crunch and touch of nuttiness, keeping the mouth feel interesting and satisfying.  It's just sweet enough to do the job, and yet has just a little over half the sugar of comparable brands (Newm@n's Own, anyone?).  This is a chocolate connoisseur's treat. No fluff, no sugar-overload.  Just chocolate.  Mmmmmm . . .<br /><br />Now, if I could just buy them by the gross . . . ;o)

review/summary: Great Bars
review/text: I have been eating the Endangered Species bars for several years and had not ever tried this particular flavor. I really have been missing something special. The Nibs add a special flavor and crunchiness - Friends I have shared them with love them. Just one more way we can play a role in the survival of endangered species.

review/summary: Not the best
review/text: Im not a fan, I bought the ones with and without the nibs, and I dont like either.  I didnt know what nibs were, but I dont think they enhance the chocolate at all.

review/summary: Yet more false advertising
review/text: I'm sorry, but I just have to be honest.  This chocolate has no flavor of bat in any way shape or form.  I did a review of the chocolate from the same company with the chimpanzee on the label, and noted no flavor of chimp in it.  I was forced to give it a one star review, but did try to be fair and say the chocolate itself, if it was sold as JUST chocolate was fine.  Now they continue this trend of such false labelling and have no bat flavor in this chocolate.  What gives?  Yes, as chocolate it's fine, much like the so called chimpanzee flavored bar I tried earlier this year, so consider this a four or five star review if the lack of bat flavor doesn't bother you.  But doesn't a chocolate bar with let's say raspberries on the label contain a raspberry extract, jelly or something else with raspberry flavor?  Why wouldn't one with a bat on the label contain no bat flavor?  I may try the other chocolates by this company, I'm curious to see if the one with the panther on the label does taste at least like some sort of cat, if not an actual panther.  But I am disappointed yet again by this company.  If you're going to claim to flavor your chocolate to taste like animals, include the animal flavor!
