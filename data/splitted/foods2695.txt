review/summary: Love this Tea!!!!! My favorite - better than any coffee!
review/text: I love this tea!  It's spicy and wakes me up in the morning without feeling like I'm drinking something unhealthy.  Plus it's filled with antioxidants so this is good for my health too!  I only wish they'd put it out in K-cups so i can use it with my Keurig coffee maker - which I'm shamelessly plugging as the next best thing on earth!

review/summary: My all time favorite black tea, no question.
review/text: I've had around a dozen different brands of store bought black teas, and TAZO is by far the best. It is a dark, spicy tea, more spicy than typical brands. Without sugar or honey it is quite bitter, probably undrinkable to most (including myself). If you don't enjoy putting sugar or honey (or whatever) in your teas, I would not recommend this purchase. I highly recommend this tea with a tablespoon or so of honey, you will NOT be disappointed.

review/summary: Does not stick to your bedpost overnight
review/text: This is the story of a girl...a girl who went through two sets of braces. A girl who spent most of high school unable to chew bubble gum. Before I got the first set of braces, I was a bubble gum fiend. My favorite Easter candy was that little mini egg carton filled with bubble gum eggs. Still is, to be honest. But after two sets of braces and a TMJ surgery, I was firmly broken of the habit of chewing gum. If I'm offered a piece, I take it, but I don't tend to buy it. But when I do, I buy the bubble gum flavor...is there anything better? It's another one of those flavors I associate with childhood and so this brings up all sorts of good memories, even at first whiff. Bubble gum ice cream, does anyone remember that? The rainbow ice cream filled with little gum pieces...it was two treats in one! Two treats that made two separate royal messes! I also broke my nephew of bubble gum at the age of 3 (he's 13 now). I wasn't thinking and his folks said he could have a gumball, so I gave him one of mine. Filled with Shocktart powder. He won't touch the stuff now, ha! I should feel guilty, but I bet his dentist thanks me for it.<br /><br />Anyway, bubble gum has a very fond place in my heart, and it brings up all kinds of memories. It was another of the new matcha flavors that immediately hopped into my cart and I had to try immediately. And I'm so glad I did. It's definitely the bubble gum ice cream of bubble gum flavors, a rainbow of different tastes and flavors, but under the single heading of bubble gum. Generic bubble gum. Not the teeth-rotting super sugary kind, but the Bazooka Joe kind that loses its flavor too quick. Except this tea doesn't lose any of its flavor. Oh gosh, it's good. My brain keeps trying to make me chew the tea, it tastes so much like bubble gum. I wish I had known about this when I was younger! I keep going back for sip after sip. It's taking definite willpower to put it down long enough to write this review! I want to blow bubbles with it. I get the feeling this would make amazing cupcakes, maybe with cotton candy icing. Yum, yum, yum. Definitely a staple in my cupboard.

review/summary: Cardiologist recommended
review/text: I have been using rice bran oil since my cardiologist recommended it in the Spring of 2010. Rice bran oil has the highest phytosterol level. Search: List of Foods (with High Phytosterol)That Help Lower Serum Cholesterol.<br />This oil has almost no taste except for a very slight nutty taste. I use it for all my oil needs except for occasional use of olive oil for taste. This brand has the best price point and is also available in 1/2 gallons - which I use to refill the attractive 12.7 oz bottle. The more you buy the more cost effective the shipping expenses so I buy a few 1/2 gallons & share with my mom.

Like the price value very<br />much so will continue to order in the future.<br /><br />This oil is easy to cook with it - so far no burning/odors from cooking with it.<br />Have really gotten used to the taste of it - even use it on popcorn.  A very light oil textured<br />which I like.

review/summary: Very addictive coffee candy
review/text: This candy comes very close in taste to a real cup of double latte, though a tad sweeter. This does contain caffeine, so its not a decaf alternative to coffee, and its definitely not recommended for kids.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Great tasting coffee candy; a good caffeine fix<br />2. Hard toffee, so it lasts a long time<br />3. 20 calories per toffee, which is not too bad<br />4. Individually wrapped pieces<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. All the cons of regular coffee; overuse can cause headaches, dehydration, digestive dependence, restlessness, sleep disruption, stained teeth, bad breath and caffeine crashes<br />2. Very hard, brittle candy that is sometimes broken with sharp edges; I've hurt my tongue on occasion<br />3. A little sweeter than I'd like<br /><br />I ordered a 20-pack from Asian's Best through Amazon. Great value at roughly 2 bucks a bag including shipping.

When I got the candy and was surprised to find that it originated in the Orient.  I received the candy early to the delivery date and it is just as I have ordered.  The candy is definitely based on coffee and tastes like a cup of Cappoccino, Bustello or Cuban Coffee.  This buisness shows a great care and responsibility to it's customers' needs.  They are an excellent supplier of the Kopiko Expresso and Cappucino Candies.

And, just like the previous reviewer's, the results I received were inaccurate: "Community 12-pack" (at a much higher price than we'd paid). I'll update my review once I've scanned and checked a few more products, but so far, I'm not as "wowed" as I have been with previous buys from these guys. ...P. S. - After writing all of the above, but before hitting the 2nd round of "Publish Review" buttons, I discovered that the result info had changed! Now, it's telling me that my 18 ounce box is only a 4-pack of boxes, instead of either the 12-pack it had originally said, or the individual package it actually is! (V-e-r-r-r-y interesting...)

review/summary: Rishi Organic Golden Yunnan Loose Tea
review/text: This tea has become the staple in our house. The flavor is bold enough, but never bitter. It stands up well to double brewing. In fact, my husband drinks mostly the 1st brew, and I drink the 2nd brew, with less caffeine, but it tastes great. We have tried double brewing at least 5 other varieties of tea, but they don't hold up- they come out flavorless and watery.<br /><br />The other nice thing about this Yunnan variety tea, is that it tastes great black (husband's preference) or with milk and honey (my preference).<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea. It is our all around favorite for everyday (we don't regularly drink coffee).

review/text: THis is a FINE tea. I also recommend highly their Keemun. I've other tea sources, that I enjoy for their highly elevated, fine qualities in flavor and all that is the tea experience for the very serious tea afficiando. BUt they are very expensive. This is comparable to Yunann teas that cost three times or more the price of this one.<br /><br />The one thing I offer, you don't need as much of the leaves as the purveyor recommends. Only about 1.5 tsp. is enough for a full, big 8 oz. cup to produce a marvelous tea, and steep only 2.5 minutes, precisely, not 3 or more minutes... that will produce a tannic tea that is loses the sweetness that is inherent in the tea brewed a short span. Then, sip and find heaven in a cup. And Yunnan is great for that feeling we all want, uplifting, invigorating, without the nervousness that might come from coffee. Though, must add, love my coffee! Yes, I'm a caffeine fiend, but it is legal!

review/summary: high quality tea
review/text: I don't usually put much stock in manufacturers' product descriptions, but Rishi nails the description of this tea: "Robust, smooth and malty with sweet-caramel finish."  It's not as malty or quite as full bodied as Assam, but is has a deeper, more complex flavor with a very distinctive candy-like sweetness, and just a hint of dryness/bitterness.  I think I've heard that some Yunnan black teas taste peppery, but this doesn't taste peppery to me.<br /><br />Rishi says that this tea can be steeped multiple times.  This is true, but unless you use a large amount of tea with a short first steeping, the second steeping tends to be much less flavorful and more bitter than the first.  I prefer to use a little less tea with a longer steeping time, and just get one cup per batch of leaves.

review/text: I was not impressed about this product (Made in China). Cheaply made and not very good quality. Outside was coated with redish brown sweet something which stained the carpet.  My dog first tried to lick the coating and then bit the "bone".  It was like hard leather, more than bone, and left a mess of shreds about as well.

review/text: My little yourkie absolutely loves these treats. He chews all the chicken off first, which I think helps keep his teeth clean, and then goes to work on the rawhide.<br /><br />GREAT product, but the packaging wasn't too great. The bones were falling out when I got them... a little concerning.

review/text: My 30 pound puppy goes crazy for these, he really loves them.  He's just in heaven when he's chewing on one of these, but they only last about 20 minutes.  If you're looking for something that lasts much longer than a biscuit but doesn't need to last for hours like other rawhide treats then this is perfect.

review/text: These are very delicious and very addicting, they do not taste like dark chocolate however. It's more of a milk chocolate with a kitkat wafer like crunch. Definitely a great candy bar for all ages.<br /><br />My only complaint for them on here is the price..<br /><br />You can get these a lot cheaper if you can find them (in a store outside of Europe or a European store).<br />I happen to live in a very European influenced neighborhood in Brooklyn and these cost $10.99.

review/summary: My Picky Cat Loves It!
review/text: My cat is a picky eater. I ordered this product because I was concerned about my cat's nutrition as she has recently started losing her hair. My vet recommended weaning her onto a healthy, high protein, wet cat food. I had been feeding her cheap dry food.<br /><br />My cat absolutely LOVES this stuff! As soon as it arrived, I opened a can of it, just to see what it smelled like. THIS STUFF SMELLS FINE! I think that is smells BETTER than most cans of cat food that I have opened. It does NOT stink-up my house at all.<br /><br />My cat does not usually eat a whole 6oz can of wet cat food in a day, but she will happily gobble up as much of this as I give her each day! I HIGHLY recommend this product to any one looking for a healthy food for their loved pet.

review/summary: Saved my Cat!
review/text: Two months ago, my 11-year-old kitty began to vomit after every meal. She had been on a prescription food for FUS (feline urinary syndrome) for seven years and had never had any trouble with this food.<br /><br />I tried sensitive stomach food, which didn't work, then another recommended food, which also didnt work. I tried diluting the foods with water. She lost a lot of weight (and couldn't keep anything down! I went through three bottles of spot cleaner!) but she still seemed to have some energy and was getting water,  After almost three weeks I was ready to submit to vet bills, which I couln't afford. (Thought it might be hairballs but could have been food allergies or something worse.)<br /><br />I read somewhere about Dick van Patten's Natural Balance, and tried the Ultimate formula, canned. It's been eight weeks, and my kitty hasn't thrown up since the first time I gave her this food. She has lots of energy now and has gained back a good portion of the weight she lost. No exaggeration, this has been for me like a miracle.<br /><br />I don't know what the reviewer who said there was a smell was talking about, because there is no smell! (Maybe he was trying the fish formula, which should smell like fish?)<br /><br />In fact, this food contains only human grade meat and veggies. Again, my cat loves the food. I have also used the Hairball Mgement formula, and that first week she liked that, too... now, she doesn't eat that alone, so I mix a smaller amount with the Ultimate formula and that seems to be fine.<br /><br />I am very grateful to find this food and, having read some about cat nutrition, I feel confident that it is nutritionally very good.

review/summary: No more "crazy cat"
review/text: My cat simply seems to have fewer issues while on this food. She also likes it. I give her a small can of wet at night, and the rest of the time she grazes on the Ultra dry. Whenever I tried to tighten the budget and switch to cheaper supermarket stuff, I would notice a behavioral change in her. She would get twitchy, like her back was all itchy, and she would alternate between slinking around then running really fast, eyes wide and ears back with her hair all sticking up. It was like she was possessed. Kitty exorcist stuff. She doesn't do that ever while on quality food, though. I guess I'll have to cut the budget in other ways. Cats are obligate carnivores that are used to eating whole prey items, or whatever they can catch and get in their mouths. It is not easy to give an animal like that what they need. You really can't skimp on their food and be sure that they will remain in good health. Lesson learned for me!

review/summary: Healthy but...
review/text: I started to do my research on good cat food so i could soon ween my kitten off of formula. They sell this at the pet store I worked and it was a little cheaper than the Wellness brand. So I started off with the Natural Balance cans and my kitten was doing just fine. However, I did notice he was never too enthusiastic about feeding time. I decided to chip in a couple more cents and get the wellness food and it's like he's CONSTANTLY hungry now.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if the cat likes it, thats great because it's just as healthy. BUT my cat prefers the taste of Wellness a LOT more.

review/summary: My kitty prefers this over NB's salmon formula BY FAR
review/text: I bought two packs, salmon and ultra. My cat became obsessed with Ultra, and refuses to eat salmon. He actually refuses to eat anything else but Ultra, though he was never picky in the past. Since I have a huge pack of Salmon, I am tricking him into it (by mixing 50/50 with Ultra)... Let's see how long he will buy into it.<br /><br />UPDATE: it's been 4 months since I tried it. The kitty is now happily eating 3 different formulas (Ultra, Salmon and Duck with green peas). He looks wonderful, the fur is shining he isn't loosing it much. I tried the dry food too (chicken), but that did not work: the kitty developed a bad allergy with lots of ugly pimples on the face, which went away after I eliminated this dry food. Normally, he is eating chicken products just fine, but this one definitely did not work.

review/summary: Great food for my picky cat!
review/text: I just adopted a cat from the shelter, but she seemed underweight. For the first few days, she barely ate anything. I thought this was due to the spay operation she'd had right before joining us, but a few days later, she still barely picked at her food, whether wet or dry (the shelter told me she was fed dry food). However, she always seemed very hungry (she kept trying to eat crumbs from the kitchen floor). She would even come into our bedroom at 2 and 6 am to meow loudly. I'd try to feed her, but she would eat a bite, then decide she wasn't going to eat any more.<br /><br />Frustrated and worried, I researched this product and picked some up locally. She can't get enough of it. Whereas before I was lucky if she ate 2 ounces of food, she now eats everything in her bowl. Since she's still a kitten, I feed her as much as she wants. I'm really grateful for this product, which I think will help get her back to a normal weight.

review/text: I'll begin by saying that my cats have a voracious appetite. They are under a year old. 10 months? They can eat an enormous variety of food. For this reason I was flabbergasted that they (both) smelled the food and walked away! Then I tried mixing it with a dry cereal that they love, NOPE, that didn't work either. So i allowed a good 20 hours go by without feeding them and again nothing. They would have starved before eating this stuff. The packaging is also what got me. They threw in a couple of cans they were dinged up and no labels. You couldn't place those on a store shelf, but hide them in the box for an unsuspecting online customer? Sorry can't rate this even one star. The worst part is I have another shipment this time "chicken and liver" from the same company. I'm praying.

review/summary: **Awesome Bonsai Umbrella Tree**
review/text: I purchased this Bonsai directly from Brussel's since I didn't know Amazon carried them at time of purchase. This was an anniversary gift for my wife and she absolutely loved it! According to the Brussel's site it is 5 years old. Here are the details of the purchase.<br /><br />Packaging: I was very impressed overall with the packaging. The box was much larger than I thought it would be and was quite heavy overall. Upon opening, the box was filled with foam peanuts which were surrounding and within the leaves and branches. After removing the peanuts I noticed the leave were green and not one had fallen off during shipment. The base was well wrapped in bubble wrap and tape and it was clear it had been well watered before shipping. The outside of the box had been marked with "LIVE PLANT". I couldn't have been more pleased with the packaging.<br /><br />Plant condition: If I hadn't unpacked the plant myself I would never have known this plant had just been shipped via UPS or Fedex during the middle of Summer. The plant was larger than I expected, with the planter measuring 10"x13" and the height from counter to top of the tree being 17". The leaves were lush and shiny green and the planter soil was still moist. As I previously mentioned, I found no leaves that had dropped during shipping.<br /><br />In the weeks after arrival the plant continues to do well and I've noticed new growth. We've placed it next to a plate glass sliding door that faces west where there is ample sunlight all day.<br /><br />Based on this experience I will definitely look to Brussel's and Amazon for my next Bonsai purchase.<br /><br />Big Red

review/text: This is so wonderful, I eat it by the spoonful. It needs no crackers, bread or anything. Although, I like it on toast also. It is very good if you make cocoa bark (with xylitol)and mix in some of this barney butter. It cures the chocolate peanut butter cravings.

review/text: Peanut allergy in my home.  I used almond butter prior to the peanut issue came to light, but never knew it could be this good!<br />It is very hard to locate any nut butter that is peanut free.  My hats off to the makers of Barney Butter for keeping it safe for peanut allergic folks.<br />Yeah to Amazon for Finally offering this as a subscribe item.  I now get the chunky and smooth sent each month.  We can eat a jar per week.  Both kids eat it by the spoonful mostly.  Huge savings buying it here, to buy one jar at Whole Foods puts you back $7.99!  OUCH!<br /><br />Give it a try, well worth the price.

review/text: For those of you who are peanut butter lovers and thought nothing could top peanut butter---SURPRISE!<br />Barney Butter Crunchy Almond Butter is the best!<br />It is smoother than peanut butter, has a very nutty taste and supposedly is healthier for you.<br />Even if it isn't healthier, I would still be eating this like it is "not-good-for-you" junk food.<br />I've even skipped the bread or crackers and spooned it out of the jar for a low-carb mini-snack.<br />It is soooo delicious that I should be buying this by the 12-pk if it was sold by that amount.<br />Maybe next time, I'll get four three-pack jars.<br />Bon appetite!

review/text: I loved peanut butter all my life.  On warm toast in the mornings, it didn't get better.  But something happened and peanut butter doesn't like me anymore.  I've tried so many other butters since and not found anything to replace peanut butter........ until now.  This Barney Butter has the exact same consistency of peanut butter.  You will not know the difference.  It has the same color as peanut butter.  It even has the little nut nuggets to make it crunch like crunchy peanut butter.  I will buy this again and again.  I cannot believe how lucky I was to run across it at Amazon.  I would totally recommend it to anyone who is looking for a peanut butter substitute.  You WILL NOT be disappointed.

review/text: I first bought barney butter because we learned our daughter has a peanut allergy. After testing, it turns out she is also alergic to almonds.  So, I now just eat barney butter at work.<br /><br />It tastes great, doesn't stick to mouth as much as peanut butter and I am guessing is more healthy becasue it is almonds.

review/text: This is easily the best testing almond butter I have tied, and I've tried quite a few. Note, however, that it does contain evaporated cane juice, which gives it a very lightly sweeter flavor. If you're looking for something that is 'just almonds', this is probably not the right product.

review/summary: this almond butter= awesome
review/text: I have always been a fan of nut butters. I have tried more then I can count. Peanut butter, cashew butter, sunflower seed butter, walnut butter ect, organic, raw. You name it I have gone out of my way to try to. Many of these expensive most not worth the price. I was very pleased with this product. Not only for the amazing taste but also with the price amazon sells it at. Without the subscribe and save it is still way cheaper than other almond butters in the stores. After i finish up these three i will get it sent to my house once every two months and save the additional three bucks. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an alternative to peanut butter. I put this on my toast in the morning. I look forward to it with my coffee. A great buy.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I was a little hesitant about trying this because for one, it only came in a 3-pack (and what if I didn't like it) and two, at 7.61 per jar, it's a little expensive compared to only about 3.00 for Skippy and 4.95 for Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter, but cheaper than Full Circle Organic Almond Butter which comes in at almost 10.00!  Regardless, I thought I would give it a shot.  I am so glad I did because this stuff is just delicious, absolutely better than any peanut butter I have ever tried and as an added bonus, it's better for you.  That said - it's not just simply almonds.  It does add evaporated cane juice (sugar) and a little salt.  It also adds palm fruit oil, but that particular oil is actually quite healthy for you so I don't mind.  I read in another review that they contacted customer service and discovered that they don't include the skins.  This explains the color and taste.  However, while you still get a good source of monounsaturated fat, calcium, vitamin e and magnesium, you're missing out on many of health benefits only found in its dark skin.  Therefore, I would still recommend that you try to eat whole almonds and other nuts but Barney Butter is still a very healthy option and I did I mention it's so very good.  I love this stuff!

review/text: I wanted to try something healthier than peanut butter.  I was also hoping that the other reviews were right about the taste.  Indeed!  It's low in sodium and saturated fat, and it really tastes superior to any peanut butter I've ever had (including the natural ones)!<br /><br />You get three little plastic jars, which is actually kinda nice because they're easily transportable.  You can throw one into just about any bag or purse.  Also, it doesn't need to be refrigerated or stirred.<br /><br />I love chunky, and this almond butter certainly doesn't skimp on the chunks.  I will certainly buy more when I run out.  So far I've tried it with low salt rice cakes.  Yummy!!!  This Barney Butter is a wonderful addition to a healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />Even after expecting a pretty good product, I am pleasantly surprised with how extraordinarily good it really is.

review/summary: Not 100% Almond Butter
review/text: You get what you pay for: Barney Butter contains Palm Oil, which is a saturated fat, and sugar. Palm oil production causes substantial and irreversible damage to the environment. Unfortunately, I didn't read the nutrition information until I'd already opened one of the jars, and now I have to figure out what to do with the two remaining jars. If you're trying to steer clear of saturated fats and sugar, find a different product. Trader Joe's carries 100% almond butter, and you can buy Maranatha, Sunland and some other unadulterated almond butters at Amazon.com.

review/summary: Deliciously dangerous...
review/text: The almond butter itself is very scrumptious. I personally eat it by the spoonful! In fact, my first jar was devoured within the first day of arrival!<br /><br />Anyway, my almond butters seemed to be contaminated. After my first jar, I continued on my second jar; which was contaminated with what I believe to be salmonella or something really bad (I've done research that led me to this conclusion; lots of recalls on nuts!). The contamination caused me to vomit violently along with persistent stomach aches. THe third jar seemed to be have the protective seal broken with pinkish-oily material spread all over under the cap.<br /><br />Be careful purchasing any nut based products as of now! There are many reports of recalls and salmonella outbreaks, especially almond-laced products!

It is, indeed, delicious and the best I've eaten to date. It's creamy like peanut butter and spreads the same way. Perfect to spread on apples or any other fruit of your choice. The roasted crunchy texture is great for making plant based desserts as the bits of nuts work throughout the whole recipe and there's an almond crunch in every bite.<br /><br />Try it ! You'll be glad you did !

review/summary: quite different almond butter, too much like peanut butter!
review/text: I love almond butter, and was excited to try Barney Butter based on all the positive reviews--but was really disappointed when I received the product. I don't usually write reviews, but Barney Butter is quite different from any other almond butter, so thought I would share:<br /><br />1) it's very watery/oily/runny, with large chunks of what appear to be blanched almonds--stirring it up didn't help the consistency; 2) it looks just like crunchy peanut butter, (plus with all the salt, tastes much more like it too)--honestly, as someone with a severe peanut allergy, I found myself a bit apprehensive to eat it because of this, I definitely would not have it around kids that I was trying to teach to stay away from peanut butter--I wouldn't have risked tasting it at all (anaphylactic shock's not too fun!), but they do have it clearly labelled as produced in a peanut-free facility; 3) by the monotone color, (and comparing it to the other almond butter I usually get) it looks like they used blanched almonds--by missing the skin, I'm assuming I'd be missing out on a large part of the vitamins/nutrients I get by eating almonds; 4) more sugar and oil than most other kinds of almond butter out there; 5) the taste is kind of bland--not as much depth as other brands.<br /><br />If you are looking for a copy-cat peanut butter substitute, I think you'd be happy. But, I would rather go with other dry-roasted varieties that are healthier, don't make me feel like I'm eating peanut butter, and have a better taste! (Plus, with a name like Barney Butter...I feel like they're just trying to snag the preschool market & feel kinda silly having it on my shelf!) Hope this helps!

That's how good this stuff is.  I'm back for my third order.  My favorite is the crunchy.  They are very generous with their almond chunks which I love so much that I just eat it with a spoon. It's not too salty or too sweet.  As long as their standards stay the same I'll keep buying it. Do yourself a favor and give this a try.

Almond butter, due to its monounsaturated fats and ldl cholesterol, can and should be a very nutritious substitute for peanut butter and even butter. That's why people buy it (aside from its amazing flavor)!  What are these people thinking?  So disappointing (and gross).  I don't know if I can give this stuff away.

review/text: If you love chocolate, get yourself a box!  The flavors are distinct and most unlike the usual chocolates you may be used to. Buy, buy, buy!

review/summary: Not as creamy as it should be.
review/text: The bonbons were not as creamy as I had in Brazil.  Possibly processed (Dried out) for long lasting export, or old stock. Also the mix did not include a favorite of mine PELE (Large round multi chocolate) I will not be reordering.
