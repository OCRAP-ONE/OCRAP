review/summary: Tiki Dog north Shore Luau
review/text: Don't let these little tiny cans fool you.  They pack a lot of food.  When you dish it out you can see the seafood, vegetables, brown rice. etc.  It smells like it is seasoned and my dogs love it.  I used this quality food to help my little "portly ballerina" doxie with her weight problem.

review/text: Both my dog and I love Tiki brand food.  She gets excited every time we open a can for her and I feel good about ingredients that I can clearly see and identify.  As another reviewer pointed out, they pack a lot of real food into these little cans, which are the perfect meal size for our dog.<br />I only wish that Amazon carried more variety in the small cans with Prime shipping.

review/summary: Very impressive quality
review/text: I am very concerned about quality of ingredients in dog food and have been shopping around for a while.  Yes, my chihuahua is now very picky and spoiled so much that I was actually boiling chicken breast and mixing it with her dry food so that she would eat.  Not any longer.  TIKI is one step above this - as soon as I opened the first can for her, she passed up the chicken breast and gobbled up the TIKI.  She makes me want to actually try it!  I am now a dedicated TIKI customer and will be ordering it all the time.

review/summary: these grains are working great for me
review/text: I was a little doubtful when the amount of grains seemed small, but I followed the instructions and started them in milk right away.  The first couple of small batches smelled a little "off" to me, more like sour milk, but I fed them to my dog who loves kefir mixed with her food.  The instructions I got with the grains indicated that they need 5 days to recuperate from shipping and that they should be in milk to recuperate--no problem for me with included instructions.<br /><br />As time went on, actually not much time less than a week, the batches smelled better and I began to eat the kefir myself.  YUM  The grains continued to grow, and in less than two months I started giving some to friends who say they are working great.  I was surprised at how fast the grains grew!  They are good, healthy grains.<br /><br />I should mention that I have used mostly whole-fat raw milk, but also used some whole-fat non-hormone milk when I ran low on raw milk.  Also, I make sure that I rinse the grains with filtered water that has no chlorine or other toxins to the grains.  I do not use any metal for making kefir, and I ferment the kefir in a closed kitchen cabinet using a glass jar loosely covered.<br /><br />Typically, I make a smaller batch for me that I let ferment a shorter time, and a larger batch for my dog that I let ferment longer.  I have "stored" the kefir grains in milk twice in my refrigerator for a couple of days, and their activity does not seem to be affected. I am enjoying my kefir and the process of making it!

review/summary: Got Kefir?
review/text: You will have delicious kefir in no time with these robust kefir grains!  I had been making kefir from the powdered starter for about a year before I discovered that it was an inferior product.  I ordered these grains because the seller said they would "grow like wildfire".  Well, guess what?  He wasn't kidding!  The grains started bulking up within a few days and are now producing my first batches of "real kefir".  The difference is amazing.  If you are contemplating buying these grains, don't hesitate.  The sooner you order, the sooner you too will be enjoying the health benefits of this delicious drink!

review/summary: finally threw it out after poor results.
review/text: I'm a novice with kefir, but very experienced in kitchen and have worked with fermented foods in past.  The biggest problem may have been the sketchy and unclear instructions.<br />I'd heard about letting grains rest after transport, so I did this, leaving them in package at room temperature.  Man of Genius (questionable!) didn't say to put them in milk right  away, so I waited around five days.  He also didn't say anything about proprotions of milk to grains.  I wound up with a vinegary, smelly milk, so foul my partner said it smelled like someone threw up.  I did a lot of reading on the internet, and kept trying, using more milk.  One day I had these little cauliflowers, then they flopped into little bumps on top of the milk.  I bought more grains, this time from Kefir Lady, who sent a generous quarter cup and excellent instructions.  They're growing like  crazy.  I decided today that Man of Genius grains were a waste of milk and tossed the lot down the sink.

review/summary: Standard Kefir directions do not work with this product
review/text: When I received this product it came with the wrong directions, but hey, in this modern day the internet can fix this situation... except that it can't. I tried several you tube videos, many blogs, they all seemed to have the same directions for milk kefir grains. These directions did not work for my purchased grains, and I did try a number of times. I gave up because who really has the time to trouble shoot something that should be very simple.<br /><br />After being contacted by the seller (who seems concerned and helpful) I learned that with this product you really have to let the seller guild you through the process, hold your hand, because their grains are just that much more potent then anyone elses. Also, you shouldn't expect to be able to drink more then 1/2 a cup every week or two because these grains are just that potent.... of course after 4 rounds in milk my grains didn't grow... so maybe mine weren't that potent.<br /><br />In the end I didn't have a lot of time to commit to dealing with Lifetime Kefir. If you want yummy digestible kefir instead of milk in your smoothies and on your granola DO NOT BUY THIS, buy another product, with instructions, that seems to match other's opinions of what kefir's potency should be for someone who enjoys it.<br /><br />But if you do have the time and you don't like to drink a lot of Kefir but want the benefits this is PERFECT for you. The seller is very responsive and helpful and very concerned with your happiness. But you do have to take the time to have a conversation over email instead of just looking up the solution yourself.

The quality of the beans is great, in my opinion...and of course I love that they are organic...but as another reviewer said - I thought the beans were out of date. I THOUGHT they were out of date, but after contacting the company though edenfoods.com I found out that the dates are just confusing on the packaging. When I saw "Best Before: 12DE07" I figured they expired December 12, 2007. The customer service representative that contacted me said the first two digits represent the year...meaning my beans are good until December 07, 2012.

review/text: Eden Organic makes amazing products, including beans in BPA-free cans.  They're careful with their sources and with their packaging, so I don't mind paying a little extra for products that I trust.<br /><br />But the price still seemed like a lot to me for beans, so I went to my local food coop to see what they charged for organic beans.  It was the same price per pound for loose organic red beans, and that was the only kind of organic beans they had.<br /><br />The beans themselves are good quality and cook up deliciously.

review/summary: These beans won't sprout
review/text: I usually always spout my lentils and grains if I have time.  I just like to make sure that my food is still alive, it reassures me that my food is fresh and was stored well. I dislike that conventional spices you buy in the store have been irradiated, I know that it poses no threat, but if I wanted to spout some of those spice seeds I would not be able to because they are dead.<br /><br />Sprouted beans are also supposed to be easier to digest and have higher amounts of vitamins.<br /><br />I bought these black beans expecting the best quality but when I went to spout them only about 5% of them sprouted.  It makes me wonder if they have been stored under optimal conditions.  Usually beans that are close to their expiration date or past it will not spout very well either. The date on the box is still good so I don't know what is wrong with these.<br /><br />This is not the quality I would expect from this company, I will not be buying these again.

review/summary: uneven texture after cooking
review/text: I soak black beans overnight and use a pressure cooker to cook them. I've had very poor results with this brand time after time. Some beans are overcooked and mushy while others are undercooked and crunchy. I've tried different soaking times and different cooking techniques with the pressure cooker and always end up with beans that aren't evenly cooked. I've had other brands cook up just fine, so the only thing I can think is that the issue is with this particular brand.

review/summary: Beans, beans...they're good for your heart...the more you eat...the more you (well, you know)
review/text: The cost is slightly more than if I were to purchase from my local grocer, but in the area I live in, the dry black beans seem to fly off the shelves. I've also never seen this brand except for their canned variety's so figured I'd give it a shot. 6lbs of beans....hmmm, did I think that through before buying? No...lol, but since I'm trying to cut back on the meat intake and just eat better...I think this will work out fine. I could live off just beans and rice really since I did the all vegetarian thing for about 3 weeks...didn't love it, but tried it and know what I like now if I went back to all veggie again. Remember to wash & soak the beans!!<br /><br />***I opted for the subscribe and save option too since it brings the cost down to just about what I mentioned at the beginning...thought I'd throw in a little free love to Amazon.

Check the dates before you open them. I just cooked one package of beans before thinking to check the date.  I thought that would not even be an issue since I was ordering them direct.  What is going on here?  Mine have such old dates that I don't know if I should use the rest of them.

But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.

review/summary: Bitter Grass Clippings
review/text: I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea "leaves" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.  A green tea that I do like is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/summary: Tastes like a Campfire!!!
review/text: The product description says, "assertive, dark, smoky fragrance and flavor" and they ain't kiddin'!!!  It barely tastes like tea at all... more like they took a cloth, let it hang in campfire smoke for a week, soaked it in hot water and wrung it out into my mug.  Seriously!<br /><br />I've tried taking half of a pinch of this and adding to other tea leaves when I brew a pot. That turns out pretty good.  But straight? You'd better like wood smoke!

review/summary: Daughter's first choice
review/text: My adult daughter is "into" saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea "the old fashioned way".  She realized with the first brewed cup that loose tea has a much fresher, intense flavor than teas in a bag. I doubt that she will go back to using tea bags again and will probably research and request more Stash tea products in the future.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a "premium" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.

review/summary: Go for Pinhead Gunpowder instead...
review/text: Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.

review/summary: Very Bergamot-y Tea!
review/text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: "Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it."<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****

review/text: I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.

Off the well-beaten and ordinary tourist path. Beautiful people. Possible to take the train (or a flight) from Kolkata [Calcutta.] Large parts of Assam are blanketed with beautiful tea gardens. Stayed at a tea garden in Assam on one of my visits there. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand.

review/summary: Great Green Tea
review/text: I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

review/summary: Good product
review/text: Most Earl Grey teas taste similar. This product has a sense of freshness that reflects Earl Grey at its best, and is reasonably priced. To those who do not regularly use loose tea, the tea bag (Teebeutel, sachet) definitely does not taste as crisp and refreshing as the comparable tea when brewed as loose tea.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.

review/summary: Its good!!
review/text: *rolls eyes at other reviewer* of course its going to smell like a campfire they roast the tea over pine and its awesome!!! I love this tea, but their suggestion of one teaspoon is a bit conservative for black tea you usually do one tablespoon per cup not a teaspoon, its up to preference but i love this tea and the fact that it reminds me of camping is a plus! it makes me feel good, and it tastes great too!

review/summary: Decent tea for a moderately picky tea lover
review/text: I am not a real connoisseur of loose teas, but I do like decent black tea with no added flavors, just loose black tea like indian or ceylon teas or maybe some blends like irish or english breakfast. This is a perfect example - relatively inexpensive but good tasting with full, rich flavor. Perfect for someone who would not settle for teabags, but is also not into exquisite expensive teas.

review/summary: Jasmine Green Tea.
review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx

review/text: I recently started drinking loose tea instead of bags. I was buying the jars from my health food store, but they are pretty expensive. I am always looking for a better deal, so when I found these on Amazon, I decided to get them. I gave one to my mom, and one to my brother. I kept one for myself and I think it is going to last me awhile. Since I don't know all that much about teas, I can't comment much on the quality but as far as I know it is good! It seems comparable to the same stuff I got in the smaller jars. Recommend :)

review/text: I have been searching for the 'right' balanced English Breakfast Tea for a few years now. Other than actual English Teas from London, England, it was very difficult to find a rich and aromatic English Breakfast.<br /><br />After trying out at least 20 different varieties, including some very expensive brands, I've found this to be the perfect cuppa in the morning. Personally, loose leaf seems to taste a lot better to me, and I've not tried the tea-bag variety on this one.<br /><br />Hope others enjoy this tea as much as I have.

review/summary: I always come back to this tea
review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.
