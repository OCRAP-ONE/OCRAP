review/text: I love the Senseo Coffee, dark roast especially.  My son introduced this coffee to me years ago and I have worn out two Senseo coffee pots.  When I had lung cancer, I heard that coffee was a good thing.  And I have my pot going almost all the time, loving the dark roast flavor the best.  I carried it with me when I flew to Texas and when the water holder was damaged, my daughter in Texas bought me a new Senseo pot.  When the handle on the top was broken, my son bought me another pot and for Christmas we bought a Senseo pot for another son who loves the French Vanilla. We love ordering from Amazon, as we cannot find the product locally.

review/summary: Senseo lover
review/text: My first experience with Senseo style coffee was shortly after the manufacturing of the machine. I purcahed one. The coffee was excellent...much better than other machines, very close to the experience of getting a European (Italian) style coffee...froth and all. I have since purchased 3 Senseo coffee makers and everyone is blown away by the quality of the coffee produced. The dark roast is my favorite of the entire selection, followed by the decaf!  Try it, you may like it or even learn to love it!

review/text: This product is not the best for flavor, but the earlier price per cup was reasonable, at about $0.28. Now, however, the price seems to have escalated to more than $0.33 per cup, and for that I will abandon ordering prefilled pods & just resort to using my ecopods and coffeeduck. Amazon, you have disappointed by not keeping prices within reason.

review/summary: Keurig pods vs Senseo
review/text: I actually love both systems but I find the Senseo coffee to be easier on my stomach without a loss of flavor. The Senseo pods are much easier to composite given there is no plastic in the container, just paper. However, the fact that there is somewhat less of a mess with the Keurig pod, consumers are more apt to go with this convenience than with the recycling aspect. Alas, we can not find Senseo in our supermarkets anymore.

review/text: I love the sumatra, but since this product just keeps getting more and more expensive everywhere, the best price I found was on Amazon. And it was a really good price at that.  They shipped the first box of 6 packs and UPS broke the box, and put 4 packs in a UPS box and shipped that to me...3 of which were broken open inside THAT box.  I took a picture of how they tried to sneakily (is that a word?) ship only 4 packs to me.  It was sooo obvious.  I called Amazon and they reshipped a new box of 6packs immediately.  GREAT customer service!

review/text: I don't know what I expected.  Coffee pod systems all seem to be geared to someone who prefers weaker coffee than me.  I can reduce the water, but then I get a smaller cup of coffee and it starts being less cost effective.  Plus, the Senseo coffees (both medium and dark roast) are bitter.  These aren't horrible, just mediocre, and they do have caffeine in them and are quick and convenient, so 3 stars.

review/summary: Warning: Pods are NOT available........
review/text: I have been a very very loyal Senseo drinker since my first machine over 7 years ago.  I purchased the new Supreme model in Oct '11 when my old one was wearing out and then Consumer Reports rated the new model the top one for pod machines.  I would have purchased it from Amazon but the Senseo website was selling them for half price!  Too good to be true it turned out....as they stopped selling the machine several months later and on April 1st the pods were no longer available in retail stores.  So I kept purchasing pods thru Amazon.  Until May....when I saw that they no longer in stock.  And no longer in stock anywhere online....including the Senseo Store on their own website.  Well I just called Senseo today, June 7th, 2012, to complain and they said they they "should" have coffee pods back in stock mid-June.....and they said Amazon "should" have pods the 1st week of July.  That wasn't good enough for me.  They sell (and then stop selling) a coffee maker and then claim they cannot supply the coffee pods due to operations problems and changes with their manufacturing.  I love my Senseo brewer a lot but it is too much of a struggle to get the pods....or wait for them....and I am not convinced that this won't be the case again the future.  So the people at Senseo (Sara Lee, Inc actually) helped me make a decision.....that I will be disposing of my 8 month old Senseo brewer next week when my current pod supply runs out and I will be replacing it with a new K-Cup machine.

review/text: From all the original Senseo Coffee Pods, I like this variety best.<br /><br />I follow the rules and prepare it using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XQZFBK">Senseo HD7003 Espresso Pod Holder</a> - that means it will be a smaller cup (not really as little as an Italian Espresso shot), but you can always use your regular Pod Holder, if that is too strong for you.<br /><br />The prepared coffee has a nice Crema and great taste. In the morning I heat some milk in the microwave and whip it using an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001RT1OS">Aerolatte Frother</a> to make a very quick Cappuccino - the way I like it :)

review/summary: Senseo Abandons US Market
review/text: Apparently, Senseo has decided to abandoned the US market. It is nearly impossible to find Senseo at any of the traditional retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, or Target. Walmart is carrying Melitta brand pods that work in the Senseo, but the quality is not as good.<br /><br />It is interesting to note Amazon continues to list the Senseo brand in email blast, but the items are always out of stock. I wrote Senseo customer service about the issue, but they failed to respond.<br /><br />I'm going back to Costco brand ground coffee and the old reliable Mr. Coffee or Bunn for the morning jolt. I refuse to buy into another expensive pod or k-cup single serve system that changes as often as Gillette changes razor blade models.

review/summary: Good coffee, but let's not pretend it's Kona coffee
review/text: This is one of the better tasting Senseo pods out there, but it is not Kona coffee.  It contains only 10% Kona coffee, the other 90% is something else.  If you want Kona coffee, go buy Kona coffee.  This Kona "blend" won't taste anything like it.<br /><br />Names aside, as I stated this is one of the better tasting Senseo pods.  Four stars are based on rating Senseo coffee.  It would get less stars if I was just rating "coffee".

review/summary: medium roast = medium good
review/text: Senseo pods are very convenient and reasonably priced--I only wish the brew was a little more "tasty".  Since I don't like dark-roast beans/coffee, I ordered the "medium roast".  Much to my surprise, it is TOO mild for me!  This is particularly so since a pod really is only intended to make an 8 oz. cup of coffee.  My coffee maker allows me to use up to 12 oz. of water and then it's really way too mild/weak.<br /><br />The Senseo pods are ordered by the case, so it's going to take me a long time before I can try a stronger brew.  My recommendation is to be sure and try all the flavor options before ordering a full case of pods.

review/summary: Okay, but not great
review/text: The Kona blend pods are okay, but a bit weak and lacking in "bite" like the coffees I prefer. My favorite of the pods was the Espresso Blend, which is no longer available in the US.<br /><br />I've tried using the "coffee duck" as a substitute for the Senseo pods... and it works okay with a good, finely ground coffee, but it's much less convenient than just tossing a pod into the coffee maker.  And the "duck" doesn't produce the trademark foam on the coffee surface.  Melitta Dark roast is another alternative for those who like a bit more coffee taste, but the Melitta is not as good as the Senseo Espresso Blend was (when it was still available).<br /><br />My understanding is that in the very near future, the existing US supply of Senseo pods will be exhausted and users will either need to find a replacement or move on to a different type of coffee maker... maybe a Kuerig machine or, when it's available, the new Starbucks Verisimo machine.  I believe the latter is slated to be on the market in time for the 2012 Christmas holidays.<br /><br />I hate to see the Senseo machines go... and I believe the pods and the machines are still being sold in Europe... but due to some corporate mergers and non-compete agreements, we are about to see the Senseo line come to an end in the US.  (If my facts are wrong on this, please, post something to let me know!)

review/summary: Glad they are available now
review/text: Because there was a period last spring when I couldn't get the Senseo pods anywhere, I was thrilled to find some at Tesco (large grocery chain in England).  I bought a large quantity to bring home with me and the best news is they make a mug size pod (you only use one instead of two).  The other nice thing about the European product is they use nicer paper for the pods...it has a silky quality.  Any chance of getting the mug size here?  I prefer this product to Keurig etc as it is much more environment friendly, not to mention cheaper.....although the price has really gone up since it disappeared from the supermarket shelf.

review/text: We've had the Senseo coffee maker for a few years now and really enjoy the coffee.  I like the dark roast (purchased) and my wife enjoys the decaf.  It seems other competitors are gaining ground in the local stores and the Senseo coffee pods are less and less easy to find.  Or, if you find them they are priced higher than usual.  We're really glad we located this product and vendor online through Amazon.  Hopefully, our Senseo coffee machine will continue to last and the pods will continue to be made available.  The only "complaint" we've ever had is that the decaf flavors are very limited.  Otherwise, love the coffee!

review/summary: they're back and as good as before!
review/text: After a long absence, Senseo dark roast coffee pods are again available.  I had heard they are made by another company,not Sara Lee, so I wasn't sure they would taste the same. I ordered them again from Amazon.com (I was previously on their subscription plan, in which they would automatically send me a 6 pack every month, but then Amazon cancelled it--lack of supply from Sara Lee).<br /><br />Good news, the coffee is the same, delicious!  However, in the many months of absence of the Senseo pods (did they think I was going to stop drinking coffee and wait?  Lol, NO!), I found another brand that is comparable, just as good, but just about the same price:  Baronet dark roast makes pods that are also excellent coffee.  So if Senseo again stops production, I have another brand to fall back on. Bottom line, Senseo coffee is back, it's still delicious, but I don't trust them to stay in production, so I have Baronet as my back up plan.

review/text: I have not been happy with my order. I love this Senseo coffee but cannot find the Sumatra flavour in the stores.<br />My first order was disappointing.Apart from two of the bags, every bag had one pod with a tear in it making it unusable. The other two bags... one had no torn pods and the other had two torn pods.<br />So I am averaging one unusable pod per bag which bumps up the cost of the coffee. I find this unacceptable but will see how the second order pans out as I have already received it.If I have the same problem I will cancel future orders and buy my coffee elsewhere.

review/summary: Senseo Coffee Pods
review/text: If you like a rich dark coffee, Sesseo Sumatra Blend is really great without being bitter.  While the pods are expensive compared to ground coffee in a coffee maker, we believe that this is equivalent to coffee you would buy at Starbucks and you have it at home.  We also like Senseo Dark Roast, but actually we did not like and do not buy any of the other coffee offerings from Senseo.

review/summary: Smooth, Rich Blend, simply the best!
review/text: Our Senseo coffee machine was given to us as a house warming gift, and we have loved from the first time we used it!  The dark roast coffee pods seem to taste so much better than any other brand or flavor I have ever made from home.  The dark roast blend is simply the best. It is smooth, rich, and brews so quickly in our new machine, it's fantastic.  I suggest using stevia powder as a natural (and chemical free!) sweetener with this blend, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ">30 Grams (1.06 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a>.  I don't even use cream anymore, no kidding!

review/summary: Finally, a great cup of coffee
review/text: I have tried them all...all the brands on Amazon, that is. Some have been less than thrilling and some pretty good. The Senseo Espresso Coffee Pods are the best I have found. You can make a great cup of coffee...I wouldn't really call it espresso with the convenience of a pod. I read a tip somewhere on Amazon about wetting both sides of the pod and it was the best tip I got in 2008. The resulting coffee is rich and full flavored, without bitterness. I think I will stick with Senseo Espresso. I did not use the special espresso pod, just the usual one pod holder, and it worked fine.

review/summary: The Best.....the price?
review/text: We were among the first owners of a free Senseo coffeemaker way back like 10 or more years ago. We have a white machine in our laundryroom & then bought my husband a black one for work.  Soooooooo I guess you could say we looooooove this coffee/method of making it, & medium roast is the best. I recently saw Douwe Egberts non-pod coffee @ a local gourmet shop & it was like $9 something for 12oz! Good to know one can get the coffee to use in a regular drip pot as well, however, @ that price, I guess we will just continue to have this as "treat coffee" via our machine.<br />All this being said, I would like to say that @ both Target & Walmart here in Buffalo, NY area stores, I can get the pods for $4.24 each. However, when Target in particular, wants to rotate stock, they mark it down to the wonderful price of $4!!!!! Needless to say, I buy them out, go to another store & do the same. That's almost $4 less for 6 bags than Amazon sells it for!!!! I encourage all of you Senseoholics to do the same & check out the above mentioned stores. I wish Amazon would stop reminding me it's so cheap, when they don't mark it down to Target's level.

review/summary: Can't find Senseo coffee, here's the story
review/text: Years ago Philips and Douwe Egberts were partners in the development of the machine and coffee pods.  The copyright on the pod system was ruled invalid and a decision was made to offer the pods via on line vendors only; no more brick and mortar stores.  Philips then sold their share of the coffee business to Douwe Egberts and are moving pod production to Brazil.  This is causing the delay, especially with the Dark Roast.  According to Senseo the coffee should be by June or July at the latest.  Or so they say.  I am surprised that they have not made this info more available.  Seems like many will simply move on to another coffee machine.  Meanwhile try using a regular coffee filter and espresso grind your own coffee.  I've tried Starbucks coffee and not bad.  Less creama, but good flavor.  Google 'make your own coffee pods' to see the methods used to trim the filter and pack the coffee.  It's easy, but not so easy as dropping two pods and pushing the start button.

review/summary: Wonderful Coffee - absolutely delicious - love the frothy flavor
review/text: Senseo Dark Roast is a wonderfully flavored coffee designed for use in the Senseo machine - unfortunately this machine is almost never sold in brick and mortar stores anymore and Amazon is about the last place you can buy one.  In fact, we bought a backup when we realized this was occurring so we would always have access.  AND we THOUGHT surely Amazon would continue to at least sell the coffee since it's so difficult to find in local stores - but about two weeks ago Amazon's Subscribe and Save service notified us Dark Roast would no longer be available and recommended another brand of Dark Roast - which was awful.  Senseo Dark Roast coffee is incredible - best coffee we've ever drank and I'm 62 years old and have been drinking coffee for nearly 50 years - honestly, if I have to purchase it from European suppliers, I guess I will because there is no other real substitute for this wonderfully delicious coffee.  I've even written to Senseo on their web site and they don't respond - so something is happening here, not sure what.  But if you can find this Dark Roast, buy it - because you will not be disappointed.  It is THE best pod coffee out there.<br /><br />Why would Amazon stop selling this coffee? Dark Roast has a very loyal following and comments on every blog or review site are almost all favorable - PLEASE - BRING IT BACK!  If enough of us indicate an interest, perhaps Amazon will reconsider - after all, the continue to sell the other flavors (for now?) but not Dark Roast - which is hands down the best.<br /><br />UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2012:  Senseo Dark Roast is BACK! YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  Finally, after I had to switch to alternative pods, Senseo finally got their act together and started production at their new facility - I don't know all the details, but basically they shut down their production of this particular line (perhaps others) and sold the product line to another retailer - so we had a down period of several months when it was all but impossible to find this product on line (and it will never, I'm told, be in the brick and mortars again) - WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is THE best coffee out there, bar none.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, while we were anxiously waiting for our first shipment of Senseo Dark Roast in months our Senseo Supreme coffee maker broke down (probably due to using alternative pods that don't fit!)  So our shipment arrived and no coffee maker (we love the froth on top, so their new machine by Hamilton Beach I think it is, does not produce "froth" so not a viable option) - anyway, we reached out to Senseo Customer Service - we are many years out of warranty and Philips no longer makes the Senseo Supreme machine - OH NO!  Now what.  CS rep says there is nothing they can do to help.  So I clicked on the Corporate Relations link on their site and shot off an email to the big cheese.  GUESS WHAT?  A nice lady (Dolores) wrote me back and said she would get me a refurbished machine, no problem.  We thought great - and waited, and waited - and waited - almost a month and no machine came - so I wrote her back and ask for tracking - she checked and the order was still in the system; seems she forgot to click the submit button to the fulfillment center so it was just sitting there in limbo.  She corrected this and apologized, machine came a few days later.  Just like a new machine, could not tell that it was in any way refurbished - even included a bag of dark roast!! (stale, out of date by 9 months, but was still drinkable, just a little more bold than normal.)<br /><br />Senseo came through for us - they know they have very loyal customers and appreciate them - and while the disruption in supply was annoying, we are just thankful we can still buy this product on Amazon - although the price did go up by $13 a case (or $2 a bag) and there is no more Subscribe and Save capability (please Amazon, restore this savings and if possible, please lower the price back to a more competitive level with other pods - under or about $4/bag!?!?)

review/summary: Decent Espresso on the Cheap
review/text: I enjoy my senseo so much more now that I have these pods.  I had worked as a barista for 8 years and was having a hard time adjusting to life without free lattes.  I certainly won't say that Senseo espresso by itself is in the same league as freshly ground, coffee shop espresso, but having the freedom to easily and cheaply make my favorite coffee drinks at home has been a Godsend.  I usually mix two shot of Senseo espresso with a spoonful of Xylitol, a spoonful of Black and Green brand unsweetened cocoa powder, and a splash of half and half for a sugar-free mocha that tastes almost as good as one from coffee shop, but for about a quarter of the price.  Try it!

review/text: First time I tried Sumatra in a large order from Amazon and I was not disappointed. I read the reviews before selection and was encouraged to try this blend. When I grind Sumatra beans for a drip coffee maker it is stronger. This Pod-style Sumatra blend is not too strong and should please most coffee drinkers. Very satisfactory - will probably stick with this selection for future purchases. The quick and easy brewing using Senseo is so great for people on the run - or too sleepy to grind and brew. Tastes great from first sip to bottom of cup!

review/summary: I hope they don't sell out to Melita completely
review/text: I'm going to try this, hoping it is the same good coffee we've been buying for years - ever since the Senseo machine came out. We used to buy these pods at Walmart but now they sell something that says Senseo on it and Dark Roast etc. but It's a "Melita" brand and it's awful. Really awful. Some people on here say the Keurig is better but don't believe it. Plus, compare the price of using all of those Keurig "pods."<br /><br />There is another single serving coffee maker (Hamilton Beach) where you put your own coffee into a strainer receptical and it makes an 8-10 ounce cup of coffee that is as good as any drip coffee but you don't have to heat water, use paper filters, etc. We have one of those too.<br /><br />We also have a Pavoni Espresso machine ~$1,000. But it's a lot of work. Our favorite is still the Senseo with the original Dark Roast Coffee pods. If they stop selling these, our two senseo machines will go to the Goodwill store.<br /><br />One additional comment: After writing this review, I was going to order a box of six packages of Senseo Dark Roast Coffee as I have before. The price was $29 and some cents but with shipping it ws over $35 so I didn't order. Amazon says orders over $25 ship free but apparently not unless it's very small or you are a Premium member. So it might mean we will give up our Senseo because we can't buy it locally anymore. I refuse to pay 25-50 cents for a cup of coffee at home (as with Senseo+shipping or Keurig or other "pod" systems) when I can make a great cup with my own premium beans from Costco for about 2 cents with my Hamilton Beach single cup system. And this simple system makes hot water for tea or coffee with your own ground coffee in about 3 minutes and it cost about $60. I don't know why people buy these Keurig or other systems (Nestles has had this pod system in Europe for 20 years or more). Have you ever figured out what you're paying for each cup?

review/summary: Good coffee, but do watch out for differing batches
review/text: OK so most people seem to like this coffee; it's got a strong rating (4 1/2 at the moment), but there are still those that say they don't. It will always be subjective; many people detest Starbucks coffee, but millions more like it. Some like it bold, some like it weak, some like it mild, some like it bitter, some like it sweet; no way to please everyone.<br /><br />This coffee is on the mild side, meaning it has flavor but its not overpowering, and is moreso on the sweeter side, meaning it's not bitter like diner-house coffee. The great thing about this flavor is that it blends excellent for those that like to flavor their coffee; because it is not bitter but still has a noticeable coffee flavor, it compliments most flavored creamers. I've had many many different types of coffees with many different types of creamers, and it can be a real balancing act to find the right blends. The senseo medium roast so far has been the best "starting point", meaning nobody I've personally made coffee for has said anything but complimentary things about it. Some still like a more bold or bitter coffee, but so far nobody has said poor things about this coffee. I use a single pod in approx. 6oz of coffee in a cheap Hamilton Beach drip machine with filtered water, and it turns out great.<br /><br />One other thing, sometimes batches taste 'slightly' different from one-another; it's a product from a plant when all is said and done, and while controls are put into place to regulate the taste, sometimes batches are slightly more bold or bitter than another, it happens with all manufacturers (including Folgers and other large manufacturers, which I've personally tasted radical variations). I've ordered this 6-pack around 6 times so far, and only one batch was slightly odd tasting (had a much more noticeable/bitter flavor to it), other than that it has been very consistent. I left the bag slightly open on that batch, in essence making it "go flat" so it wasn't so bitter. While these packets are sealed, make sure you store them in a sealed container after opening to preserve the flavor.<br /><br />One other thing to watch out for: increasing costs. This pack is still a great deal on Amazon, but I am worried since they have made the decision to pull from retail outlets that it will increase in cost on Amazon as well. I still love this coffee, but if it goes up to $40 for a 6-pack of this, I may be rethinking the coffee I purchase. Keep it low in cost and at the same level of flavor and we'll all be happy.

review/summary: Sara Lee Senseo Coffee Pods, Dark Roast
review/text: Despite the Douwe Egberts name on the label, Senseo Dark Roast is not particularly good coffee, but the price is right; the pods fit the Senseo coffee maker, and they are probably the least expensive dark roast available, although calling it "French Roast" is a misnomer.  When I feel wealthy and successful, I splurge on Community Dark Roast pods or Lavazza gran filtro, both of which are much better coffee and cost twice as much.  Still, the Senseo system beats the heck out of trying to assemble an espresso machine while half-asleep early in the morning.
