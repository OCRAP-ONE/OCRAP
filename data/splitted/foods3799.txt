review/summary: Not Too Sweet
review/text: Some narsharab can be a bit sweet. I suppose it may be the difference between pomegranate syrup versus molasses. This brand is a nice, in-the-middle between too sweet and too sour. I bought the case of four because it's more economical and now keep a bottle at the office as well and now don't need to bring a separate container when I bring dushbara for lunch.<br /><br />This is also outstanding served with/on salmon which is either pan fried or broiled. Yum!!!

review/summary: Not What I Expected
review/text: The cracker meal I previously purchased locally has been discontinued, so I ordered Gilda.  The quality was good, just not what was expected.  Cracker meal I always used wasn't fine, it was more like panko, only not quite so coarse.  Gilda has the consistency of flour.<br />Regretably, I don't recall the brand name I like and will keep searching.

review/summary: The brand makes a difference
review/text: I didn't know there was a difference between brands of gelatin.  I had gotten this brand through the Radiant Life company ([...]), and it had a pleasant, gummy smell when mixed in hot water.  Then I got Knox gelatin from a store, and to be frank, it smelled like pure sh**.  I guess they figure people are going to be mixing it with sugar and stuff, because I don't know how they could stand by that product.  I think I'll go with this brand again.<br /><br />I believe gelatin could be a food that heals.  "Good broth cures anything" is a South American proverb.  It could be because it is a protein that DOESN'T have tryptophan.  See more in this article: [...].<br /><br />And it has to be a broth that has GELATIN.  You can tell store-bought broths don't have an ounce of gelatin, because they absolutely do not GEL in the fridge.  They usually have MSG as well.  I don't know what it is, but it's not broth.  If you've never made your own broth, you'll be surprised that it turns like jello in the fridge.

review/summary: Bernard Jensen Geletin
review/text: This is the gelatin that is recommended in the WAPF Wise Traditions 2011 Shopping Guide.<br /><br />I ordered my first bottle of it a month or two ago, and have used it several times to up the nutritional content of homemade broths and soups. I haven't made "jello" with it yet (using fruit juice) but I can tell you that it smells WAY better than the cheap Knox brand gelatin.<br /><br />I made "jello" using Knox gelatin one time and it had an off taste, because the gelatin powder smelled weird. The Bernard Jensen gelatin smells good, so I imagine that fruit juice gelatin made with it would taste very good.<br /><br />Amazon's price is good, too. Radiant Life is currently selling the same size bottle for $15. If you can score free shipping by ordering something else at the same time then you've got yourself a great deal.

review/summary: The best gelatin, easy to stir
review/text: I don't know much about gelatin but use it a lot and this one stirs in an instant.  I boil the hot water, and only use a half a cup and about 4 tablespoons of gelatin.  Then I put in pomegranate juice and fill up the glass<br />for a strong flavored drink.<br /><br />I was using raspberry flavored diet mix and it tasted really super good, just like black cherry jello.  Alas they are so down on aspartame, I switched.  I'd love to find flavor like that and mix it up with stevia for a sweetener.<br /><br />You can also mix it with orange pulp from the freezed cans for some flavor and with this you can actually tolerate<br />mixing it with chlorella or spirulina.<br /><br />I like to make dried apricot pie and other pies like apple and gelatin helps it stick together.<br /><br />I sure wish I knew how to prove there is protein in it. It really seems to work and makes expensive protein<br />drinks seem pretty stupid.  Especially for old people without teeth.  Ensure keeps a lot of the old or anorexic's<br />alive but it costs a lot.  So I don't know who lives on gelatin instead.  I'd love to know.<br /><br />You do have to drink it before it gels and that's not hard. If you do leave it sit you would have to chew pretty hard to get it down.  Once I cut it up into candy sized squares.<br /><br />If jello didn't get a bad review for health because it has some chemical in it...I would do this more often,<br />but black cherry jello mixed with a few tablespoons of this is a very tasty hot drink.<br /><br />Cheers to your health.  Email me if you know anything real important about this, ouivalerie@yahoo.com.<br /><br /> I'm going to try the<br />5 lb. Now Food Gelatin, although you have to stir a LOT longer....it tastes the same.<br /><br />What is really in gelatin?  I can't find anything online, no books, no factory tour.  Is it ground toenails<br />from cows?  It's so gross what it's said to be secretly made up of, but it works like settles down my appetite so I don't overeat.<br /><br />It's missing something live so I have to eat a lot of fresh stuff too.<br /><br />Soup...that's nice but it's a hot drink I seek and this is a sweet hot drink sometimes, so I don't need the soup. Just gelatin, fruit and vegetables....<br /><br />I might recommend also a pineapple smoothie.  Pineapple in the juicer and some tablespoons of hot gelatin<br />mixed in a half cup of boiling water and maybe some icecream.  It's even known that fresh pineapple stops gelatin from getting hard so you can keep it cold and drink it whenever.  :)

review/summary: Poor gelling agent compared to name brands
review/text: You get a lot of gelatin for the money, but it isn't the same quality as name brands like Knox.<br /><br />The gelatin is much cloudier. It gels less effectively no matter what ratio of water/gelatin I tried, making for a more gooey and runny gelatin than the competition.<br /><br />However, as a food thickener it would probably work well. Just don't expect to be making a nice solid fruit salad with it.

I has someone else try it and they did not like it at all saying it make the pizza have a very bitter taste.  So this product was a waste of money as was the no salt beef and chicken base.  They all went into the garbage and I began a search for another source or brand of low or no salt products.  I would not recommend this to my worst enemy.

review/summary: This genuinely works!
review/text: Some background:<br />I have a history of stomach issues, mainly digestion problems similar to the symptoms of IBS. Up until recently I have treated my sickness by taking prescription medicine, which has had limited success and its own set of downsides. I made a decision not long ago that I would not take a pill for the rest of my life, especially since it cannot completely alleviate my symptoms, so I had to find something new.<br /><br />Aloe and Aloe Juice:<br />After hearing about Aloe juice and its benefits, I decided it was worth a shot. Intuitively speaking, it seems to make sense that given aloe's healing and topical (skin-applied) properties, it would have similar healing affects when taken internally. I tried a few different store-bought aloe juices, realizing some benefits afterward, and then decided to try something a little more potent. (Some notes about my aloe juice research: There are many brands of aloe juice, and as you can expect some are better/more potent than others. When making your decision about which brand/type to try, know that generally speaking you want to find one that is made with the inner fillet, and if it is an issue for you, has a decent taste.)<br /><br />This Product:<br />Since beginning to take this product, I am convinced of its profound healing potential. In only one week, my appetite has drastically improved, my latent pain feeling in my stomach/abdominal is practically gone, and I feel better around mealtime. Compared to a very similar brand, this one has a great taste too, which makes it actually a pleasure to take.<br /><br />My use/dosage (I am not a doctor and this is not a professional recommendation):<br />I take one capful/ounce first thing when I wake up in the morning, and usually a half of a cap/half an ounce in the afternoon or evening. There are instructions on the bottle as well.<br /><br />TL/DR:<br />I have had serious stomach issues for most of my life and I am tired of treating them (somewhat unsuccessfully) with prescription medicine. I heard about Aloe juice, did a lot of research, tried several types, and this one is definitely my favorite. If you even have minor stomach issues that you would like to address, I highly recommend this product!

review/text: This is actually a pretty good tasting aloe concentrate mix. It has a slight 'herb-y' taste from the various herbs and stuff they put in, but overall it is a nice refreshing tasting concentrate. I just pour a capful into a glass of water for a flavored drink. My stomach and throat does feel good after having some. I also ordered the similar product by Lily of the Desert which is 10$ cheaper. I wanted to like it since it was priced lower, but the taste is much worse. I'll probably stick to this brand. This one is priced a bit high, though, wish it was under 20$.

I take two tablespoons in the morning and again at night.

review/text: This is the first time that I have ordered these San Marzano Tomatoes by La Valle on line by Amazon. I was very happy to find them at this price because I usually have to pay more so I ordered them. These are fabulous tomatoes and are very fresh tasting, tangy, and a little sweet. They are truly an experience! My suggestion for use as a light sauce for pizza or for your fresh pasta is to pass the tomatoes through a foodmill and add a little tomatoe paste to thicken. Do not cook the sauce as it will loose some of that awesome FRESH taste! Enjoy!

review/summary: A Great Product Ruined by Misguided Marketing
review/text: I have used this formerly terrifc product for over 10 years.  It was the only canned chicken sold in North America that contained no food additives.  It was just chicken, water, and sea salt.<br /><br />As of this month( March 2011) new labelling and contents  have appeared.  The label now proclaims "Better Flavor".<br /><br />The product now contains 50% more sodium - at a time when many manufacturers are either cutting back on salt content or introducing "reduced sodium" vesions of their tradtional products.<br /><br />Worse yet, the "Better Flavor" is achieved by adding "rice starch", "vegetable starch" ( a call to the company revealed that this is potato starch) and "chicken broth" - which contains, among other listed ingredients, "natural flavor" (derived from corn - an increasingly common food allergen ).<br /><br />This product is now useless to me as I am highly sensitive to corn products.  While the label still claims the product is gluten free, which was pretty much guaranteed before, since it had only chicken water and sea salt in it, this claim is now somewhat suspect in as much as with the introduction of each new additive, there is the possiblitly of cross contamination in the prodution of the various grain based starches and "flavors"<br /><br />The company needs to re-think this change.  What made them unique and a mainstay for people on specialized diets, was their plain and simple good food.  Now they are little differnt from every other canned meat that is adulterated with unecessary and unwanted food additives.<br /><br />They can kiss goodbye all their former customers who are allergic to or sensitive to corn, processed starches, who are on the Atkins or no grain diets, who have arthritis which is exacerbated by potatoes, and who avoid processed food additives in general.<br /><br />The company also needs to be more up front in their new labelling and say "potato starch" rather than "vegetable starch" AND in bold print say "Contains Corn" to warn customers who are allergic to corn products that they probably should now avoid the product.<br /><br />Hopefully this "Better Flavor" change will be about as successful as New Coke" and we will see Valley Fresh "Classic" chicken in a year so.

review/summary: It is pretty good, really.
review/text: It is pretty good.  Not spectacular, but very good, smooth, low acidity, medium roast with caramel or toffee notes and slightly sweet.  Like most decaf coffees, this coffee is somewhat bland.  It is an unfortunate part of the decaffeination process that a lot of flavor goes down the drain along with the caffeine.  I hope someday this problem gets resolved for those of us who love coffee but not the jitters!<br /><br />I'm glad it is organic.  I only buy organic coffees after I found out that pesticides that have long been outlawed in the US are commonly in use in the third world countries where coffee is grown and they are used on coffee.  But thankfully, not this one.<br /><br />If you are looking for an everday coffee that is better than Folgers, you have found it!  It isn't an earth-shattering coffee.  You have to use much more per cup than a regular coffee, just like most decafs, and the flavor is better than most if you like a medium roast (if you like dark roasts, keep looking!.<br /><br />It can actually be hard to find a medium roast in a decaf.  Probably because they are trying to find a way to get more flavor into the end result by roasting it a bit darker.  A solid, every day coffee at a very competitive price for organic.  The only comparible price for organic decaf is Trader Joe's--however they only carry darker roasts.  This satisfies my desire for my favorite kind of coffee without worry about dangerous pesticides.

I love this brand. I used to buy this brand for my husband's regular coffee 25 years ago and we stopped when we moved because we couldn't find a good health food store that carried it back in the day. I should have checked into this brand years ago when I became a coffee drinker, they are the original organic coffee company that I found in health food stores years ago. These are the best decaf for me.

Very soft. Just EXUDING black licorice 'attitude'.<br /><br />I opened first bag and repackaged them in a quart freezer baggie to help keep the opened pack softer longer... it could be dangerous, they do a 'subscription' at a discount, auto shipping them to your door at intervals!<br /><br />This is great though, if you can deal with having 6# of THE black licorice at once. Add Amazon Prime for fast shipping and you can indulge without the great hunt to find some! (certain big box store that will not be named, can never find these in stock there)

review/text: I used to buy pasta seasoning from Trader Joe's (grocer) but they stopped carrying it. After a little research I read that Spice Hunter was packaging it for Trader Joe's. So I am glad to have found it again. I love this seasoning, it blends well with any pasta.  I especially like it on pasta pomodora. In my opinion, it compliments the pasta and does not over power it like Italion seasoning.

review/text: The hat is of good quality.  It looks better in person than in the photograph because, in person, you can see that every design element (the logo, every jelly bean and even the circular borders around the grommets) is fully embroidered.  I  bought this for my Jelly Belly-loving daughter but it fits my large adult size head as well.  The only question is whether the wearer can pull off this look.  It's a great look for kids and for adults with colorful personalities.  Would also be fun at an Easter Egg hunt.  On me (44-year old Mom), I find it strangely flattering...but I'm not sure I could wear it in public.

review/text: I was excited to try these flavors but unfortunately they did not live up to my expectations. For one thing, they were stale when they arrived. This would not have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the flavors were nasty (for the most part). One of the superfruit flavors tasted (literally) like dirt. The most tolerable flavor was the Crush grape soda. Jelly Belly should stick with its traditional flavors, this is a bust.

If you want, you can substitute ground beef for ground turkey, or even a vegetarian substitute and it still tastes good. I eat this stuff several times per week. If you've never tried it, you dont know what you are missing. This is one of my most favorite foods. Sure, it has a lot of sodium, but it is meant to be a main course and it has lots of protein in it with the meat. I prefer adding about half a pound of meat instead of a pound like it says, but you can decide for yourself.

The portions, although they appear to look large in the picture are small and several of the sweets were broken.  For the price, we expected higher quality.  The packaging was okay but you might consider asking them to secure the sweets better to endure shipping.  We are on the East Coast so it's not like it had to ship across the country.  If you want a treat because you can't get anything nearby, this is okay but expensive.  I would recommend locating the nearest Indian stores or restaurants and purchasing sweets there in the future.

review/summary: Good, not great coffee
review/text: The Mount Hagen coffee is very convenient, but the amount in each tube is not enough for a medium sized strong cup of coffee, so you will need to use less water or two sticks if you prefer strong coffee and want more than a small cup.  However, Mount Hagen's single serve coffee sticks are comparable to the much more expensive instant coffee sticks being promoted/sold by Starbucks.  The Starbucks brand is a bit stronger in taste, but it too only makes a strong small cup or a weaker large cup.  As for me, I would rather buy Mount Hagen's version because it is cheaper, organic, and I like supporting a smaller company.<br /><br />A note for Jewish customers: I would like the distributors of the coffee, InterNatural Foods ([...]) to clarify whether or not the Mount Hagen Single Serve Instant Coffee Sticks are Kosher or not.  It is very confusing because they indicate on their website that it is Kosher, but then there is no heksher on the packages for the single serve sticks or on the box they come in.  Are all the Mount Hagen coffee products Kosher, except the sticks? If this is important to you, there is a slightly hard to find heksher (Orthodox Union) on the Mount Hagen instant coffee sold in bottles, and the Orthodox Union website lists Mount Hagen as one of the products they oversee and certify.  I just want to know if they also oversee/certify the instant sticks.  If so, a change in the packaging would help clear up the confusion, and meet the needs of more customers.

review/summary: Very good instant coffee!
review/text: This is surprisingly good instant coffee.  And so convenient!  If you think it's too weak, one suggestion I would make:  These sticks are supposed to be mixed with a cup of water; that's 8 ounces.  Most of us are used to 12 or 16 ounce "cups" of coffee.  If you are mixing it in a large cup (most household coffee cups hold 12-16 ounces), use 2 sticks.  It's still ridiculously cheap, convenient, and very tasty!

review/summary: Smooth, mellow...
review/text: Ok, so this isn't Starbucks Via, but it is a fraction of the cost of Via AND it is organic which is important to me. I think that, though delicious, Via tastes like Espresso. Mount Hagen tastes like coffee. Good coffee. Unlike many instant brands, Mount Hagen does not taste burnt or bitter. It is smooth and mellow. If you like a stong cup of coffee, maybe don't go for these single serve packets... try the jars instead. For me, one packet produces a smooth, medium bodied cuppa that I will continue to purchase and enjoy daily. I love Via, but it is too expensive and I see no reason to give Mount Hagen a low rating because I also enjoy a different brand that I can't afford. I'm glad to have found this product and highly recommend it.

review/text: I am the only organic nerd in my office and the communal pot of folgers was just not cutting it.  I didn't want to deal with grinds and cleaning a pot, so my boyfriend suggested a hot pot and instant coffee.  Wow!  This was the best idea ever!  These single serve packs are great.  The coffee tastes great and is so smooth that I can totally skip the creamer and just add a pack of organic sugar and I am in happy coffee wake-up land.  Look, it is definately not the whole bean, grind it just before brewing, french press, orgnic, single origin, Ethiopian coffee we brew at home; but is sure is a great fix for work and they store great in my cubicle with no mess.  Oh! And the co-workers don't steal them because they see the instant and the organic labels and stay away!

review/summary: Just Regular Instant Coffee, not the fine powdered Starbucks type
review/text: I was fooled by the packaging to the think that this coffee was like the Starbuck's Via Ready Brew.<br /><br />Instead, I found that each tube has 1 level teaspoon of normal instant coffee.  You can get the Mount Hagen instant coffee in glass jars for about $45 for 6 jars.  Each jar has 60 level teaspoons.  Meaning about .15 per cup.<br /><br />With this instant coffee in single serve packs you get 100 servings for $19. Meaning about .19 per cup.<br /><br />Plus you waste all of that packaging.<br /><br />I guess the only benefits are portion control and portability, since with the jar you can easily use a heaping teaspoon which is more like 1.5 teaspoons.  So, if portion control and portability are worth 20% extra I can recommend this product.<br /><br />The prices I use are if you subscribe to regular delivery.

review/summary: Reasonably good instant coffee
review/text: As stated, reasonably good for instant coffee. I think most everyone would prefer a cup of fresh-brewed, but that's not always feasible. I brew fresh Newman's Organics in the AM, but in the afternoon when I just want that one cup or when we're traveling, this far surpasses the hotel coffee or others available. Although Starbucks abound, they typically do not have the organic varieties "on tap," and that is a requirement for me. These are also great for when you want to make a quick iced coffee-- you don't have to make/plan ahead or use ice because you're trying to cool the coffee down-- just take some cold (organic) milk, few ice cubes, and a packet or two of these (to taste). To the best of my knowledge, this is the only instant organic on the market-- comparing to Starbucks Via isn't really a fair comparison, because it's not organic. I guess your like or dislike of this coffee depends somewhat on what your priorities are. I like it well enough, and am back to buy more.

review/summary: Great coffee! But, price increase is way too much!
review/text: We have been drinking organic mount hagen coffee products (both regular and decaf) for a really long time. Couple of years ago, we started to buy them online from Amazon. But, unfortunately the price increase in the recent years has been unexceptable. We just had to go back to regular instant coffee (Nescafe) from the good old supermarkets. If Amazon wants to stay in its glory days, it should compare the market values. Wegmans is very strong with its organic products and suprisingly much reasonable prices. Trader Joe's is also doing an excellent job. Good luck selling Mount Hagen Organic at Amazon!

It doesn't even taste like coffee. I'm somewhat flexible. I'm not really that picky. I can drink just about any coffee in an "emergency." I could not drink this stuff. I don't really know how to describe this product. When I tried the Starbucks I was very impressed, however. To me it tasted like what you'd get at an actual Starbucks.<br /><br />Take my word for it, go with Starbucks. It's not organic, but at least you can drink it.

review/summary: Smoooooth! Love it!
review/text: 1st have to say I am not a hard core coffee drinker, I love the taste of a coffee, but can't handle too much caffeine. I always look for local coffee shops with organic coffee AND MILK, but I was finding many that have organic coffee, do not have organic milk. Then I stumbled upon Mt Hagen instant at a health food store in SF - solved my problem and saved me tons of money. I now heat up water and organic milk at home, add the Mt Hagen and have a delicious, organic, Latte! The flavor is very rich and smooth. If you like really strong (bitter) coffee, then maybe this is not for you. The individual sticks are convenient, (especially for travel!)but buying it in the 3.5 oz jars is more economical. Also, for a caffeine light-weight like me, I can mix the decaf and regular and get just the right buzz! :-)

review/summary: Super tasty, if a bit slow to cook
review/text: I bought a bag of this stuff just for kicks. I like Cream of Rice and usually make it with a little butter and salt. I had no idea what Teff would taste like, but it is fantastic, it really is! Kind of like a nutty Cream of Rice but with a very nice consistency. I am definitely a converted Teff eater!<br /><br />I followed the directions on the bag: boil 2 cups of lightly salted water, then add 1/2 cup of Teff. It says to cover and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes or until all the water is absorbed. The first time I made it, the Teff was all over the inside of the pot and cover. So it needs to be on a very low simmer. I find that it works best to cook it like they say but stir it around 2-3 times during the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />UPDATE: By the way, if you cook it the entire time with the cover on like the directions say, the water won't evaporate. I remove the cover about half-way through. I set the kitchen timer for 5 minute intervals and simmer the Teff, then come back and stir it. After 10 minutes, I leave the cover off, otherwise the water won't evaporate and it will be too watery.<br /><br />If you don't use a low simmer, it will stick to the sides of the pot so you have to stir it to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom.<br /><br />It takes around 17-18 minutes, it has the consistency of a bit loose Cream of Rice or oatmeal in terms of how much water stays in. I turn off the heat and keep stirring until it stops bubbling, then put it in a bowl.<br /><br />Note: The portion size above and on the instructions yields a huge bowl of the stuff, definitely two big servings. Cut the ingredients in half for one serving. Also, don't over-salt it, it seems to carry the salt taste pretty well.<br /><br />I mix about a 1/4 teaspoon of butter and a bit more salt to taste and it is really delicious, it really is. Definitely recommended. Although it is a bit expensive. But it's good! In fact, I'd say it's probably the best hot breakfast cereal I ever ate -- except I eat it all the time, for a snack!<br /><br />It gets 5 stars as a food, but I dropped a star because it is a bit fussy to cook. But if I can do it, anyone can!

review/text: They go great with tea!  I can understand why people might think these are bland if they're looking for a cookie to eat as a snack.  These are not overly sweet and they're not loaded with fat.  They're slightly sweet with a hint of orange flavor and are perfect with a cup of tea for an afternoon or morning snack.  I try to keep these on hand at work all the time and my boss & I usually have a late afternoon tea break.  Orange & vanilla are the favorites here.  I love all things chocolate but the chocolate flavor biscuits don't appeal to me much.<br /><br />The Amazon price is no bargain.  I can buy them cheaper at local (and generally expensive) NYC grocery stores.  They always seem to be out of the orange flavor so it might actually be worth it to order a case from Amazon.

review/summary: Questionable quality
review/text: Made from Chinese apple concentrate.  Chinese apples are bitter from all the chemical sprays and pesticides used on the trees and soil.  China makes the juice marketable by turning the apples into powder concentrate and shipping the powder in industrial drums.  Any juice that uses chinese apples is of questionable quality and we all know the chinese record for producing safe products.  Please see the FDA's testimony below this review.<br /><br />I bought this brand for years.  You can definately notice the difference in taste and quality from the chinese concentrate and other additives.  Still not too bad tasting, but I only drink it when no other USA grown apple brand is available.  You can save a few dollars now by buying these chinese juice imports and save the money for the cancer treatments and nursing home bills when you get older.<br /><br />Also stay away from Tree Top, Welch's, Motts, and store bought brands.  Check the bottle, if you cannot find USA or Canada as country of origin on the bottle, do not buy it.  If it is fresh squeezed or 'not from concentrate' you should be safe.<br /><br />FDA website 'Testimony on Food Safety before the Senate Committee on Commerce"<br /><br />"During the 1980's through the late 1990's, FDA encountered several serious compliance problems with Chinese food exports, including lead and cadmium in ceramicware used to store and ship food products, and staphylococcal contamination of canned mushrooms."<br /><br />"While improvements have been made in some Chinese products with which we have had concerns in the past, there is unfortunately still a pattern of substandard products that continue to be shipped to the U.S. As all of you are very well aware, this pattern has continued, and the safety of food and other FDA-regulated products from China have become a concern for FDA, Congress, and U.S. consumers."

review/summary: Tastes like Red Bull
review/text: Tastes like Red Bull energy drink.  Maybe mix it with Black Jack chewing gum (http://www.amazon.com/Candy-Crate-Black-Jack-20ct/dp/B0007OVVZM) and make a Jagerbomb!<br />The flavor doesn't last that long, but most fruit flavors don't.

review/summary: Quick Enery Burst, Good Flavor - Highly Recommended
review/text: This Wrigley's RPM Fruit flavored gum is good tasting (if you like "energy drinks") and does provide a nice energy kick. I use energy products throughout the day, every day, to counter act the effects of a medication that makes me tired and have found that this gum provides a fairly good pick me up. I also like the gum form of energy products for longer driving trips since drinking large size cans of energy drinks results in having to make "restroom" stops along the way.<br /><br />The gum does loose it's fruit flavor fairly quickly but, unlike other gums, it remains firm a very long time. For longer lasting flavor with the same energy enhancement, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006OFZGCW">Wrigley's 5 Gum RPM Mint</a>.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Great Taste, Weird Smell
review/text: The gum pack smells weird! Kind of like puke. But it tastes great. Initial flavor disappears pretty quickly, but it comes back to life and lasts pretty long.

review/summary: Monster!
review/text: This is basically Monster energy drink in gum form. Smells EXACTLY like it, and tastes almost identical as well. The flavor lasts about as long as any other kind of gum. If you like the sweet taste of Monster you'll love the gum.

review/summary: Tyenol grape chewables or Red Bull????
review/text: This gum is absolutely repulsive. As soon as you take off the plastic wrap, you hope it's not going to taste like it smells.  This reminds me of the grape tyenol chewables with a dash of Red Bull. GROSS!!!! My mom and sister would not even try it just from smelling the package. This ended up in the garbage.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: Not only does this gum smell like cough syrup, it tastes like it too. Disgusting.<br /><br />Ad for the fruit taste, its there for a very short time before turning into a stiff ball of gum.
