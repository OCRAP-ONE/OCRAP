review/summary: IMPRESSIVE INGREDIENTS
review/text: Impressive ingredients--all whole, organic & no pumace.  I give careful attention to ingredients & this food is top of the line.  All ingredients are fresh & the fish is ocean fish--human grade--(I am happy the fish is not farm raised since farm-raised fish can be contaminated by filthy waters--fish tend to be sponges--they absorb more contaminants than the water that surrounds them).  The water added for processing is pure well water that is constantly monitored for purity.  This food has a great aroma--sweet & delicate, but not as poignant as Wellness Salmon mix super premium food, but OH MY, the ingredients are very serious, awesome, and the care and attention to detail is impressive.  She meows with delight & really digs in.  Her stool is a PERFECT consistency EACH & EVERY every time she eats this food which I give in the morning & Wellness Salmon & Turkey dry food in the evening.<br /><br />After careful attention & much shopping, I decided to settle with this food and the one from Wellness--see my reviews.<br /><br />Apples in other foods does not impress me.  Apples that are not organic are sprayed with pesticides (all you have to do is wash your apples with dish soap & wait to see the pesticide residue film appear that is beneath the wax).  I personally peel my apples if they are not organic--a European custom that I learned to appreciate.  This food includes organic sun-dried tomatoes!  I love this food because everything is whole and wholesome.  They have barley right at the beginning (after the chicken of course).  Barley is really an awesome wholesome food for too many reasons: dietary fiber, plus antioxidants, protein, vitamins & minerals, selenium, tryptophan, copper, phosphorus & manganese, & its low in calories.  They have noble organic oats & organic brown rice in that order & of course we all know how good oats & brown rice are!  Perfection!<br /><br />Other foods use only tomato pumace which have pesticide residue--especially when it is pumace!  Cats can eat only ripe tomatoes in the right proportion, & I am happy with the whole sun-dried tomatoes!  I only wish they would have added organic blueberries.

review/summary: Best food for our cats
review/text: By Nature is by far the best cat food we've tried.  Our local pet stores stopped carrying the brand and we couldn't find it anywhere.  We ended up buying another organic food but are very disappointed.  Ever since we started them on the new food, they've been throwing up, pooping outside of their litter box, they've had more hairballs and now I can actually smell really strong ammonia in their pee like I never did before.  We're definitely going back to By Nature.  They rarely coughed up hairballs, their coats were sooo shiny and soft, and they weren't stinky.

review/text: I loved the quality and the taste of these cookies. They are not too sweet and they will live to your expectations. To the person that posted a bad review, just a small comment. They are called meltaways because they have real butter, go figure. If you are interested in low fat food, look elsewhere. It like complaining that french fries are fried, or that chocolate is fattening. Just saying.

review/summary: Absolutely loved them!!!
review/text: These were so, so good, and I love that they're made with whole wheat flour and a healthier sugar substitute (not aspartame or splenda).  I looked at some Atkins peanut butter cups I'd just bought, and they're a higher percentage of saturated fat than these cookies.  I worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat, unless it's made with soybean oil or lists trans fat.  I list this as one of my "healthy snacks."  And since I'm over 40, size 4, with no health problems - I must be on the right track of what "healthy" is. :)<br /><br />One customer said hers were "greasy."  Maybe hers were in the heat, and the butter got hot?  I'm now placing my third order for these. They're worth it!

review/summary: Good dessert for someone gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive and diabetic
review/text: My husband is gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive, and diabetic, so it is very difficult to find desserts for him.  Usually, if it's gluten free, it has waaaay too much sugar, for example.  I tried a box of these cookies for him.  He tried them and said that they are surprisingly good.<br /><br />They are not mereingues, even though they are shaped like those types of cookies.  They are regular cookie consistency.  There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.  (Can you tell I have made some bombs in my time as a specialty cook? LOL)

review/summary: Delicious mixed-flake and granola cereal
review/text: Like the other reviewer I thought I would take a chance on this cereal due to the excellent price that Amazon has on it (as of this writing) thanks to it being a manager's special.  In contrast to them I find the flavor outstanding though; perhaps the other reviewer does not like flax, or (unlikely since we likely received cereal from the same batch) theirs is stale and the flaxseed oil went rancid in theirs?<br /><br />Regardless, this cereal is a tasty mix of wheat flakes, corn flakes, and a loose 'granola' made up of small oat clusters and fiber "shoots" (sort of like miniature Fiber One), moderately sweetened with a mix of sugar, molasses, and honey.  I'll likely be ordering again when I run out anytime the price is at least in the ballpark of what I initially ordered it at, since I know it's *far* lower than what I've seen it for in any local store (which all tend to be $4+ / box for any of the Barbara's cereals).

review/text: I just tried these Classic Gel Food Colors by Betty Crocker and, like the description says, the no-drip gel formula is easy to use and doesn't dilute whatever you're adding it to for color. I was especially pleased that the gel formula didn't spritz beyond my mixingbowl as sometimes happens with LIQUID food coloring if haste, or children, are involved in the process.<br /><br />My only negative comment is that it required more gel food coloring than liquid to create the same color, thus making the process of coloring food less cost-efficent for consumers.

review/summary: Chewy Goey is Chewy Crumbly
review/text: I have been waiting for a packaged soft cookie that can recreate the melted yumminess of<br />chocolate chips in a fresh baked cookie. Nabisco has mastered the art of creating melted chips<br />with each bite, but that is as far as it goes.<br /><br />The overall goodness of this cookie is lacking- it tastes like a packaged cookie. Its softness<br />fools you into thinking fresh baked, yet when you take a bite, you are quickly reminded of the<br />preservatives that must be contained in each cookie.<br /><br />The cookie is not at all the size represented on the packaging. It is considerably smaller. Once<br />you pick one up to eat, it crumbles into several pieces. Basically, it falls apart before you can<br />even take a bite.<br /><br />The packaging does contain a freshness seal so that after you open the pack, you will be able to<br />reseal to ensure freshness.<br /><br />This cookie is getting two stars simply because I love the concept of melted chips in a packaged<br />cookie but I think the title "Chewy" is a bit of a stretch. The more appropriate title would be<br />CCCC-Crumbly Chocolate Chip Cookies!

review/summary: Buy at store, if you must buy at all...
review/text: First off - these don't ship well.  When I recieved my package (even though it was clearly sealed and had not been opened) it looked like there were several cookies missing, there was a lot of empty space in the package allowing the cookies that were in there to slide all over, and several were broken as a result.  If you really REALLY want to try these, I would look for them at the local store rather than buy online and have them shipped.<br /><br />That being said....I'm awfully glad I didn't actually pay for these.  I've never been a fan of Chips Ahoy cookies - even as a kid.  They're just so over-processed and artificial tasting.  I was hoping the extra blob of fudge in these might help make up for that, but not really.  I can't justify buying awful-tasting cookies when it's not that difficult to make your own, or even to buy from a local bakery which tastes a million times better and fresher.<br /><br />I cannot recommend these - they were not packaged well, and did not taste any better than I expected.

review/summary: Deliciously addictive, but small cookies and slight chemical taste
review/text: QUICK SUMMARY:  This highly fudgey cookie is addictive and was gobbled up at a party in no time.  However, the cookies themselves are relatively small (just slightly larger than a Thin Mint or Oreo in diameter), and I/we did note a chemical taste not unlike that found in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OXIZOE">Chips Ahoy Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</a>.  You'll go through a package quickly both because of the deliciousness and that you really only get 15-18 relatively small cookies.  More details follow...<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />(Note - I received this product through the Vine program and it is possible that packaging will change between the review version and final launch.)<br />The outer wrap is a relatively standard Chips Ahoy pack.  Opening it involves lifting a tab on the front, which reveals three rows of cookies.  While the cookies in my package were intact, I was initially shocked by how much air is in the package.  Nabisco clearly re-used the tray from other cookie products, and these cookies do not fill the space.  As such, they're probably prone to bounce around and crumble if treated poorly in shipment.  The package can be re-sealed by pressing the flap back down and running a finger along the edge to adhere.  The cookies didn't last long enough for me to judge whether the package truly prevents the cookies from becoming stale.  The seal seems a little looser than I'd like.<br /><br />VISUAL IMPRESSION:<br />The cookies look kind of shabby, to be honest.  They don't look like they'd be very chocolaty.  Also, the smaller size is quite striking if you're used to the size of a standard Chips Ahoy.  (This smaller size likely accounts for the large amount of airspace in the packaging.)<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I was blown away by the taste of these.  While there is a slight chemical taste, it is the same chemical taste found in any soft-style packaged cookie.  The chemical taste is quickly replaced by an explosion of chocolate.  One guest I shared these with noted that the cookie tasted a S'more minus the marshmallow. (Idea for Nabisco: S'more flavor!)  I was initially concerned that the cookie would be too sweet, but the chocolate filling is kind of dark and semi-sweet which compliments the cookie perfectly.  The cookies are also quite rich, and I found myself satisfied after a smaller quantity of cookies than normal.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />Well, it's a cookie.  You shouldn't be expecting a health food here.  It's 150 calories per serving, and a serving is roughly 2 cookies.  That seems fairly calorie-dense to me, but your perception may vary. Each serving has 21g of carbs, with 13g of those coming from sugar.  There's no trans-fats, and the ingredients list sugar, not HFCS, as the main sweetening ingredient.<br /><br />QUANTITY/VALUE:<br />At $4.32 a package, that's roughly 24-28 cents a cookie or around 50-56 cents a serving (2 cookies).  While I didn't pay for this product directly, I have to say that I would not pay over $4 per package for these given the low quantity of cookies.  I'd watch for a sale or lower price.

review/text: This is an interesting concept in a packaged cookie:  a chocolate chip cookie with a soft chocolate center.  The cookies are small, which is a big plus in my book (easy portion control).<br /><br />Personally, I liked the flavor and texture of the cookie better after heating it in the microwave for about 9 seconds.  Then, it tasted more like a just-baked chocolate chip cookie, when the chocolate chips are still melted, soft, and smooth.<br /><br />For me, these cookies were just a trifle too sweet, but others in my family liked them & children LOVED them, so I'll go with the majority & give them 4 stars for inventiveness.<br /><br />If you have young kids, they'll like these!

review/text: Lately Nabisco has been branding new products as new "styles" of existing products including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LA1LKI">"Ritz"</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEJ968">"Newtons"</a> brands. Those products, while tasty, had little resemblance to the original products. These, however, are a logical extension of the "Chips Ahoy!" brand.<br /><br />As far as the product itself, they are cookies. I don't expect them to have any healthy ingredients. I don't care what they are made of or how many calories they have.<br /><br />First impression: They are about 2" in diameter and have a dark, almost burnt look. The aroma is overwhelmingly sweet and of chocolate and vanilla.<br /><br />When the least bit warm, they are falling apart soft and melty. They firmed up when cooled down. The small chip bits in the cookie were almost an unnecessary addition, in my opinion. The center is not not gooey, but grainy, and almost crunchy.<br /><br />To me there was an overpowering fake chocolate taste, and an aftertaste that hung on far too long.<br /><br />All in all, I am not enamored enough with these to purchase them. They are too fragile and overpoweringly sweet for my taste.

The cookies are much smaller and a lot less attractive than the illustration, but to be fair, they're not much different or any smaller than other Chewy Chips Ahoy! cookies.<br /><br />So once you get past the visible let down, the taste is at least on par or better than any other Chewy Chips Ahoy! cookie, plus it has the benefit of having chocolate in every bite.

review/summary: A great soft, fudgy cookie.  Plus, no HFCS make it a win.
review/text: My wife and I have had a craving for some soft chocolate chip cookies, but both Chips Ahoy's and Keebler's didn't really hit the spot.  Then these came along.  They're kind of amazing due to the layer of fudge that is dispersed throughout the cookie's center.  It makes the cookie soft and chocolatey.<br /><br />To top it off, they ditched the High Fructose Corn Syrup for good ole' fashioned sugar. HFCS has been linked to obesity and certain sources have been found to be contaminated with mercury so I try to avoid it if I can.  It's good to see that snack makers are catching on.<br /><br />So, these may not be the greatest soft cookies around, but they are certainly high up on my list of store-bought soft cookies.  Mixed with ice cream, it's a seriously tasty treat.  I recommend.

review/summary: Less chemical-tasting than other Chips Ahoy products
review/text: Word of warning: I found these cookies to have a very strong "chemical" taste that made them near-inedible.  They weren't as bad as a lot of other prepackaged cookies I've had in the past, but they still had a very strong chemical taste that made them distinctly unappealing. If you're the sort of person who prefers more organic products, I'd stay clear of these.

review/summary: The Product Picture is Better than the Cookies
review/text: See that ooey gooey chocolate stretching between the two pieces of cookie on bag? That doesn't happen, even when the cookies are warm. The chocolate is actually quite stiff and dry. Another one of those "got milk?" products. I like plain old Chips Ahoy and would stick with those before diving into these and being disappointed again.<br /><br />And I'm not alone -- people in my office weren't impressed either -- and we'll eat anything.

review/text: Whether or not you can bite into one of these Chips Ahoy cookies and enjoy a burst of gooey fudge is unknown to me because most of them were broken in shipping. However, I did eat the bigger pieces and they were fine, tasting a bit heavier on the chocolate than the conventional Chips Ahoy cookies I'm familiar.

review/text: Definitely a winner. There are two of us in this household, both seasoned cookie fans, and we tore through this package in almost no time (even though we're on a diet!). They don't taste as much like regular Chips Ahoy as I had thought; the chocolate in the center actually overpowers that flavor a good deal. Still, this was no bad thing, and they stand alone as their own tastiness.

review/summary: Very Good for A Store-Bought Pre-packaged Cookie!
review/text: These cookies are pretty good for a store-bought cookie.  Obviously, homemade cookies will always be better, but for a pre-packaged cookie, these Chips Ahoy! Chocofudge Cookies are pretty good.  I noted that they were perfectly soft right out of the package, and also pretty tasty.<br /><br />I'm now going to compare them to the original Chips Ahoy! Chocolate Chip cookies.  In terms of softness, these are much softer right out of the package than the original Chocolate Chip cookies.  The original Chocolate Chip cookies can be made very soft and nice if you stick them in the microwave for a little while, but the Chocofudge cookies are soft right out of the package.  I think the Chocofudge cookies are better tasting right out of the package too.  I also tested both in the microwave, and the Chocofudge cookies were also tastier this way.<br /><br />I do need to talk about price points though.  The Chocofudge cookies are pretty close to the same price as the original Chocolate Chip cookies in the stores that I checked, BUT you get much less quantity-wise from the Chocofudge cookie package.  In fact, the original Chocolate Chip cookies have about 5 oz. more cookies in them.  Of course, the fudge filling probably makes them a bit more expensive to manufacture, which would account for this marketing strategy, but do be aware of this if you're a big fan of the originals and you're thinking about switching to the Chocofudge variety.<br /><br />Well, that's about all I've got to say about these cookies.  They are fairly tasty for a packaged snack and they are pretty soft, which isn't common for store-bought cookies of any kind.  If you are a fan of the Chips Ahoy! brand, you'll probably love this new Chocofudge variety.  Just go ahead and give them a try!

review/summary: Tasty Treat
review/text: When you first pick up a package of Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocolate Fudge Cookies you may be a bit surprised at how light the package is - only 10 ounces - but don't be deceived.  The package may be light but it is filled with delicious cookies.  The cookies are on the small part - you can easily finish one in two bites - but they are yummy.  While the cookies aren't as gooey as advertised (they aren't messy to eat at all), they are indeed fudge filled - break a cookie in half and all you see is fudge.  In fact, there seems to be more fudge than cookie (there are chocolate chips on the cookies but I couldn't really taste them).  However, the fudge taste is never overwhelming - the combination of cookie and fudge is delicious.  I love the resealable package that keeps the cookies fresh although the cookies are so good they won't last long in my house and there's little chance they'll go stale.<br /><br />Chips Ahoy!

review/summary: and a half stars - Not as good as I hoped but teenagers loved them!
review/text: I've always liked Chips Ahoy! cookies and was excited to try these "gooey" ones!!  What could be better with chocolate chip cookies than more chocolate?  Unfortunately, for me, they just fell flat.  The chocolate "gooey" part was not very soft or, well, gooey and there wasn't much flavor to it, in my opinion.  I actually felt that it took away from the taste of the cookie as a whole.  I would have preferred eating a normal blue package chocolate chip cookie!!<br /><br />That being said, however, my late teen recently graduated high school son's friend LOVED the cookies!!  In fact, he asked if he could take them home as they were driving up north that weekend!  He felt they were delicious!<br /><br />So maybe it is my more mature taste buds, but these would definitely be a hit with teens!

review/text: "Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge," I liked these cookies. During the summer these are easy to prepare, just open the bag. I liked the fudge center. No summer oven heat. This could be real good crumbled on ice cream and put in the microwave for one second. It was very good for summer.  I like to play with mixing flavors.

review/text: I love chocolate chip cookies. The upside of these is that they are soft, and the chocolate in the middle makes them extra decadent. They are also the perfect two-bite size, in my opinion. The only downside is a little bit of a chemical taste, probably from the stuff that keeps them soft.

review/summary: CHOCOLATE CHIPS & FUDGE - WHO COULD ASK FOR MORE?
review/text: CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE COOKIES<br /><br />We love cookies and were excited to received these.  They are chock full of chocolate chips, extremely soft, definitely chewy, and for an added treat, there is a filling of chocolate fudge.  The only down side regarding these cookies are perhaps they are a little too soft -- when taking them out of the package to enjoy many of them simply fell apart in my hand.<br /><br />The packaging is attractive and eye-catching and has the new lift-end resealable package.  I find this type of packaging an easy opener, but always find the package does not stay sealed well and end up placing all the cookies in a plastic container or placing the entire package of cookies in a food storage bag to keep fresh.<br /><br />These cookies are good -- I don't think Chips Ahoy! ever disappoints.  However, they are not my favorite Chips Ahoy! cookie, [that would be the regular old plain chocoloate chip non-chewy, thank you] but they are worth every bite and every calorie.  For those of you watching calories, fat, sodium, etc -- you may enjoy two cookies for a total of 150 calories, total fat is seven grams, zero cholesterol, and sodium clocks in at 110mg.  There is no trans fat involved.  So you should definitely have more than two cookies -- go for it!<br /><br />If you like chocolate chip cookies and fudge, these cookies make for a nice combo.  They are delicious with a hot cup of coffee or tea or a tall ice cold glass of milk.  Dunking in milk was a bit sloppy since the cookies are so soft,  yet still highly recommended.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad cookie.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pam

review/summary: Great and chewy tasting cookies
review/text: When we got the box, I wasn't particularly expecting much, but after the first taste, I was rather impressed.  Very chewy and soft, they are sweet but not overpowering and have a great chocolate flavor.  So I gave them to my wife and kids to try and before I knew it they were gone.  So, if you are looking for a nice treat that doesn't leave crumbs all over the floor, satisfies the craving for sweets, and is reseal-ably stored, I would definitely recommend these Chocofudge coockies.

review/summary: chocolatey, but not cookie enough for me.
review/text: I only feel ho-hum about these cookies. They seem like they are really more of a vessel for chocolate rather than a cookie. It seems that there is barely any of the chewy cookie and what is there doesn't have enough cookie flavor to it. The cookies are overwhelmed by the amount of chocolate in them.<br /><br />They also seemed a bit overpriced for a small package. Even though the outside package is about the same size as the regular chewy cookies, there are a few ounces less of actual product and a bit more packaging. I also found them in my local store for almost half the price listed here on Amazon.<br /><br />I found the cookies to be okay and easily finished off the package in a few days. My husband didn't care for them, so I have no one else to blame for eating all of the cookies. He prefers the regular Chips Ahoy cookies (non-chewy) and I found that I do, too. I saw these at the store and did not buy them after having tried them from Amazon. I don't see myself picking these up at my local store at any time even with a lower price.<br /><br />These cookies just didn't work for me.

review/text: These cookies are, as promised, chewy.  That's definitely their selling point.  The cookies feature a gooey chocolate core.  The cookies are not especially thick, but there's definitely a gooey layer in there.  These are VERY chocolatey cookies.  If you don't like a lot of chocolate, these are probably not the cookies for you.  That's not an issue for me.<br /><br />These are still no match for a homemade chocolate chip cookie, but if you're not inclined to bake, this is a reasonably good substitute.

review/summary: No corn syrup or hydrogenated oil!
review/text: I would say "chewy gooey" is taking it a little too far but the cookies are soft. I prefer them over the regular hard Chips Ahoy from my childhood. I like that they just have sugar instead of corn syrup. They are REALLY sweet though. It's a good thing that they're on the small side so it's not too overwhelming eating all that sugar. For the popular brands of cookies, this one is pretty good.<br /><br />The packaging has a nice feature where you can pull open the package from the front left side and reseal it so the cookies don't get stale.

review/summary: Good cookies
review/text: I received these cookies as a sample to try out and I would have to say that I would consider these for purchase.  The cookies are billed as "gooey" cookies.  They aren't the most gooey inside cookies.  I would say that each cookie is bigger than a quarter but smaller than a silver dollar.  Somehow I remember ChipsAhoy from my youth being bigger.  No matter, the cookies are still delicious.<br /><br />After I sampled the cookies, I put them out in the office breakroom and gave them a test.  Anything that lasts in the breakroom until noon is not that great.  These cookies didn't make in until 10am.  My co-workers loved them.<br /><br />I checked to see if there were any transfats in these cookies and didn't see any hydrogenated fats.  I might have missed something but it looks like they are transfat free.  Maybe I'd have to re-read the packaging but they looked solid.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: These cookies are chewy and soft, but the inside layer is more like solid chocolate instead of creamy. The new packaging means you peel back the top layer of the package, one compartment at a time. The only problem is the cookies shift around and there were only two cookies in the front because they had slipped to the back. None were broken however. Despite the solid inner layer and the packaging, the cookies tasted good. I just think there were too few cookies for the size package.

I wouldn't pass these up as a snack for a road trip in a gas station or had an insatiable hankering for a cookie and didn't have time to bake my own but, frankly, there's nothin' like a homemade cookie and these don't come close to comparing.

review/summary: Say it ain't so!
review/text: While my younger self would swear up and down that no such thing would ever be uttered, much less typed, regarding the amount of sugar in a snack, I have to disappoint that little boy I used to be. These cookies are indeed good, but they are just over the line of being too sweet to become a regular purchase. The standard chewy Chips Ahoy cookies are pretty darn close to being perfect. Adding in a fudge center might sound like a good idea, but it just ratchets up the sweetness. Don't get me wrong, the fudge is entirely too good, as is the cookie. It's just the injection of one into the other that makes it a bit too sweet for my aging palate. Nevertheless, in moderation, which is to say one to two cookies at a sitting instead of a half-dozen of the non-stuffed variety, is a nice capper to a packed lunch at work (just as it would be in a bag lunch for a school kid). I think this is a case of trying to improve perfection and falling a bit short of the original product. Kudos on the effort, but I will return to the prior incarnation.

I have to wonder if the advertising department has ever tried this cookie... it was chewy, soft, even mushy, but the center was a HUGE let down, can't see myself buying another box/bag. They were sweet, too sweet, it really wasn't a good sweet, more of a so sweet there's an aftertaste sweet. Might need to go back to the drawing board on this cookie... and quick... no point in pushing the envelope as to what your patrons will put up with in terms of deceptive advertising... Short of it... the cookie's a flop and the ad doesn't represent the actual end users product experience!

review/summary: Too sweet, not fudgy
review/text: Children who can consume sweets by the pound will gladly go through a box of these with no issue.  My friend, an adult male who occasionally feels the need to snack - took about two days to consume the box of these.  These had the appearance of a smaller, thicker chips-ahoy chewy cookies.<br /><br />I personally didn't care for them, they were smaller than normal chips ahoy cookies, and seemed damp.  The fudgy center didn't really seem fudgy at all but rather made the cookie seem more cakey.  The sweetness however was really kicked up a notch - they were so sweet it was almost painful.  Although this cookie seemed like a great idea, I'll stick with the chips-ahoy chewy cookies personally. These were too sweet for me and the dampness was just sort of strange and a bit unnerving.<br /><br />From a kid's perspective these are probably the greatest cookies available in a store (everyone knows that mom's and Grandma's cookies are the best).  But the majority of adults would probably prefer the original or chewy cookies.

review/summary: Play with your food!
review/text: I loved the "gooey" cookie line when they first came out. This edition has a nice chocolate-ish flavor but there's nothing 'chewy' about it. The cookie is too gooey to have a texture and all the cookies within the same compartment just smooshed together forming a cookie blob. This brings up the best use for a package of these cookies--if parents of a preschooler have ticked you off, give their kid a package of CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE..and tell the little angel to make a monster cookie blob to eat and play with! If you are still of an age to play with your food this would be the cookie of choice to smear on the walls and mash on your face.<br /><br />(Seems kind harsh on the parents--if they have a preschooler, don't you think they've been punished enough?)<br /><br />The other "issue" is the crumbs. These cookies don't stand up to the rigors of the real world. About one third of the mass of the cookies in each compartment was disintegrated into crumbs. The crumbs don't have much flavor and they won't stick to the walls. What's the state of junk food coming to?<br /><br />No nutritional value, great sugar buzz and a high potential to make a mess--what's not to love here?

review/summary: Mmmmmm.... Fudge!
review/text: I eagerly anticipated these cookies.  Every once in a while I crave chocolate, the richer the better.  And what sounds better than a soft chocolate chip cookie, with a fudge center? Just apply those calories straight to my hips!<br />At first I was not very fond of these cookies.  They do have an oddly artifical taste, and the chocolate is definitely not the highest in quality.  The fudge, instead of being "gooey" is actually a bit brittle and hard.  I took a bite and chucked the rest of the cookie.  At 75 calories and 3.5g fat for one itty bitty cookie, it's just not worth it.  However, I happened to leave a plate of these on our deck for my husband, thinking he'd like them more than I did.  What can I say, I couldn't help one more trial bite! After warming in the sun, the fudge center actually did become soft and gooey - much better!<br />Overall, I'd sneak one if I happened upon a plate sitting out on the deck.  I would not go out of my way to purchase or eat these cookies otherwise, however.  For that kind of apply-to-bum calorie content, I'd go for an actual bite of quality chocolate.

To me, they were too sweet and not the best quality of chocolate.  I am not a huge fan of the original, but I prefer them to this new cookie.  I would not buy these, but on a side note, my four year old and two year old seemed to like them.

review/summary: I never thought I'd say "Too much chocolate"
review/text: but "Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge" is TOO MUCH chocolate.  Seriously.  Milk doesn't even help.  In moments of weakness, I have been known to eat a whole package of chocolate chip cookies, with chocolate milk.  I was barely able to eat two of these goo-balls.  On one hand, maybe that's a good thing - it forced me to moderation.  But the truth is, I really didn't like them that much.<br /><br />Oh sure, they are chocolate, and that's really never a bad thing!  But these are just too much for my tastes.  The description is accurate:  they are chewy, they are gooey, they are chocofudge.  Basically, they are the Chips Ahoy chewy chocolate chip cookies, slit open and filled with gooey fudge in the middle.<br /><br />Not bad - just WAY too far over the top for my taste.

review/text: If you want a chocolate bar, you should probably buy one.<br />If you want chocolate chip cookie ice cream buy that,<br />but I suggest if you want chocolate chip cookies,<br />you should try another kind of cookie.<br />Sort of an half baked cookie effect makes these<br />cookies although tasting very good,<br />something you will eat too many off and too fast,<br />both of which are not very healthy or desirable.

review/summary: Wet Bread Mouthfeel
review/text: Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge / B004U43ZO0<br /><br />I received these cookies and their extra-chocolate counterparts at the same time, and I'm a little disappointed with both.<br /><br />I was skeptical that packaged cookies would be soft, but these cookies actually are very soft around the edges. Unfortunately, the mouth-feel is very unpleasant to me: they feel a little like wet bread in my mouth. Once the edges have fallen off, you hit the center core of fudge -- it's basically a hard chocolate disk inside the cookie that needs warming for a second or two in the microwave beforehand.<br /><br />These aren't the worst cookies I've ever eaten, but I didn't enjoy them at all and really wanted to throw them away after the first few had been eaten -- there's a strange aftertaste that I don't much care for. There's also a bit of a "fake chocolate" smell to the cookies that is unpleasant -- my husband took one sniff of each package and refused to try any, saying that they "smelled bad".<br /><br />I really like the idea these cookies represent, and I hope that Chips Ahoy can get the recipe right in their next attempt -- it's a good idea, but just doesn't quite come together in execution.<br /><br />NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Better than I expected, but not the greatest either
review/text: I haven't had a Chips Ahoy cookie in many, many, many years, so I honestly didn't know what to expect when I got these cookies.  Upon opening the (convenient and resealable) package, I saw many tiny cookies.  Each one is only a little over an inch in diameter, which is both a blessing and a curse:  being so small, you'll have to fight the impulse to eat a whole handful of them, knowing that the serving size is only two cookies (150 calories and 7 grams of fat per serving); however, the cookies are rich, so once you eat the requisite two cookies, you'll find yourself without the desire to eat any more.  The cookies themselves are soft and very sweet (13 grams of sugar per serving); the gooey center is less goo and more like a smear of chocolate.  It doesn't flow or ooze or look anything like the commercial makes it out to be.  I suppose if you wanted the center to be gooey, you could warm the cookie in the microwave for a few seconds; however, that would also make the rest of the cookie gooey as well, which kinda defeats the purpose.  On the downside, there's a slight metallic flavor to the cookie, along with a rather artificial taste; I don't know if all Chips Ahoy have that or if it's only limited to this particular type of cookie.  However, it's rather off-putting.  Normally, when I'm looking for a cookie fix, I buy the kind you can buy from a bakery, which has usually been freshly made just that morning, making the artificial aspect of the Chips Ahoy cookie even more pronounced.  Which is strange considering the ingredient list.  It's less offensive than most:  the ingredients are straight-forward and easy to pronounce, with none of the polysyllabic products which make one wonder if what's in the package is actual food and not, say, some sort of food-shaped plastic.  However, taken all together, unless I'm in the middle of a serious cookie craving and no other option is available, I won't be eating Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey cookies again.

review/text: This was a good cookie. Not quite fudge tasting. More like a somewhat underbaked cookie out of the oven with melted choco chips. My daughter loves these type of cookies.

review/text: These cookies are soft, but not really chewy. They are more crumbly than chewy. They are chocolate chip cookies with a core of soft chocolate. Tasty, but very sweet and a little salty. Definitely for a chocolate lover. The chocolate may be little overpowering. They leave you thirsty, so you'll want something to drink available. They go great with milk. The cookies are smaller than your average Chips Ahoy! The cookies got a little beat up in the mail, but for the most part they held up well. Not my favorite, but still very enjoyable.

review/summary: Fine for what they are
review/text: Let's be honest.  If you are buying these, you are probably not buying them for yourself.  You are probably buying them for youngsters.  So, here is what you need to know.  These are basically just soft chocolate chip cookies.  The "gooey center" is only marginally noticeable, and it barely tastes like fudge.  However, kids seem to like them.  There are two up-sides to this product.  First, the cookies are quite small, which makes it easy to manage portions.  Second, the resealable package actually seems to work.  There is nothing special about these cookies.  Kids seem to like them, but kids will pretty much eat anything with sugar.  When you sneak a couple, you won't wind up with stale, hard cookies, but don't expect gourmet.

review/summary: So-so...sorry, but only so-so
review/text: We were very excited to try these cookies, since the kids had already seen the commercials. Our daughter especially loves Chips Ahoy, especially the soft ones. My first impression when eating one of these new cookies -- besides how small each cookie seems compared to the picture -- was that they're kind of like chocolate fig newtons. My wife was not thrilled with the aftertaste, much the the "presentaste." These cookies are okay, but not outstanding enough to make us changes from the Chips Ahoy we already buy and enjoy.

review/summary: Same Old Cookies
review/text: To me, these taste no different from the regular Chips Ahoy! chewy cookies. They have a very thin layer of "fudge" in the center, but it isn't gooey as the pictures show. It's similar to a layer of chocolate chips. The cookies taste like regular chocolate chip cookies, just with a little extra chocolate inside. The cookies themselves are pretty small, they're soft and moist, and they have a lot of chocolate in them. If you like regular soft Chips Ahoy! cookies, then you might very well like these. I'm not much of a fan, however, and I probably would not buy these at the store if given any sort of option.

review/summary: Unpleasant Aftertaste
review/text: I'm a long time fan of the original Chip Ahoy cookies; I've like them since I was a kid. I've also had the soft Chips Ahoy, which are OK but still not as good as the original. So, when I set out to review Chewy Gooey Chocofudge, my expectations were not high, but I didn't expect them to taste THAT bad.<br /><br />In order to give a fair and balanced review, I sought help from two others: My mom and my teenage daughter. Mom and I were on the same page, not good. Certainly not horrible, but just not good. We are both experienced cookie bakers and both know that its very difficult for mass produced cookies to match up with home baked. We did take this into consideration.<br /><br />Number one: The cookies were somewhat soft, but they also crumbled when taking bites; "chewy" cookies are not suppose to do that. They were hardly "gooey". There is a bit fudge in the center, but gooey means that it pulls like hot cheese on a pizza. So, Nabisco, don't claim gooey if they're not! Finally, once swallowed, both my mom and I experienced an unpleasant and lingering aftertaste. Yucky to say the least.<br /><br />My daughter, though, thought they were wonderful! Or to quote, "They're da bomb!" So, I'll just take that as a five star review.<br /><br />Me: 2 stars<br />Mom: 2 stars<br />Daughter: 5 stars.<br /><br />Overall: 3 stars.

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: Soft chewy cookie with a thin layer of equally soft layer of fudge in the center.  The flavor is good but slightly salty.  Not sure if I would have noticed the salt at all if I wasn't reviewing the product.  Best to eat with a glass of milk.  The texture is somewhat uneven.  Every cookie seems to have one tiny piece where the texture is unexpectedly harder, although there aren't any nuts in the cookie.<br /><br />I was afraid that gooey would mean you'd need to wash chocolate off of your fingers after eating the cookie, but that's not the case unless you decided to play with your food.<br /><br />There are 2 cookies per serving with a total of 150 calories.  9 servings per bag.  I don't recommend having these shipped.  The package isn't designed to prevent the cookies from bouncing around during shipment and a number of cookies arrived broken.<br /><br />Overall not a bad cookie, but I doubt that I'll be buying them.

review/text: Kudos to Nabisco for coming out with a new delicious cookie! Unlike the traditional Chips Ahoy cookie which is crunchy texture (and I'm not criticizing it, by the way), this one is chewy and has a fudge center in the middle in addition to the quintessential chocolate chips. My wife enjoyed it, too. We'll be looking for them at our supermarket (these went pretty quickly).

review/summary: Gooey these ain't
review/text: I enjoy the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z2BS">Chips Ahoy! Real Chocolate Chip Cookies, 1.4-Ounce Single-Serve Bags (Pack of 48)</a> on occasion, but hadn't had their soft version for a while, and figured I'd give these new, gooey cookies a try, since they looked appetizing. How wrong I was. Opening the package I was confronted by a cookie massacre. About 65-70% of the package was a mess of broken cookies, displaced cookies, crumbled to pieces cookies, mashed cookies; not a pretty sight at all. I go ahead and eat one, a little mess isn't going to change the taste, right? First thought, "Ugh, these aren't very good at all!" As I chew, other thoughts race through my brain. Like, umm, where's the promised goo? All I have in the middle is a sweet, imitation-tasting chocolate (imagine my surprise when I saw they used real chocolate!), chewy-ish piece of food that bears next to no resemblance to real chocolate. The rest of the cookie tastes stale, preservative-laden, and a bit mushy, not my idea of a good cookie. Last, but not least, while cookies are purely junk food, the calories for these horrible cookies are 150 for two, which comes out to 75 calories for a rather small cookie (about 2 inches in diameter)! As I always say, "If I'm going to put junk into my body, I want it to taste good." These do not.

review/summary: Mushy, Yucky, NOT Chewy, Gooey
review/text: The bright, colorful package with the big picture of the chocolate chip cookie with "chocofudge" oozing out of the center creates great expectations. Upon opening the wrapper, you see very small, misshapen cookies. Some are crumbled because the package is way too large for the contents, and the cookies fall over and get jostled and broken.<br /><br />I see that one of these small cookies is 75 calories, so it really has to be good to warrant the count. No way!  They aren't chewy; they're mushy.  The flavor is weird, sort of sweet and chemical.  There is no clear chocolate flavor. Inside this small, thin cookie is a tiny solid dark mass; guess that is the "gooey" chocofudge. In sum, YUCK!<br /><br />These cookies besmirch the good name and reputation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017Y9UKO">Nabisco Chips Ahoy!</a>. I have eaten and will gladly consume "Chips Ahoy!" cookies, but these don't come close to the quality of "Chips Ahoy!". One "Chewy, Gooey Chips Ahoy!" cookie is too much. Save the calories and your money for better.

review/text: These cookies are quite tasty and it's a very interesting gimmick. As someone else pointed out, you do expect a little more "goo" since the package says "Gooey". The chocolate fudge inside is about the consistency of a slightly melted chocolate chip cookie. These cookies are also smaller than regular Chips Ahoy! cookies, and I believe you get less per package, but they're still an interesting treat if you're a fan of chocolate.

review/summary: Not sure mail order is the way to go for these.
review/text: It was pretty hard to judge the quality of the cookies because of the condition they arrived in: several were smashed into crumbs and none of them were oriented correctly in the container. They had that oily look that cookies acquire when they've been overheated. The packaging just doesn't seem well-suited to being shipped individually: the cookies have so much room to move inside the package that even with all the packaging Amazon fitted around it, they effectively self-destructed from the handling.<br /><br />That said, they were reasonably tasty soft cookies with an extra kick of chocolate in them. Nothing close to home made, but a decent alternative to other store-bought varieties.<br /><br />For comparison purposes, I picked up a pack of these from the local grocery store, and it was an entirely superior experience. Even the price was better than through Amazon.

review/summary: Pretty gooey to me
review/text: This is a nice new twist on Chips Ahoy cookies. These cookies are a much, much softer version of regular chocolate chip cookies, to the point where the packaging has a big "gooey" label on it. After having a few, I can definitely agree that these are exceptionally soft cookies, much softer than the regular "soft" Chips Ahoy cookies. However, it seems like a lot of the other reviewers have complained that these cookies aren't "gooey" enough. I definitely don't agree. For a mass-produced, mass-marketed Nabisco product shipped to thousands of stores, I imagine this is about as gooey as you can make a cookies and still have it last to market. It's not quite "melting in your mouth," but it's not too far from that either. The flavor is also much richer than regular Chips Ahoy cookies. These have fudge in them, so there a much richer chocolate taste. Overall, if you like chocolate Chips Ahoy cookies, I suspect you'll love these. If you are picky about how "gooey" your cookie is, then store-bought just aren't ever going to be the same as homemade cookies in that respect.

review/summary: Taste Treat
review/text: These cookies are not for the calorie counters but for those who want a tasty snack regardless of the consequences. Just reading the label, Chocofudge & Chewy Gooey, is a tipoff that you will move the scale pointer further after sampling these treats. There are 18 cookies about the size of a silver dollar in a resealable package designed to provide easy access. Each of these little cookies contains 75 calories of which 30 are fat. You will not be able to eat just one cookie. You will eat a handful of these cookies with impunity and when you finish you will shed tears of regret at you lack of disipline.<br /><br />Super market purchase is the best way to obtain these cookies because they are not sturdy enough to withstand the rigorous handling of shipping companies. I received one package from the Vine program and although it was well packaged none of the cookies were whole. By not having a whole cookie I was able to gather numerous pieces and pretend that I was eating just one cookie although in my heart of hearts I knew it was a bald-faced lie. I am now back on my diet and exercise regimen with shameful feelings of remorse but with secret memories of these tasty treats.

review/text: I like Chips Ahoy cookies, both the soft and the hard ones, and I like fudge, so that's two positives already. These chewy gooey cookies are the soft kind with a filling of fudge in the middle. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not find any plasticky or unpleasant taste with mine, nor did I find the cookies half crumbled when I got them.<br /><br />I didn't give these are 5 because after trying them I found that I'd rather have stand alone chocolate chip cookies and stand alone fudge rather than both together. And I thought the cookie itself was ok, but the fudge wasn't fudgy enough. But apart from that, I thought they were pretty good.

review/summary: Sweet, soft, and that extra hint of preservatives...
review/text: Chips Ahoy and I go back a long way. I remember plowing through whole packages of them on any given Saturday afternoon. They're not gourmet or anything, but the crunchy sweetness was just about right for an indulgent snack.<br /><br />Quite honestly, the gooey "Chocofudge" Chips Ahoy don't live up to the nostalgia.<br /><br />Opening the package, the cookies smell delightful, a heady mix of vanilla and chocolate scent wafting out immediately. The cookies stick together, coming out in bunches of two or three, slightly oily to the touch. They feel a little like raw cookie dough, but on the tongue they're somewhat mealy and too soft. The chocolate chips are runny and the chocolate filling is more pasty than gooey, about the consistency of Nutella.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, these taste about average for a store-bought cookie off the shelf. The chocolate and vanilla you smell when you open the package are both there, but a little too sweet to be appreciated. There's a hint of chemical aftertaste too, which lingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is an average cookie, and the current Amazon price is steep for an average product. Over $4.50 per package is just too much...I might go for $3.00 or $2.50 per package, but not more.<br /><br />And if I'm buying Chips Ahoy anyway, I'm still going to opt for the original, that crunchy goodness that reminds me of lazy weekend afternoons.

review/summary: Not gooey
review/text: This is definitely a downgrade from the standard chewy chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />These cookies are supposed to be just like chewy chips ahoy cookies filled with a "gooey fudgey" center.  There are three problems: first, the cookies appear a little burned when you open the pack.  Second, there are many more broken cookies than usual.  Finally, the center is not gooey, even at 80 degrees F.<br /><br />In fact, I microwaved a couple of cookies to see what I could do.  Even after just five seconds, the outside disintegrated, but the inside failed to get gooey.  I think there's just too little cookie and the center is too solid - it's about the consistency of the "stuff" in the middle of an oreo.<br /><br />Ok, so it can't all be bad, right?  Well, the cookie isn't even as good as regular ones because it's a bit burnt and greasy, and the fudgey bit in the middle is tasty but not really good enough.  The main issue is that the cookie isn't structurally sound enough to stay intact around that "gooey fudgey" center, and the middle part isn't better than the cookie it replaces.<br /><br />So I did what anyone would do and took them into work to get rid of them.  They lasted a shade under 4 hours on a floor of 30 people, and there were a lot of small pieces left behind.  I got comments ranging from "that hit the spot" through to "even as free cookies go, I've had much better."<br /><br />I won't be getting them again.

review/summary: Good soft cookie, deceptive packaging
review/text: These are soft and chocolaty, and I like them better than the crunchy chips ahoy, but they still have that store-bought taste.<br />The packaging seems to be too big for the cookies, as a consequence they were a jumbled mess, I normally check the nutrition info and then divide by the members of the family to see how many each person gets, but so many of them were broken that it didn't end very well this time.<br />I realize that contents are shrinking and the manufacturers are trying to make it LOOK like more, but I for one would prefer not to be treated like an imbecile who won't notice that the packaging would hold 50-75% more than is actually in there.<br />Other than that, these are my favorite chips ahoy, since I prefer soft cookies, and while they can't hold a candle to home made, I'm not turning the oven on more than I have to in summer, so I'll be buying these again (and again) in the future.

review/summary: LOTTA chocolate here!
review/text: I'm not a huge sweets fan, prefer chips and such normally, but every once in a while, like just about everyone, a sweet tooth bites me and I want something with some sugar in it.<br /><br />Having grown up in a family known for baking (grandmother used to make wedding cakes profesionally), cookies are nothing new.  And a good chocolate chip cookie can hit the spot sometimes, even for those of us who aren't THAT fond of chocolate.<br /><br />So the Chips Ahoy cookies here are a variation I haven't tried in their product line before.<br /><br />The cookie dough itself is about normal for them, not quite great but not bad, either.  A little squishier than I'd normally want, but these are supposed to be gooey after all, so that comes with the territory.<br /><br />And while the picture on the package shows something with just oodles of chocolate in the middle, while I think everyone knows it's a given that the picture is an exaggeration, I have to say it's not exaggerating by MUCH...  There's a LOT of chocolate in there compared to any other chocolate chip cookie.  For me, it was overwhelming, way too much chocolate.  My 7 year old said the same, took a bite, made a face, and threw the rest of it away.<br /><br />But these aren't being marketed to people who don't like chocolate, so our problem shouldn't be an issue with anyone that purchases these.<br /><br />Chocolate is pretty normal tasting mass produced cookie type of chocolate, with a pretty smooth consistency to it.  Again, nothing to rejoice about, but if you like a lot of chocolate in your chocolate chip cookiess, it will definitely float your boat.<br /><br />They're about the size of a silver dollar, give or take, so they're not very large, but given how sweet they are, I think anything larger would be overkill.<br /><br />If you like store bought prepackaged cookies, these should be just fine, if not a little better tasting than most of the other options.

review/text: Most people are on one side or the other when it comes to chocolate chip cookies - crispy or chewy.  When it comes to homemade chocolate chip cookies, I am definitely in the chewy camp.  So I was very excited to try this version of Chips Ahoy.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  As far as store bought cookies go, the regular Chips Ahoy are very good.  But the chewy just does not translate well to a store bought cookie.  It is more like a soft regular cookie, but not in a good way.  It is similar to stale Chips Ahoy.  Sorry, but they were just not for me

First thing I noticed is how dry the cookie dough was. It is soft, but after a bite or two I reached for a drink. The dough was just dry, and what I was searching for was some flavor. There might have been some, but I may have imagined it. Next, the inside. It is a bit gooey, and consists of a thin layer of chocolate fudgey filling. Very thin. I was surprised again at how little flavor I detected. I expected a rush of sweet sensation, because as I stated I seldom eat sweets. Usually when I do eat something with a lot of sugar, I immediately notice it. Not so here. There was a little chocolate flavor, to be fair. But far less than I was expecting. And hoping for. These reminded me of standard issue packaged cookies.<br /><br />Kids will probably eat these readily, without complaint. I'm not sure that's a reliable method of evaluation. Or maybe someone who regularly eats cookies is in a better position to grade these. Problem is, I used to be one of those people. I still remember the many happy moments between me and my cookies. And some of them were Chips Ahoy. But they weren't like these. I know if I am going to indulge in a cookie, I'll reach past these to whatever other options are available.

review/summary: nice idea, but needs a little work....
review/text: Ok, I haven't probably had a chips ahoy cookie since I was a kid or close to it, so I thought I'd give these new chewy gooey chocolate ones a go.  Here are the likes:  They are soft and chewy and the middle is nice and fudgy.  Dislikes: small cookies-2 cookies are a serving size and 150 calories and these cookies are about the size of a silver dollar, the cookies though soft and fudgy on the inside are dry on the top, if they were just a bit softer and less dry they would remind me of how fresh out of the oven cookies get that nice melty center when you hit the chocolate chips.  So, for me, this cookie is not quite there.  I didn't dislike them, but I wouldn't run out and buy a bunch of them.  If they were less dry I might purchase in the future.

review/summary: Hmm
review/text: I saw the name "Chips Ahoy!" and thought of delicious, crispy chocolate chippy goodness. Alas, these don't live up to the brand name.<br /><br />I rarely buy storebought cookies, honestly, so I really looked forward to trying these as a treat. Here's my three cents:<br /><br />1. The filling is not very noticeable except as a faintly chemical, chocolate-like slime. There wasn't much filling, either (and it does not, for the record, look at all like the package advertises when breaking the cookie in two). The last two days were quite warm and the cookies became almost liquid on contact with warm fingers. Quite a mess, especially with kids. In short, the gooey filling seems to me a gimmick.<br /><br />2. I do like these better than the other chocolate fudge flavour they have, but not by much.<br /><br />3. Despite not really caring for them, they WERE very addicting, and considering the calorie/fat content, this was hardly a good thing.<br /><br />If I want a tender cookie, I can make better ones myself from scratch. If I'm going to buy a chocolate chip cookie, I'll stick with the original crispy Chips Ahoy.

review/summary: OK, but too rich for me
review/text: If you want a chocolate chip cookie, this works, but it was too gooey and rich/sweet for my taste, plus a lot of calories for one cookie. But, since I didn't particularly care for the taste, one cookie was enough. So, I'd say the world doesn't need this cookie, but it's OK.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I'm sorry to say I will not be buying these cookies. Upon opening the re-closeable packaging, I discovered the cookies were tossed around in their compartments as well as being broken and crumbled. I tried two cookies as did my husband and 12yr old daughter; none of us were excited by them.<br />I felt they had an odd taste - nothing at all like the regular Chips Ahoy and not the same taste as a homemade soft cookie. My husband who loves soft cookies also didn't care for them. My 12yo daughter liked the cookies but felt they were too small in size. The package has only 18 cookies meaning each only weighs a little over 1/2 ounce. I also feel they are overpriced - I will not pay nearly $5 for a small package of cookies - that's more expensive than Girl Scout cookies.

review/summary: Fair to middling
review/text: These are OK cookies. Nothing really stands out, however. They are very sweet, even for store bough mass-produced cookies. So sweet that it's unpleasant after a couple of cookies unless you have it in combination with something else (for me, tea). The texture is nice - soft and chewy - but it needs something to break up the softness. This is a cookie that just cries out for nuts to be added.<br /><br />The flavor is hard to pin down due to the heavy sweetness. There's somewhat of a poor aftertaste as well.<br /><br />But, the bottom line with judging the appeal of any cookie in my households is two-fold: are there any left over in the bag a short while after it's opened?; and do people want more after they are gone? The answer to both of those questions is no - while they were all snarfed up, there was no interest in getting more the next time at the grocery store. So, three stars. Not bad; not memorable either.

review/text: The chocolate filling inside is a little softer than the chocolate chips which is nice, but the flavor the the entire cookie tastes a bit like preservatives took a strong role in the ingredients. I flavor of the cookie is about the same as a regular Chips Ahoy! cookie. The cookie dough part is softer than standard Chips Ahoy! cookie making slightly better then the crumbly counterparts.

review/summary: Too Sweet
review/text: I really thought the combination would work well but found the fudge inside making the chocolate chip cookie a little to sweet.  I think I prefer them just the way they are.  Why mess with perfection?  They were always good so leave them that way.  I do enjoy cream filled cookies but dont think the chips ahoy need them they were just fine.  Not like an oreo which needs them.

review/summary: Just okay cookies
review/text: These cookies are not bad but I expected more from Chips Ahoy. The reason I love their regular cookies so much is because they are crunchy. These are not, they are very soft and chewy and that is not a texture I love in a cookie. While these cookies aren't crunchy, the chocofudge in the middle is a nice and added treat. It would be nice if the original crunchy cookies had this middle and then they would have a homerun on their hands. As it stands, these cookies are just okay.

review/summary: Good Cookie
review/text: My kids really loved this cookie, perhaps because we don't buy many soft baked cookies. The cookies are moist and soft, with a layer of chocolate in the center. Since it was warm when they tried it, the chocolate (there's a lot of it) easily melted. My kids thought this cookie was great, lots of chocolate! I found them a bit grainy and lacking in texture, making them merely okay. Since I'm not used to soft baked cookies this might just be a personal preference. Overall, it's a cookie; of course it is good! Yet I wish it was just a bit better. Sill, if you enjoy chocolate you might enjoy this.

review/summary: I really wanted to like these more ...
review/text: After receiving these today, I once again gathered the household testers together (aka, the missus and munchkins) to try these cookies.<br /><br />First, let me describe them. (The cookies, not the testers!  :-) )  They are about two inches across, maybe an eight of an inch thick, and are a darker brown than shown on the package.  Inside the cookie is a thin layer of fudge. The cookies have a bit of a dampish-texture and were all stuck together.<br /><br />The taste of the "outside" part of the cookie was slighly similar to soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.  However, the texture was a bit "grainy", somewhat like an soft oatmeal cookie.  The fudge layer on the inside was tasty, but was a little overpowered by the rest of the cookie.  It wasn't quite as firm as the layer you'd find in an oreo cookie, and was more like a spread.<br /><br />I love chocolate chip cookies, and I love fudge, so I had high hopes for these.  My wife has similar tastes and also thought they'd be a good cookie to try.  However, the testers and I unanimously agree that they are somewhat mediocre in taste and appearance.  While they aren't terrible by any means, they didn't grab me enough to make me want to go out and get more.  Everyone's taste is different, though, so you may love them.  I give these cookies a three star rating ... that is to say they're not good, they're not bad, they're only fair.<br /><br />As an aside, I received these cookies to evaluate as part of the Amazon Vine program.  The Amazon shipping container was very well protected and undamaged, but when I opened the pack of cookies, about a third of them had been reduced to crumbs, and only two thirds of them were in a condition to eat.  (And those were all stuck together.)  I don't know if that was due to rough handling or excessive heat during shipment, so I didn't consider it as part of my rating.  I only mention it as something to watch for in the event that it's a flaw in the cookie itself.

review/summary: Big Disappointment!
review/text: First let me say that I am big fan of regular crunchy Chips Ahoy, and I esp. love the Chips Ahoy cookies with Heath bars in them, so I was excited to try these out.<br /><br />Although my cookies arrived more as bits of cookie in a bag, I wasn't upset because that can happen, and bits of cookies can taste every bit as good as whole cookies.<br /><br />Except in this case.  First, the cookies that were whole were quite a bit on the tiny side, and at a serving size of 2 cookies, you'll be getting 150 calories and 7 grams of fat.  That would be acceptable if these cookies were delectable.<br /><br />But they're not.  I didn't like them at all.  I thought they weren't very flavorful, and the chocolate fudge left a lot to be desired.  But worst all was the bitter, acrid aftertaste.<br /><br />I think Nabisco would do well to go back to the drawing board on these cookies, because what they have here is not working.  I'm sorry.

review/summary: Very tasty soft cookies with a bit too much sweetness for me
review/text: I like soft-baked chocolate chip cookies, and these Chips Ahoy Gooey cookies are very tasty.  If you can stop at eating just two, you'll end up with a moderate 15 grams of sugar in your system.<br /><br />If you keep eating, however, like I did, you may find these veer a little close to being candy.  The fudgy filling is pretty sweet and there is not a lot of cookie to  back it up.  I feel a little sick after eating five of them.<br /><br />Tasty, but a little too sweet for me.

review/summary: Delicate cookies with chocolatey goodness
review/text: These Chips Ahoy chewy gooey chocofudge cookies are extremely delicate and easily break apart if not removed carefully from the resealable bag. However, they are just so good, so chocolately, and so gooey soft without being gooey in the "sticky sense" of the word. There's also a thin layer of fudge in the center of each cookie.  Two small cookies will set you back about 150 calories with 60 calories from fat. There are about 18 cookies in a bag.<br /><br />Taste-wise they are great especially as a once-in-a-while treat for those who are more health concious.  I know they satisified my chocolate craving and were hard to stop eating once I started.

review/summary: Very Good, but in Moderation... Check the Serving Size!
review/text: We keep a constant stock of Chips Ahoy 'original' cookies in out candy cabinet. We've tried all the variations that have come by, but we always end up returning to the 'original'. The Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are pretty much just their softer cookies, filled with fudge. I like the softer Chips Ahoy cookies, but never enough to repurchase them... I always considered them to be pretty 'boring'. These, however, with the perfect amount of fudge added are a LOT better. A vast improvement over the standard soft cookie. They also have an addicting 'crunch' from the chips (I like interesting textures in foods).<br /><br />I usually have 3-4 cookies with lunch, but with these I ended up downing 12 of them. That's when the bad news hit me. If you look at the nutritional information on the package, you would think that there is actually less calories and fat per serving, but then you notice that the serving size is two cookies, while the Originals have a serving size of three. The Original Chips Ahoy have about 53 calories and 2.7 grams of fat per cookie. The Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies have 75 calories and 3.5 grams of fat each! Wow, I realized I finished off my lunch with a 900-calorie 'snack'. I don't have any need to watch my weight, but after finding out how much they will 'cost' you, my wife won't even look at them.<br /><br />These are definitely very good cookies, but they still aren't a replacement for my Originals.

review/text: I typically don't like soft cookies. I prefer crisp, thin cookies. So, I was pleasantly surprised when I bit into Chips Ahoy Gooey Chocofudge. The chocolate chip distribution was excellent, (not sparse and stingy like other brands.) And the addition of the thin layer of fudge on the inside was a sweet, velvety experience. I ate one, then another, and then a whole row was gone. Needless to say, I won't be buying these cookies again because I can't trust myself to eat just one. :/ Fudge.

review/summary: Just OK if your expectations are low
review/text: At my house, I am known as the Cookie Monster.  I love cookies and bake cookies, too.  Chips Ahoy! (original) are one of my favorites.<br /><br />However, these are quite disappointing.  The packaging size and pictures are very misleading.  The cookies themselves are scarcely bigger than those "toy" cookies you get at McDonald's.  See my customer images.<br /><br />As far as chewy and gooey, I would call them more like soggy.  These arrived when the outside temps were about 90 degrees, so I expected them to be really gooey.  The "fudge" was a not-too-sweet and not-too-flavorful layer of filling in the middle which simply tears apart.  See my customer image.  They seem to be rather crumbly and mostly held together by their oiliness.<br /><br />Finally, a serving size is a laughable 2 cookies.  These are so tiny, I easily ate four of them which is two servings at 150 calories an 7 grams of fat each serving.  Overall, the taste is not bad, but it is not great either.  For a rather unsatisfying 300 calories and 22% of the USRDA of fat intake, I could definitely do better.<br /><br />I hope you found my review and customer images useful.

The "soft" cookies are almost more along the lines of mush and the filling doesn't taste like chocolate, rather, it leaves a gross plastic taste in your mouth.  I am incredibly surprised by this considering how fantastic these sounded and excited I was to try them.<br /><br />And at 75 calories for every cookie that is just slightly bigger than a half dollar, this isn't worth your while on a whole other level.<br /><br />Save your money, do NOT buy these.

review/summary: Familiar Taste, Definitely Gooey
review/text: These cookies were the same shape and size as the regular crisp Chips Ahoy! cookies, but they were soft with a chocolate filling. The taste was almost exactly that of regular Chips Ahoy!, which I really liked, but I have to admit the filling didn't really do it for me. I wanted it to be more dense and fudge-like, but instead it was really soft, like frosting, and took up too much of the cookie. The texture of the cookie was just a little too gooey in itself, I prefer something a little more grainy in a soft cookie.<br /><br />These weren't bad, but I guess I like the texture of a good cookie more than I like filling, so I would probably pass on these and get the standard Chips Ahoy! instead. I didn't hate them and I didn't love them. I can't see myself craving them.<br /><br />If you like frosting or soft filling in your baked goods, though, you might want to try these, because the taste was good and very reminiscent of a regular Chips Ahoy! cookie  I also liked the resealable package.

When I pulled them out and ate them cold they were really great. I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that these cookies were enough to satisfy it. My only complaint is that I expected the fudge in the center of the cookies to be more liquidy because of the packaging which says 'chewy gooey' but they were still delicious and I would purchase them again. I received both this flavor and the megafudge. They were both great, but I prefer the chocofudge better.

review/summary: Just OK, and not that great for you
review/text: I was not particularly impressed by these new fudge-filled chocolate chip cookies. I'm a chocolate-chip-cookie lover, but these just didn't hit the spot. There was almost no "cookie" left after they put in all the fudge. The dough that was left was a darker-than-normal brown, was crumbly, and seemed to be infused with the fudge. In all, they didn't taste much like chocolate chip cookies, though the fudge flavor is pretty good; and they were very rich. Also a warning, the cookies are quite small, but packed with saturated fat (4.5gms/18%dv in two cookies, though that's not that out of line with other chocolate chip cookies, either store-bought or home-made). So in all I'd say, not bad. But if you do go for them, go one at a time.

review/text: The resealable package is very nice, unlike their elvish competition.<br /><br />Upon first opening the package, the Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey cookies didn't look that appealing compared to the photos on the package.  The cookies are soft, dark, and small, only about 2 inches across.  Because they are filled with chocolate, they can get crumbly and therefore might break apart during shipping.  Photo uploaded.  I think they could make the package smaller and contain these type of cookies better.<br /><br />They taste good but very rich, one or two at a time is enough for me.  Which is good because 2 of these cookies have 18% of your daily saturated fat allowance and 13g of sugar.  I would recommend these for an occasional chocolate cookie fix, but enjoy in moderation.

review/text: Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies have a really rich chocolate taste. Because of this intense taste of chocolate, one is best advised to not eat more than one or two at a time and have a beverage at hand (milk or cup of coffee if you prefer) to quickly wash away the powerful fudgey-chocolate flavor of the cookies. The cookies are soft in texture and are quite easy to chew. This is not a product I'd probably buy with my own money as I prefer the harder, crunchier, Chips Ahoy, but if you're a fan of a soft cookie that packs a lot of flavor into a relatively compact cookie than the Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are worth taking a chance on.

review/text: Received a nice box of cookies ( total 18 cookies per box) packaged in plastic trays to help prevent breakage All cookies arrived intact and even in the brutal heat of Florida 92 deg. soft but not melted..<br />Cookies were not crisp and filling was not gooey.. more like they had taken a  pat of chocolate and formed the cookie around it. If fact there was a slight crunch to the CHOCOLATE FILLING but not the cookie.<br />  the cookie portion was very thin top and bottom with a few choc. chips scattered around.<br /><br />Now this is not a bad packaged cookie but certainly nothing to write home about. Just the regular  chips ahoy cookie with a fudge patch in the middle. The over all taste is sweet and the usual fake chocolate flavors all store packaged cookies provide. This cookie has a rather odd aftertaste, as well.<br /><br />Again no kid would turn their nose up to these cookies but the average adult may take a pass.<br />. Not worth the calories  = 2 cookies for 150 calories and 60 gm of fat.<br /><br />Not a repurchase for this house.. Sorry...

review/summary: Chewy and Chocolaty
review/text: These delightful little cookies are about 2 inches across, with tiny chocolate chips on top and a layer of chocolate fudge within.  The fudge layer is about 1/8 inch thick.  The cookies are soft and chewy and they are sweet, chocolaty and full of favor.  They are perfect with the morning cup of coffee.  They come in a handy easy-open and resealable bag with the cookies sitting in a plastic tray, which makes them easy to store and easily accessible, even to a child.  I will pick up a couple bags on my next grocery-shopping trip.  I like them.

review/summary: Great taste with so-so texture
review/text: I've tried both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2">Megafudge</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U43ZO0">Chocofudge</a> versions of these cookies, and I'm writing a similar review for both.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the taste of these cookies.  The center chocolate fudge (which is soft enough to bite through easily, but not actually gooey) is quite tasty and the highlight of the cookie to me.  Chips Ahoy did a good job on that part.  The cakey portion of the cookies taste pretty good to me, too, but the texture isn't great.  They are kind of dry and just crumble apart.  So, not hard and crunchy, nor moist and soft.  More like dry and soft.  If you're like me, you're definitely going to want something to drink afterwards.<br /><br />I've tried the cookies at room temperature, warmed up in the microwave, and chilled in the refrigerator.  I like them chilled the best because the cookies didn't crumble apart in my mouth like they did otherwise.  Warmed up in the microwave, it wasn't much softer than room temperature...just harder to eat with some parts being uncomfortably hot.  Perhaps warmed in the oven would be better, but I haven't been inspired enough to heat up Chips Ahoy cookies in the oven, yet.  :)<br /><br />These things are bite sized and have 75 calories and 3.5g of fat each.  Not horrible for a cookie, for sure, but the taste isn't good enough to get me to pick these over something else.<br /><br />Given that the chocolate "fudge" is the main attraction to me, I liked the Megafudge version with the chocolate exterior better than the Chocofudge version because the chocolate flavor was much stronger.  Both are around 3.5 stars to me, but with the edge to Megafudge, I gave them a 4 and the Chocofudge a 3 here on Amazon.<br /><br />I'd definitely suggest getting a single bag at the local store to try these out before buying in bulk.  You might love these, but four bags is a whole lot of cookies if you don't.  ;)

review/summary: If it looked like the cookie on the package, it might have half a chance
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:41 Mins<br /><br /></span>I do not buy too many pre-packaged cookies and when I do it's usually OREO's or fig newtons. This new cookie from Nabisco, the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge sounded promising and looked pretty good on the package but the reality was a little different.<br /><br />The cookie is very soft. Soft and crumbly in fact. It is so soft that it literally breaks in to little pieces as soon as I pick it up and begin to eat it. I guess that's a good reason to pop the entire cookie into the mouth in one bite, since they are small enough to do just that. The "representation" of the cookie on the package shows the cookie much larger than it really is and as you can see by my video, the real cookied bears little resemblance to the picture of the cookie.<br /><br />As for taste and mouth feel... I did not care for it at all.<br /><br />At best, this is a barely OK pre-packaged cookie. However I would not buy these again. I'm being generous with a 2-star rating. My wife took one bite and threw the rest of it away. The chocolately taste was the only reason I gave it more than two stars.

review/summary: A Great Idea But Not A Very Good Cookie
review/text: When got this product, I was looking forward to a real taste treat.  A nice soft cookie with a gooey fudge center, what could go wrong?  When I tried these cookies, I have to say that I was far from impressed.<br /><br />When I received my package of cookies, it was a hot day and the package had been sitting outside for awhile.  I opened the pack of cookies right away and took a bite.  The fudge was gooey all right.  It might have been a decent cookie except for the fact the cookie part crumbled in my hand with the first bite.  This led to my hands getting covered in gooey fudge that made quite a mess.  All I can say is I am glad my 3 young kids didn't get into the cookies first.<br /><br />I left the cookies inside in the air conditioning for a few hours and decided to have one after dinner.  Much to my surprise, the fudge drastically changed texture.  It was no longer gooey, but now it was more of a spongy, solid texture.  There was still some "gooeyness" to them, but nothing like what it shows on the package.<br /><br />When it comes to taste, the only analogy I can think of is with chocolate.  You know those chocolates that come out on every holiday that people buy for the kids that is real cheap chocolate?  The chocolate is cheap, gritty, and kind of has an unnatural taste to it.  These cookies are kind of like that.  The cookie is not bad, but for some reason the taste just does not work.  The only thing that pops into my mind is that cheap chocolate.  The taste just does not seem right.  It did not taste like a decent chocolaty treat, they tasted artificial and cheap.  In my opinion, when the cookies were warm when I first tried them, they tasted better than when they were room temperature.  In the case of my family, these cookies got pushed to the back of the pantry and not even half a pack was eaten before they got tossed.<br /><br />I think the idea of product was great, but I think the execution was poor (kind of like the McDonald's McDLT for those who remember them, the sandwich where the hot side stayed hot, the cold side stayed cold, you put them together and you get a lukewarm sandwich).  The cookie was way too soft and crumbly, the fudge was not very gooey at room temperature, and the product did not have a good chocolaty flavor to it.  At the very least, a cookie that stayed together and did not make a mess would be a huge improvement.<br /><br />If you are a chocoholic, this product might be worth a try.  If you are looking for a sweet treat to savor the taste of, then I would definitely recommend steering clear of this cookie.

review/summary: I prefer non gooey...
review/text: That said, these were quite delicious.  I received them during the hot summer so not sure how much negatively this affected them, nevertheless, they were quite tasty.  They have a healthy dosing of chocolate and I am hoping (as of this review) that there will be a dark chocolate variety.

review/summary: Certainly  Not Home Made
review/text: It is incredibly difficult for a huge company or even ANY company or even most bakeries to make a chocolate chip cookie that tastes homemade.  Apparently chocolate chip cookies are one of the hardest to duplicate.  While I did not expect this to taste like homemade,  I expected just a bit more out of this cookie especially with this flavor.  I love the regular chocolate chip cookies from this company so I thought I would love these also.<br /><br />This product certainly delivers what it claims with the fudge stuffed aspect. It is rich and fudgy, with a yummy creamy center and nice bits of chocolate pieces,  but the cookie surrounding the fudge is too chemical tasting for me.  If you  want the option of having a fudge stuffed cookie then stick to the  Megafudge style.

review/summary: Deliciously chewy
review/text: When asked to try these, my daughter said "delicious".  Asked for more information she added that they are soft.  She would have expected cookies that come in this kind of package to be crunchy but these were surprisingly soft.  She also said they are very chocolaty, and when asked to give them a rating out of 5, she chose the 5.  So since they get the thumbs up approval of a teenage girl (not easy), I guess we'll be ordering them again.
