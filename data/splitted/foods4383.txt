review/summary: Dogs like them
review/text: My dogs think these Chicken Zuke's Minis are really tasty. The only problem for me is that the treats are so tiny, that my 90lb German Shepherd swallows them as if they're dust. They're excellent for a smaller dog, I just wish they were slightly larger for the bigger kids in the playground.

review/summary: Zuke's Mini Naturals
review/text: My Sheltie loves these treats! They are great for training, just cut them in half to make them last longer. I also love that they are 2 calories each, another reason they are perfect for training. Just make sure you keep the bag closed, or they will dry out! The salmon flavor doesn't smell too strong or make your hands smell. My dog also loves the peanut butter flavor, which actually smell delicious! These treats are moist, which my dog seems to prefer. We haven't bought the chicken flavor yet but I'm sure they are excellent as well. I will never be without these treats!

They are just enough to reward him when he does something good.  I would definitely recommend to all dog owners and would purchase the other flavors too.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: I tried this for my dogs for the first time a few months back. They are the pickest dogs about treats that i have ever seen and the only things i could get them to eat was another known brand of the chicken nuggets. I decided to try these and they we're smaller then i expected but i gave them a try anyways and i could not believe it. They all ate it right up and now after 2 more orders of them they are still begging for them every night. If i don't give them one or forget to they all sit and stare at me or bark untill i do. I do use them as treats rather then for training. I hope they never quit selling this product and the shipping was really fast not to mention the good price and the large bag size. Thanks for everything. I will keep buying this for as long as i can.

review/summary: My cockapoo puppy loves these!
review/text: My pup, Miltie, is 7.5 months old and so far he's not tired of the Zuke's treats at all, and he's had them since the first month I brought him home. He sometimes eats too fast, but I've had no problem with him throwing up. Other treats have given him "poopy" messes, but he doesn't have that with Zuke's, which are worth the money.  He's had PB & Chicken mini treats, Filet Mignon chews...he adores them all, and the 16-oz. bag of mini treats can last him a long time. The trainer is his puppy kindergarten class recommended these, and I'm glad she did.<br />I'd like to get the "Dental Fresh Breath" treats, but Amazon.com doesn't ship them and the shipping is almost as much as the product...that's not cool.

review/text: I am new to dog training but I learned real quick that they will respond much better if they love the treats. Our dog really loves these and they are just the right size for training.The main reason I tried this brand is because it is MADE IN AMERICA. Almost everything else is made in China, and you know their history of using toxic ingredients just to cut expenses. The price is not bad either.

review/summary: Great for food puzzles
review/text: I had some trouble finding kibble sized dog treats, I had been breaking up smaller ones. I needed a smaller size to work with my dog's food puzzle since he won't use it if it only has plain kibble in it. These are great! About the size of a pencil eraser or a green pea. My bag says that each treat is 3 calories, not 2 as it says in the description, just an FYI. The salmon ones stink pretty bad, but dogs love stinky treats. They are kinda moist and squashy so I wouldn't put them in my pocket. They also turn the feces black. Kinda gross. But poodle really likes these so I bought him 2 bags. For the price and usefulness, they can't be beat!

review/summary: Excellent Dog Treat
review/text: Right now, "Mini Naturals" are the only treat that I give to my dog.  I prefer them for several reasons:<br /><br />1) Ingredients:  When you buy any food or treat for your dog, it is always important to look at the ingredients and the first ingredient especially.  The first ingredient in the chicken flavored mini naturals is chicken.  In a lot of other treats it is something less nutritious like sugar or corn meal.<br /><br />2) Calories: I have a dog that gains weight easily.  Each mini natural has only 3 calories.  Many other treats have 15.  My dog has lost a little weight since I switched from the other treats I was using to mini naturals.  Although the treats are small in size, they are large and tasty enough to get my dog to do what I want him to do (most of the time).<br /><br />3) Flavor: My dog seems to like the chicken flavor the most.  He will eat the others but definitely seems to notice the difference and have a preference for chicken.  They all look the same to us but maybe not to our dogs.<br /><br />4) Buying on Amazon: I have been buying mine at a health pet food store.  But I was pleased to notice that it is actually a better deal to buy them on Amazon.  I will be doing this in the future.

review/text: This is a household staple for our dear dog who loves the taste. These treats are moist and firm enough for a few chews. They will dry  if left in the open, which is why we have a vacuum sealed container to put them in. The size is perfect-- it really is the size of a pencil eraser. We usually get the salmon because the smell is irresistible to our dog. When I have them around, a whiff and a look from me and our dog is sitting & staying for a treat. We also stuff a kong with it sometimes. We have 2 more bags around just so that we don't run out. We tried the peanut butter, it was great too but we keep coming back to salmon.

And I can't feed them bits of last nights steak since my poor minature pinscher is allergic to everthing.<br /><br />But with Zukes... he avoids wheat, corn, beef, milk, oats, all other sneaky grains/fillers/etc and he only gets the good stuff that he deserves and that his poor skin/coat can handle!<br /><br />And don't get me wrong... they will do plenty to get these little bites of good stuff, which is great because when I do have fresh meat for them to eat they tend to get too excited trying to get at it to hold a sit for long enough to deserve a treat!

review/summary: GREAT TREATS!!
review/text: I purchased Zuke's mini naturals in the Chicken flavor based on all the amazing reviews I had read on Amzon.com. Not only I was so pleased with thisproduct, so was my lil 4 months old lab pup! My husband and I used these mini treats for training and rewarding. The product was a great value as well. Just because each individual treat was so tiny and there were so many of them in one bag...it would've lasted a lot longer...if my mischeivious pupppy didn't get into the bag when my husband and I were gone...Yes, he loved these treats SO much, maybe too much that he ATE the ENTIRE BAG!!!! I was really concerned at first when we found out he had eaten almost a full bag (I bought the 1 lb bag about 2 weeks ago, so it wasn't completed full but there were still A TON of left in the bag). But, I was a little bit relieved knowing at least this product was made out of all natural and high quality ingredients. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 start was although the treats were made out of all natural and high quality ingredients, the smell was AWEFUL! My husband wouldn't even reach into the bag to get the treats...and after I gave these treats to my puppy, I had to wash my hands to get the smell off. That was my only complain about this product, otherwise, AWESOME product! I didn't plan on purchasing another 1 pound bag that soon but since my pup ate em all, I'll have to buy it AGAIN!

I have been able to teach him tricks and have him obey commands by using these treats.  They are one of the better treats out there for dogs as they do not contain corn.  The treats are very easy to break in half also for smaller servings.  They have other flavors as well, Salmon & Peanut butter but our dog seems to love the chicken ones.  We also put these in a food cube and make our dog work for them as well.  I definitely would recommend these.

review/summary: Great Product for Training Your Dog-- Great Price
review/text: Bought these treats to use when training my dog and they have worked perfectly.  The treats are small, low-calorie and can be broken into even smaller pieces.  They have a very strong odor, when makes them impossible for my dog to resist and an excellent reward for obedience training.  I highly recommend these treats.  **You should note that these treats will dry out quickly if you carry them in your pocket or leave them lying out.  They need to be keep in a container or baggie when you carry them so they will stay moist.

review/summary: Don't hold Dog's attention, Gas
review/text: I bought the chicken flavored treats for my dog. She'd eat them if I handed them to her, but they definitely weren't good enough for her to come running to me on a recall. That makes them kind of useless as training treats, which they're perfectly sized for.<br /><br />She also got serious gas from these treats.. which suggests they're probably lower quality food. Maybe your dog will like them, but if he/she's picky, don't bother.<br /><br />I just buy franks at the store and cut them up small. It's cheaper by far, and I can eat them as well. I usually microwave them long enough on high so they dry up, then they make perfect treats that don't make your hands sticky, but my dog likes them fresh a little better. Just a heads up.

review/summary: not for spoiled/finicky dogs who prefer stella and chewys
review/text: as a new dog owner, i made the mistake of feeding my dog super-premium, filler-free raw food and treats from stella and chewys since she was a pup. But because of the high price of Stella and Chewys, i switched to the Zukes mini chicken treats. My mini dachshund turned her nose up at the treats, over and over.  Even with nothing else to eat in the home, she actually preferred gnawing on her deer antler over the Zuke's.<br /><br />i'm not saying that these treats are bad at all---but it may be a waste of money for overindulged dogs with "caviar tastes" that have been spoiled by their owners (especially small companion dogs).

review/text: I have a 10 month old Boston Terrier and I use these treats when we go to puppy class and when we do exercises at home. He absolutely loves them and they are the perfect size for training. And since they are only 2 calories each, I don't feel too bad about giving him a handful. My only complaints are that they are kind of stinky (probably because of the fish oil) but it's nothing unbearable, and that because they are moist treats, they can dry out easily if you forget to seal the bag completely. Other than that, we both love these treats and I would recommend them to anyone.

review/text: My two ECS eat salmon dog food and it's hard to find a salmon treat and one that is affordable when you do find them.  These are PERFECT for agility, obedience, conformation-- you name it.  They do smell strong of Salmon (which, my boys love) and like the other reviewer, they will dry out pretty quickly if not kept sealed.  That being said, my boys will not hesitate to eat them if they do get dried out from leaving them in the bait bag.  At the 4-for-3 promotion price, you can't go wrong!

review/summary: My sheltie love these treats (and so does my sister's cat)
review/text: My 30 lb shetland sheepdog is picky.  She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats.  No "doggie junk food" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, salmon, comes from salmon being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />Also, we've found that my sister's cat goes nuts for these Zuke's in the salmon flavor.  They're not intended for cats, but my sister's cat apparently didn't read the package when she found and inhaled these.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.

review/summary: Why dogs won't eat them.
review/text: My pomeranian is 11 and will eat any treats. Heck, she eats more produce than most people do. So we bought the duck jerky and peanut butter bits. She won't touch either one. Now, she has never been given duck food so I'm not shocked that she wouldn't put it in her mouth, but she eats peanut butter like crazy. So, I looked at the ingredients and both packages contain tumeric, rosemary, and sage. I think that the seasoning may be what turn many dogs off. My dog won't eat seasoned meat. I'm not positive that this is the problem, or everyone's problem, but I don't see any other ingredients that would turn off dogs. Our pet supply store gave us a full refund and we chose another treat that she goes crazy over.

The small size is perfect for obedience training with my dog and none of the flavors I've found leave any mess in my pockets. Treats do not have to be large or impressive to be effective. The smaller the better, I say. My dog and I both really like these.

He does all the tricks he can without me even saying anything as soon as i take one of these out of the bag. He is crazy about them! I like that they are pretty small so i can give them a couple more a day, especially for training. I think they would work great for potty training! I love that they don't contain wheat, soy, corn, or artificial colors, flavors, or by-products. My dog love them and they are not bad for him either!

review/text: My dog LOVES these, especially the peanut butter ones.  He goes insane when i open the bag, and they are perfect for training. Id recommend cutting them in half for puppies, smaller dogs. they are already small, but it makes them easier to swallow and continue with rapid training. Dont listen to people about how bad they smell, sure they don;t smell like roses, but the smell is more than tolerable. The people say it is unbearable must have the most sensitive olfactory in the world. Just rinse your hands with water after, and the smell is gone. I prefer the smell of the peanut butter ones, and my dog loves them. gets reaaly excited, which is what i need when training him

review/summary: My dog loves these Zukes!
review/text: I got these treats because we needed chewy treats that our soft-coated wheaten terrier puppy could eat quickly during training. We had a lot of the cookie type treats earlier but it took too long for him to break apart the dry treats and lick up the crumbs. He'd also run around having only half-swallowed the treat and I worried about him choking. These treats were recommended to me by a friend and they have solved these problems.<br /><br />PROS<br />-- Our dog loves these treats. LOVES them. Mostly because they are so moist and chewy.<br />-- Even though they are chewy, the treats don't leave any residue on your hands or anything-- they are very clean.<br />-- quick and easy to chew. Seems to be a lot less unhealthy than many other treats out there.<br />-- definitely gets him to pay attention!<br /><br />CONS<br />-- you have to be careful of leaving the bag open as the treats can dry out, although I think you can put a damp napkin in and re-hydrate the treats.<br />-- These are a little too expensive for regular use, especially if you have a bigger dog.<br /><br />Our dog is medium sized and it is easy to go through these treats pretty quickly. Then again, you really need treats that a dog will go wild for, and these do the trick. Overall, these are great treats that we'd recommend to anyone that is looking for high quality dog treats. When he finishes his training for the day we toss a small handful of these around he floor and let him hunt them all down (he is a terrier so he loves it!).

review/summary: Love the idea, can't stand the smell!
review/text: My dog and I both love Zuke's.  The mini naturals are great for training because they are small but super flavorful.  This means that you don't have to cut them up or break them into little pieces (I'm looking at you, Buddy Biscuits), but your dog will still go the distance to earn them.  The small size makes them super convenient.  I have used the peanut butter, chicken, and salmon flavors.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the salmon flavor has an awful stench.  I am used to reeking like dog treats, but the salmon odor is too much.  Upon opening the bag for the first time, I gagged.  Even now, several months after purchasing the 1lb bag, I am still trying to get rid of these treats.  I tried passing them off on my mother, but she wouldn't take them because of the smell.  Yesterday I decided I would just bite the bullet and use them for training for a few days, but after just a couple minutes in the bag I use for treats, I gave up.  I just couldn't take it.  I stuck them back in the bag they came in.  I think I will mix the remaining treats with a giant glob of peanut butter to try to get rid of them in one stinky fell swoop.<br /><br />So Zuke's: we love you.  You have a great mission that both my dog and I both appreciate in our own ways.  The salmon mini naturals, however, definitely miss the mark.  We'll stick to the chicken and peanut butter flavors.

review/summary: Great treat!
review/text: This is a great treat to put inside the Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug Treat Dispensing Dog Toy.  My 60 pound 6 year old "puppy" goes nuts whenever she gets this treat/toy combo.  It is one of her favorite treats, it has a (moist treat) smell to it (which I think is tolerable and is what makes the dogs smell it from a mile away).  This bag barley lasts a month and I don't even give it to her every day.  One you open the seal, your dog will keep asking for more. Bag is resealable to help treats fresh.  Great for training too!

review/text: These treats are nice and small (about 1cm diameter, 1cm tall), making them excellent for training, and they're still popular after 6 bags! In addition, although the pricing is a little odd, they're much cheaper than at the local Petco. As others have stated they can dry out a little, but that hasn't been a problem for me.

review/summary: Wonderful Treats for training
review/text: Just have to say that the treats are great for training. They are small enough that they don't fill up your small - medium sized dog and allow for enough time to work on a couple of tricks or actions each day. I choose peanut butter just because I know my dog loves it and we don't have to get really messy with something like a kong or anything. The overall training has been going really well with these as I can take a handful and have more than enough left for each training session. I will say that the one thing is that they are small enough that you sometimes worry that the dog is going to bite your hand and not the treat so make sure to palm feed your dog and not try to pinch the food between two fingers.

review/summary: Dog Loves Treats but Bad for His Teeth
review/text: My dog loves this treat and it's great for training and teaching tricks.  I would not recommend them if you have a small dog prone to dental decay.  After going through many bags of these treats I learned that small dogs prone to dental problems should not have soft or sticky treats because they may promote dental problems. I did not know this and he recently had to have 7 teeth pulled.  I don't think it was entirely the fault of this particular treat but a combination of problems, but I think it could have been a factor. Overall, these are great for training.

review/summary: Perfet bite sized treats!
review/text: These treats are wonderful. They are healthy and you can tell they are full of EFA's. They do smell to high heaven of fish, so if you can't stand that smell, you won't like these. My dog won't eat fish, but she LOVES these. My dog does not drool, except when you open these up! These are her favorite treats, and she is a 45lb medium mutt. They are perfect for training rewards. She hates having her nails clipped, so when we clip her nails, I have my fiance pinch one of these in his fingers and she tries to get it from him and she's totally distracted from me clipping her nails. The price is right especially if you have prime!

review/text: I tried Zukes Minis after they were suggested by a vet tech as a great treat for training my new puppy.  They are soft and easy to cut into even smaller pieces so you can use a lot of them during training sessions.  The price through Amazon beats the pet and feed store prices by a long way, so I bought 3 large bags of different flavors.  The bags zip shut, so the treats stay fresh.  I just take out a handful and cut them in quarters, and keep them in another ZipLoc bag, enough for a few training sessions.  I cut them using both a pill cutter and a knife; I think using a knife is easier.  In their whole uncut size, they are only 4 calories each, so they are not a fattening treat either.  A great product I feel good about using.

I don't have to break the treats in half, and I can give her these treats  without worrying that she'll turn into a sausage.  Because she likes them so much, I never feel like I'm depriving her.  The bag is re-sealable and keeps the treats soft.  If the treats happen to dry out, just put a moist paper towel in the bag, and they will re-absorb the moisture.

review/summary: Great size, but not my dog's favorite
review/text: I bought these treats for the size. We go through a lot of treats on walks with our dog, who has some leash issues. I get frustrated with crumbs in my pockets and breaking up treats during walks. He is a picky fellow when it comes to treats. These are, in fact, a great size, but they dry out quickly as others have commented. I can live with that, but I think they may also lose flavor. My dog has become less and less interested in them, and it's to the point now where he seems to eat them as a favor to me. For the price, I can find more appealing treats elsewhere and live with permanent crumbs in my pocket.

review/text: Training usually requires lots of positive reinforcement (read: treats) for young dogs, so these treats are the perfect bite size rewards to use when training or rewarding your dog. They do give off an unpleasant scent when you open the bag, but hopefully you aren't the one eating them so this won't matter. And for those of you label-readers, these things are made with all-natural ingredients that are great for your dog.

She is just a "dainty" eater and even the smallest Milk Bones dog biscuits were too big for her liking. When my neice gave her a bag of Zukes Mini Naturals for her 1st birthday she went crazy for them! They are PERFECT for training and she responds wonderfully. I highly recommend these if your dog is a "dainty" eater (I've never had one before) and even if they will swallow a hot dog whole (like my last dog, a Lab) these Mini naturals will be loved.<br />Bob

review/summary: Perfect training treat!!
review/text: This treat amazing for training!<br /><br />I'm writing this in regards to my 5 month old puppy, somewhat food motivated, and my 12 year old lab mix, extremely food motivated.  I can't say how the treats would do for a very fussy dog.<br /><br />It never crumbles in your pocket but splits easily for giving small training rewards.  It's tiny enough to use a bunch without filling up your dog.  It has good ingredients.  It doesn't mess with the puppy's digestion.<br /><br />The only possible drawback is that it's smelly.  Not gross, just smells like fish.  They love the treats and I'm sure the odor has something to do with it, but they also can smell it on you, so you can't surprise them with a treat.<br /><br />Overall, the go-to treat for training, rewarding, and stuffing in toys to prevent separation anxiety.
