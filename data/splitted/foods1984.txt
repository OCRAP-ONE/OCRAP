review/summary: DON'T BUY IT!! BOWEL OBSTRUCTION
review/text: This bone single-handedly caused my Doberman puppy's bowel obstruction. After a 3 hour, $2000 surgery, it looks like she will be ok. Thank God. But the vet pulled huge chunks of this out of her stomach and intestine. So please do not let your dog have this. If you must, give them a dura chew.

review/summary: Watch out!
review/text: My puppy loves nylabones and it usually takes him a few months to start to rip off the pieces of the bone.  However, with this bone, he worked on it for one day and had eaten the entire top part off.  By the time I had seen what happened, I was looking around for the pieces, hoping he spit them out.  Well, obviously he didn't because he spent the night throwing up the pieces of the nylabone.  I will not be getting this kind of nylabone again.

review/text: I knew we needed something harder than a plush toy for this boy to work on when he started gnawing the chair legs. The pupppy bone (we use Souper size) keeps him happy and wears him out almost as much as a walk does. This is a great price; it's double at the pet store.

You should also try the Sangria flavor.  The Strawberry Wine actually has bits of strawberry in it.  Some people liked it, some didn't.

review/summary: It's like the old joke: these cheese straws are terrible, and the portions are so small!
review/text: I was initially disappointed on opening the package because the packages are so tiny.  Then I was more disappointed because they are less than half full.  There were maybe 20 small cheese straws in each package.  A four pack of Paula Deen has about the same amount of cheese straws as a single package of Geraldine's (the best packaged cheese straws, in my opinion, which sell for less than $5 a package).<br />But I suppose it's not a terrible thing that there are so few cheese straws because these taste terrible.  They use oil instead of butter, and I think that's the primary problem.  They're greasy instead of rich. They are also not nearly cheesy enough somehow.  Very disappointing on the whole.

review/text: I love Cheese Straws.  I'm from the south and this is a favorite snack of mine.  However, Paula Deen's brand is tasteless, without any of the real cheese taste.  If I were to eat the box it would probably be the same.  They are also incredibly dry.  If you want something like it without the high price, just go to a store and buy the store brand of cheese crackers.  You'll be happier.

review/summary: Truly strangely addictive
review/text: I discovered these in a local health food store when I began searching for seaweed products as a way to add some iodine to my diet. The store carried lots of products, but most were processed with nasty canola oil which I try to avoid as I do all the high-PUFA oils. Then I found SeaSnax which use olive oil!<br /><br />I bought some and the rest was history. Now I buy them in bulk from amazon because the price is much better. Yes, they do have a slightly fishy odor and flavor - but I *like* that. You may not like them as much as I do if that bothers you. But for me they are the perfect snack - great taste, a nice crunchy mouth-feel, low in carbs and calories. No matter what your eating goals or eating style - low carb, low cal, low fat, vegan, etc. these snacks can fill the bill, but you *must* like that slightly fishy taste and scent. However in my case I do!

review/summary: such a special gem, this one!
review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good tea, very gingery
review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

review/summary: Unacceptable Change to Product
review/text: When I had heard enough about dogs getting sick or dying after eating Chinese chicken jerky, I went looking for products made in the US and found this and have ordered several 1 lb bags. When fewer and fewer vendors were listed on amazon and the price quadrupled from my last purchase, I called the manufacturer to see if they had stopped making the product. The person said no, they had reformulated it so I waited for that to show up. Now it has so I went back to the manufacturer's web site to see what they changed.<br /><br />I was appalled by what I found. From my bags of the old product here is a list of the ingredients. Chicken, natural smoke flavor. That's all.<br /><br />Here's the reformulated product ingredient list: Chicken, betaine, brown sugar, cultured dextrose, sea salt, natural smoke flavor, garlic powder, mixed tocopherols (preservative), paprika extract color, rosemary extract.<br /><br />I didn't know what betaine was so I looked it up on the net. After reading about it, I still don't know what it is.<br /><br />The crude protein dropped from 77% to 50%.<br />crude fat increased from 2% to 5%.<br />moisture increased from 18% to 28%.<br /><br />I am not going to give this product to my dog and will make my own chicken jerky in the oven.<br />____________________<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I just went to a new Petco that opened near me. I found a 1 lb package of Colorado Naturals Chicken Jerky Dog Treats. Made in the US.<br /><br />Ingredients: Chicken breasts, natural flavorings.<br /><br />Crude protein 70%<br />Crude fat 3-7%<br />Moisture 10%<br /><br />I will be buying these when I run out of my old stock of True Chews.

Poland Spring is a very nice water but to provide an analogy; if Poland Spring is the Cadillac of water then Volvic is the Mercedes.... although the French would probably disagree.<br /><br />Be warned; if you buy a couple of bottles, you will be hooked and start buying two cases per month like we do.

review/summary: volvic spring water
review/text: Volvic Natural Spring Water is a good alternative to your normal bottle water.  The "volcanic" processing gives it a unique taste that I have not found anywhere else. I was first introduced to Volvic during a Eurpoean vacation (where bottled water is big). Volvic's products were competitively priced and flying off the shelf.  The 1.5 litter bottle seemed to be the most popular size for a day's consumption. Volvic's Touch of Fruit series is outstanding and should not be missed.  I just wish I could find the Touch of Fruit in 1.5 liter bottles in U.S. :)

review/summary: Excellent water!
review/text: I thought Fiji would be as good as it gets for clean, hydrating water. I was wrong! I tried this water on a whim, bought a whole case. It is like pure liquid oxygen...clean, soft, yet LIGHT, unlike Fiji. Fiji is soft, but there is a bit of heaviness to it. This water will hydrate you like no other...and you will find yourself enjoying drinking water. I've read that Volvic in the glass bottles taste even better as there does tend to be some leaching in plastic bottles. I also recently read that the silica content in this water works well to detoxify you from aluminum.<br /><br />You know how you get tired after eating a carb heavy meal? Drink a few ounces of this water before eating and that wont happen. Its like drinking it makes you lighter somehow.

review/summary: PERFECT WATER
review/text: I couldn't agree more with the customer who says you will be hooked.  This is one pricey love but I've been fond of this, "tastes like liquid oxygen" beverage since it got to the United States in the 80s!<br /><br />Then it was practically a salon item. I even called overseas to the French offices that controlled its distribution back then and was told, "you don't see it everywhere because we don't want it sold everywhere!".<br /><br />I started drinking it when it was $1.99 for this 50 ounce size now its nice to see it below $3 a bottle.  Once you have it you can't stand anything else I'm afraid.  I dragged in bottles via city cabs.  Then once my fingers could stand the shopping bag handles no more, I bribed delivery people to go beyond their store's delivery area to begin to get a monthly case.  Fast fwd 20 years finally I have online grocers who yes yes yes carry Volvic so my living rm looks like a Volvic storage facility at all times.<br /><br />Poland Spring tastes bitter by comparison and even Figi with its great bottle and all doesn't taste as clean and refreshing as Volvic does year in and year out.  I am so glad this luxury now involves giving clean well water to those in world who had no clean water (says so right on the bottle).<br /><br />There is a website that discusses the mineral content of bottled water brands.  I'll admit Volvic is certainly not high in any natural mineral but then that's why I say it tastes literally like liquid nothingness.  It isn't laden with minerals which sway the taste of water even though they're healthy for us.  I'll just have to get my minerals some other way.  Leave my water crystal clear please.<br /><br />Can't believe its finally available online minus the typical $56+ in shipping fees. haaalayleuyah.  Now I can actually gift it even to people in parts of the country who have never heard of this water let alone can't lug the 40lb box from a store to their homes far away.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />Issues with Packing.  Every box I get from Amazon of this product is a crushed box mess.  Interior Volvic box is busted open and in my last order even a bottle was missing.  So check your count when you get it.  Amazon needs to improve how they pack beverages.  That seems to be where if any you will get bashed or broken items.  Bottle liquids are heavy, that's why so many stores won't sell case sizes online.  Since Amazon is they needs to step up and not use free-post-office type weak cheap board boxes but mover quality high burst strength boxes instead.  That's what glass or weighty liquids require and that's all there is to it.  Take a lesson from some of the online liquor sources.  They Pack Right.

review/summary: Best Bottled Water Anywhere
review/text: I don't like most bottled water. Some seem tasteless and don't really seem to quench my thirst. I usually prefer a tea drink. Volvic is the exception. There is a balance to the natural mineral content that imparts a great water taste and drinkability. I have tasted bottled water from all over the world and some that are really expensive but this is the ONLY one that gives what you pay for. I have tried water such as glacier water from iceland and fiji water that are really ordinary except for the bottle packaging. Packaging does not impress me only taste. Chill your Volvic well before you try it and I guarantee you will find it exceptional if you can differentiate the taste of water. If not you may be able to now.

review/text: I ordered this water after hearing a recommendation on People's Pharmacy. Its high silica content is supposed to help purge aluminum from the body. Volvic water tastes so good I have made it a subscription order, and am now able to drink much more water daily. I find there is absolutely no aftertaste, it's totally refreshing.

review/summary: Lquid Nothingness
review/text: Liquid nothingness... What a perfect way to describe this water....  If you have never tried it and you can afford to do so may I highly suggest that you do just that....  These reviewers are 100% correct.  volvic water IS unquestionably, the best tasting water I have ever tried.....  What is crazy is that, as others have said, it tastes like... nothing...  I know it may be hard for you people who have never tried it to picture how a plain old bottled water can be so good... well it is....  I wish I could afford to drink nothing but this...  Here is a way to sell you on the stuff....  Buy a case of volvic, drink it exclusively (no other plain water) untill it's gone.  Now go back and resume drinking your old brand of bottled spring water.....  I can guarantee that you will then agree that any nestle` brand (ice mountain, deer park, poland spring, zephyrhills, arrowhead, calistoga, ozarka, ETC)  or aquafina or dasanti brand water you get, it tastes like it is contaminated now-  I guarantee it will<br /><br />While volvic may not be the very best water on earth, it is without question the best water available in North America!  go ahead, give it a try!

review/summary: Volvic Water Pricing Change
review/text: The French Volvic Water taste great.  I like it much better than the other water competitors.  It is a great way to jump start my day and keep my thirst quenched.  However, its pricing seems to have have jumped.  When I first bought it on Amazon, it paid $29 for a 12 pack (a liter and a half size).  However, when I went back to repurchase it a few months later the price has jumped to $47 a liter.  My question is why? It is still water.  FYI, that is 2.41 per container versus 3.91.  Did the distributer change or is it cheaper somewhere else????

review/summary: Dog Gives 5 stars
review/text: This review is for Blue Buffalo brand "Blue Bones" size small. My Dog is 16lbs so could use either the mini size (5lbs - 15lbs) or the small size (15lbs - 25lbs). Since he is very active I give him the small size. He really enjoys these bones, and gets one every day.<br /><br />I love that these are 100% digestible and won't cause intestinal blockage like rawhide products.<br /><br />These are not long term chews, like raw beef bones, or "Kong" chews. My dog usually prances around with the bone for a while before eating it, but when he settles down to chew it he has it eaten within five or so minutes. He is not a power chewer. Do supervise your dog when giving these as some dogs may attempt to swallow the pieces whole instead of chewing them to an appropriate size before swallowing.

review/text: I LOVE Patak's mixed pickles, but the seller shipped the mixed relish instead of the mixed pickles.  This also happened to my friend.  There is a huge difference in the pickles and the relish.  The relish is delicious, but it is not what I wanted.  I can't find the pickles anywhere now.  They aren't even listed on Patak's web site, so they may have discontinued this item.

review/summary: Favorite thing about Brazil
review/text: I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong.

review/summary: WARNING: Not for consumption by anyone having braces, dental implants or other dental appliances
review/text: With that proviso out of the way, these are some seriously awesome candies.  If you've read my other Amazon product reviews, you may find that I am a bit of a candy snob.  Tootsie Roll Caramel Apple Pops give you all the benefit of bobbin' for apples on Halloween, without the awkward costumes, getting wet, or any resulting nutritional value that one may enjoy from eating a real apple.<br /><br />I have to admit that I purchased these candies to give to a client; curiosity got the best of me and I found myself employing surgeon-like skills in extracting one lollipop from a box seam.  That is when I realized these lollipops are HUGE.  In fact, that is my only gripe with the candy - they are too large to comfortably enjoy without the need to occasionally take a break.  Also, I suspect that they were each shrink-wrapped immediately after manufacturing, so the caramel coating surrounding each lollipop takes on the irregular shape of the plastic sheath under which the candy is transported (occasionally bearing somewhat sharp edges).<br /><br />That said, the caramel coating is mild, but substantial enough where the consumer clearly enjoys two distinct types of candy - which I suppose is what Tootsie brand pops attempts to achieve.  Once you work your way through the caramel shell, the green apple "disc" is not overly tart - something I was concerned about after having Jolly Rancher brand green apple hard candies.  The combination of the caramel and the green apple candy pairs up perfectly.  You have to force yourself not to chew too much as the combination creates a bond that will surely rip out any dental appliance.

review/text: I love these lollipops! You used to be able to buy them at any store during Halloween, but now I can't find them anywhere. Since this candy is hard to find in stores, I was worried that I would buy them online and the candy would be old. When these lollipops get old (and by old, I mean like 2-3+ years), the caramel gets dangerously sticky and the lollipops taste bad. However, the product was really fresh and so delicious!<br /><br />The caramel on the lollipops is sticky so don't buy these if you're someone who likes to chomp down and chew on hard candy. Even after licking/sucking the pop for a while, it still won't come off the stick. The pop actually bends so if you do try and bite it off the stick, the candy will just bend around the stick and probably get stuck to your teeth. The apple part of the lollipop is tart so someone who is really sensitive to sour may not like these so much. The caramel layer is sweet and creamy. I really love these lollipops because they are a very satisfying candy (takes forever to eat one and then you don't really feel the need to eat another) and they have just the right amount of sweet/sour.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase these again.

Most all companies on Amazon split cost and box together to save shipping fees.  The shipping cost on this cereal is not worth ordering it at all if you can get something similar close to or where you live.  I can't get anything like this here where I live, and sadly to say the shipping makes the total price compared to amount of product I get (10 servings per bag, 1/2 cup per serving) not something I probably won't re order again.

Refrigerate or freeze your nut oils as well for the same reason; they can be re-frozen without any problems.)<br /><br />I don't use pine nuts all the time but when I do use them in a dish, I like to be a bit "heavy-handed" with them because I really like their flavor, so having this much on hand is a real boon!<br /><br />I hope that Amazon will continue to carry this product in the future at this price. I highly recommend this product so I am given it 5 STARS. Be smart when you buy them, order a little something else to bring the price up to "super saver" level and you won't even have to pay to have them shipped! Happy cooking, everyone!

review/summary: Beef Straganoff
review/text: January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.

review/text: Ladies and Gentleman, I cannot begin to express my joy in finding this Hazlenut Extract.  I'm breathless!<br /><br />I'd been buying flavored coffee grounds and mixing them 1/2 and 1/2 with my espresso beans. I can tell you that I've tried every brand of Hazlenut coffee grounds and syrups that I've come across.  SUCKY, each and everyone of them!<br /><br />I didn't know my coffee could taste so good!  Do you know how much 16 ounces of extract is? It's ALOT!!!!!<br /><br />I use a 1/4 teaspoon from the measuring cup set that I bought in my 12 ounce cup of coffee using those espresso beans I bought.  I can now buy the cheaper espresso beans and with this extract my coffee tastes the same as if I were using very high quality and very expensive beans.<br /><br />I spilled some one morning and didn't take the time to wipe it up from my ceramic tile coffee counter top.  I walked back in the house by myself a couple of times and with a few friends a couple of times and our faces lit up with surprise at how great the house smelled.  I'M NOT GOING TO EVER CLEAN IT UP!!! I may spill some every now and then on accident, on purpose!  Maybe I can make a household cleaner out of this and market it; I'd be FILTHY RICH!!!

review/summary: Not actual Russian Caravan tea
review/text: I am very disappointed in this tea and wish I could return it.  I've brewed two pots so far "just to make sure," but this tea does not taste like Russian Caravan tea.  I went to Davidson's website and found the reason why - they apparently don't use lapsang souchong in this tea.  I understand actual Russian Caravan tea to be a combination of lapsang souchong and Assam teas.  This one claims to be a combination of Assam and Sri Lankan teas.  Typically Sri Lanka produces Ceylon teas, whereas lapsang souchong is produced in China.  At any rate, this tea does not have the strong, smokey flavor that is associated with Russian Caravan tea, and one of the previous reviewers was correct in stating that it is bitter, no matter how you brew it.  It's a real shame, too, because I was very happy that this tea is organic.

review/text: I was looking for Russian Caravan tea, so tried this out. It's fine, drinkable, but just a bit too light for my taste. I may either need to brew it longer to get the flavor to set in more (but that usually just makes a black tea more bitter) or use more (again, bitter). Maybe it just doesn't stand up to milk well, but the one's I've had in the past did much better w/ milk.

review/text: I brew my Russan Caravan in a samovar so I probably have different results to some of the others. The smoky flavor is a bit lighter than I was expecting however brewed traditionally as zavarka, the tea has neither a dusty nor bitter flavor and since zavarka is continually heated with the leaves in, it continues to get darker and richer the longer it is there. I haven't tried to brew it in an infuser at all though so your mileage may vary.

It is exactly as I remembered it when I had it at an extremely authentic Italian restaurant in NY. The only thing I was not expecting is the packaging is different than the photo provided, and the cooking time they suggest needs to be increased (I.M.O.).  But I expect lots of high quality pastas always need tinkering depending on what your making. My only regret is that I didn't buy more at the time because it was so good we went through all 3 bags in 2 weeks! My Shrimp Cavatelli in sage cream sauce is that good apparently! :) If you'd like the recipe let me know. ;)

review/summary: Vinegar Is Magic!
review/text: I have always heard about vinegar being great for cleaning, I'm sure I even used it to clean a microwave before, and I know I've soaked mildew-smelling clothes in vinegar water which was successful. But, it wasn't until I bought a steam mop (here on Amazon) and tackled my vinyl kitchen floors, that hadn't been well cleaned in years... that I discovered the MAGIC of vinegar. This steam mop left my floor so tacky and sticky, if I stood in one place, I felt like either the floor or my skin was going to come off. I took to the internet for a solution. Someone said to mop the floor with vinegar. Skeptical, but desperate, I did ONE mopping of the vinegar all over the kitchen floor. Just like that, as soon as it dried my floor was clean again. Extremely excited, I looked up more magic ways vinegar cleans. Then I ran out of vinegar, and had to buy some more. I have used it now to clean faux wood blinds that had grease & dust buildup, air return vent that had years of residue & dust build up, and stained toilets. I now keep a generic spray bottle of vinegar for cleaning anything.<br />Alright, I am a believer now. Vinegar is magic.

I ate 4 anyway and got a belly ache.  I am used to using xylitol daily in my tea, so it was not an issue of not being used to it.  I called the company and was told the chocolates were fine, that the white coating happens sometimes in shipping.  Funny, I've never received any other shipped chocolates that turned white, have just seen it before on out of date chocolates.  I told her they gave me indigestion and she said people should eat no more than one a day because they contain a lot of xylitol.  Shouldn't that be a warning on the package?  So I tried just eating one.  Belly ache again.  And I was denied a refund or even a discount on my next xylitol order!  Guess they don't want my business.

Plus the assurance of no hormones, preservatives, or msg as shouted on the big green sticker on the package. The quality is there, no doubt.<br /><br />So what's wrong with it? It's right there, second on the list of ingredients -- SUGAR! This jerky is too sweet! I ordered the Peppered flavor and I was expecting a savory treat, a nice snack for the afternoons. Instead, this stuff is as sweet as maple syrup and not really what I wanted.<br /><br />Too bad, as I'm now stuck with 8 of these packages. For now, I'm going back to the SnackMasters brand. The quality is not as good but the flavor is many times better.

review/text: If you are looking for traditional jerky, you will want to order the slab style, which I would give 4 stars. High marks for hormone free and vegetarian fed. Their regular jerky is nothing like you would expect and I would only give it two stars, because the product description does not accurately reflect what you are getting. It is not thin, dried strips of buffalo. It is chopped up, extruded, and sliced into "O" shapes. If you look at the product packaging for their regular jerky, look at the letter "O" in buffalo. The name itself indicates that you have "O" shapes inside, but nowhere in the name or description is that mentioned. I'm sure many people will like this, but it's definitely not the "jerky experience" that most are looking for when they buy jerky.

review/summary: Good Buffalo Jerkey but wierd shape...
review/text: Although I've had better buffalo jerkey this stuff is pretty good.  My only issue is that the jerkey is processed into a flat disc of meat.  The shape makes the jerkey feel more processed.  It takes away from the experience of eating jerkey.  Next time I'll get the slab style.

review/summary: Ground Meat Overly Sugarized Then Pressed Into Circle Patties
review/text: This stuff is made from ground meat then formed into circle patties. It tastes OK, but not the quality of many grocery store brand jerkies. I am not going to buy this product anymore nor would I recommend it.<br /><br />The best buffalo jerky I have ever found is the Trader Joe's brand. They take whole pieces of thinly sliced buffalo steak and have sweet or spicy flavors. Great stuff!
