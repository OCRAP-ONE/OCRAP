review/summary: Some really great and some really really bad
review/text: Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free. I always have at least three bottles of this in my cabinet at all times.<br /><br />Orange - Very sweet but good. I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more. I am cautiously optimistic about the diet ginger ale so that will be my next purchase.

review/summary: A fairly "meh" generic cola.
review/text: I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other "b-list" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the "kick" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula. I'm pretty sure there's got to be a better option out there that does not involve spending $150 on a 5 gallon bag of Coca Cola syrup (which would have the high fructose corn syrup that I've been trying to avoid anyway).

review/text: We love our SodaStream and have found several of the mixes we like including the Root Beer.  It is not as good as A&W root beer but it makes a great root beer float.  It does not taste overly sweet, nor does it leave you with a chemical after taste.  Plus it is nice that you can control how much syrup you add to play with the flavor a bit.  I would recommend at least trying this syrup and definately use it for a root beer float!

review/summary: With a little doctoring, very good
review/text: This is better than diet but falls short of brand name cola taste.  I feel the cola flavor is a little "spicy" and not fruity enough. I tried a few mixin's and now I think it is great.  If it came as good as I can mix it, I would give it five stars.  If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that.

review/text: I chose the diet soda. Notice that the total amount of the product is not written. I was perplexed at first, but then discerned that the product image clearly says 750ml. So at $8.39 it seemed to be a decent price. However what I received was a 500ml bottle. Not worth the hassle of returning for a couple of bucks, but an annoyance none the less. So beware when you purchase. I suggest you assume that you will receive a 500ml bottle.

This is nothing but a customer advisory.  Buy the syrups direct and save a bundle.  As for the product, its a great product.  Spending 99.00 on the machine means I have to drink a LOT of soda to equal 99.00 of sodas but it is more fun and a lot less waste.

review/summary: Tastes like Redbull, doesn't look so much like Redbull and smells a little vitaminy
review/text: First thing, this does give you energy just like an energy drink. It also tastes very similar to Redbull. When I burp, it has the similar energy drink belch smell that energy drinks have for some reason. The color is not quite the same as Redbull.<br /><br />But having said all that I still find this to be an excellent value when you compare the prices of Redbull vs this mixture. At the store, Redbulls are $1.99 where as this one costs maybe $0.40 after all is said and done (cost of carbonation, syrup, shipping charged on carbonation, etc). I made that number up in my head though, did not use a calculator or even really think mathmatically about it so it is pretty much a made up cost I pulled out of the air and doesn't represent anything truthfully.<br /><br />Anyhow, I know it is a much cheaper solution, I enjoy it and am drinking some now.

review/summary: Flavors from home and childhood
review/text: The sodastream has been a real help to my family we are currently serving overseas and while there is an abundance of coke here the other flavors of soda are shall we say lacking! Some are so bitter that they are not palatable to my family. Rootbeer is a favorite and the sodastream has it nearly perfect to the rootbeer my dad made when I was young! I think that a touch more syrup is necessary to reach the true rootbeer flavor so it gets one less use for my family than the bottle says and I think there is an underlying mint flavor that is not overwhelming or unwanted but a bit noticeable to me. I did not give it 4 stars because the items arrived dented and not packed as well as I would have liked to make the journey overseas not punctured but close. It was however shipped quickly and without delay. I have not tried the diet in any flavor other than cola and with  the significantly lower sugar count in the regular probably wont but wouldnt mind hearin how they are! Thanks for shipping to us folks overseas since the sodastream site will not and where they have international sites they will only ship the flavor varieties for each country! That doesnt help much for me!

review/text: With all of the recent problems and publicity over contaminated medicine, pet food, and bibs with lead from China, the fact that this juice is made from Apple "concentrate" from a country, seemingly without a lot of standards or oversight is extremely worrisome.  I am especially concerned because apple juice is frequently given to children and toddlers.  The company didn't even put this on the label but imprinted on the container which is not obvious.  It is clear that the company didn't want to advertise this.  However, on the company website, they proudly proclaim that apples are from the U.S.  I believe this is misleading and disingenuous.  I'm telling all of my friends to stop buying this product and for them to spread the word.

It's way too expensive and the pre-ground coffee is very fine (like espresso) and choked up the coffee machine every time when I first started using it, leading to coffee grounds floating around in my coffee cup.  The simple solution?  Brewing six cups at a time instead of eight - works like a charm.  Overall I'd rate this product as 'wonderful' and would strongly recommend it to my friends :)

review/summary: Definitely Smoky!
review/text: This a wonderful, smoky salt. You can smell how smoky it is when you open the package. It has a finer texture than some other salts, and seems saltier as well. I don't eat meat, but I imagine it would be wonderful on hearty, savory meat dishes like beef and bar-b-que. I love it on cooked greens, and grilled veggies, especially portabello mushrooms. Adds alot of flavor to boring popcorn, too. A good purchase, and attractive packaging as well. The bottom of the container is magnetized, so you can stick it to the fridge, or on the stands that are sold separately.

review/summary: Robust Flavor
review/text: So glad this is now available at amazon.com.  This is absolutely one of the best coffees in the Tassimo line.  It has a robust flavor without being overwhelming or bitter as some Columbian coffee can be.  I hope this selection is added to the Subscribe & Save stable of products.  I do find the price to be out of line with other sources prices, e.g., Bed, Bath & Beyond sells this everyday for $9.99 + tax as does our local Target, Sears and K-Mart stores.  Also, Bed, Bath & Beyond offers a 20% off coupon every so often which helps bring the price down even further.  Take note, amazon.com.  You are way overpriced on this item.  Five stars for the coffee itsself, one star for the amazon price.

review/text: Wow, I was super impressed with this item.  I wanted a cool party favor for my sons' birthday party, and boy did I get it.  I purchased them for around $40 (this includes shipping costs) here on Amazon and couldn't be happier.  I got 36 lollipops and they all arrived unbroken.  They are enormous, colorful, and well sealed.  The kids at the party are going to be thrilled.  At around $1/party favor, this was a great deal for something so different and festive.  I'm sure all the parents will hate me for giving their kid such a big sugar boost, but I'm still thrilled with my purchase and can't wait to see the happy recipiants.  I will even double the value by using them in my centerpieces.

The tops rarely stay on and the plastic container occassionally snaps.  The positive is that the contents never last more than one day in my house.  We purchase the six pack and it lasts maybe six days because of the delicious taste.

review/summary: Bonita! The magic word that makes my cat go bonkers :-)
review/text: It wasn't until a few months ago that I introduced my cat to Bonito flakes. The fact that it's all natural is a big plus. I had previously purchased Cat-Man-Doo Extra Large Bonito Flakes and he went nuts over it. The 4oz. bag lasted a little over 2 months. I was going to order another bag but the price has gone up $10, so I decided to try Bellyrubs instead. Even though you get .5oz less with Bellyrubs there seems to be less dusting and small flakes. The flakes also seem to be softer and the ziploc bag is a little more robust. My 6 yr. old black cat loves this stuff and gives it two paws up.<br /><br />Food for thought: Bonita means "pretty" in Spanish, and Bonito is the correct spelling of the fish.

We tried quite a few foods but found that bonito type food was something she enjoyed and it really aided in bringing her back to health.<br /><br />The reason I like this product is that the flakes are a nice size and there does not seem to be all the powdered up flakes like in other products.

review/summary: Cat Loves but it makes her throw up
review/text: I've been buying thus for my cat for about 6 months now.  She's always had a bit of a problem with throwing up so i didn't notice itr at first.  But now that I've had a few months of experience with it I can confirm that it makes her throw up.  I would say 7 out of 10 times she throws up not even after, but while she's eating it!  At first I didn't think anything about it, I thought she was just randomly throwing up.  But today I noticed she threw up while she was near finishing what I had put down for her.  So just as a test I decided to give her a little more and she threw up in less than a minute of eating it.<br /><br />So, I don't know what to tell you.  Maybe it's just my cat.  I can't imagine they sell this and it happens to every car!  My cat is 16 and in really good health considering her age.  But maybe it's age related, I don't know.  I just know i won't bed able to give her this anymore.  But I'm going to have to find a good substitute fast because she's so addicted to it, she starts yelling for more every day at the same time!!

review/text: These were a surprising flop as far as my indoor cat and a neighbor's visiting cat. Initially I thought it was our Kitty being finicky as she tends to be, but when the neighbor's omnivorous cat similarly ignored these flakes I puzzled over what was up with them. I've bought other brands before and have encountered one hit and one other miss. What makes some appealing to the cats and others not is a mystery. I couldn't see any visible difference and the scent seemed appropriately fishy, but something did not strike a chord with the cats. Wish I hadn't sprung for this economy sized bag.

review/summary: a lot of tuna flakes for the price
review/text: I had bough another brand of tuna flakes to try on our two cats.  They loved it!  It was a 1-ounce bag and fairly expensive.  So I went looking for a better deal and found this 3.5 oz bag from Bellyrubs.  Don't let the small ounces deceive you this is a LARGE bag of tuna flakes.  Remember they don't weigh much.  Our cats really like this brand.  It has helped us transition them to new dry foods.  We sprinkle a little on their dry food as a treat. That's probably the best way to give it to them.  The flakes aren't as easy for them to eat on the floor or on a plate by themselves.  This is a great value for the money and this large bag will last a long time.

review/summary: Fantastic value and finicky cats love 'em!
review/text: I had been buying bonito tuna flakes in the pet store for $10 an ounce, so I was thrilled when I found these BellyRub treats on Amazon at only $15 for 3 1/2 ounces.  I was skeptical at first because the store ones had a lot of very small flakes at the bottom, almost "bonito dust" and I thought these might be amost all "dust."  But yahoo!  The BellyRub flakes are BETTER than the store treats - the flakes are larger, hold together better, and there's no "bonito dust" at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />For those concerned about additives to their pets' food, the only thing in this product is Bonito Tuna.  That's it.  They're dried, so no need for preservatives.<br /><br />If you've never bought tuna flakes before, you should know that 3 1/2 ounces is a lot of flakes. They come in a resealable bag - and the bag is similar in size to a bag of potato chips once you let the air out and nope, the tuna flakes aren't packed with extra air.<br /><br />The true test: my cats' noses.  They dug right in to these!  Didn't notice a change from the store variety.

review/summary: Macarons with great flavor and freshness!
review/text: Disappointed with previous orders of Macarons from other US places, I didn't expect these to be much better. I fell in love with macarons when I was in France but had found nowhere to buy locally and ordered products ranged from rock hard/stale to crumbled messes. These arrived safely packaged, fresh and wonderful flavor. I highly recommend this company to anyone seeing quality items.

review/text: We are really enjoying this dish.  You can fluff it a bit with a fork after removing it from the foil package if you want to. The taste is very pleasant and it has a wonderful texture. We serve this along with other MTR and Tasty Bite foil packed Indian foods for a quick and delicious meal. Just make some rice. These packets are also ideal for camping or for emergency meals. At under $3 a package, it is a good price.

review/summary: Where did the raisins go?  I wanted a granola bar, not a barley/rice bar.
review/text: I stumbled across these in the grocery store today, after having purchased the 25% less sugar chocolate chip version.  Surely there must be a tasty oatmeal raisin equivalent, my stomach wondered.  Sure enough there is!  Just 90 calories, 10% less than the chocolate chip version?!  Sounds promising I thought.  No high fructose corn syrup, 0 g trans fats, sign me up!  Upon closer inspection, these granola bars aren't quite as healthy as they're advertised; they still contain corn syrup, though not "high fructose" corn syrup, as well as a bunch of preservatives, oligofructose, polydextrose, and various hydrogenated oils.  Minus 1 star.<br /><br />Taste wise, they're terrible compared to their low fat chocolate chip brethren.  There's nary a raisin to be found, and somehow, the oatmeal to barley/rice ratio is very low on these compared to the chocolate chip version.  If I wanted a barley/rice bar, I wouldn't have bought a product that said "granola" on the front.  Additionally, the bar is very dry; I think the lack of a nice fat (chocolate chips) definitely leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />Don't buy the 90 calorie oatmeal raisin bars.  Buy the lowfat 100 cal chocolate chip ones if you truly must have "lowfat", but I'd recommend just getting the full-fat, tastier regular Quaker bars.  It's really only just a 40 calorie difference, and you can teach yourself some better self-discipline.

review/summary: Not Much of a Granola Bar...
review/text: These granola bars were somewhat of a disappointment.  They are VERY, VERY small, contain LOADS of various sugars (sugar, molasses, barley malt, corn syrup, corn syrup solids, invert sugar, sorbitol and fructose) and preservatives (TBHQ and BHT), are SPARSE on raisins and contain all sorts of things not usually in granola bars---like oatmeal cookie pieces, crispy rice, rice flour and glycerin.  They also contain partially hydrogenated AND hydrogenated oils---both of soybean and cottonseed (ie: trans fat, even though the nutrition facts say 0 Grams trans fat).  I expected something a little more nutritious from Quaker Oats.  If you don't mind this stuff, they did taste okay (mostly like cinnamon), but were too sweet and not "raisiny".  About two medium bites per bar.  The price from Amazon was good and Amazon shipped them quickly and in good condition.

review/summary: Great healthy snack
review/text: The Oatmeal Raisin bars by Quaker are a tasty treat, but unlike some bars, they aren't too sweet or too bland. They have enough sweentess to make them flavorful, but don't go to extremes. They are relatively low in fat content (90 calories, 15 fat calories) and pretty convenient to have with you if you just want a quick snack, but don't want anything too heavy. They are also appropriate for any time when you get a little craving for something unhealthy (something you might regret), something like potato chips or cookies. For this reason, they are a healthy alternative to "junk" food. I tend to like to eat them for breakfast, but they are also an excellent "in between" meals snack. In stores, it will cost you about three or four dollars for a pack of 10. I've tried a few of the others kinds made by Quaker Oats, but these are my favorites.

review/summary: A Poor Choice for a Granola Bar
review/text: The first disappointment came when I opened the box and discovered the size of the "bars" which were barely bigger than a Tootsie Roll Snack Size.  The oatmeal raisin that I tried was much too sweet and consisted mostly of rice.  I saw little evidence of oats and only one single raisin in the whole bar.  For a few calories more, I'd go with the Fiber Plus bars which tastes significantly better and whose fiber count fills you up.

review/summary: sought-after version of favored product
review/text: Patak's Tandoori Paste is a condiment that I have used and savored for many years.  When it disappeared from local grocery store shelves in recent years, I lamented the loss but fortunately still had a couple of jars in my pantry.  Then I located it on Amazon but was appalled to find that this perfectly tastebud-tantalizing, formerly all-natural product now is being adulterated by the addition of red food dye (in which case I will not purchase it).  In a further search on Amazon, however, I was extremely relieved to learn that the original, all-natural-recipe product remains in existence as well (perhaps by popular protest of the undesirable and unnecessary additive), so I happily awaited its availability.  Although I'm drawn to any food product showcasing the flavors of ginger and garlic, I find this particular product especially appealing due to its inclusion of tamarind, that unique-tasting, lusciously tart tropical fruit that lends an irresistible quality to any recipe in which it is used.  I consider Patak's Tandoori Paste (previously labeled Ginger-Garlic Marinade) equally delightful as a marinade when mixed with a bit of plain yoghurt or as a rub straight from the jar (or even as a zingy sandwich spread when sparingly applied to brighten the flavor of chicken or turkey -- or whatever you choose)!

review/summary: I'm glad I took the risk...Melts in your mouth.
review/text: I rarely give 5-star reviews. Just look at my other entries. Buying food on Amazon is risky in my opinion - especially when it is purchased sight unseen. Let me simply say this about the private reserve roast. It was outstanding and the big hit of the Chrsitmas dinner this year. After letting it thaw for three days in the refrigerator and then setting it out on the counter for a couple hours to come up to room temperature, I set about making a simple rub of olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and minced garlic. I then put it on a hot gas grill and seared it for about 2-3 minutes on each side. It then went into a preheated oven set to 250 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. That brought the internal temperature to about 140 degrees, a perfect medium rare in the middle and medium on the ends. It literally melted in your mouth and could be cut with a fork. My dinner guests said it was literally one of the finest tasting tenderloin roasts they had ever eaten. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this from Omaha Steaks on Amazon again. It might just become a new Chrsitmas day tradition.

review/summary: Great for small to medium size dogs
review/text: I have two dogs - one is an Aussie Blue Heeler and the other a Corgi/Pug mix.  They both love these bones (and one of them is a very picky eater.)  I love that they don't make my Corgi/Pug mix barf or choke.  They're easily consumed and gentle on their tummies and my mixed breed dog has a super sensitive stomach, (he's unable to eat anything except for dog food or bread without barfing), so these bones are a big plus for us all around.  The only reason I didn't give a full five stars is that both the price and the shipping expense are a bit steep for such small bones (literally 2.5" each) and they don't seem to last long for medium size dogs - I usually give our Aussie two at a time.

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!

It was smooth, and crisp, and felt like the flavors just keep hitting your tongue as it goes down. It's going to take me a bit to discern the different tastes in here, but they work so well together, mostly I'm just enjoying them all. Great stuff, I highly recommend if you like flavored teas.

review/summary: Galivanting in the Dutch East Indies in the Name of the Queen...
review/text: The scent of freshly steeped Superfruit White Mangosteen with Peach tea... reminds me of my voyages...<br /><br />It was hot.  The air was thick.  It hung.  It began to rain.  The H.M.S. Peregrine Caverdish rolled ever so slight.  The scud's indicated squally weather.  Such was life on the seas around the Dutch East Indies in the Spring of 1931.  There was no escaping it.  The fear to be lost to Davey Jones locker was never more present.<br /><br />"Make no mistake gentleman!", I yelled at my crew, "The seas are an ugly today my friends, but Her Majesty will carry the day!".  "Man the rigging!  First Mate Tignor, hold the line!!!"  "Aye, skipper", First Mate Tignor sung.  My crew was steady, but they were tired.  It had been a long and perilous journey around the Cape of Good Hope.  Rations were meager, but morale was high.  Our journey was epic.<br /><br />Beneath deck I sighed to Boson's Mate Micklegal, "Curses that scoundrel Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford!  There is much of us he asks, but for he does not know the dangerous chain of events for which he has set to motion."  Truth be told, traveling through the Dutch East Indies always left me uneasy.  Boson's Mate Micklegal sensed this.<br /><br />"Captain, the line is steady, our bearings are true.  She's tip top Captain.  The Western winds will carry us.  Do not lose faith, Captain.", said Boson's Mate Micklegal.  A cheery fellow, Boson's Mate Micklegal was.  He threw the kettle of Earl Grey onto the flame.  "Cup of Earl Grey, Captain?", he asked.  He always knew how to raise morale.  Boson's Mate Micklegal, as any fine Englishman, knows that Earl Grey is the finest tea in all the Empire, and as is known, that "The Earl", is the tea of Kings.  "I'm going to check on the boys", he said, and he vanished up top.<br /><br />So why did the H.M.S. Peregrine Caverdish find herself in the middle of this confusing and dense achieapalgo?  Her Majesty, Queen Victoria.  You see, Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, offered 100 pounds to anyone who could return the sacred Purple Mangosteen to her fresh and free of tropical disease.  So we sought to follow in the footsteps of James Herbert Veitch who said of his journey's to this foreign land that, "to eat the Mangosteen it is necessary to eat the Mangosteen grown within three or four degrees of latitude of the equator to realize at all the attractive and curious properties of this fruit."  Alas, Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford set orders, and when Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford set orders, the crew H.M.S. Peregrine Caverdish obeyed. But the journey would not be simple.  Before us and the Mangosteen stood Privateer infested Dutch waters, malaria infested jungles, and the legendary humanoid beast, the "java man".<br /><br />We knew the legendary Dutch privateer, Jan Janszoon was somewhere within these waters.  Our goal was simple, to reach the Spice Islands, retrieve the Purple Mangosteen, return it to Queen Victoria, and enjoy the splendor of our bounty.  First Mate Tignor had used the celestial heavens to plot our course directly to the Maluku Islands, home of the Tropical Evergreen Tree bearing said Mangosteen.  I clenched onto the port deck, and dug in.<br /><br />First Mate Tignor anchored the H.M.S. Peregrine Caverdish in the shallows a hundred meters from the sandy shore.  First Mate Tignor, Boson's Mate Micklegal, Midshipman Householder and myself boarded the longboat and approached the shore.  We traveled through 6 kilometers of malaria infested jungles.  The boys were tense at the thought of encounter with the "java man".  As we pushed out way close to the Mangosteen Tree, we sensed that we were not alone.<br /><br />Then from out of nowhere, jumped out the wretched beast, a humanoid creature, with distinct ancient features, as if time forgot this creature.  The Java Man appeared similar to Caveman exhibits I remembered from my youth visits at the Natural History Museum on Exhibition Road, South Kensington, London, England, as a young lad.  As we recoiled in horror, Boson's Mate Micklegal, ever the young ing&eacute;nue, picked up a stone, and with all his might, slung it at the Java Man, striking him square in the head.  With a forceful grunt, the Java Man collapsed at the foot of the Mangosteen tree.  "If the Java Man were as true and gentlemanly as an Englishman, he would be called the Tea Man", Boson's Mate Micklegal stated with a chuckle, ever the subtle humourist.<br /><br />Back at the boat, Boson's Mate Micklegal added the zest of the Mangosteen, along with peaches that remained from our previous summer's voyage to Zanzibar to the loose tea leaves, and four minutes later, we had a delicious concoction that tasted of pure victory.  Like any victory, this was cause for celebration.  Boson's Mate Micklegal pulled out a bottle of Glen Fiddyich he had stowed away in the hold, and we all celebrated our victory.<br /><br />However, Boson's Mate Micklegal, ever the fan of a fine scotch, and often victim of such devlish vices, filled his belly with too much scotch.  At some point, in his sloshed bender, Boson's Mate Micklegal ate all the Mangosteen.  The ultimate irony being that despite our victory, there would be no bounty from Queen Victoria.<br /><br />I do believe that was a difficult time, and it was a scar we all carried until the hacks at Lipton discovered Superfruit White Mangosteen with Peach tea.  Truly, a unique flavor as harrowing as it's conception.

review/summary: Great tea
review/text: This tea is really good. Be careful though... I like strong tea so I didn't follow the directions and added more tea.  It was a little stronger than I bargained for, but still quite good.  Worth the money, if you are a tea drinker.

review/summary: A real "roast" one can toast
review/text: This is Starbuck's strongest and boldest coffee.  If you like your cappuccino strong, then this is the best bean for you.  If you want to take a bit of the bite out of it as I do, then try blending it with their Verona bean.

review/summary: Excellent Coffee
review/text: The coffee is wonderful but the price has now stopped me from buying it.  Last month it was $23 for 3 bags, now $40 for the same... Rediculous!
