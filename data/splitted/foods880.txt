review/summary: really disappointed
review/text: though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did

review/summary: Did Nothing
review/text: I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.

review/summary: Tastes like sweaty gym socks
review/text: I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

review/summary: Shocking confession
review/text: I don't like hot cereal with sugar and milk.  An addict of oat bran, I make mine with chicken broth (+half water) and a couple of added herbs and onion flavoring.  Every morning it's like being allowed to eat all the delicious stuffing out of the turkey with no guilt!<br /><br />Hodgson's Mill Oat Bran seems to be the best of the lot -- it tastes freshly milled and it cooks quickly.  But it's hard to find in certain areas and the company's customer service is not helpful when it comes to finding retailers.  Thank goodness for Amazon.<br /><br />As a regular user for several months now, it's nice to report a weight loss, even during the holiday season and cold winter.  Could that be because a bowl of oat bran (with no added fat) is so filling that snacks and even lunch become unnecessary?

review/summary: Best Oat Bran Out There
review/text: I used to eat Quaker Oat Bran but one day discovered Hodgson's. I eat it every morning and it is the best, brown and crunchy compared to the bland whiteness of Quaker or Mother's. I add water and a few peach slices, some ginger and a pinch of pepper, then two minutes in the microwave and it's a great way to start the day. When my local supermarket stopped carrying it, for some reason, I found this offer and immediately bought 10 boxes.  And when they're gone, I'll buy 10 more!

review/text: This is the BEST OAT Bran cereal.  But one star because it is over-priced!  Should be less than $3.00 a box, if purchased from your local grocery store, such as Harris Teeter or Publix.  Or order directly from Hodgson Mill website for a case with 6 boxes for a total of $11.50, though shipping costs are high. Or order from iherb website at $2.07 a box, lower shipping charges.  Still this is the best Oat Bran cereal in the market.

review/summary: Big rip-off, do not buy from Hoosier Farms
review/text: If I could leave negative stars about this seller I would.<br /><br />I found this product last week while after getting a cookbook that was published by the Hodgson Mill company.  This product came up in my searches and was originally listed at 8.43 (0.0439 unit price).  In the desciption it said this was for 12 boxes of 16oz oat bran.  That correctly added up to the .0439 unit price 8.43/(12*16).  I sent an email to Hoosier Farms to make sure that was correct before dering becuase it was a really good deal and I waited until the next day but did not get a personal response.<br /><br />The following day after I sent the email I decided to go ahead and order this and I then saw that the price had increased to 10.22 with a unit price of .053229 but the description was unchanged, still had 12 boxes (16oz).  So I placed my order.<br /><br />I received my shipment last night and I only received 1 box of 16oz oat bran and then when I logged onto my account and checked I see that the decription had been changed to state it was for only one box with a unit price of 10.22.<br /><br />I will be returning this box ASAP since I can buy this same product locally for half the price.<br /><br />Bad, bad business practices. I will leave a bad review for Hoosier Farms everywhere I can.  If they had personally responded to my original email this could have been avoided

review/text: My husband and I have eaten this excellent brand of Oat Bran every morning for many years. It has a nice, slightly chewy texture rather than being overly powdery--which makes us gag. We prefer to cook it with enough water to make it soupy, pour it into tall glasses, and drink it while we're on the computer or doing our morning reading. We also drink it in the car when we're on the run. We recently moved to another state and had trouble finding it locally. Amazon delivers right to our door for less than we could buy it in the grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty Treats For Toy Dogs
review/text: I am lucky in that my 1 year Chihuahua isn't picky about his snacks and will eat just about anything. This product is no exception. I gave him one and he promptly took it to his favorite "eating spot" on the rug and went at it. I like the fact that it is low in fat and has somewhat natural ingredients as well as being good for the teeth. Since Chihuahuas can have dental problems, I am all for products that keep their teeth in good condition, since dental cleanings are quite expensive. Anyhow, he knows where his treats are kept and will eagerly anticipate getting one of these or some other tasty snack. Although it's made in China, my dog hasn't had any adverse reaction to the product. The product can get expensive but you can probably find a deal on it at your local pet store. That's how I first discovered these.

review/text: MY dog doesn't like many treats so I was delighted when I found the small packs at Petsmart.  They no longer carry them. Going online, I discovered that you sell them. For several months I have purchased these from you and my dog has loved them.  My last order seems to have changed.  The texture and color seem different and my dog won't eat them at all.  I don't know if this is a one time thing or the change is permanent.  I am very, very disappointed. The other treats I bought at the same time are the same, or at least she eats them sometimes.<br />So I probably won't be purchasing the dumbbells again, especially since the price has gone from under $30 to $40...<br />Thanks<br />Marye

review/summary: This Weight Watcher's Favorite Snack!
review/text: As a self-proclaimed popcorn addict, I cannot imagine life without the delicious smell and satisfying crunch of popcorn.  Yet I am also a Weight Watcher and I don't want to squander tons of calories every day on buttery, fattening snacks.  These 100-calorie mini bags are perfect to satisfy my craving.  I eat a bag EVERY single night (usually while I catch up on all my recorded shows).  The built-in portion control ensures that I never overdo it on my favorite treat.  I eat it slowly and savor every piece.<br /><br />For some reason, I can never, ever find this product in stores.  Most will carry the Healthy Pop Butter in the big bags only, or sometimes the 100-calorie bags of Kettle Corn...but the 100-calorie bags of butter are few and far between.  When I find them in stores, I buy every box, but usually, I just order by the case from Amazon.<br /><br />This popcorn doesn't taste like "diet food".  Try it with a sprinkling of flavored popcorn seasoning, a drizzle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil, a pinch of shredded parmesean cheese, or chili powder and garlic powder.  The possibilities are endless!<br /><br />**Just don't forget that the smaller bag requires less cooking time than a big bag!**

After that I filled it, but with room to spare. To better understand, fill it and close it, if you can shake it and hear the coffee moving around, then you have it right. After doing it that way from the second time on, I have had one great cup after another! And yes, you do get the creamy foam! I have been using Starbucks Sumatra and it comes out tasting great! The only reason for not giving it 5 stars.....Because if you have a big mug, you have to fill both pods and run the machine twice. But that's just me.

review/summary: I don't understand the bad reviews....
review/text: Because these filters have been the best thing I have bought since getting the Senseo machine. Now I am not a terribly "green", crunchy sort of person but I did find the waste involved with the paper used for the individual use pods kind of disconcerting. Not only was there the waste of throwing away the pod after 1 use, there was the packaging for the pods themselves. And consider if you drank just one cup a day just what sort of waste that is producing. And the pods were not recyclable due to the coffee grounds, because even in my liberal, tree-hugging neck of the woods, food scrap recycling plans are still not very wide spread. And of course there is the money issue too. These filters have already paid for themselves, considering how many times I have used them vs. what it would have cost to buy as many coffee pods. I can buy a half a pound of ground coffee (even with the coffee costing more than 8 dollars a pound) and get more than a *month's* worth of cups of coffee vs. spending just as much on a bag of 16 pods that will only last me 2 weeks.<br /><br />The issues mentioned with the pods can be solved by two simple steps that a lot of people fail to do---read and then actually follow the directions. Make sure the pods are snapped firmly shut, clean off any loose coffee grounds, and do not pack the coffee down, and these filters will work wonderfully in your Senseo machine. I have not experienced leaks, weak or bad coffee, or any of the bad experiences others have mentioned.

review/summary: As advertised...
review/text: The product does what it advertises.  As other reviews note, it can be a little tricky to get the right amount of coffee in the device to get the coffee to taste just right.  You also need a fine grind, and be aware that it takes up the 2 cup slot to make a 1 cup serving.  As long as you know these things before you buy it, you won't be dissapointed with the product itself.

review/text: These reusable filters are great.<br /><br />Pros:Use your favorite brand of coffee(starbucks), easily mix your own flavors(french vanilla/columbian), less expensive than the disposable pods(in long run), easy to use(just fill them up), and great on environment(used coffee grounds make good compost).<br /><br />Cons:Can only use one pod at a time(trust me) and having to clean them(that is the reason I'm giving four stars).<br /><br />I bought these in 2008 for $20 they are still good. The key is to pack them up and use one pod per 4oz(I like my coffee a little bit stronger)

review/text: I have a Cafe Invento machine, not a Senseo.  After trimming 1/8 inch from around the edge, it fits perfectly and works like a charm.  The lid seems to close easier than the EcoPad, and the design of the filter allows for better flow-through and drainage.  I like the EcoPad, but this one just seems to work better.

review/text: Wanted something that is pretty much hassle free and I got it. I just put a regular teaspoon full if coffee grounds in the reuseable filter and away I go. I don't over pack the filter, there is a little breathing room. The only down side I see is when I am done using the filter. The cleaning... I usually set it aside to dry/drain... Then I empty the filter and let it air dry. Then after a bit I will take a dry napkin or paper towel to "brush" out the remaining grounds. I do see that if it is not rinsed out frequently it will start to clog and will take longer for the coffee to sift through the grounds.<br /><br />In short.... Don't over pack. Let dry before emptying. Empty, then let dry again before brushing out with paper towel or napkin. Wash and rinse throughly frequently.

I've determined some of the newer senseo models like this must be machined differently and (deliberately or not) the spring clip 'chews up' the melita pod, resulting in worse and worse performance. Check what model number you have!

review/text: Okay, so I've had this product for a week or more, and I gotta say... it's pretty darn good. I had just finished my last pack of Senseo pods, and this came in just at the nick of time (phew); so I couldn't wait to try this out with some grounds that I had.<br /><br />So, here was the con: the water would not run through the filter, and I ended up with water all over my counter. So, I, half-asleep start to freak and get this mess cleaned up. I try again, thinking maybe I didn't have the filter in correctly... low and behold, water all over the place again. ARGH!<br /><br />My daughter, who is not a coffee drinker, says to me (after laughing hysterically at my coffee catastrophe) that maybe the coffee is too big for the basket. Hmm, could that really be the case, could an 8y.o. really know more about this machine than I?!?!.<br /><br />So, I grind the grounds a bit more fine (using a food processor for a quick fix), and try again. Yes, I was crossing my fingers that I wouldn't be cleaning a mess again. And by golly, the machine worked just perfect. No issues, hiccups, or spills of any sort.<br /><br />Alright... so here is my two cents... these filters are good, and it will save my wallet in the long run. Just be sure that you are using finely ground coffee, as I don't wish a mess on anyone.<br /><br />~*~Cheers~*~

I had used the MyPods for the longest time but they were constantly leaking after making coffee and the fiters are too expensive in the longrun, so I thought I try out the Melitta Padfilter.

review/summary: Better than CoffeeDuck!
review/text: I got great results with this product.  I purchased it to replace my CoffeeDuck (which leaked at first if I put in too much coffee... then the seal broke, and it leaked worse than before.)<br /><br />The Padfilter is easy to use and hard to overfill.  I got good crema with both espresso ground and drip ground coffee (better with espresso).  Hard to get the coffee in without spilling everywhere, but I'm learning that is on me to figure out.<br /><br />It fits perfectly in my first generation Senseo; no leaks whenever I've used it.  I find it somewhat difficult to get the grounds out, but I have a disposal, so I just rinse it in that sink.  I imagine it will wear well too (even if the lid breaks off, it looks like it will still seal).  And I have another one anyway if it doesn't...

review/summary: Melitta Padfilter a total flop
review/text: If it sounds too good to be true, it's too good to be true.  Thought I was making a good investment in purchasing this item.  Turns out it is useless.  The filter prevents the coffee maker from completely sealing once it is placed in Senseo coffee maker, so once you clamp down lid and press botton to make coffee it leaks hot water all over the place, making a big mess.  Also, the rich foamy coffee you get with Senseo pods is nowhere to be seen.  I used Starbucks. It did not foam up and it was weak, weak,weak.  The podfilter was fully loaded with coffee. Even on the 1 cup setting the coffee was weak.  FOLKS YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM.  IT'S NO WONDER. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND KEEP BUYING THE SENSEO PODS IF YOU WANT A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE AND FORGET ABOUT BEING A CHEAPSKATE.  I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON THE HARD WAY.I'M OUT 30 BUCKS AND I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.  IF THERE WAS A TOTAL RIP OFF RATING AVAILABLE, THIS ITEM WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IT.

review/summary: A wonderful flavor to help diabetics make a good tasting treat or snack!
review/text: If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />We miss shakes and ice cream and this is a good flavor to use to make such a treat.  Peel and freeze a banana in 3 to 4 pieces in a zip lock bag.  Put it into a blender with 6 to 8 ounces of skim milk, a couple of tablespoons of vanilla or banana instant sugar free pudding, one to two table spoons of this flavoring and  � cup of crushed ice.  Blend this until smooth and you have a good tasting dietetic fruit smoothie that makes a good snack.  You can even freeze this and have a sort of banana ice cream treat. We also used to add in a vanilla protein mix that we would add into one of these to make a light meal.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!

I tried again, steeping it as you would a green tea, 175 degrees less than 1 minute. This was drinkable, but not good. The taste was very astringent, somewhat bitter. I actually got a sore throat from drinking it. I then tried blending small amounts of it with other teas. I tried 1/2 tsp silver yin with 2 tsp gyokuro, the green was completely overpowered by the white. Threw that batch out as well. Then I tried blending 1/2 tsp silver yin with 2 tsp monkey picked oolong. The result was okay, but then I went to the bathroom. My urine smelled like burnt plastic!?!?!?!? It was so bad that I actually searched the house to find the source of the chemical fire. It was the next time I went that I realized where the odor was coming from. I've never experienced anything like that before. Bottom line, I probably won't be purchasing ANY teavana products again.

I love Dunkin' Donuts Iced Coffee, and I also have tried to make my own, but it never tastes the same and I have tried many "home recipes" for iced coffee.  This Cold Brew coffee is amazing and simple.  The best part is that you can make it as strong or as weak as you want to by adding more or less water.  I just take it out of the fridge in the morning, pour the syrup into a tall glass, add cold water, creamer and iced cubes and I am in heaven!  I'll be buying this forever!  And .... it does NOT upset my stomach due to too much acidity.  PERFECT !!  Thank you Cool Brew !!!

review/summary: 5 lbs of olives with no brine or storage
review/text: OK, the description is accurate but I expected some brine.  The olives (and other ingredients) are shipped without any brine which makes long-term storage a challenge.  I had to make my own brine since if you leave the olives without any brine they get even mushier and spoil.  I re-packaged them in a plastic container and made a brine of sea salt and water (which is a standard olive brine) and they are storing well after 6 months.  Yes, I made them even saltier but at least they will last indefinately this way.  Make sure to use enough sea salt or they will spoil.  These olives are mushy and don't compare to quality store brands like California Olive Company.

review/text: We were preparing a dinner for 160 people of mixed faiths in our community (Jews, Muslims and Christians) and went with what we considered an appropriate Mediterranean theme common to all 3.  As a treat to add zest to an otherwise very low cost collection of foods on the buffet, we splurged and bought 2 bags of these olives, hoping that we'd interpreted the reviews correctly.  To our delight, the olives were extraordinary.  We couldn't believe our good fortune.<br /><br />However, we had had no idea how much 5 lbs would be in terms of volume.  To our chagrin, there were clearly not enough olives for generous servings for 160 people, even with two bags.  So... we extended them, by adding in an equal amount of a carefully drained mix of ordinary green and pitted black olives from the grocery store, stirring thoroughly and refrigerating it all for 24 hours, so that the heady aromas from these antipasto delights would spread to the more plebian ingredients we had added.  Guess what?  It worked!  So... for any of you who love these olives but can't afford them often enough to suit you -- try extending them the same way.  I think you'll be very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />For those of you who aren't worried by the price, forget about extending them, but don't miss these spectacular olives -- they're truly fabulous.  We didn't have much in the way of leftovers, but we were able to take home a cup or so after the event and have been rationing them for ourselves.  They're that good!  We will buy more for ourselves sometime and divide them into small packages for long term storage, just as many reviewers have suggested.<br /><br />P.S.  From this experience, we've concluded that 5 lbs. equals 40 generous servings, so, if money hadn't been an object, we'd have needed 4 bags for 160 people.  That makes it just a hair over $1 a serving, which we consider an extraordinarily good value, given how fabulous these olives really are.

review/text: These are delicious mixed olives that also contain caper berries, little peppers and garlic. Wonderful flavor; not spicy.  They are wonderful for salads, antipasto platters or just to eat right out of the bag. Only 'problem' is a five pound bag which has to be opened and then the olives transferred to a more suitable container for storing in the fridge.  Just a minor inconvenience!

review/summary: Contains artificial dyes; Ingredient description inaccurate
review/text: I searched high and low looking for gluten free, casein free, and dye-free sprinkles.  I thought I had finally hit the jackpot when I fell upon India Tree products and read the ingredient description here as of this review's writing.  Many India Tree products are indeed dye-free and good for those of us on the GFCF diet. I thought that these non-pareils would be the same high quality and natural ingredients as the rest of India Tree's decorating sugars.<br /><br />I was wrong.  Got the HUGE jar of sprinkles today (dented; thanks Amazon shipping) and the ingredients are as follows:<br />Sugar<br />Corn Starch<br />Confectioner's Glaze<br />FDC Yellow 5<br />Red 5<br />Blue 1<br />food grade carnauba wax<br />FDC Red 40<br />Yellow 6<br />and Blue 2<br /><br />I'm willing to pay a premium for good naturally colored sprinkles.  But when you're just the same as the sprinkles in the grocer's aisle, I don't know what's the point?  Next time, only buy India Tree's "natural" product line.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, please let me know.

review/summary: Good quality, affordable food.
review/text: It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)

I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery.

review/summary: Made my dog's coat shine
review/text: I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.

review/summary: Great value product that is full of protein
review/text: We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier.

review/text: I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.

review/summary: Seems to Be Good Food - Dogs Like It.  Does have an Odor While Other Premium Foods Do Not.
review/text: We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).

review/summary: Looks like good stuff!
review/text: The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.

review/text: Our source for this dog food went out of business. It was highly recommended by our dog trainer and wasn't out of line on cost. We couldn't find it anywhere and I jokingly asked my wife to check at Amazon. To our shock, you had it, at the same price and you had it delivered right to our front door, all at the same price.  Unreal.

review/summary: Quite pleased with my purchase of this food.
review/text: High Quality ingredients. Excellent deal I got on the price.My dog seems to LOVE it, which is extremely important to me because I love my dog!!!I probably would have given it 5 stars but it is rather pricey on a normal basis but kind of understandable with the great ingredients just hard for those on a budget to afford sometimes!Overall great deal.

review/summary: Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg
review/text: I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)

review/summary: My dogs eat it. Ingredients are better than anything at the grocery store.
review/text: I didn't plan on writing a review for this product. I mean, it's dog food. I don't eat it! But I read a review or two that complained about dogs getting gas after eating this. I have three dogs: 11.0 pounds, 33 pounds and 96 pounds. I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me). My bottom line: My dogs like it, my wife is satisfied with the ingredients, and the price isn't insane. I intend to buy it for awhile and see...

review/text: This dog food is the only thing that helped our dog with his dry skin.<br />We tried topical creams, antihistamines, etc.  With this dog food, he stopped itching and we dont have to apply any creams, give medicine or apply liquid omega oils on his food.  Will never change up from this brand.  Absolutely love it...so does our dog.

review/text: I researched all the medium priced good quality foods made of lamb and rice and this was the only product that actually had real lamb as the first product followed by lamb meal, then has rice, carrots, peas, eggs, etc.  Only nonfood items are the required minerals to balance diet and taurine and glucosmine.  More natural than the natural products.  Couldn't ask for more.  Plus comes in 35# bags not just small.  Definitelt recommend.

review/summary: Superb, top of the line dry dog food
review/text: I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.

review/summary: Only Brand I now Recommend
review/text: I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called "premium" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  "Lamb meal" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.
