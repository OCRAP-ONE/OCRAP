review/summary: These hold K-cups just like they're supposed to
review/text: I really love this product. I had to take some time to figure out where to put it that would be accessible. I've put it on top of my microwave and it fits there great. It holds the exact amount of k-cups that it says it would and I was actually glad that I picked the 54 cup pod drawer over the 36 cup pod drawer as I have a lot of k-cups to store. I even placed some of my extra k-cups on the top of this shelf until I can put them into the drawers.<br /><br />I noticed that someone had said they could fit extra k-cups into their drawer by alternating one up and one down. I found this annoying as I couldn't see what all the flavors of coffee were being stored in the drawer. I could only fit one extra k-cup per line in the drawer anyway so I didn't find this needed or unnecessary.<br /><br />So if I enjoy it so much, why knock it down by one star?<br /><br />I noticed that the drawer is bent just slightly. It's a sturdy drawer, but it's not as sturdy as it could be it seems, the wire bent in slightly more one one side than the other. It would be nice if it had been made out of slightly stronger metal that didn't bend as easily. Also, some of the drawers slide very smoothly while others pull out a little harder because the wire that they slide on is a bit bent as well.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product!  The construction of the item is durable and each drawer extends fully so you can view all of the coffee pods - no guessing what is stuck in the way back!  This item was exactly what i was looking for...  and is perfect for organizing.

review/text: The only drawback is that it's too deep to fit in a cabinet.  Luckily, it looks very nice sitting out on the counter.  It doesn't look cheap like a lot of others do.  The drawers are sturdy, and fully functional when completely filled.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law and brother and they love it!

review/summary: Nifty 54
review/text: Overall the Nifty 54 drawer is a nice solution for large capacity k-cup storage.  However there is one thing I dont like about it, but have learned to work around it.  When pulling the drawers open, the tops of the kcups catch the drawer above it and tip over, or drag.  Just have to pull it out slowly to avoid problem.  Ive added a picture in the gallery also.

review/summary: "Sturdy" comes to mind as the best description!
review/text: If asked to sum up this coffee-pod drawer in one word, "sturdy" would be my enthusiastic answer. It is one hefty piece of metal sliding-drawer perfection - it weighed in at 4 lbs. 11 oz. on my postal scale!<br /><br />The drawers slide in and out with barely a hitch. Large rubber feet on the bottom means it stays put on your counter. The drawers have stops on the bottom so you won't accidentally pull  them out completely. And best of all, 36 K-cups fit in perfectly, nestling cozily in 3 individual rows per drawer thanks to 2 divider bars in each.<br /><br />Seriously, you can't go wrong with this product if you have only a couple of boxes of K-cups you need to store. So much more attractive than boxes! I do plan to eventually paint mine with metal spray-paint to complement my kitchen's color scheme.

review/summary: Great, except bottom drawer
review/text: We are very happy with this purchase.  It looks nice, holds more K-cups than other containers of the same price, and arrived in perfect shape.  The only thing I dislike about the product is that the bottom two drawers are sometimes difficult to pull out.  Instead of gliding out, you have to sort of wiggle and shimmy them.  It's really not that big of a deal though.  It's a minor annoyance but, overall, the product is everything we hoped for.  We just store are least favorite flavors on the bottom (the most difficult to pull out).

I am a new Keurig user and this has greatly added to my enjoyment of the system. More organized than a basket, holds more than a carousel, and looks great too.

review/text: For those of you who have limited counter space, this pod drawer is ideal.  It is made of metal, so you don't have to worry about sagging plastic causing drawers to bind. There is just enough room for a coffee cup to sit upright in front of the Mini, but not upside down. The Mini fits perfectly within the boundaries of the top shelf. And if you load the drawers using the up/down technique, you can fit 21 pods per drawer instead of 18.

The one thing that is sometimes frustrating is when you have to pull a drawer out to get to a kpak in the back if you don't have the paks in there just right it gets hung up.  But overall it works great and takes up little space!

review/text: I read the review and I was hestitant as it was reported the drawer did not come out easy.  Well, it comes out easy.  I have room for plenty of choices in the drawer as my family likes hot chocolate and tea.  Personally I like coffee. The best thing is that it is a space saver.  I put the Kcup machine on it and I have plemnty of room for condiments.  With other storage syatems you place it next to the Kcup machine.  This takes a lot of spce.  Space is important in my cottage which is now my home.  I think this was a great buy for me.  It is funny how sometimes you buy something and it turns out to be a dud.  This is definitely worth the money.

review/text: These drawers look great in the office.  There is a little lip on the top of the drawer so they can stack or you can put more K-Cups.  Looks so much better than boxes!  Invert every other K-Cup and it will hold 63 K-Cups.  The drawers pull out smoothly & evenly (it might need a bit of wax after a while).  The drawers have a nice little stop to prevent the drawers from falling out accidentally (nice little plus that).  It is kind of long so it might not fit into some cabinets.  If you were wondering about this well, just get it.  We are thinking about getting another one.  Great product, accurate shipping, worth the money.  Thanks!

review/text: For those of us who place their full size Keurig coffeemaker on the counter under kitchen cabinets, this is the perfect solution for storing K-cups.  I started out with the single drawer, under-the-Keurig type of storage, but found that although it fit fine under the cabinet, I couldn't raise the front to remove and replace the K-cup, and adding water became tricky.  I found the 3 drawer side storage unit to be the perfect solution for this problem without having to move the Keurig to a counter space with no overhead cabinets.

review/text: I bought this based on other reviews. I am not disappointed. The drawers slide in & out very smoothly. It is larger than I thought it would be but it works just fine in my kitchen and on the top I had enough room to place two bowls, one with the Mini Moos & the second with my sweet n lows. The price is extremely good. I can honestly say you will not be disappointed in this product.

review/text: I ordered with the intention of keeping the drawer in the cupboard because my kitchen does not have a lot of counter space. However, the drawer is nice looking and I ended up sticking it out of the way in a corner on the counter. It will actually hold one more in each row (three rows per drawer) if you arrange the cups in one down/one up order.

review/summary: Great K Cup Holder
review/text: Very sturdy.  I think it is attractive too.  The picture is misleading and only shows the 36 cup holder, not the 54 cup--so I was hesitant to order it.  But each row holds 8 to 9 K cups (9 if you turn some upside down).  So each drawer holds 18 (or 21) x 3 drawers for 54 (or 63) total.  The day I got it, I ordered another one.  And yes, if you are wondering, THEY STACK very well.  Love it!  I think it is better than most of the racks and drawers I have seen. Drawers slide easily and pull all the way out, but don't fall out.  I will just leave it by the Keurig for guests to pick what they want.

review/summary: Fantastic space saver, great quality
review/text: Living in an apartment right now, counter space is significantly limited. The small counter my wife and I have our Keurig on does not have much space at all to spare. This did the trick perfectly. Likely the most sturdy, space-saving k-cup pod holder you're going to find - not to mention one of the most affordable out there. Great buy, great product, fantastic price! The medal "piping" and wire mesh are all sturdy and does not seem cheap or brittle in the least.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is completely insignificant and not worthy of deducing a star. At certain times the drawers tend to stick a little bit making me lightly shake the drawer a little bit in order for it to slide out. It's a completely minor thing; happens only occasionally, and definitely does not take away from the product itself, or its fantastic value!

review/text: This is a quality product and like the other reviewer stated you can easily fit 63 K-cups instad of the advertised 54.  You just alternate within the rows, one up, one down.  SO each row will take 7 K-cups, so each drawer will hold 21 K-cups...your total is 21 K-cups x 3 drawers= 63 YEAH!!!!<br /><br />For the price this is the best value for K-cup storage.  And the price on Amazon is the same as in store at Bed Bath'N'Beyond.<br /><br />Worth the price if you like organization, and not a bunch of K-cup boxes piled in your cupboards.

review/summary: The perfect drawer for my kitchen
review/text: The product arrived on time and was well packaged. It's a durable construction, there is enough space for the 54 cups it says it can hold and the product looks great next to my Keurig coffee maker.<br /><br />I ended up buying this design drawer as I think the carousels use up too much space for the number of pods they can hold, and after reading reviews for drawers to put underneath coffee makers I figured that with a drawer underneath my coffee maker there wouldn't be enough space left between the top of my coffee maker and the cupboard to be able to lift the top of the coffee maker open to put new cups in. If I would have had enough space, I would have probably bought the Nifty storage drawer to put underneath my coffee maker. Nevertheless I would recommend this product.

review/text: Before I bought this Niffty organizer, I read all the reviews available on it and on the single drawer organizers. It took me quite awhile to decide which type I preferred for the space I wanted to put it in. I even did some measurements. LOL When I got it it fit perfectly where I wanted it to!!! I really love it and have filled it and nearly emptied it already. The drawers on mine work smoothly and the individual rows in the drawers seem uniformly sized. I hadn't really thought about alternating them top to bottom to get 7 in each row until I re-read some of the newer reviews.  63 is the maximum capacity which is great.<br /><br />This is the first review I have ever written for a product that I have bought thru Amazon or any other online "store".

review/summary: Great K-Cup Holder
review/text: This was a great addition to my kitchen, next to my Mr. Coffee/Keurig machine.  It doesn't take up much space and makes retrieving my k-cups so much easier than digging around in the boxes.  Each drawer holds 3 rows of 6 kcups, however, if you alternate each one (right side up, then upside down), you can get an extra kcup in each row. This is great if you organize your kcups like I do, with one type of coffee in each row. If you just toss them in there haphazardly, turning some upside down isn't the greatest idea.  Great product!

It is all metal, welded construction with a nice paint job. It also has good neutral colored rubber feet so it shouldn't leave marks on counters or shelves. One thing I didn't see mentioned is that the drawers will not come all the way out. Great because your k cups don't end up all over the place, not so great for cleaning. Still think its great, especially when you consider the price. Definitely would recommend.

review/summary: My dog actually eats these instead of carrying them around.
review/text: Finally, a dog treat my dog loves and consumes - historically she just carries similar chews around and ultimately I find them in the yard (sometimes buried, sometimes just in a pile).  These sticks are more of treat for her than a typical long-lasting rawhide chew - which is fine with me.  My dog (a mini Aussie mix of about 48bls) gobbles a chew in a few minutes and seems quite satisfied with her "you just got home, where's my treat?" chew.  My dog's vet said these were fine in moderation - the dog is happy, the vet is content and I'm both :)<br /><br />UPDATE: July 22, 2012 - I purchased another pack of these a few months ago and my dog snubs them - the batch I received are much lighter in color, perhaps a recipe change?  Alas, I won't purchase again simply because I now have a bag of "things my dog like to carry around". Back to hunting for the next yummy chew.

review/text: My basenji, Lily, loves beef best, but chicken is a close second. Peanut butter is third choice.<br />This is a good deal, though the beef seems to last the longest.  She is a happy camper with these rawhide chews.

review/summary: Our dog loves these!
review/text: We have a 14-pound chiweener (chihuahua dachshund mix) who doesn't like most doggie snacks other than thin rawhide.  She loves these rawhide chicken sticks.  They are a perfect size for her.  They are softer than typical rawhide sticks; so, we alternate her snacks between these and her usual rawhide sticks.  I read some reviews of chicken sticks that they can smell, but we have not had a problem with these.  I divided them into batches of 10-20 sticks, kept one batch out, and put the rest in the freezer.  I thaw out a batch as we need them and keep the current batch in the fridge.  Great product, and shipping was as advertised.

review/summary: Not Bad For Mass Produced If You Do Not Care About Ingredients
review/text: I purchased these because I am a volunteer dog handler at our local shelter.  I wanted something in bulk and cheap to give to all the dogs that are trapped in a crate for most of their day.  They seem to like it.  However, the ingredients are not exactly ideal.  We have our Pits on a strict diet with no fillers (wheat,corn etc etc.) If you are considered about allergies or overall quality you might want to look elsewhere.

review/text: Is a little bit more costly then other dog foods but is worth it (personal opinion of course) . My doggies Tito and Cleo love this branch and especially the lamb one.

review/summary: Dog Loves
review/text: I bought this to let my dog try it out when we switched over to adult food.  It is extremely expensive, but when I fed my dog this food, I put it at the bottom of the bowl and put her old food over the top of it. She proceeded in digging through the old food to and only eating this food. She LOVES it. When we made the switch she had some really bad gas, but that only lasted 2 weeks and now everything is normal, and instead of waiting to eat her food, she pretty much eats it right when I put it in her bowl. I highly recommend this food. The only thing I wish is that the food pieces were bigger so she would have to chew it up. I was at the vet and he said that there prescription science diet is made with carrot fiber so as the dogs are chewing it up (big pieces that can't be swallowed hole) it is also cleaning their teeth... So We will see if her teeth get bad in the long run, I constantly give her small chunks of raw hide and teeth cleaning toys, so I am hoping that will also fend off bad teeth.  My dog loves this food. Highly Recommend!

review/summary: Charly loves it!
review/text: I have been making the food for my little Maltese since the pet food scares a few years ago.  I use Halo dry food for little treats for him and if I run out of the home-made and can't get a batch done before his next meal.  I trust Halo products, they're made of real food items, just like the food I make.  I tried the salmon first and Charly loved it, but I didn't like the smell of it much.  Once that was gone, I gave the chicken a try.  He loves that also and it doesn't have the same smell, so I like it better.

He has had a noticeable increase in energy, he is more responsive, he eats his food (has an appetite) and this food has none of the bad ingredients you are supposed to stay away from. You know how their stools get loose when you switch their food? That never even happened with this food!<br /><br />THANK YOU HALO!<br /><br />BY the way if you go to the HALO web site, you can sign up for their email list and they give you a $5 off coupon!

review/summary: My precious child (yorkie) REFUSED to eat for 2 months!!!!!
review/text: I have literally been frantic over "Celli" (nickname for Andrea Bocelli) not eating anything except treats..no nutritive value..for 2 months!!! I cooked grilled chicken breasts, beef cooked every way, even lean pork chops...no deal...It is very grueling to watch your only baby starving!!! I tried 32 flavors of dog food. He has always preferred dry food over canned food. So I was perusing the dog food offered by my "hero sight" Amazon,and something about Halo Spots Stew caught my attention. For days I went back and forth between flavors that my pooch would find appealing. Finally, I settled on the adult lamb recipe. After ordering I thought "Oh no, the kibble is going to be too large for his small mouth"( Am I neurotic, doting mother or what?) Anyone who thinks I am totally disgusting doesn't know what this situation is like!! I was prepared to chop the dog food in my food processor...BUT, the food arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and what a surprise!!! Upon opening the bag of food, to my pleasant surprise, the smell of the food was so good..so fresh.. and the kibble is so small!! Now for the happy ending...Celli ate every bit in his bowl as if to say "This is what I've been waiting for"...Mommy will rest tonight...Thanks Halo and Amazon...My love and gratitude to you!!!

review/summary: I found a WINNER!
review/text: Finally!-- a dry dogfood that my dog likes. I've tried many of the better quality dry dogfoods, but I usually give away at least half the bag to another dog owner. I've bought 3 different flavors of Halo Spot's Stew, and she likes all of them. And maybe it helps that the food is made in smaller pieces. I often mix the dry food with chopped meat or hard boiled egg, and sometimes wet dogfood. She eats everything instead of picking through it and leaving behind some of the dry food. Also, the size of the bag is easy to handle.

review/text: My little Cowboy is very happy with Spot's Stew.  It took us a while to find a food that worked for his "finicky" tummy but a friend suggested we give it a try.  Her dog, Mr. Quiggs gives it "two paws up."  Full of real food and the end result is easy to scoop - hey, that rhymes with poop!  Cowboy will pick out the peas (yes, there are real peas in there) and eat the rest of the food first - either he saves the best for last or he really doesn't like peas.  I'm guessing the latter.  It's a big plus that the food can be delivered to my door - thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Smells like real food!  But watch out for the peas if your dog has allergies
review/text: My dog loved this food, and he lost a few pounds without seeming to be ravenous all the time.  I'm so impressed with the high quality ingredients, but I'm still searching.  My dog's skin issues are much improved on this food but not completely resolved, and peas are unusually high on the ingredient list here, so I'm thinking that he may be allergic to peas as well as corn.  Would definitely buy again if I can rule out peas as a problem.

review/summary: 15 years of Shedding Stops!
review/text: My JRT used to shed terribly before I found this brand.<br />I have tried at least 20 different premium dog foods, supplements, & coat treatments throughout her 16 years.  No expense was too great.  Her coat always looked shiny and healthy, but no amount of brushing (I tried all types of grooming tools, even those wire things to strip a dogs undercoat) would  even slow down her shedding.  And, she is also a very picky eater, demanding a new brand after about a month.  All that shopped with HALO.<br /><br />--It was AMAZING!  After a few weeks her shedding was noticeably decreased!  Thinking it was a dream and I had finally gone off the deep end I pushed it out of my mind.  I didn't want to jinx it but I washed and vacuumed the car especially well, crossing my fingers that it wouldn't fill up with hair. Sure enough, by the time she finished her first 4 pound bag of Halo Stew she STOPPED shedding altogether! AND, she has been eating this brand for months and still loves it!  Another prayer answered!

I toasted one today and tried it for the first time.  I could barely get down one bite before the whole thing went in the trash.  They really are very bad.  I strongly recommend against them.  There are some other low carb bagels available on Amazon that are better.<br /><br />I also don't appreciate someone patently connected with the business coming in and giving a 5 star rating and "review" to her own product.

review/text: I changed my review of this product since I've tasted the rye bagel, which is quite good for a low carb bagel that does not raise my blood sugar.  However, I don't care for the taste of the cinnamon flavor which is much too sweet.  The plain bagel is just okay.  Of course it's not as tasty as a full carb bagel, but the rye flavor is pretty good and does not raise my blood sugar.

review/summary: What's in this bone?!!!
review/text: Our greyhound absolutely loves these bones! Even though it's designed to clean her teeth, I think she plans her day around the opportunity to chew on this luscious bone. She knows she gets the bone after she finishes her dinner. I think she would eat sawdust to get to this bone! Like the original Coke recipe, does it have Cocaine in it? Our dog is a loving, docile pet, but regularly growls if we try to take it away from her...we give her 1/3 of a bone after each dinner meal. Too much of this product seems to effect the stool negatively. If you want  your dog to place you on a pedestal, buy this product!

review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS BONE, IT WILL MAKE YOUR DOG SICK.
review/text: I bought this bone for our 8 month old schnoodle. He loved it, and ate all of the inside 'meat' within two days. True, he shouldn't have been left to eat it so quickly but he also shouldn't have gotten sick. The day after he started eating this bone, he developed diarrhea with some blood for a couple of days. After a week, he is still having loose stool and yesterday he vomited twice. Otherwise, he has been eating his food and drinking water as usual and is playing like he always does so we have been trying to wait for his system to clear up on its own. Another couple of days of these symptoms and we'll be taking him to the vet. Btw, I did a google search on the Dingo brand for any cases of puppies/dogs getting sick and I found multiple hits where people were talking about their dog having the same reaction as ours did. I also found out that there was a recall on another type of Dingo treat 1 year ago. Please look for another brand of bones for your pet, better to be safe then sorry.
