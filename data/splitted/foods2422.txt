review/summary: Good enough, but
review/text: I thought it would be strange to put a berry flavor in coffee, and it turns out they didn't.  Like most flavors, its all in the fragrance, no difference in taste.<br /><br />It's a bit weaker than most of the other flavors, but still good.

review/summary: Blueberry flavored coffee?  Weird sounding, but one of the best K-Cup flavors I've found...
review/text: I must admit, like many others, that this sounds a little weird.  However, after trying this coffee months ago, it is one of the few K-Cup coffees that I will pay the premium price for.  Of course it brews like any other K-Cup, but the added aroma from the blueberries that it adds to the room is incredible.  In fact, they should make an air freshener out of this, but that's another category.<br /><br />The coffee has a good balance to it, and the added blueberry flavor is not just right.  I use a vanilla creamer and sweetener with my coffee, which may enhance the flavor, so I can't attenst to what this would be like if you drink your coffee black.  I also tend to make two 8 ounce cups from one K-Cup, brewing both into a small pot, and then dividing the coffee into separate cups, which makes for a good strength from this coffee.  I like a medium roast normally, and this holds up to that.<br /><br />Although you're not going to get a full serving of fruit with this coffee, you will wake up a little faster when you smell this coffee in the mornings.  I like many flavored coffees, but find a few that I don't like, but this is one that seems to appeal to most when they smell the blueberries.  My recommendation, give it a try...

review/summary: Wild Blueberry Coffee
review/text: I have been wanting to try this flavor since I first got my Keurig coffee machine.<br />I wasn't disappointed.  It smells like blueberries and you can really taste the blueberries in the coffee.  It's a very natural good flavor, not sweet or artificial at all.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this brand of Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry coffee!<br />Angie

review/summary: Wow is this good!!
review/text: I have been wanting to try this for a while but have put it off thinking that it might have an artificial taste or that the blueberry is just a little weird with coffee.  But WOW was I wrong.<br /><br />This coffee is absolutely delicious!!  I love it with a splash of vanilla coffee-mate in it.  It has a sweetness to it, with a hint of blueberry with a really perfect blend of coffee that isn't too strong or too weak.  It's just right!  Kind of reminds me of a blueberry muffin or blueberry waffle or something - but without it having an over powerful blueberry taste.<br /><br />With the fall weather it has been an excellent morning choice, along with the perfectly pumpkin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OHGP72">Timothy's World Coffee Perfectly Pumpkin, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> which also very tasty!

review/summary: Different, and GREAT, Coffee
review/text: I'm a big fan of Green Mountain coffee, and the blueberry flavor has been one of my favorites for a while. These K-cups have the same great taste that I know and love from the fresh ground version.<br /><br />The blueberry flavor is in no way dominating. It gives on a great sweet aroma and has an excellent coffee flavor with a hint of blueberry aftertaste. If you're unsure about the flavor, I would suggest trying it at a coffee shop or cafe before buying the entire K-cup pack, but if you're up for trying something different (or you know you love the flavor), this is a great buy.

review/summary: Blueberry coffee?? Oh, yes ma'am!!
review/text: Echoing several other reviewers here - we were so skeptical about trying Wild Mountain Blueberry coffee and now that we've run out, both my husband and I miss it.  It was such a pleasant surprise, as we generally don't drink that much flavored coffee. As the coffee is brewing, it gives off a strong blueberry scent, and the taste of the coffee doesn't disappoint. My husband usually takes a bold roast in the morning for his first cup of coffee. He liked having a cup of blueberry as his second cup, kind of like "dessert." I had a couple cups a week. I agree with another reviewer who said its possible to have too much of a good thing. For that reason, I will wait a little while before getting our next box but not too long.

review/summary: Great tasting soup, easy open package
review/text: I use very, VERY few processed, pre-packaged foods, but this soup is one I do use regularly.  As a vegan, I'm used to having to bring my lunch to work all the time.  What I love about McDougall's soup is that I don't need any tools (can opener, scissors) to open the box of soup.  Its top is designed to be scored, and then tear off and it works perfectly.<br /><br />You then have a sturdy, leak proof box from which to pour the soup out into your bowl.  The design is superb ... I consistently can open the box and pour it into a bowl without any difficulty and with no spills.<br /><br />Of course the packaging's design would be unimportant if the soup did not taste good ... the flavor is excellent!!  Lots of flavor AND very filling.  You aren't stuck with a tiny 4 or 6 ounce "bowl" of soup .... each box provides a LARGE bowl of soup.  I'm a very hearty eater, and am more than filled and satisfied with a bowl for lunch.

review/text: I've had a subscribe and save subscription for this product for several months now as it is expensive to purchase at my local grocery store. As a vegan, I enjoy being able to purchase vegan easy to cook/ready made vegan products.<br /><br />PROS: Out of all of the Dr. McDougall's soups, I find that the Black Bean Soup is the most tasty and filling of the bunch. At about 120 calories a serving (there are 2 servings in one package), it makes a great main course meal - I often find that adding a serving of carrots + pepper adds to the taste and vigor of this soup! As an added bonus, the packaging for this product is easy to open (requires no can opener or scissors)and mess free.<br /><br />CONS: Despite the savings over Amazon, the price for this soup is still rather high! (but this is expected as the soup is targeted towards a niche audience as is)

review/summary: Would be 3 stars of not so salty and watery.
review/text: I just got this, one of the Nile Spice black bean soups (dry mix), and the Lime Dr. McDougall dry mix. This one is the saltiest of all, is quite watery (and as it is not a dry mix, there is no way to make it less watery). Of the three, this is the worst. The Lime black bean one from this same company has the salt separate in a 'flavor packet' and is a dry mix. You can avoid the salt by not using the full packet, and you can use less water to make it less watery. This has far far more salt that either of the others, and you are mostly buying water. I do not recommend this variety at all. If you want one, try one of the same company that has the flavor packet and is a dry mix. Summary: You are buying a lot of salty water and not much nutrition.

(disclaimer: my kids have never been allergic to milk or eggs and I started them on it pretty early, you might wanna add formula)

review/summary: Great source of protein and my son LOVES it!
review/text: My son loves this "soup".  The consistency of the soup is basically the same as thick, smooth baby food (it just doesn't have any chunky bits of food in it as most Stage 3 baby foods do, which qualifies it as a "soup" apparently). When my son was 8 months old, he had a hard time adjusting to chunky foods (gagging and choking, etc.), but I needed to buy him some protein-rich baby foods, as we were weaning.<br /><br />I was also buying the Sweet Potato and Chicken meal (stage 2), but I really wanted the larger serving that this jar offered. Upon comparing the nutritional content on the two jars, I discovered that this soup has as much protein per serving as the actual meal labeled as Sweet Potato and Chicken - perfect!<br /><br />I was slightly concerned that the "cinnamon" might cause him gas issues or digestive discomfort (it does me sometimes and he is a spitter-upper), but he has no problems whatsoever. And he LOVES the taste. He will eat a whole jar in no time flat (at room temperature, me spooning it in).<br /><br />My son is now almost 14 months old. He is in the 95% for height and 55% for weight. He has never really adjusted to chunky baby food, which I can't explain, as he now eats finger foods, bananas, berries, pb&j, mac and cheese, chicken, etc. just fine self-feeding. But I still use these Earth's Best Soups pretty much daily to supplement his dinner, to make sure he keeps his weight up to how fast he is growing.  He eats on his own for awhile and then I feed him a jar of soup. He still loves them and it is great having an easy source of protein on hand.

review/summary: Chocolate heaven
review/text: Well well, here's another matcha that took my tastebuds by surprise. I ordered the Belgium Chocolate matcha expecting, well, I didn't know what to expect! Haha.<br />I've never had a chocolate flavoured green tea before, but for some reason I didn't even blink or flinch at the thought of a chocolate matcha. It must be the faith in flavour that Red Leaf has instilled in me - if cotton candy works, why not chocolate, right?<br /><br />There were a few more reasons I sprung for the chocolate - I had also ordered the strawberry and knew they would make an amazing pair! (Chocolate covered strawberry matcha, how sexy!), but I also have caramel and cheesecake matchas which it would also blend well with! Let's not forget a chocolate covered banana iced latte (might add a little bit of english toffee in there as well for a Skor effect!)<br /><br />What can I say? I feel like a matcha mad scientist. I've got a blending itch that I have to scratch!<br />What took me by surprise was just how chocolaty the smell and flavour was! The cocoa powder used in the blend must be of quality, because it is leagues better than the no-name powder in my cupboard. It's silky and rich and has the quality of drinking chocolate. When I'm drinking it straight, I'm tempted to throw in a dash of cinnamon and cayenne for a Mexican hot chocolate flavour. Or maybe experiment on the savoury side with a matcha mole sauce - I would definitely be feeling like a mad scientist with that one, but hey why not! If the Food Network did something like that no one would bat an eye ;)<br /><br />So far my favourite way to enjoy this matcha is as a hot latte with all the fixings! I whisk up 1.5 teaspoons of matcha with just enough water (175 F) to make a paste. I then add about a half of cup of water (same temp) and sweetener (white sugar for me) and whisk some more to dissolve the sugar. A simple syrup would also work! Now I heat up � cup milk and cream (half and half) in the microwave and froth it up with my milk frother. Add the half and half to your matcha, top with whipped cream and chocolate shavings! This treat is oh so comforting, and could even be recreated with soy/almond milk or 1% for a light but indulgent treat!<br /><br />Before this matcha I hadn't found a flavoured tea of ANY kind that was a "replacement" for treats. Yes, I am in love with the cheesecake matcha - but it doesn't replace my cravings for a big fatty piece of creamy thick cheesecake. Nor does a chocolate cake tea turn me away from the frozen McCains delight sitting in my freezer. This tea, however, DOES cure my craving for chocolate and hot chocolate! Sometimes I get a real hankering for a package of powdered hot "chocolate" - but I don't even consider this a "substitute" - it's the real thing!

review/summary: Renew my faith in Matcha
review/text: I should mention that my first experience with matcha was not a positive one. We had bought a pouch of matcha from a tea store that shall not be named, and my fiance spent some time looking around on the internet figuring out exactly how much matcha to use for a cup of tea. Needless to say, it didn't go terribly well. I took one sip, looked at her, and said "Are you serious, you actually want to drink this?". Except it also involved swearing.<br /><br />I put my interest in matcha on a back burner at that point. Maybe it was something a future, more refined me would enjoy, but definitely not today.<br /><br />Then, Red Leaf Tea started showing up and making a huge effort to bring in new customers from Steepster. Reviews started popping up about their fantastic matcha, and the awesome flavors that they have. When the Belgium Chocolate Matcha went on sale, I knew it was time to give matcha another try. I figured, if I can't enjoy half-priced, chocolate flavored matcha from what appears to be the best matcha vendor around, there was probably no hope.<br /><br />For preparing this, my fiance used her battery-powered frother, as opposed to the traditional matcha tools. It may be bucking convention, but it really seems to create a nice, smooth evenly distributed cup of matcha. This resulted in a smooth, but murky jade green drink, which is significantly darker than the matcha-that-shall-not-be-named. This makes it obvious that there is true cocoa powder in here, as opposed to just a flavoring (unless there was a flavoring and a coloring, then all bets are off).<br /><br />It definitely smells very chocolatey, very sweet without any sugar added. It reminds me of a chocolate cake batter, or possibly muffin batter. There's the chocolately sweetness to it, but the hint of background... well, I suppose it's the smell of the matcha itself. Anyway, the matcha smell in the background elevates it a little bit to a baked-good smell, at least for me.<br /><br />The taste is very smooth. At first, it has a warm hot cocoa flavor to it, absolutely delicious. It is inviting, and comforting, with a subtle sweetness on your tongue (much more subtle in taste than in smell). To me, the first drink was overwhelmingly cocoa flavored, with no vegetal taste to betray the matcha lurking below. Each successive drink makes that matcha flavor come out a little bit more. There is a strangely beneficial aspect to this, and that is that the matcha flavor itself slowly builds on you. It's very crisp and clean, lightly foresty but without that swampy, seaweed taste that some green tea comes with.<br /><br />As you get to the end of the drink, there is some matcha that has settled towards the bottom. This is likely because I'm a little bit of a slow drinker, sensitive to hot liquids and such. Or, we really have no clue what we're doing. Always a possibility.<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this matcha, especially if you're new to the world of matcha. It has renewed my faith in matcha as a viable beverage choice.<br /><br />You can also get this from Red Leaf Tea's website, with a staggering number of different options.

review/text: I was excited to try this tea as I love both matcha green tea and chocolate.  I do not like this product.  I usually order my matcha from Matcha Source out of LA and I guess I have been spoiled because the quality of this green tea seems low and combined with the "chocolate" flavor is undrinkable to me.  I will be using the rest of the bag in smoothies and hope it will drown out this awful taste.

review/summary: Matcha + Cocoa = Heaven
review/text: If you've ever had drinking chocolate, you know it can be a bit much to handle. Drinking this tea is like having matcha combined with drinking chocolate. It has cocoa powder added, so it has that bittersweet chocolate flavor without the additional sweetening and flavor ruining of your usual hot chocolate. Oh, and of course, it's matcha, so it's far better for you. The only complaint? Well of course, it's not extremely chocolatey but sadly I think I am always going to be stuck in the camp of things never having enough chocolate. Still, it's delicious.

They can be expensive in the pet stores so I was so glad to find them a bit cheaper on Amazon.  Our last puppy chewed on everything no matter how many toys we provided.  We have leather couches and wooden endtables and I was worried about the new puppy tearing them up.  He chews on these Flossies faithfully and has not touched the furniture or anything else (except for one unfortunate bath rug)and they keep him occupied.

review/text: I swear by Harrison's bird foods, including this birdie bread. Add a banana mashed up to the mix and your birdies will LOVE this bread. You will also see a huge difference in their feather quality and their colors will become more vibrant after a few months of using Harrison's. Their health will improve drastically too. I have fed my birds on Harrison's since they were babies. When mixing this birdie bread, I use the SUNSHINE FACTOR (palm oil) instead of regular oil. Try Harrison's other foods and treats. You won't regret it. Yes, it is more expensive, but well worth the money if you care about the health of your pet bird or parrot.

review/text: My quaker is a big fan of this bread. He goes for this before he goes for seed ball treats or fruit even. Plus, since switching him to Harrison's fine food, his feather plucking has greatly diminished. Hopefully the bread will continue work as a good "treat" and also help keep his system balanced like the regular Harrison food.<br /><br />Additionally, the package was easy to follow and the bread was super easy/quick to whip up. Only 3 additional ingredients were needed (veggie oil, water, 2 eggs. I just wish the package made a little more than one loaf (using a loaf cake pan, the bread only rose about half the way up to the top of the pan) since I'm planning on freezing it anyway.<br /><br />All in all, a great product!

review/summary: Greenies Allergy Formula Pill Pockets for Dogs
review/text: I love this product. I have to give my dog medicine on a daily basis and he takes them like treats using pill pockets. I normally buy the capsule (as opposed to tablet) size and just pull off as much as I need to cover the size pill Dexter has to take. This makes the product last longer. Dexter thinks they're a treat and just gobbles it down medicine and all.<br /><br />The one draw back for me is the smell of the Allergy formula pockets - it's pretty bad! I've used the beef flavor in the past and don't remember the smell being so bad. I had to stop using the beef formulas because after finally reading the ingredients I found it had chicken broth/stock in it and my dog is allergic to chicken. Not sure why they put chicken of any kind in a beef version but I've found this in many beef products.

review/summary: My dog can still taste the pills, and spits them out
review/text: My dog had been taking pills without issue for several months.  Due to a recent surgery, her daily pill count has gone up dramatically, and it has become increasingly difficult to get her to take them. I have heard many people saying how wonderfully these pill pockets work, so I finally decided to give them a try.  First, I think they are ridiculously expensive (although reasonable at Amazon, these cost almost 30% more at my local pet store, where I unfortunately bought them).  Second, if the pills taste bad (particularly if they are tablets that are cut in half to lower the dosage), it is likely that your dogs will still spit them out if they are anything like mine.  I was hoping for the magic solution to pill taking, but this is not it.

It is bitter, not only to the taste but she could  smell it in everything I tried. Braunswager (sp) Vienna Sausage, everything.  I wrap it well in the Greenie Pill Pocket and she eats it right up. I ordered two packages and both contents were in perfect shape.  No crumbs, no pieces, none smashed as I have read in other reviews.  Since the stores that carry these are not in my immediate shopping area, I find it's easier to order from Amazon along with other items I need. I will order again and I have already recommended to a friend and neighbor.

review/summary: Best thing ever!
review/text: My dog suffers from an auto immune disorder which causes him to have to take a lot of meds. He also is on a novel protein diet and can't have many "normal" dog treats or food. After trying a million ways to get those pills in him I found these in the reduced allergen flavor. Yes, they stink horribly. But suddenly meal time is a treat and I couldn't be happier! Just wish more came in a bag and they were cheaper.

review/summary: Wish I'd found these sooner!
review/text: I'd always heard of Pill Pockets and thought they were just stupid. Why pay a lot for treats with a hole in them when you can just wrap some cheese around the pill? Until my dog got so sick she refused to eat anything at all. The vet gave me some of these to try, and she would eat them and the pills inside right away, when she refused to eat anything else.<br /><br />I've also discovered they make great training treats, because you can break off small pieces without dropping crumbs everywhere. I've always had problems with treats that leave crumbs because my dogs spend more time hunting for crumbs than listening to me. Wish I'd started using these years ago!

review/summary: This is a great size for savings!
review/text: I have used well over a dozen of the beef flavored 3.2 oz, tablet size. The Amazon.com Prime supply ran out of the 3.2 size, so I thought I'd go ahead and try these. One of my dog's daily liver supplements are rather large. Still, it fits in a half of one of this size. Just 1/4 will cover his smaller daily meds. I use a knife to cut them, but it's hardly necessary. The pill pockets easily mold around any shape.<br /><br />Even though the prices vary, it's still just a few cents more for this size. Twice as much, for a few pennies! Makes the pill pockets way more affordable for me.<br /><br />My 14 year old dog still takes them, even when he's not feeling very well. Makes pill taking a treat, rather than an upsetting battle.

review/summary: Kinda Dry & Rubbery
review/text: I was hoping this would be as good as the beef & chicken pill pockets but these were dry and rubbery.  I had a hard time getting the pocket to stay wrapped around the pill.  AND it really smells - not too good - although my dog doesn't seem to be turned off by that. (Of course with most dogs - the smellier the better....)  She does appear to like the taste - just wish it wasn't as rubbery as these seem to be.  Maybe it's because of it being `Allergy Formula' and doesn't contain the stuff that keeps it from being dry?  The number of ingredients is a lot less than the beef pockets....

review/text: Greenies Pill Pockets are the only way to give my dog his meds.  In one pill pocket we can get the two capsules, powder supplement and a large chewable tablet that he gets in the morning.  He has never spit it out or not taken it.  We use two bags a month so we needed a cheaper source than the local retail stores, we looked on-line and Amazon has the best price. I can buy a six month supply and it doesn't break the bank.  Good product, great price and super quick delivery.

review/text: I picked up a bag of these locally (not on Amazon) for my bf's treat-driven English Setter.  He needed to take pills for a few weeks to clear up a skin condition, but half the time he would spit the pill out.  First time trying the pill pockets and he gobbled it right down.  Never had a problem giving the pills again.  I guess for a dog who is picky about treats it might not work, but for ours it was a perfect solution.  He thought he was getting a delicious treat.

review/summary: No More Hassles
review/text: These make giving your pet medicine as easy as giving them a treat. Most people don't know these can also be used with liquids. My older dog has always been good at taking pills anytime we want her to, but now her medicine is in drop form.  She needs to take 10 drops twice a day.  It is very hard to know if she is really getting what she is intended without the Pill Pockets. Just put the drops in the pocket and pinch it shut. If you are using the Pill Pockets for pills and have a pet that knows all the tricks try this. Put the pill in the pill pocket with one hand and close the pocket with the other. Never touch the pocket with the hand that touched the pills, your pet can tell. Take another pocket or two with nothing in it break it into a couple of pieces and give it to your pet as a treat. Try this treat, treat with pill, and treat again.

review/text: This product is so good that I had to review it.  Summertime means skin problems for my Schnauzers here in South Florida. I do not like choking pills down the dogs, and they don't like it either! Now, everybody is happy.  I also checked this product at Petco and Petsmart-much higher, almost double.  One piece of advice is the beef is a little better on the hands and doesn't feel quite so slimy.  I prefer the beef.  My youngest Schnauzer did figure out the pill part, but that was easy to deal with. Just act like you are going to give another, and they wolf it down. lol

review/summary: Finally...
review/text: I have to admit, I was skeptical of these to begin with.  Our dog is a master of avoiding medication.  We've tried shoving pills down her throat, we've tried squirting liquid medication into her mouth, we've tried hiding pills in her food, we've even tried grinding tablets or opening caplets and mixing the powder with her food.  She's always able to avoid it.  Even when we mix it with her food, she'll refuse to eat for days.<br /><br />These things actually work though.  I highly recommend the smaller size, because the larger size requires a bit of chewing, and so our dog was able to remove one of the pills once.  Even 29/30 is pretty good.  The small ones are perfect though - 60/60 and counting.  Even if the pill is slightly too big, you can just mold the treat around it so it can't be immediately detected.<br /><br />I wish I had found these years ago...

review/summary: Pill Pockets Help Reluctant Pill Takers
review/text: We first encountered these at a vet's office and tried them, but recently I have been buying via Amazon for convenience and price. The capsule ones help get various pills, including fish oil, into our two dogs. They gobble them down. They are very soft and can be reformed around whatever pill(s) you are giving. I did try the chicken and couldn't stand the smell of them myself, although the dogs were happy with either kind. These are a tiny bit greasy, so I always put a napkin down on the counter before inserting pills, and the smell will persist until you wash your hands (or you will continue to be pestered by yours dogs! This has been a great solution to get most pills down without the dog spitting them out.

review/summary: Pill pockets, what a great idea!
review/text: This is the best thing ever for giving meds in pill form to a pet.  Each little "pocket" is the consistency of a soft brownie.  So they are easy to mold around even a large pill.  I have 2 dogs and both take meds with these, no picking them apart, they just swallow them whole!  Both of my dogs are small (20#) so I usually don't even use a whole pocket for their meds, I break one in half and it's plenty to cover the pill.  Great solution and really makes things so much easier when pets are sick and not even wanting to eat.  I will always keep these on hand now.

review/text: The dog absolutely loves these! She gets anti-anxiety meds every morning and she will come running with tail wagging when she hears me open the pill bottle. Can you believe that? I don't even need to use the whole treat. I rip off about a third and they are soft so I mold it around the capsule. I then make her work for it by giving a few commands "sit, stay, come, etc" and she does them excitedly. After she gets her treat, she is so excited that she does a lap around the apartment. Overall, these pill pockets are a winner and I will use them as long as she keeps getting pills!

review/text: My little dog is a Japanese Chin. Giving him medicine requires more effort than the building of the Pyramids and years of combat training. Enter the Pill Pocket. These little gems are amazing. If you're dog can smell a pill from a mile away, try these. Sometimes in his morning dose, I have to dip it in gravy (which I buy at KFC every couple weeks and keep in the fridge), but that's the most additional effort I've had to exert since we started with these. Get them, use them, enjoy them. Warning, they're pretty stinky, IMO, so don't spend too much time sniffing them.

review/text: I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills - we would hide them in wet dog food, only to find the food eaten and the pills spit out. We hid them in salami, raw meat, pastrami, turkey, soft cheese, hard boiled egg, anything that you could think of that is appetizing to a dog and he would eat the food and spit out the pills. It got so bad that he actually stopped eating and drinking. He was so sick. Our vet put him on IV fluids and steroids and antibiotics and these wreaked havoc on his liver. We were so worried. He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down. He actually got to the point that when the 6 hour time was coming around to "get the treat" he would start whining and staring at the refrigerator where I had prepared the whole dosage plan ahead of time and put them into a plastic box with big lettering, "THIS IS ALEX'S MEDICINE - NOT CHOCOLATE!" We had a close call with my little sister - they looked appetizing to her as well! :) Now I use these for his vitamins and for anything that he has to take that is not appetizing. Really a life saver! I now buy Greenies Pill Pockets in bulk - by the 6 pack.

review/summary: Love Them!!!! and so does the my dog!
review/text: This past winter was so cold my fury friend and I didn't venture out much. Then along came Spring, and it rained, and it rained, and it rained.  Again, not out much. In April I noticed she was starting to lose hair on her back end, backside of her legs, and her back sides. :-( After a trip to the vet, I was told she would need about 6mg of Melatonin twice a day till her hair fully returned. Turns out it was happening to a lot of Boxers this year in our area due to the lack of sunlight exposure (cold winter/rainy spring). Well, giving her a heart worm pill every month is tragic in and of itself....we both hate it. So the thought of trying to shove pills down her throat twice a day, EVERY DAY, was not appealing. Then I stumbled across these pill pouches! I can't sing their praises loud enough!!!!!! Made giving her the meds each day like giving her a treat, and that's what she thought too.  We also now give her the heart worm meds in these! Our lives are much less stressful with the help of this wonderful item!  And in case you are wondering.....yes, her hair returned! We now take the supplement once a day just to be sure all is well. She still loves the taste and waits for it each morning! Now, if we could only invent something that would make trimming her toenails less of a wrestling match!

review/summary: Big help
review/text: I have 2 older dogs that are both on meds.  Pill pockets are the only way I can get them to take their pills without a fight  No more chasing them, and forcing their mouths open to push the pill down their throats!!  Now I just hand them their pill pockets and the are happy - and so am I!

review/summary: Totally Worth the money!!!
review/text: I have a english bull terrier with ALOT of skin problems so he takes medication and vitamins 2x per day and some of them are quite big and the zinc pills apparently taste extra bad so he has become very difficult to give pills and actually hides with he hears the bottles being opened and when you get him you have to pry his very large jaw open and hold it closed until he swallows because he'll spit it out. With pill pockets I even combine a few together and he LOVES it... he will even do his tricks to take his meds now and I'm not sure he even chews ha.. Its a little expensive but combining the pills together makes it last longer and it saves time and my fingers!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: The pill pockets are great for dogs who will not take pills!  Otherwise I'd just use cheese, peanut butter or hot dog pieces.  Unfortunately one of my dogs is too smart for any of those.  It's a little pricey but worth it.

review/summary: My dog loves them
review/text: This is my dogs favorite treat.  Little does he know that there is medicine hidden in them.  Whenever I start putting the pill in the "pocket", he gets really excited.  Alot more so than his other treats.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: These are AMAZING!  I have a very slippery and sneaky cat who needed medication before a trip.  I stuck the little tablet inside the snack, put two down on the floor, and she ate them both.  No stress, no drama, no cleaning up medicine from the floor.  I will be keeping these on hand, and recommending them to everyone I know.  If your kitty is hard to medicate, you should definitely try these.

review/summary: Great Product to Hide Pills for Doggies
review/text: Just like kids, my dogs hate taking pills when they are sick.  Thanks to Greenies for creating this product, I can easily hide their pills and they are willing to take it with no fuss or force.  It smells like their treats.
