review/summary: Pricey Stuff and Hardens up Real Fast!
review/text: I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.  The other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl. If he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and I had to literally scrape it out of his bowl.

review/summary: Tasty topper my dog loves!!!!!
review/text: I just got my 1yr old shihtzu the turkey and she loves it. I mix it with her dry food. It does have a gel substance around the food. I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: Consistently in the top ten recommended canned dog foods
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and other healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

review/text: After reviewing the lamb product that is labeled the same way it is worth noting that this food is very good as well.  Not quite as attractive as the lamb, but still rated high on her taste test scale.  It provides a way to give some variety without upsetting her system.  Most of the Wellness canned foods are remarkable in that respect.

I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.

review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

review/summary: Good Choice
review/text: I just wanted to supplement the dry food that I feed my two schnauzers. I tried several other brands and even other canned food by this same brand. My dogs did not do well on any of them until I tried this one. They love it and it does not cause stomach upset or potty problems. I highly recommend this product for extra protein, esspecialy if your dog has a delicate system.

review/summary: Good but Beware!
review/text: This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.

review/summary: Great Tasting Drink, But The Refined Carbs Are Too High
review/text: I like this drink because it is an alternative to soda and so-called fruit drinks (some of which actually have very little or no fruit in them.)  It is entirely made with fruit juice and has a slight carbonation that is pleasant.  The drink is not overly sweet, which distinguishes it from many other drinks that are loaded with sugar, or worse, with high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />However, while Izze's formulation makes it somewhat more healthy than other drinks, I have to agree with those who make the important point that fructose, like sucrose, metabolizes in the body as high glycemic carbohydrates that may be problematic for diabetics and insulin-resistant people.<br /><br />If Izze could offer the alternative of diet drinks made entirely with sucralose, I would buy them without hesitation.

review/summary: delicious, inconsistent and spendy
review/text: i am a fan of izze beverages. i will occasionally pony up the $1.50 to $2.50 that a 12oz bottle costs in my area. but i am poor and that is rare. so, when i got a rather good discount offer from amazon for the 8oz cans of the "fortified" izze's, i bought three cases. one each of pomegranate, clementine and blackberry. my signifigant other thought perhaps that i had lost my mind when case after case of "soda" began to arrive at her office. first, 8oz seems to be about the right amount. i'm a glutton and really i need the help with portion control. so, serving a beverage in a container that is actually 1 serving is nice. seems almost responsible. likely it's also a money making move for the manufacturer but that's fine- long live capitalism. second, it's a damn chic little can. this probably matters to no one who matters but it's an observation: the packaging is nice. third, i'm finding the 8oz cans to be sweeter than the 12oz bottles. this might be that i've had far more experience now with the 8oz can. perhaps my exposure to the bottles is infrequent enough and such a treat that i am overwhelmed, like a whelp with bargain chocolate, with the treat and don't notice the sweetness overload. it could also be that they are sweeter. finally, or 'fourth' if you're counting, i'm finding the cans to be inconsistent. some seem far sweeter than others. some just right. in the end: izze fortified naturally flavored juice beverages are delicious. and i will contiue to enjoy them. and i will buy more when my three cases run out. though i will seek out deals as they are spendy (8oz for about $0.60 even with the discounts). they are primarily juice and spakling water with a little vitamin A, B, C and some niacin thrown in for good measure. low calorie they are not- 90 calories for 8oz.- but no refined sugar and no caffeine. if you need caffeine fix don't bother- you're probably weak anyway and should probably get a little fresh air and exercise instead of ingesting more calories or hunting for your next caffeine fix... well, my (correct) opinion about caffeine addicts aside- enjoy some izze's sparkling beverages. they are delicious. try the blackberry.

review/summary: Good, not great
review/text: My family and I tried the Sparkling Blackberry and we all agreed that it was good, but not great.  It's better than drinking a soft drink since the sugar content comes from the fruit juice and isn't artificial.  It's sort of like having a carbonated fruit juice -- they take sparkling water and add fruit juice (70% fruit juice is what the can says).  The cans are small, perfect to pack in a lunch for your kids.  The price of Izze is a little steep, especially since they're good...not great.

review/text: I was so excited to try this "healthy" fruit beverage and couldn't believe it when I looked at the nutritional information about it--SUGAR!  EEEEK!  While this is probably better for you than a sugary soda would be, it's definitely not the epitome of healthiness for your beverage choices out there.  Why include any sugar at all in it when we have such health ailments as obesity, diabetes, and the like all linked directly with sugar consumption.  It's a nice try, but remove the sugar and it's probably gonna be okay.

review/summary: IZZE is the best alternative to HFCS laden soft drinks
review/text: Having become tired of the High Fructose Corn Syrup laden soft drinks and "fruit" drinks that permeate the drink market in the US, not to mention the "energy" drinks that are full of chemical substitutes for all the badness you can find in junk food, I started a search for the perfect alternative.<br /><br />I have found that perfect alternative: IZZE Sparkling Juice! Each flavor of IZZE (Blackberry is by far my favorite, but they also offer Pomegranate, Apple, Grapefruit, and Clementine) is nothing more than 70% real fruit juice and 30% sparkling water - the perfect combination! And each can or bottle equals a serving of fruit.<br /><br />On a hot day, I have found an IZZE to be a more refreshing salvation than any other drink out there.<br /><br />One "negative comment": I have been drinking IZZE out of a glass bottle for a few years now, and they seem to be disappearing in favor of the canned version - though the canned version is fine, it lacks the experience that only an ice-cold GLASS bottle can brink to any drink.

review/summary: Good blackberry flavored natural fruit drink
review/text: This review is for the sparkling blackberry flavor.  I have not tried the others.  I originally found this product at the Highway61 Coffeehouse in Vicksburg, and then ordered it from Amazon.  It is an excellent natural fruit drink in 8.4 ounce (248 ml) pop-top cans.  It contains white grape, apple, blackberry, raspberry, lemon, and red grape juice concentrates, reconstituted with sparkling water for the equivalent of 70 percent fruit juice.  A good juice for breakfast, lunch, or snacktime.<br /><br />I have also tried the sparkling pomegranate flavor, and I do not recommend that flavor which I thought was somewhat yuck.  It is a combination of apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry, and pomegranate.  That combination should go back to the drawing board.  For reasons unknown, Amazon lumps all the reviews together, without regard to the fact that the products are substantially different.

review/text: It is delicious.  However, for us the taste is not pure blackberry but rather like a fruit punch with an olio of compatible fruit flavors zinged by sparkling water.<br /><br /> In addition to the natural flavor, what we have really enjoyed is the variety of uses we've found for this Izze.  We like it as a breakfast drink as a change from orange or grapefruit juice.  We love it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream than whirled in a blender for a great smoothie.  And, it's appreciated by our non-wine drinking guests (Looks a bit like a merlot).<br /><br /> All in all, Izze is a welcome addition to our pantry and table.

review/summary: Light and refreshing
review/text: I've been drinking IZZE for awhile now, albeit in bottles, not these cute little cans.  First seen at Amazon, I have since found them at my local grocery store.  I really enjoy the lightness.  I don't drink soft drinks, mostly because I don't like them and actually prefer water.  But sometimes, especially when eating something salty like pizza, I really enjoy a refreshing drink.  Izze is perfect!<br />TASTE:  Definitely fruity, not overpowering.<br />EFFERVESCENCE:  perfect.  Too much carbonation would overpower the flavor.  Not enough and it would not be refreshing.<br />HEALTH BENEFITS:  sweetened with fruit juice, there is no high fructose corn syrup, just natural fructose.  But don't be fooled, sugar is sugar and does contain calories.  This is not a calorie free, or even calorie reduced beverage.  But in the spectrum of sweeteners, if you are going to ingest 80-100 calories in a beverage, this would be far superior to soft drinks, straight fruit juice, or beer.  I can't stand the taste of any artificial sweetener and far prefer this.<br />So, why "fortified"?  From their own website, I discovered that in order to be sold in schools, beverages now have to meet the National School Beverage Guidelines, which require drinks to contain a minimum of 10% of the RDA of at least 3 vitamins.  (BTW, I think the Guidelines are an excellent idea, check out their website.)  IZZE fortified meets their standards in both calorie and vitamin content.<br />There's been some talk around here about drug interactions with pomegranate, so if you are concerned, use some caution.  Recent studies have demonstrated that pomegranate does not inhibit enzymes involved in the breakdown of medications (i.e., no problem) but previous studies likened it to grapefruit juice, which does alter drug metabolism.  There are a few things to consider: the actual amount of pomegranate juice (I can't find this information anywhere, but suspect it is quite small), how narrow the therapeutic index of your particular medication (will a tiny change in the level of your medication affect you?), and in the case of warfarin, how stable you are.  While I personally don't think (and I am a pharmacist) there is a problem here, if your condition is unstable, or you consume large amounts of pomegranate flavor IZZE, or if you just don't want to worry, then skip the pomegranate flavor.<br />FLAVORS:  Blackberry.  My personal favorite, if I were able to make a drink out of blackberries, this is what I would want it to taste like.  Clementine: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> refreshing, but a reminds me a little bit of Berocca.  Might be the addition of the vitamin C, which I didn't notice in the other flavors.  The fortified Clementine tastes very slightly different than the bottled Clementine.  Grapefruit:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> tart and fresh.  Great in hot weather.

Tasty.<br />Looking for an even lower calorie IZZE?  Try IZZE-esque.  That is for a different review, but it is out there.<br />Overall, I love these.  Highly recommended for all ages.

review/summary: Blackberry = Sorta Blackberry
review/text: This review is for the blackberry flavor of this product only. I can't speak for the other flavors.<br /><br />Izze is onto a pretty good idea here - sparkling water fortified with vitamins and flavored with real fruit juice. I was happy for the opportunity to sample the blackberry, because that's one of my favorite flavors but you don't see it in too many mass consumer products. But according to the label on the can, this beverage includes "Pure juice made from white grape, apple, blackberry, lemon, and raspberry juice concentrate." Note that blackberry is third on this list, but the product is called blackberry. Is this mixture necessary to create a believable blackberry flavor that does not react negatively with sparkling water? In any case, the flavor passes for at least artificial blackberry, which is tasty enough. Outside of the sorta blackberry, in general the beverage has a rather bitter aftertaste, and the Izze sparkling waters are a bit on the pricey side even when bought by the case, with the small 8.4-oz. cans. But with plenty of vitamins, low sodium, and 70% fruit juice (though in a curious combination), this is tasty enough for four stars, and it's an enjoyable beverage if you don't think about it too much.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I first discovered Izze Blackberry juice when eating at a local restaurant. It is absolutely delicious and a wonderful alternative to sugary, caffeinated pop.<br /><br />One warning: it does take some getting used to. Our American palates are so conditioned to the ultra-sweet high fructose corn syrup that infiltrates practically EVERYTHING we eat (believe me; I tried to avoid HFCS for an extended period of time and it was virtually impossible--it's in everything from Pepsi to ketchup), so at first, it won't seem very flavorful. But if you let yourself get used to it, you will quickly be trading in your Pepsi for Izze. It's much healthier, and the cans are smaller, which means you get less calories--90 calories per serving as opposed to the 150 you get from a 12-oz can of Pepsi or Coke, or even the 100 calories you get from the smaller versions of the canned pop. It's certainly more refreshing than pop and doesn't leave your mouth with that coated-in-sugar-and-syrup feeling. I highly recommend this product!!

review/text: If you're looking for a drink to quench your thirst, no need to look any further. Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice in Blackberry will satisfy your cravings for a fizzy fruitful drink without the strong carbonation that most soft drinks usually have.  Imagine drinking your favorite sparkling cider but with more of the rich fruity flavor enriched in the drink.  That is what it tastes like when you get a hold of Izze.  Also, there are two other great things about it, low in caffeine and not too sweet; so, you'll have to look elsewhere for something to add a little jolt to your day.<br /><br />And although it may be consumed without refrigeration, it may taste better chilled or dispensed from the can into a glass filled with ice cubes, especially if you're drinking on a hot summer day. Either way, you're in for a cool and refreshing drink any time of the season.  In addition, it also comes in grapefruit, Clementine, and apple flavor.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: I love Izze products, but especially the blackberry flavor. They are delivered monthly and I order enough so I never run out. It's a great alternative to colas or other types of sodas.  Healthy juice and just the right amount of carbonation keeps me an Izze fan. The Subscribe and Save program is ideal for me.

review/summary: Much better alternative than high fructose corn syrup sodas
review/text: I order this case on sale, and it was much less expensive than in the grocery store.  We love these cans but the carbohydrates are not that much less than regular soda, however, if you want to avoid high fructose corn syrup or phosphoric acid (that plays a major role in cavities according to my dentist), then these are a great alternative.  Recommend.

review/summary: Delcious healthy alternative to sodas - sized right, too!
review/text: Izze is a great tasting, refreshing beverage with 70 percent fruit juice and 30 percent sparkling water.  I've tried several flavors, and have yet to find one I didn't like.<br /><br />Sparkling blackberry juice tastes like an idealized version of my childhood favorite - black cherry soda.  The sparkling clementine juice brings back childhood memories of great tasting orange sodas.  Whereas now the fruit flavored sodas taste overly sugared or like chemistry experiments - the Izze sparkling juices taste wonderful!  The pomegranate flavor is tart, but sweetened up a bit with added cranberry and apple juice.<br /><br />I've tried the sparkling blackberry juice in both the glass bottle and the can.  The flavor is subtly different; from the bottle it seems a little sweeter and less carbonated; from the can the flavor is a bit stronger.<br /><br />The 8.4 ounce cans are smaller in height and circumference than the standard size US soft drink cans; they're more like European soft drink cans.  The size and shape is a good size for the hand, and holds enough sparkling juice to satisfy a normal thirst.  I'd like to see more US drink companies adopt this size can!<br /><br />This is a great tasting, healthy alterative to regular sodas.  Highly recommended!!

review/summary: Sparkling and sweet
review/text: I enjoyed this offering from Izze, which is smartly packaged in terms of portions (although not the most eco-friendly) and packs a great deal of flavor. It can be a challenge to find sparkling juice that is 100% juice and not loaded with artificial sweeteners, and Izze gets it right here. What I most liked about it is that it's a smallish portion which gives you just the right amount to drink without loading up on too many calories at once. That is, if you don't find yourself going back for more. :-)

review/summary: Refreshing natural soda
review/text: What I love about Izze is that it's a relatively lo-cal soda (compared to products like Coke, etc) and it is all natural. There is no sugar in this drink - it is a fruit juice and carbonated water.  The blackberry flavor is all I've had so far - the taste is great.  It isn't too sweet.  I like the 8 ounce can because it prevents over-indulging.  Well, unless you crack open another can.<br /><br />The B-complex vitamins that this drink is fortified with might not do a whole lot of good, honestly.  From what I understand most of the 'vitamin-enhanced' soft drinks don't provide much in the way of retainable vitamin content.  But I'm no expert.  The thing is, I like this beverage because it is tasty and refreshing - and without any high fructose corn syrup.

review/text: Looking for a fizzy alternative to soda?  This is a great option.  Izze drinks are mostly fruit juice with some carbonated water.  There's no sugar or artificial sweeteners.  They're nice and light, refreshing, sweet enough to satisfy but not too sweet.  The blackberry is my favourite.  I really enjoy these when I'm looking for something fizzy.

review/text: Izze, a brand I know and sometimes love, has a real winner on their hands here. Fortified with vitamins, and chock full of good taste, this is one smart drink.<br /><br />While not as blackberry as eating the berries fresh off the bramble, it is delicious.<br /><br />If I had any qualm with the product, they've gotten the tolerances too tight on the thinness of the can. I've sprung a leak on these with very little provocation. I'd suggest you put the good stuff into either a padded holder, or something a bit more sturdy.<br /><br />Other than that, it tastes so good, you don't even realize it's good for you.

review/summary: Blackberry flavor is delicious
review/text: The Blackberry flavor is perfectly sweet and perfectly carbonated.  At 8.4 fluid ounces, it's small enough to guzzle down in just a few gulps.  At 90 calories, it is a wonderful alternative to those 100 calorie snack packs of carbs since you can comfort yourself that at least this is fruit juice.  The nutrition facts label says it conatins 21g of carbohydrate, 20g of which is sugar.  Also has 15mg sodium, and 10% of recommended daily allowance of vitamins C, B6, and Niacin.  Perhaps surprisingly, the Blackberry flavor is made from juice concentrates (in order listed on can) white grape, apple, blackberry, lemon, and raspberry.  It also contains red grape juice concentrate for the color.  Very tasty!

review/text: If it had more nutrition, I would have given this one 5 stars. As a refreshing alternative to colas, it is excellent. Our family really enjoyed the taste and I particularly liked it.  It was unique, a nice change of pace, with plenty of fizz and everything we'd expect from a sparkling juice.<br /><br />We served this to guests as well and some of them wanted to know where we'd gotten it so it was a hit with them. On hot days, it is particularly appealing, served nicely chilled. The Blackberry taste was easily identified by everyone who sampled it, even before I noted the flavor. A nice, tempting alternative when you want a refreshing beverage.

review/summary: Sparkling Juices That Beat Ordinary Sodas . . . Hands Down!
review/text: When I heard about IZZE drinks, I went looking.  The way I figured it, in my small town, I'd be lucky to find anything other than the highly advertised, obligatory sodas I stopped drinking several years back.  I found IZZE in only one store, but, happily, it was on sale.  It seems that nobody around here has heard much about IZZE so the store wasn't selling a lot.<br /><br />I predict that's about to change.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />1. IZZE products contain 70% fruit juice and 30% sparkling water.  Period.  No added sugar, no artificial flavors, no artificial colors to send your kids up the wall.  Just the good stuff, just the real stuff!<br /><br />2. IZZE's delicious.  I tried blackberry, pomegranate, and clementine - all great tasting!<br /><br />3. IZZE comes in cans containing only 8.4 oz, so you don't load up on sugar and carbonation. Think portion control.<br /><br />4. IZZE (in cans) is fortified with vitamin C, niacin, and B6 in small amounts.  At least you're getting a dab of nutrition along with the taste of a very good soda.<br /><br />5. IZZE flavors vary in sweetness.  Blackberry is very sweet, but pomegranate is more on the tart side.  There's something to suit most tastes without the cloying sweetness of kids' juice drinks.<br /><br />I predict IZZE will soon appear on the shelves of my regular grocery store.  It's that good!

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I found these at Costco first, and decided to buy them on here because I can get an all Blackberry case which in my opinion is the best(not a huge fan of the Orange..Apple is pretty good).I tried these as an alternative to soda (my vice) and I love them. They are not overly sweet (sugar amount COULD be lower) and I drink them constantly. I would like to think they also don't dehydrate you as much as soda would.<br />Also, if you like these I would suggest trying R.W. Knudsen Spritzer Black Cherry. A little more expensive but taste extremely good.

review/summary: The best alternative to soda!
review/text: I love blackberry Izze!  I first tried them at a local Chipotle Mexican Grill and fell in love immediately!  I've been trying to eliminate caffeine and excess sugar from my diet, but sometimes you really just want that fizzy experience.  The 8 oz size is smaller than a soda can, but I think it is just the right size for a serving of something cold and refreshing (I never finish a full soda can anyway).  These are very flavorful (they taste like juice, not watered down or anything).  The tangy blackberry flavor is very refreshing and doesn't seem syrupy or sugary at all.  I love these, and so does my 6-year-old son.  I've got them on the auto-delivery for one case a month - they're so tasty I have to pace myself otherwise I'd probably drink 2-3 a day!

I ended up ordering 3 cases of it from Amazon and it was shipped free to our door within a week. The whole process was easy and convenient.

review/text: I had tried one of these once in the past, I saw the deal Amazon had from a blog and decided to take advantage. It arrived on time, but the box was crushed on the top and 2 of the drinks had opened and spilled. There was air bubble protection on the side, but not the top. It was a terrible smell and I had to thoroughly clean the rest.<br /><br />That aside, the drinks are delicious and a good alternative to sugary juices and energy drinks. I like that they are not too sweet and the fruit taste comes through. They are best enjoyed very cold IMO.

review/text: IZZE has seemed to find the balance between healthy fruit taste and the sensation of carbonated soft drinks with their sparkling juice line.  I haven't had a soft drink in over a year since discovering these wonderfully refreshing, healthy alternatives to carbonated soft drinks.  Since it's pure fruit juice, it's also naturally weet (but not too sweet) so it also satisfies that "sweet tooth" as well.  Although not a substitute for plain ol' H2O, this beverage definitely satisfies and quenches my thirst.  Can't get enough of these beverages.......

It would be nice to have a variety pack choice though.<br /><br />But anyways what can I say other than blackberry happens to be my favorite flavor and it never disappoints. I like these since they are fruit juice and sparkling water. Most other juice beverages list water as there main ingredient so it's nice to see the flip side. I also don't really drink soda and it's nice to have a healthier alternative. So try all the flavors!

review/text: I like this flavor best, refreshing and just enough fruit flavor to satisfy.  Good size can, not too big that it gets warm.  Highly recommend for those who want something refreshing and good for you.  Counts as a serving of fruit.

review/summary: Delicious, healthy, and natural...
review/text: There really aren't that many choices available for those of us looking for natural sparkling juices.  Lucky for us, there's IZZE!  Naturally sweetened, naturally colored, and suprisingly delicious.  There's just one drawback to these otherwise perfect drinks...  they're a little on the small side.  About the same size as those Red Bull energy drinks.  They are also available in a larger size, though not in cans but rather glass bottles.  Either way, get some!

review/summary: Blackberry Juice water
review/text: I bought this @ my grocery store and found it was a weak soda, but very tasty as a pop. It could be mixd in a tea or used in a punch mix too. It works well if your doctor has stopped your water intake due to low blood sodium to quench your thrist, because there is a small amount of salt in it. Caffine free so you can drink at night. I'll buy with the 15% off through Amazon it is apprx. $.75 a can.<br /><br />UPDate:<br />I have gotten my thrid case of this Blackberry Juice by Izze. We love this product.

review/summary: Tasty and refreshing
review/text: Delicious! I usually don't like flavored waters and avoid them and was afraid that this product would be something similar, but this blackberry sparkling juice is quite good. It's best when very cold and hits the spot with a not-too-sweet flavor. My beverage of choice would usually be soda, but I am trying to wean myself off caffeine. This is a great caffeine-free drink for when I just have to have something other than water. I appreciate that there are no artificial ingredients - especially those suspicious artificial sweeteners - in fact, you can actually read the ingredients list without needing a scientist standing next to you.<br /><br />All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this drink, and I'll definitely try the other flavors (I have my eye on the grapefruit next). I think this will be a good alternative beverage for the summer months, and although I'll choose water over this most of the time, as a little bit of "something" extra, this drink fits the bill.

review/summary: who knew
review/text: Wow.  Very refreshing drink, and it's from my brothers back in Boulder, Colorado.  Blackberry, huh?  Pretty good.  I'm glad that, all these years later, they are still coming out with new Coltrane albums and new fruits.  These little cans are nice, not big enough to count against you and a nice quick chug.  I enjoyed the drink but especially enjoyed getting a case of fruity drinks in the mail.  Purchasing this drink will add years to your life, cleanse your colon, get your fingernails looking bright and shiny again, increase your stamina, reduce your carbon footprint, improve your bowling game, and save a Daubentonia madagascariensis paw.

review/text: These drinks are pretty tasty a bit on the tart side but not too sweet which is nice in the current market of way to sweet beverages. I'll be trying more of the flavors fo these drinks. They also make good mixing drinks for vodka and other stronger drink!

review/summary: Blackberry Izze
review/text: This review is written by a non soda-drinker; it's not that I never drink pop, it's just that I know it's not that good for my teeth or my body, so, up until receiving a bunch of Izze through Amazon Vine, I probably have drank at most 1 pop a month (probably less) for about the past 5 years.  Since I'm not an everyday soda drinker, I'm not particularly concerned when I do drink one that it's low in calories, "diet," or anything else--it's just gotta satisfy my very occasional desire for a soda.  With this in mind, I'll keep my reviews (yeah, I did request 4 different ones--should last me about 10 years at this rate!) of Izze short and simple.<br /><br />Of the two I've tried, I like this blackberry one less.  I do like it, but the flavor is less reminiscent of actual blackberries and more reminiscent of that generic blackberry flavor that comes in soda and other products.  I actually like the very small (8.4 oz) cans a lot, since it doesn't take much for me to get a soda fix, and I probably don't need twice as much refined sugar that comes in a larger can.  It's soda, and it tastes good--if you buy your soda from Amazon.com(!?!), I recommend giving this a try.

review/summary: Sweet and Sparkling
review/text: This blackberry sparkling juice is delicious.It's nice and sweet.<br /><br />I liked it and my friends liked it very much. It tastes just like dark cherry soda.<br /><br />On the can is printed "We partner with Global Education Fund to help provide education and resources to needy children around the world." That alone is a good reason for me to buy this beverage.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
