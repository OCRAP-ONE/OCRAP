review/summary: Some texture issues, but delicious
review/text: The bag for these clusters recommends enjoying them in milk, on yogurt, or as snacks right out of the bag, so I decided to try them in every manner that did not involve buying yogurt that I would then be disinclined to finish.  First, I snacked on them dry out of the bag.  They definitely tasted delicious, with all the cinnamon and sweetness promised on the label.  They had a really satisfying crunch without being too hard, and I would definitely keep buying them for snacking purposes at my office.  My main problem with the dry snack method is that the clusters aren't very cohesive, so sampling them mostly involves scooping them up in your hand, pouring them into your mouth, and trying not to lick your fingers before going back for another scoop - I don't recommend this method for people with germ issues.  There were some clusters that were easy to pick up and enjoy, but most of the bag was loose or powdered.<br /><br />I next tried them in a bowl of milk, and again, the taste was delicious.  Sweet with cinnamon, exactly what I want in the morning.  Again, though, texture became an issue.  They stayed crunchy in the milk for the first minute or two, then got very soggy - still tasty, but not nearly as satisfying.<br /><br />Texture issues aside, though, I really enjoyed this product by both methods.  I love that it has so much fiber and flax, and so many simple ingredients on the list.  I also love that it is gluten-free (I eat my share of gluten, but I have close friends who can't eat it, and I am always on the lookout for more tasty products that I can share).  This is definitely something that I would eat again.

review/summary: Even my picky eater loves this!
review/text: My Husband and I love this, but what is really surprising is that my picky daughter absolutely loves it too!  She ate two serving of homemade yogurt with the Kind Vanilla Blueberry Clusters mixed in with a touch of maple syrup added to sweeten the plain yogurt.  This is the first packaged granola she has liked and it is so healthy!  It is also tasty just on it's own.  The flavor tastes "pure" (it actually tastes like fruit and whole grains), it has a good crunch, and is not overly sweet.  My bag had plenty of clusters and was not powdery at all.<br /><br />Whole grains included: gluten-free oats, brown rice, gluten-free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, and quinoa.<br /><br />This is definitely a snack I can feel good about serving to my family.

review/summary: Tasty and Versatile
review/text: Like good granola, this stuff works both as a finger-food snack and as cereal with milk. Nice, crunchy texture to the clusters and the cinnamon flavor is the key that gives it its good taste. The fact that it's a healthy snack/cereal, is just gravy. Highly recommended for both kids and adults.

review/summary: Excellent Ingredients, Unremarkable Taste
review/text: I decided to review this product for the Vine program since I love granola, and I had never tried the KIND Healthy Grains brand before.  The combination of blueberry and vanilla was extremely appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try, in a cereal bowl with milk.  Let's start with the positive things about the granola, since there is much to like.  The product is gluten free, has 750 mg of Omega-3s, there are no refined sugars, no saturated fat (there are 3 grams of fat total in a 1/3 cup serving), no trans fat, 5 grams of fiber, and has very low sodium.  The sweeteners include evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree and apple juice.  In essence, it should be the perfect snack.  Unfortunately, it was not.  There was a very mild hint of vanilla flavoring and almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found.  In fact, the granola lacked any kind of flavor at all.  And the granola clusters themselves lacked freshness and tasted quite stale.  The overwhelming smell when you open the bag is definitely flax, and not the formerly mentioned blueberry and vanilla that was advertised.  So what I had hoped would be a new favorite granola cereal ended up being a bit disappointing.  I wish that the flavor itself could have been better, because the ingredients are just so good for you.  I will more than likely eat some more of this, perhaps in yogurt to ease the crunchiness and stale taste a bit, but I will not be buying the product again.  If you are looking for a great tasting granola, I would highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OCKIP0">Back To Nature Granola Chocolate Delight, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a> or Nature's Path Love Crunch.  Both are much better tasting, and offer a better alternative to this product.

review/summary: Review for both Cinnamon and Vanilla Blueberry flavors
review/text: NOTE: Because Amazon has all of the "Kind Healthy Grains Clusters" reviews linked together, it is necessary for me to say that this review is for only the cinnamon and vanilla blueberry flavors.<br /><br />After trying Kind's cinnamon clusters and loving them, I was really excited about trying all of the Kind Clusters!  Unfortunately, I didn't like the vanilla blueberry at all and found that they actually turned me off about wanting any more Kind Clusters.<br /><br />While the cinnamon taste popped out as soon as the cluster hits my tongue, the vanilla blueberry didn't even taste like it was supposed to!  It tasted more like sour apple juice and less like any form of blueberry!  Plus, I didn't detect any vanilla flavor at all.  I really enjoyed munching on the cinnamon clusters by themselves as a light snack whenever I felt like nibbling.  However, I needed something to drown out the vanilla blueberry clusters' nasty flavor and wouldn't eat them without milk or yogurt.  I'm sure that the cinnamon clusters would have been just as delicious with those two additions, as well.<br /><br />Both of these flavored clusters only have molasses and evaporated cane juice as sweeteners; therefore, they won't be as sugary as some people like their snacks; however, this lack of refined sugar makes the clusters healthier than most foods on the market.  Besides the already-mentioned molasses and cane juice, other ingredients include the following: whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, cinnamon, sea salt, and Vitamin E.  The vanilla blueberry ingredients are different in that there is no cinnamon but there is vanilla extract, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, citrus fiber, and citrus pectin.  I'm baffled as to why plum and apple products are added to a supposedly vanilla blueberry food.  All the ingredients are without a doubt extremely healthy.<br /><br />A serving size is about 1/3 cup which has 120-130 calories, 3-3.5 grams of fat, and 5-6 grams of sugar.  Other nice things to note are the calcium, protein, and iron that are present.<br /><br />I love the cinnamon flavor and highly recommend it, giving it a rating of 4/5.  The vanilla blueberry flavor was repulsive to me, though, and I would only give it a score of 2/5.  Overall, Kind Clusters are a highly healthy snack that's easy to grab a handful of.  I recommend trying the cinnamon, although I warn against getting the vanilla blueberry.  As for whether or not to try other flavors, that's completely up to you.  I will probably not be doing so in the near future.

review/summary: Unremarkable in taste or quality
review/text: Some highlights:<br />* Not too sweet, just right<br />* Not too salty either<br />* Some clusters like would be in granola, but not many<br />* Doesn't smell like vanilla or blueberry at all<br /><br />Overall, it has a bland and unremarkable taste.  I have tried much better granola in the past with a better nutritional profile.<br />Actually, it's hard to assess the nutritional profile since the "Nutrition Facts" do not show accurate data.  For example, one of the ingredients is Vitamin E, but it's not listed under the nutrition facts.  Which makes me think that anything could be there (or not be there).<br /><br />Also, the smell when I opened the package was anything but appealing.  No hints of vanilla or blueberries.

review/summary: Hits all the High Spots
review/text: Most mixtures similar to the Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters are too sweet for my taste. I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice balance in these clusters. Still, if you're avoiding sugar in your diet, this product is not for you.<br /><br />The mix is my newest all-time favorite snack since it contains no raisons. I also like the combination of healthy grains (no wheat), low sodium content, cinnamon flavor, and the fresh after-taste it leaves in my mouth.<br /><br />A full serving is 1/3 of a cup, so the portion is too small for breakfast except to top oatmeal. That's the way I will eat it this winter. I'll also pack some to snack on when I take my long Thanksgiving trip. Next summer I'll enjoy it over ice cream and yogurt. This product is a keeper.

review/summary: It's good, but..
review/text: I bought this for my granola bars (peanut butter, honey, and the healthy grain clusters).  It is very good and for 3 bags the price is awesome, but there's something in this bag that my stomach just can't digest.  I don't know how else to say it, whatever it is comes out the same way it went in and it is not comfortable at all.  I ate two bags before I narrowed it down to this product and it was not a pleasent two weeks.<br /><br />It may just be me as I don't see anyone else complaining about it.  It is a very solid product though.

review/summary: Not too impressed...
review/text: ...especially when it came to the flax seeds.<br /><br />I guess I'm just not a flax kind of guy... or maybe I've been brainwashed (or tastebud washed) into preferring commercial grade mass-market granola (with something like, say, Nature's Valley or the like), that this particular granola didn't feel right to me in terms of taste and texture.<br /><br />I freely admit this may be my own fault and should not reflect on the product as a whole. If this is the case, I apologize to the folks at KIND... but, in my own opinion, this granola just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />It should be said, though, I did like the packaging... I am so sick of single serving packages that waste materials or open box/cereal box that allow their product to go stale on the shelf the moment you break the plastic. KIND's method reminds me of the same style of packaging that Great Harvest puts their local-sourced granola in (another granola that I admire, even as I cannot eat it enjoyably).<br /><br />Still, 2 out of 5.

review/summary: Kind and Healthy?
review/text: I may have gotten a bad batch, but these tasted stale to me. I'm also frustrated with poor marketing. Is this a cereal, or a snack? If it's meant to just be a snack, it falls very short. There were few actual clusters,and the rest was loose bits of grain, etc. That could have worked in milk with a spoon, but the packaging seemed to indicate it's a snack food. I have no idea what's 'kind' about it, and I don't like the push for grains to be considered 'required' in anyone's diet. The original studies that showed fiber was important for digestion were all studies on VEGETABLE fibers in real whole foods, not in processed grains. They're doing good by using only non GMO ingredients, but still not what I consider to be truly healthy food.

review/summary: What Blueberries?  And what's with the weird aftertaste?
review/text: I'm a pretty big cereal and granola fan.  You'd have to botch up pretty badly to make me not like your cereal - Kind Healthy Grains has botched up pretty badly.  On the initial bite, it wasn't too bad...it has a good crunch and tastes like a pretty decent granola.  I really didn't detect a blueberry taste to it, nor did I see any actual dried blueberries in there.  The vanilla taste was a little artificial tasting, but I kept eating anyways.  Then the weird flavor started kicking in.  The vanilla taste started tasting more and more nappy tasting, and when I stopped eating for a little bit, I got the worse aftertaste in my mouth.  I'm presuming it was from the flax seeds, but having eaten flax seeds in a lot of cereals and from the fresh flax I put in my yogurt, I'm not sure if that was the cause of the problem.  The aftertaste of this granola is pretty bad.  It just doesn't taste right - kinda like a mix between musty old nuts and artificial vanilla flavoring.<br /><br />I tried eating this granola with milk and it was still pretty bad.  My two preschoolers didn't seem to mind the cereal much, although I noticed that when I offered it to them after that initial bowl that they never wanted it again.  I'm guessing that means that they probably tasted that funky aftertaste, too.  After this experience, I'm probably not going to buy this cereal again.  Not recommended.

review/summary: Not a bad healthy snack
review/text: This oat cluster snack is pretty tasty, though it's not something I would want to snack on all the time.  The flavor tastes like a mild cinnamon.  It's a little a hard to eat by hand because the clusters are so small.  It says on the package that you can eat it with milk like cereal, which seems preferable, or sprinkle it over yogurt.  It has a lot of fiber and contains flax, which is a good source of omega-3, and it has no saturated fat.  It's not a bad snack, and healthy snack-lovers will probably enjoy it.

review/summary: The good and the bad
review/text: Some people will extol this product, some will dislike it, while others will see some good and some bad points in it. The good are the healthy ingredients: the 5g fiber, 750mg Omega 3, and the five 100% whole grains. Nutritionists have said that if a product states that it is whole grain, it is not 100% unless it explicitly says so. Other people may dwell on what they consider bad points. The problem with 100% whole grains is that many individuals find them tasting too grainy. This is the case here. It is one of the reasons why some manufacturers do not use 100% whole grains. Secondly, the clusters remain hard even after sitting in milk or soy for several minutes. This may be too hard for some consumers. Thirdly, the cereal is filled with flax seeds, which is good, but they do not soften, and they get caught in some people's teeth.

review/summary: low fat, high-ish sugar, mild flavor
review/text: This cereal is pleasant enough tasting, but quite honestly I would have appreciated the addition of more blueberry puree (or, better yet, some dried blueberries) for extra flavor.<br /><br />Relative to lots of other granolas, this one has some things going for it:  relatively low fat (3 grams per 29 gram serving), with no saturated or trans fats, and 5 grams of fiber.  It's also lower in sugar than many other granolas, with 5 grams per serving.<br /><br />Bear in mind that a serving of this granola is only 1/3 cup.  If you are inclined to eat more at one time (like I am), you'll likely want to double or triple the above values.<br /><br />The back of the bag suggests serving this granola three ways:  on-the-go (dry), over yogurt, or with milk.  I think they should add to that on top of baked fruit since I think this might make for a healthy alternative to a traditional cobbler topping.  I think I'll use the rest of my bag to try that out!

review/summary: Hard, crunchy and sweet
review/text: Considering the ingredients in this product, with the exception of sugar, it is a healthy combination.  I am a granola fan therefore was looking forward to trying something new.  The first spoonful was a surprise because I didn't expect it to be so hard and crunchy with an occasional chewy berry thrown in. I didn't like the texture and found it very difficult to eat.  As well, I found it too sweet.  After two spoonfuls I couldn't eat anymore so I gave it to my husband to try.<br /><br />He liked the crunch of the granola but said it was too sweet for him.  He did finish off the bowl but indicated it is doubtful he will eat any more of it.  My thoughts are to soak the rest of the package and add it to muffins. The added fiber will be a bonus.<br /><br />If you don't mind a sweet cereal and like the hard crunch then you may like this product.  I didn't but that's because of my personal preference.  Looking at other reviews many people do like it so you may want to take their considerations in as well.

review/summary: not the best, but still good
review/text: So, I tasted this nummy granola, and it was quite satisfactory. Granted, I probably wouldn't reach for it to just snack on plain (i.e. just the granola itself. Instead, I decided to add it to my Greek yogurt. Mmmmmm! LOVED it! It wasn't too crunchy, and by the time I was done with my yogurt and granola, it wasn't soft/mushy/soggy; the granola didn't have the same crunch and solid firmness as it did to begin with, but it wasn't a "wimpy" granola that got soft/soggy after a short period of time.<br /><br />I'd recommend it if someone were thinking of buying it. Would it be my first choice? Depends. But I do know that it tastes great, is not TOO hard right out of the bag, and won't get soft sitting in yogurt for simply a short period of time.

review/summary: Healthy AND irresistible
review/text: When my one review pack arrived, I thought I'd have a quick taste just to see how it compared with the Kashi GoLean Crunch that DH has been eating to replace the decidedly NOT heart-healthy snacks that his cardiologist says he can't eat anymore. Why not? I could just zip the bag back closed. Well, I tell you, I had to sit down right there and pour myself a bowl with milk. Wonderful. And now we have something that can be sprinkled over greek-style non-fat plain yogurt, which he IS supposed to be eating more of. The evaporated cane juice provides just the right hint of sweetness without being too much sugar, and the high level of fiber will certainly be a boon to healthy dieters. The flax seed is an added benefit for heart health.<br /><br />My 60-year-old teeth are sensitive and weaker now than they used to be, so I often have difficulty chewing some of the granolas. This Kind blend is chewy and substantial, but not so hard that it's risky for me to try to eat it out of hand. Softened with milk, it's no problem at all. I'm not on a gluten-free diet, but I have friends who are, and this product would be just fine for them. The mix of whole grains has an interesting texture and taste, and the whole blend tastes so good I'd warn you not to sit down with the whole bag in front of the TV. It WILL be gone before you know it.<br /><br />Cost is my only problem with this product, but not because it's not worth the money. Healthy food costs more than junk, as it should, and it's clear to me that Kind is very healthy indeed. We're on low fixed income, though, so this would have to be an occasional splurge item for us, used more as a condiment on aforementioned yogurt than as a complete meal. I can stretch $5 worth of beans or chicken a lot further than I could one of these 11 oz. bags. I might, though, try it mixed in with oatmeal.<br /><br />In short: It's good food.

review/summary: Not very blueberry, but otherwise OK
review/text: First off, with a name like "vanilla blueberry clusters" you'd think there'd be some dried blueberries mixed in with the granola, but you'd be wrong here.  It's simply pureed blueberries mixed in with the other flavorings.  I also have to take a little issue with the "clusters" part of the name.  Some of the product was in clusters, a bit was in great chunks, but a lot of it is broken down into little pieces or partial pieces of grain and seeds (and those flax seeds are tiny!).  Some of that breakdown may be the way Amazon sent the Vine product sample to me, in a padded mailer, where normally I imagine they'd use a box, but I doubt that was the sole reason.<br /><br />My gluten-free friend liked this product enough to seek it out on her own.  My roommate's toddler enjoyed it and kept asking for more.  I am personally kind of ambivalent about it - I wanted a stronger blueberry presence and more clusters.  I'd eat it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it (unless shopping for gluten-free snacks for a social event with that friend).  It's nicely crunchy, and the 1/3 cup serving size (120 cal) is reasonably sized for an afternoon snack, and contains 3g each of fat and protein.

review/text: Overall, I found this a pretty tasty, crunchy granola cluster snack. The clusters seem to precipitate toward the bottom, but c'est la vie. The taste was good as was the texture. Good for snacking or as topping or cereal (though there'd only be enough for a couple bowls, like 2-3?). Though, I felt like it maybe needed something extra like some dried tropical fruit mixed in or something? Maybe I'll have to try making my own sometime... But, as it was, I liked it.

review/text: Overall, I found this granola quite appealing. Seemed like more granola than clusters, or maybe the clusters all just settled to the bottom of the pouch? ;)<br /><br />Flavor's good. Quite crunchy. I like the fact it's got largely healthy-ish stuff in it. Oats, seeds, etc. Seem to recall it has a little of your typical vegetable oil. Not entirely sure why that's necessary, plenty of fats in the seeds & such. I'd kind of rather just have dextrose-based sugar for binding w/o the added fat in the oil or whatnot. I assume there's a way. But regardless, overall I thought it was quite nice. I'd give it a good thumbs up. Good for snacking on the go, or probably as topping for yogurt or ice cream. I suppose you could eat it like cereal, though you'd only get a couple bowls out of it. Maybe 2-3?

review/text: I love this cereal as an alternative to hot oatmeal.  it is high fiber, low glycemic, great tasting, and fills me up.  The flavors are outstanding, and it's so much healthier than regular cereal, I think.  highly recommended.

review/summary: Very crunchy, but a not as tasty as I expected
review/text: Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds was better to snack on than to eat as cereal with milk.  The taste is an acquired taste, and after you've eaten a few it starts to taste better.  It never tastes bad, it just tastes a little like cardboard until you get used to it.  All in all, I'd recommend this to people that are very health conscience and like foods like this, but this isn't something I will buy.

review/summary: A good granola
review/text: I personally enjoy granola at all times of the day, so it was not a surprise that I really liked Kind Healthy Grains.  I have always found granola as a great snack, that gives loads of energy in a small dose, and this was no different.  It has just enough of a sweet taste to make it enjoyable, while still maintaining that granola taste.  The fiber content (5g per serving) is  an excellent addition as well.  It is made with whole grains for those that are looking to induce your diet with whole grains.<br /><br />Overall I really liked the granola, its made with great ingredients, and it tastes great.  Its a great snack on top of yogurt, or as a pick me up in the middle of the day.

review/summary: Tasty and nutritious...
review/text: I'm a fan of granola and blueberries, so getting a chance to try the Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters (w/Flax Seeds) was something I was very much looking forward to. I tried it with (almond) milk as a cereal and added it as a topping to yogurt and oatmeal, and all-in-all, it tasted good. With the inclusion of grains like amaranth and quinoa, this would seem to be a very healthy granola that isn't filled to the brim with sugar. It's great as a straightforward cereal and holds its crunch well in milk. If there's one complaint, it's that it seems as if there are few actual blueberries in the product, mostly just blueberry flavoring (albeit natural). That might seem like a minor thing, but you expect more blueberries in something named blueberry clusters. Otherwise, it's great granola.

review/summary: My KIND of Granola!
review/text: I have tried just about every type of granola that can be found on a store's shelf, but I must admit that I really like the Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds.  I ate it with almond milk, in yogurt and alone as a snack.  It stayed crunchy and had a really great cinnamon taste-not overpowering and delicious.  I am a fan of the Kind brand of products because of their short ingredient lists, and I felt good about eating this cereal.  The one issue (if you can call it an issue) that I have with this product is the fact that there are whole flax seeds mixed in with the oat clusters.  Flax seeds are healthiest after they are ground up, so I'm not sure that the whole flax seeds really provide a benefit to the consumer.  Other than that, I highly recommend this product.  I am looking forward to trying the other flavors!

review/summary: Delicious and Gluten Free!!!
review/text: The Kind Healthy Grains line of cereals (I've tried both the vanilla blueberry and the cinnamon ones) are by far my favorite gluten-free breakfast cereals. They have a very nice flavor and texture (though I wouldn't mind if it was a little less sweet) and provide enough substance to keep me reasonably full with no negative digestional reactions.<br /><br />It seems like a nice, balanced nutritional content that will be attractive (and tasty) even for those who aren't in need of the gluten-free aspect.<br /><br />I immediately ordered this on a subscription basis as it's not yet available in our local grocery stores.

review/summary: Healthy, Versatile, and Filling
review/text: Kind's Cinnamon Oat Clusters are some of the most versatile foods imaginable. They can be used as cereal by adding milk. They are a great snack dry--perfect for the period between breakfast and lunch at the office. My wife and I often disagree about food, but in this case we were both impressed. The taste, texture, and level of sweetness were all just right. Finally, a filling snack that no one will feel guilty about the next day. One 11 oz. bag should last about 5 days, depending on frequency of use and portion size.

review/summary: It's just granola when it comes down to it
review/text: The product here is called "cinnamon oat clusters", but in reality it's just granola in a bit of a fancy form. According to the ingrediants list, it's not only oats but also rice, buckwheat, and some other stuff, plus flax seed. It also uses cane juice and molassesm as sweeteners, with no artificial crap (though does have added vitemin e).<br /><br />So it's pretty healthy, reletively speaking. Still, it's food and taste is what matters -- and on that note it's pretty average. It's a nice mix of sweet and oaty, and I admit I wouldn't have trouble eating it as a long term minching snack. At the same time, though, nothing about it particularly stands out. Combined with the fact that it costs over 50 cents an oz, pretty high for a simple snack food, it's not something I could recommend unless you're a complete health nut.

review/summary: Acquired taste?
review/text: Normally I love granola but....<br />I tried this straight out of the bag, sprinkled on yogurt and in a bowl of milk and in every variation it just tasted stale to me. I don't know if that's the flavor from the flax seed or what but it was not appealing. I also pawned some off on my kids to try and they didn't care for it either. I would have to say it is better with something than alone (both to mask it's taste and because it is very crumbly)<br /><br />On the plus side it seems very healthy... perhaps by the time I finish the bag I will have acquired a taste for it.

review/summary: Health/junk food
review/text: This is a classic example of junk-food marketed as health food. Granted it's better than most junk-food so if your going to eat processed sugar treats this is better, but it's essentially a highly processed sugar and oat candy bar ground up - the other stuff listed in the ingredients are of such small quantities to be negligible. You can make oats+sugar at home with raw ingredients for much cheaper and more healthy. The one thing it has is crunch, which might be useful sprinkled on yoghurt or a replacement for sugar in your cereal (or oats) in small quantities. One bag contains 11 servings - if you actually make a bag last 11 days you're in the minority because most people will wharf it down and end up ingesting huge amounts of empty calories and consider it a good product, boy it sure tastes good. If Kind was serious about making a healthy oat-based cereal they would remove the 60 grams of sugar (more than a can of Coke).

review/summary: Taste great but made my stomach hurt
review/text: First of all I want to start by saying that the Vanilla Blueberry flavor is very good! I love that it has the omega's, fiber, and protein and can be eaten as a snack without milk and makes for a great healthy meal with milk. I really did love the flavor and tried the product several times but I did have stomache pains afterwards every time I ate it no matter how much or little I had. Maybe there is something in it that only my body can not tolerate. Such a shame too since I love granola of any kind and this one in particular seems very healhy for you. Wish I could keep eating it.

review/summary: Tasty and Crunchy
review/text: I tried two varieties, the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters and the Cinnamon Oat Clusters, both with Flax Seeds.<br /><br />The package, which weighs 11 oz., advises that you can eat the product as a snack on the go, sprinkled over yogurt, or in a bowl with milk.  The serving size is one third of a cup.  The vanilla blueberry variety contains 120 calories, and the cinnamon variety has 130 calories, with 30 calories coming from fat.<br /><br />The package also advertises that there are 5 grams of fiber, and 750mg. Omega-3 in each serving.  The clusters contain 100 per cent whole grains, including amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet and buckwheat.  The product is low glycemic, without refined sugars, non GMO, and contains no saturated fat, or trans fat, is cholesterol free and very low sodium.<br /><br />The clusters are gluten free.  The back of the package notes that the product contains soy, and is made in a facility that uses peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds.<br /><br />The clusters vary in size from one grain of one of the ingredients to clumps three quarters of an inch in diameter..  They aren't hard to break apart, so this isn't really a problem, except maybe if you are trying to sprinkle them from the package onto yogurt.  You might want to pre-crumble the larger pieces before trying this.<br /><br />Eating them on yogurt was my preferred use for the vanilla blueberry clusters.  There was something about the flavor of this variety that I didn't immediately like, eaten out of hand.  I can't explain what it was, maybe too sweet?  I have to say, though, that although this was my initial reaction, the flavor sort of grew on me later.  Mixing the clusters in blueberry or other fruit-flavored yogurt masked whatever it was I didn't like and added a nice crunch.<br /><br />Eating the clusters over yogurt wasn't my favorite use of the cinnamon flavor.  This is just personal preference, because I don't want a cinnamon flavor added to my fruit-flavored yogurt.  If you think you would like this flavor combination, or if you eat vanilla or plain yogurt, then eating these with yogurt might work for you.  Like the vanilla variety, these would add a nice crunch to balance the smoothness of the yogurt.<br /><br />I liked eating the cinnamon clusters out of hand more so than the vanilla blueberry flavor.  Again, personal preference.  I  sprinkled both varieties (separately) over Special K cereal in a bowl with milk.  They added flavor,  but at 130 calories per one-third cup serving for cinnamon, and 120 calories per one-third cup for the vanilla, it would be easy to go overboard on calories if you ate these alone for breakfast.<br /><br />All in all, I liked this product.  It was tasty and crunchy.  Although maintaining a "healthy weight" is mentioned on the package, they are not especially low calorie, so portion size has to be watched.  If I see them in the grocery store, I will very likely buy them.

review/summary: Good snacking!
review/text: I was excited to receive this item because I eat healthy and I love blueberries. I have to say this bag didn't last long. I opened it up just to try it at first, snack for awhile while watching TV. Half a bag later I had to make myself put it away. The next day I tried it on top of vanilla yogurt with a little honey and it was great. If you're looking for a good versatile, healthy snack, give it a try. My only complaints--which other reviewers have also noted--is that there aren't enough blueberries, and the clusters aren't quite as large as pictured (which is probably the old "settling during shipping" issue). All in all, I really enjoyed it and will try it again.

review/summary: WOW! This granola is awesome!
review/text: I have been on a granola kick recently and have gone through about 5 different brands of granola and about twice as many flavors. This granola is my favorite out of all the different kinds I have tried.<br /><br />The texture is really great! Those dried blueberries and nice and chewy and also give it an amazing taste, while the grain and oats are super crispy and crunchy. This stuff almost seems like a lot of work to chew, because it has so much crunch and chewiness, which is exactly why I love it so much! If you are watching your weight or calorie intake, eating foods that take more work to chew are great because they actually make you feel more full and you spend more time eating a smaller amount.<br /><br />The flavor is delicious, you can taste the different grains and the berries, with a hint of vanilla and just the perfect amount of sweetness.<br /><br />The calories in this granola compared to other kinds is really low, but it tastes better than other granolas!<br /><br />Great stuff, I will be ordering more soon.

review/summary: Good Tasting, Crunchy Granola
review/text: I've been on a granola with greek yogurt kick lately and as a Celiac, I have been trying all the GF granolas I can find. So far my favorite has been the buckwheat & millet granola by Emco that I found at Grocery Outlet one time but I can't seem to find out where to purchase it. My second favorite so far has been the Kind Vanilla Blueberry flavored granola. It is crunchy, which is a must for me. It has some clusters but not many. It has a good flavor and doesn't taste burnt like the Bakery on Main Fiber Power Cinnamon and Raisin Granola I tried. Overall, this is good granola as the flavor is good and the texture is right. It is also a healthier granola. There are two reasons why this granola is only 4 stars instead of 5: 1) Price - I can really only afford to be spending $3.50/12 oz bag for granola, times are hard and gluten free food in general is not cheap; 2) Clusters - there just aren't enough clusters, which are my favorite part of granola, to satisfy me.

Believe me when I say I am not a health nut and have only just started trying to add these kinds of healthy things into my diet and I am not kidding when I say these are great tasting.  I didn't give 5 stars as I didn't like the taste of some of the blueberries, they have a funny aftertaste.  The good thing is there isn't that many floating around in there so they are easy to avoid.  I eat a handful plane as my brunch snack, but can easily see that they would taste great in oatmeal, yogurt or as a cereal.  I can't wait to try the other flavors and other KIND products.

And, in terms of texture, it's more like eating Grape Nuts cereal.<br /><br />Now, every night, instead of eating a bunch of junk food, I find myself actually wanting this snack - it has quickly become my new favorite!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend Kind Healthy Grains Dark Chocolate and Cranberry to anyone looking for a healthier way to snack!

review/text: As a snack this Kind Health Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds is really good. The cluster size means it is more substantial than normal granola. Although you don't really need any milk to eat it, it does keep its crunch quite well even in milk. I like the blueberry taste and it is natural (some other brands taste like medicine syrup to me), but it is perhaps a touch too subtle. For the somewhat steep price, I would expect more blueberry.

review/text: I'm a healthy food eater and a big label reader, so I was excited to try these Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds.  The best trait about these clusters is that they are great tasting while still being healthy.  The thought of flax seeds may make some people frown with disgust, but you will not be able to taste them.  I enjoyed them directly from the bag, and also as cereal.  I think they would taste terrific mixed in with some Greek yogurt as well.<br /><br />Each serving has 5 grams of fiber and 16 grams of whole grains, which is a nice bonus.  The only negative is that you might want to stay away if you are a hard-core calorie counter, as each one-third cup contains 120 calories.

The granola clusters are nicely sized without being too "crumbly" or too hard.  They give a nice satisfying crunch even after sitting in milk for a bit and are a great accompaniment to yogurt.  I only wish that the cinnamon was a bit stronger in flavor, but the overall balance of flavors is quite satisfactory.<br /><br />What I like best is that you feel satisfied after eating a serving of this granola and are not hungry within the next hour or two like you are with some other granola brands.

It is a bit on the sweet side, so I'd not want to eat it every day, but as a treat it's perfect and I enjoyed it very much. The abundance of large clusters make it easy to just eat it dry out of the bag, too.<br /><br />Vanilla Blueberry Clusters:<br />This was less exciting to me, although still okay, and it was marginally less sweet than the cinnamon one. I guess it had more of a cardboard taste. I was expecting something more fruity and there are no dried blueberries at all, just some blueberry puree mixed in.

And, you know what?  I was pleasantly surprised.  In a bowl, with nonfat milk, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS is a tasty, healthy breakfast for both my husband and me.  And guess what else?  Our kids, ages 6 and 14, like it, too!<br /><br />For those who care about such things, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS has 5 grams of fiber (always a plus); 750 mg of Omega-3; is gluten free, all natural, and low glycemic; has no refined sugars, saturated fats, trans fats, or cholesterol; and is very low sodium.

And, overall, it wasn't too bad. Not my favorite of the KIND HEALTHY GRAINS brand, but definitely edible. In a bowl, with nonfat milk, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS is an acceptable, healthy breakfast for both my husband and me.<br /><br />For those who care about such things, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS has 5 grams of fiber (always a plus); 750 mg of Omega-3; is gluten free, all natural, and low glycemic; has no refined sugars, saturated fats, trans fats, or cholesterol; and is very low sodium. It is 100% whole grain cereal, made up of amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds. 1/3 of a cup is about 130 calories. (However, 1/3 of a cup still seems a bit small to me...)<br /><br />As I said, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS makes a decent, light breakfast for my husband and me. My kids did not care for it, but that did not surprise me. I have added raisons, cranberrys, strawberries, etc to, and that helps a lot, but still, it is not my favorite, as compared to other KIND HEALTHY GRAINS choices.

review/summary: Smart, healthy food
review/text: Gone are the days that cold pizza washed down by soda is a good idea for starting the day.  I've gotten older and need to watch all those tricky levels to make sure that I can maintain my health.  It makes sense to eat healthy, but sometimes you need motivation to bypass the tempting "unhealthy" foods and eat right.  This product can certainly help.  It's crunchy and very flavorful with a nutty taste enhanced by a light, natural cinnamon taste.  I eat this with plain or vanilla yogurt and maybe a little fruit to start the day and can feel good about starting the day with a healthy choice.  I also note that I look forward to the meal, a true sign of a good product.<br />The only negative side is that this is very pricey.  I appreciate the high standard of quality of the ingredients, but I gotta say that I can put something together from the bulk bins at Whole Foods at a small fraction of the price.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy, and perfect for vegans ~
review/text: So despite this saying low-glycemic, it actually does have sugar, though much less than other brands (5g per serving). It is also mostly gluten (wheat gluten) free.  The grains are oats, quinoa, amaranth, millet, and buckwheat. The flavor is mild and tastes more natural than other brands, none of that super artificial flavor. It is great on yogurt (I use plain soy yogurt and add real fruit, granola, and a dash of chia seed).  It is also great in almond milk as a cereal (again, I'm vegan here).  It's tasty as a snack.  The nutritional info and ingredients are below:<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />&lt; Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g); Servings Per Package: About 11 ><br /><br />&lt; Calories 120; Calories from Fat 30; Total Fat 3g; Saturated Fat 0g; Trans Fat 0g; Cholesterol 0mg; Sodium 20mg; Total Carbohydrates 22g; Dietary Fiber 5g; Sugar 5g; Protein 3g ><br /><br />&lt; Ingredients: Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin ><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />***On a note about packaging.  Vine voices received one bag in a manila envelope.  This is NOT how the product is shipped to paying customers.  Paying customers receive three bags in a rigid box with those plastic air pockets to cushion the bags.  Vine voices were also shipped bags that had minor defects: packaging defects, or lack of whole clusters (which were further broken down due to the cheaper vine shipping).<br /><br />So please bear with the reviews that complain about the packaging and lack of clusters (if they are Vine Voice reviews), this is not the case from paying customers (which I have since bought the three pack of other flavors).<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Also: amazon won't let me review the cinnamon flavor separately... only one review per item... odd.  But I got both flavors from Vine.  Here are the ingredients and nutritional info from the cinnamon (from the Kind website):<br /><br />Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds<br />Ingredients : Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, molasses, cinnamon, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate).<br />Vitamins and Minerals : Vitamin A (0% DV), Vitamin C (0%DV), Calcium (2% DV), Iron (6% DV)<br />Serving Size : 1/3 cup(29g)<br />Calories : 130<br />Fat Calories : 30<br />Total Fat : 3.5g<br />Saturated Fat : 0g<br />Trans Fat : 0g<br />Cholesterol : 0mg<br />Sodium : 20mg<br />Potassium :<br />Total Carb : 22g<br />Dietary Fiber : 5g<br />Sugars : 6g<br />Protein : 3g<br /><br />Both flavors were good, and I have been steadily purchasing these flavors and others ever since trying them.

review/summary: Great flavor, but watch ou for the calories
review/text: Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters taste excellent and can either be eaten on their own or mixed with yogurt.<br /><br />The clusters, though, never left me full, and I found it really easy to eat a lot of them without realizing it. 1/3 cup has 120 calories, so it's very easy for this to become a high caloric snack.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the number one thing Kind boasts about the product is that it has 5g of fiber. There are a lot of other ways to get more fiber with fewer calories. For example, 1/4 cup of kidney beans contains 14g of fiber (56% DV) and is only 70 calories.<br /><br />So I'd recommend the clusters, but you'll probably want to eat them with a measuring cup.

review/summary: More of a Tasty Topping vs. a Breakfast Option
review/text: Kind Healthy Grains never calls itself a cereal, which is probably a good thing. While it packs a lot of nutrition to start your day, two factors hold it back from being your new go-to item in the morning.  First, the taste is decent, but it works much more as an add-in like granola.  When mixed with yogurt or fruit, it does a great job of adding texture while not overpowering the other flavors.  Second, when you see for yourself how small each bag is, you realize how expensive of a product this is.  So even if you fell in love with the taste, most 99%ers would be hard-pressed to budget a bowl of it each morning.  If you're feeding a family of four, you'd be ordering more just about every other day.<br /><br />Our family was already familiar with the Kind bars and we really like them.  They come with most of the nutrition benefits but neither of the drawbacks that I outlined above.  We'll be sticking with them instead.

review/summary: granola with a mix of uncommon grains
review/text: The bulk granola normally available in most stores has limited types of grains and many use dairy in the ingredients, which is bad news for those allergic to dairy or who don't want dairy as part of a lifestyle choice.<br /><br />At first glance, yes, it is just another granola.<br /><br />Then I looked at the ingredients and was impressed with amaranth, quinoa, oates, millet and buckwheat.<br /><br />Also it held its crunchiness really well in soy milk, coconut milk, etc.<br /><br />When eating it like a cereal the dried blueberries became a little chewy, but the rest of the cereal remained crunchy.<br /><br />A great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />The blueberry flavor was strong, but the vanilla was hard to find when eating it as a snack. When put into milk, the vanilla seemed to come to life a bit more.<br /><br />The good quantity of fiber made me feel full for a good amount of time.<br /><br />The item is just sweet enough without being too sweet, thanks to cane juice and molasses.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />1/3 cup gives you one serving at 130 calories with 3g fat, 22g Carbs (5g Sugars and 5g Dietary fiber), plus 3g protein. There are approximately 11 servings in one bag. As healthy alternative to a fiber/grain bar as a pick-me up in the afternoon, use this snack instead.

review/summary: If you get it in the mail, the clusters will be broken down...
review/text: I got this bag in the mail and the first thing I noticed is that these clusters were more like tiny cereal bits, which I assume is being bounced around in the mail.  Second, my bag came with a hole in it, which I guess didn't affect the overall quality of the clusters. I feel these are two things a consumer needs to know about buying this item via the mail.  Other than that, the taste of the blend is pretty good.  I had it by itself, with milk and as a topping on my oatmeal and it tasted very good.  The fruit flavor is natural and sweet with the vanilla taste warm and inviting underneath.  All the ingredients are pretty wholesome for the most part, except for cane sugar, but at least that is a natural, non-processed sugar.  I feel the packs are overpriced for what they are.  My boyfriend and I ate the pack I got very fast, to account for how good the product is.  But we do make similar clusters as a snack in our home for a lot cheaper.  The Kind comes out to about 50 cents an ounce and I can make a great deal more of a honey/almond/fruit clusters for that much.  Even if I added flax seed and quinoa.  But needless to say, I really like the product a lot and if I had the money to spend $5.38 for a pack, I would.  It just is a bit high in price for my meager budget!

review/summary: Really good
review/text: This KIND healthy grains vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds granola is really good. The blueberry is subtle enough that it doesn't overpower the flavor, and the sugar is sweet, but not overly sweet. Plus it is not high-fructose corn syrup or anything like that, it is just regular cane sugar juice and vanilla extract. In fact, all of the ingredients in this are just regular ol' stuff that you've most likely heard of. It's printed right on the front of the package: "ingredients you can see & pronounce," and they mean it. Not only are the ingredients all just regular food, but you really can see all of them when you eat it. This stuff isn't coated in anything special to hide what it is, and it's not all ground up or anything into little pieces...it's all just right there and if you wanted to you could probably pick out all the different grains and stuff in it (gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa, flax seeds). All this results in a granola/cereal that you can feel good about eating because there isn't anything weird in it; it's all natural ingredients and you can see what it is you're eating. There are supposed to be 11 servings within each package (each serving is 1/3 cup). I probably had between two and three servings when I'd be eating this for breakfast and it was plenty. It is pretty filling and I'm a big guy. Recommended if you are a fan of eating granola or clusters for breakfast or snacks!

review/text: Pros: I appreciate that these grains are healthy and high in fiber.  It's also good that they are all natural, gluten-free, without GMO.  Nice sugar to fiber ratio.  Not too sweet.  Would be great as a yogurt topper if I ate much yogurt.<br /><br />Cons: The bag says clusters, but what I received was closer to powder.  There may have been a handful of clusters in the entire bag.  If they had been clusters, they would have made better snacks for the grandchildren.  What I had instead were granola sprinkles.  The cinnamon flavor was okay.  Also, the granola has a nutty, oily smell.  It isn't bad, per se, just unusual.  Too expensive in my opinion.<br /><br />I think I would like to try the blueberry and the peanut butter.

review/summary: Oxymoron?
review/text: While I consider the term "healthy grains" to be an oxymoron, this is perhaps one of the most healthy cereals being sold.<br /><br />The "clusters" are fairly small but still reasonable to eat with your fingers dry if you don't wish to eat this like a typical cereal in a bowl with a liquid poured on it.<br /><br />The sugar to fiber ratio is excellent (1:1).<br /><br />The grains are "good" grains (no wheat).  And while "evaporated cane juice" may not be a "refined sugar" it is still sugar, but in a small enough amount to be reasonable (as a guideline I try to consume at least as much fiber than sugar).<br /><br />The taste is good.  The texture is good.<br /><br />The "blueberry" is "blueberry puree" and gives just a hint of blueberry flavor.<br /><br />All in all a decent product, even though I advise against consuming grains.  For healthy eaters, these make a nice "change of pace".

review/summary: KIND of okay, actually
review/text: I'm a granola eater, big time. Bars, trail mix, thins, cookies, whatever, put granola in it, I'll eat it. I'd never had the opportunity to try the KIND brand, so I was glad to give this stuff a try. Right out of the package, I liked the cinnamon-sugar aroma and flavor, and I found the granola itself to be crunchy and tasty, without being overly sweet, cloying, or cereal-like. With the various seeds and quinoa mixed in, this was more like trail mix or cereal than clusters, but I didn't especially have a problem with it. I've heard flax seeds are healthy for you and I'd never had them before. For the most part, I'm okay with them, but some of the seeds don't break apart easily once they are in your mouth, and I had more than a few husks and hulls get stuck between my teeth and gums. Personally, I wasn't too happy about that, but other than that, taste was decent, texture was good, (this does make a nice texture enhancer in yogurt), and it appears to be higher protein and lower calorie than your average granola. So, this KIND snack is nothing outstanding and nothing terribly bad, earning a middle-of-the-road rating as an average-but-not-special product.

review/summary: Addictively good!
review/text: I love granola; the only thing that prevents me from eating it more often is the unfortunately high calorie/fat content.  Happily, these KIND Healthy Grains are actually quite reasonable--IF you are able to stick a single serving size, that is! ;)  One 1/3 cup serving (there are 11 per generous-sized bag, but it's still easy to overdo it) is only 120 calories, 3 grams of fat, and 5 grams (just 1 teaspoon!) of sugar.  There are also a bunch of healthy things in there:  5 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein, and 750 mg Omega-3.  Oh, and it's 100% whole grains and gluten-free, too!<br /><br />But the best part is that these grains tastes great!  There is a very strong vanilla flavor--I liked that this tasted natural, not artificial.  The blueberry flavor was more subtle, but it was detectable.  You could also see the flax seeds, although this was not necessarily a good thing (our digestive system can't process whole flax, so we lose the benefit unless the flax is ground).  Finally, I liked that as the name suggests, these grains actually WERE in large clusters, as least for about the first half of the bag (the second half were more broken up).<br /><br />Overall, I definitely enjoyed this product, and I think it's worth purchasing.

review/summary: Kind Review
review/text: This is the second flavor of this "Kind Healthy Grains" product I have reviewed for Amazon Vine, and again I must ask, what causes a food producer to avoid describing what appears to be granola as, well, granola?<br /><br />It makes me think of high-end audio receivers.  When their price soars above $1,000, they suddenly become "ampli-tuners," which apparently is a more palatable description to golden-eared audiophiles.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the negative implication of granola might be -- perhaps excess fat or high price.  This product eliminates the excess fat but unfortunately embraces the high price.<br /><br />As with the vanilla-blueberry flavor, these "cinnamon oat clusters" are made of amarinth, quinoa, oats, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds.  I don't see frankincense or myrrh listed, but at more than $5 for an 11-ounce package, they might be included.<br /><br />At any rate, these "clusters" are very tasty right out of the package.  Or you can eat them as cereal with milk or sprinkled on yogurt.<br /><br />So if you like granola but want to minimize your fat intake -- and you can afford the healthy cash outlay -- you might enjoy these "healthy grains."

review/summary: Yummy Sugary Fiber
review/text: "Ingredients you can see & prounounce..."  Okay, what exactly is amaranth and quinoa?  I've ridden a camel, been to a state fair and even penetrated Japanese prime ministerial security, but I can't say that I know what this stuff is.<br /><br />From the product page, it appears that the clusters are supposed to be little bite-size globs of vanilla blueberry goodness.  Unfortunately, when mine arrived in the Amazon.com book mailer, I only had two little cluster-like bits.  The rest was smashed and separated into bird seed.  I figure that clusters of this stuff would be pretty good, and make it a lot easier to eat this stuff "on-the-go!" as the package copy boldly exhorts.<br /><br />To its credit, the package opened right away, with the first pull, right along the top edge.  You'd be surprised how many packages can't get this right, like tortillas, beef jerky and lunch meat.  So, they had an advantage already.<br /><br />First came the sniff test: how does this stuff smell?  In general, it's kind of an industrial-neutral.  There is no cloying smell of artificial blueberry, which I was relieved not to smell.  There is the distinct and powerful scent of nothing but grain and seed, not salty or spicy, nor sugary sweet.  So far, the ingredients were in step with the package's copy.  There seemed to be just a hint of factory chemicals for the purposes of crunch or freshness or whatever.  I'm not saying that this is in the product, just that I seemed to discern that smell.<br /><br />So, I tried a third of this package in on-the-go mode, right out of the package.  Good stuff.  This would be a great product to bring along on a hike or a campout.  But, the bag's small size would make it awfully hard to share with any more than just a couple of people.  The taste was great, with very clear natural sweetness.  Very crunchy, but not that unpleasant brittle crunchiness you get with some foods.<br /><br />I then tried a third of the package in a little bit of milk, and it was just as good.  It stayed very crunchy for a good long time, all the way through eating it.  The density of it caused most of the product to sink to the bottom, so I had to bottom-feed with my spoon to get it all.<br /><br />Then I put the remaining third into some milk again, and sprinkled some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOWJQE">Equal</a> over the top.  Yeah, it was considerably sweeter, maybe even a little too much so.  Recommendation: do not sweeten this product any further.  Real sugar would make this stuff way too sweet.<br /><br />Taste.  The taste is in keeping with the smell, very grainy.  The taste of the blueberries is very subtle, as is the vanilla.  I could taste both, but it was subdued.  Overall, the taste was quite good.  Good texture, too.<br /><br />Nutrition.  Man, you're getting a lot of fiber here.  And there is a lot that this product doesn't have, as the package's front makes clear, like saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, etc.  That's pretty good.  But you're also not getting a lot of calcium, iron, or any Vitamin A or C.  While the package's front says there are no "refined sugars" in the product, the listed ingredients include official stand-ins/euphemisms for "sugar," like evaporated cane juice.  The product's serving size is a miniscule 1/3 of a cup, and this comes in at 120 calories.  So, a single package, which I ate for dinner, comes in at close to 1300 calories.  Great energy food, but not great for a Saturday morning cereal bender in front of the Cartoon Network.<br /><br />Price.  The unit price comes out to be more than $5/bag.  That's something like more than a dollar more than a big box of cereal (truth be told, the big boxes come out to about 13 oz, and this product comes in at 11 oz).  So, you'll get considerably more product for your money with regular boxed cereal.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a good product, and I enjoyed it.  The taste and texture is good.  But, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317EA46">Kashi</a> cereals, it's a bit too concentrated and a bit too spendy.

review/summary: Not bad at all
review/text: I ordered a bag and it works just fine on Greek yogurt.  It's light, not too sweet, and adds a good something to a yogurt product.<br /><br />The next day I had this product with skim milk.  It's not bad for breakfast.  Lots of granola products are very dry.  For some reason this product isn't dry at all and is fairly good.<br /><br />Now, I knocked off a star for the flax seed.  I'm not used to that seed and it left a different taste.  The oats, blueberries, and brown sugar was pleasant.  The flax is different, not bad, but different.<br /><br />Still, this is a good product and I will buy more.

review/summary: Decent, but didn't blow me away. Nom nom nom...
review/text: I like all kinds of granola. I like natural foods. I like things with fiber and anything that moves along the intestinal contents, well bonus!<br /><br />This has a good taste, but a weird smell. It does indeed have an oily smell (maybe the omega 3?). Couldn't really place what the smell was, but it's not one I'm used to. The product tastes really good though. I ate it both dry and in milk. It's delicious in 1% milk. Dry, it's OK - mine wasn't very cluster-y, so it was kinda hard to eat with just your hands.<br /><br />I like all the textures and flavors. It has just a hint of sweetness, but the sugar taste isn't overwhelming. Millet isn't something I'm used to seeing in my food, but it was good! My pet parakeets and cockatiel eat millet, so I let them try some, too.<br /><br />The price would probably steer me away from this product. It's good, but it doesn't stand out moreso than other granolas I've tried, taste-wise. I like it, but not enough to be buying it on a regular basis.

review/text: I am a `eat right out of the box" kinda guy, no milk. I eat quite a bit of granola, and I have tried this companies other very tasty and healthful products, so this sounded great.<br /><br />The taste was just OK. It had a slight chemical smell due to the packaging, and the blueberry was almost unnoticeable. The mouth feel came out with a nice crunch, but a little too oily as a aftertaste.<br /><br />But it's got a great list of good for you ingredients including flax,  and a good nutrition label. Nice fiber content, etc.<br /><br />Give it a try, if your tastes run to these things.

review/summary: Healthy Cereal
review/text: This is a lightly sweet, lightly flavored cluster oat cereal.  My husband likes granola so he tried to eat this cereal dry.  He said there wasn't much flavor to it when eaten that way.  It does taste better with milk.  There are clusters of oats and berries.  If you like sweet cereals, you will probably have to add sugar.  This is a very healthy cereal, though, high in fiber, omega 3 and gluten free.

review/text: I'm always a little wary of "health" food since a lot just doesn't taste good (at least, in my opinion), but these Cinnamon Oat Clusters were fantastic.  I snacked on them plain, but also ate them like cereal.  They don't get soggy in milk.  One thing though, which I think was related to my mailman cramming the package in my mailbox, there weren't many clusters (which is why I ended up eating this like cereal).  The resealable plastic bag is great for keeping them fresh, but not so great for protection during shipping.

review/summary: Great with cereal or apple sauce
review/text: I like the versatility of this granola pack. It's light enough to go on cereal or yogurt, but could also be a standalone snack. It tastes pretty good. The blueberries aren't full sized, or even like raisins, but rather like those preserved fruits you get in some types of cereals. It's still good, but I wouldn't recommend the pack if you're only buying it for the blueberry flavor. Another nice feature is that these grains are a bit softer than traditional granola, so it's not as crunchy to chew. Overall, not a bad choice to spice up your yogurt.

review/text: These are just delicious! It's crunchy and full of flavor. Kind remembers what granola actually is. They go great in a bowl with milk, or even better on top of frozen (or not) yogurt. It's also great eaten out of hand, but has a slight cereal-out-of-the-box quality.<br /><br />I don't get punched in the face with vanilla, but the vanilla I do get feels more authentic than a lot of snack foods. It's not an artisinal creation, by any means, but this is a new type of off-the-shelf snack food that hearkens back to real food made by real people. The ingredients are down to earth and the flavors deliver on the promise. This is good munching.

review/summary: Very tasty, fairly healthy, so-so value
review/text: I'll get the ugly out of the way first.  The 11 oz bag is rather small -- not much bigger than your hand.  It contains 11 1oz servings of 1/3 cup.  I could easily eat 1/2 a bag without really trying.  They are not really clusters as pictured, but crumbs like in a typical oat cereal.<br /><br />I don't have any special dietary requirements, but I do mind pretty carefully what I eat, so here's my review:<br /><br />Very tasty.  Much better than expected.  A little on the sweet side.  The cinnamon was not overpowering.  Very versatile as well.  You can eat it loose as a snack (although a bit messy the further down you get in the bag since there are few "clusters" -- more crumbs and dust).  You can also put it over yogurt or other dessert, or eat it with milk as a cereal.<br /><br />Nutritionally, I really like that it has whole grains which give it a nice texture, but not too hard to chew.  Refreshing compared to all those heavily processed foods out there.  Here are the Nutrition Facts per 1/3 cup 1oz serving:<br /><br />Calories: 130<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3.5g<br />Saturated/Trans: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg<br />Total Carb: 22g<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g<br />Sugars: 6g<br />Protein: 3g<br />Basically trace/minimal amounts of vitamins/everything else<br /><br />My "reference" cereal is GoLean Original which is 140 calories for 1 cup serving.  Compared to this, the GoLean has 13g of protein and 10g of fiber while being 3x the volume.  The Kind clusters do have more whole grains 16g (versus 8g) and 720mg of omega-3, so it is still fairly healthy, especially if considered a snack in its small portion size.<br /><br />The list price of over $100 is a joke.  Amazon's price in the mid-teens is fair, but it would be a lot more palatable if it was cheaper or with a subscribe-and-save.  The packaging seems to be trying to promote the KIND movement by the KIND CEO which I found as a weak sell and possibly only contributing to its higher price.

review/summary: Healthy AND tasty. Wow.
review/text: I'm happy to report that someone has finally figured out how to create a healthy snack that also tastes good. Once I opened the package, I literally could not keep my hand out of this bag of healthy grains. Composed of 100% whole grains and fruit, this snack is low in fat, high in fiber, and quite versatile. It tastes great by itself, mixed into yogurt, sprinkled over a fruit salad, or eaten with milk much like conventional cereal. Plus, a little goes a long way--it won't take much to fill you up. I'm pretty sure I have a new favorite snack!

It has just the right amount of sweetness that it could curb your craving for sweets, but also satisfy a snack urge. At 16.56 for 3 bags, it seems like a good price, at 16.56 for 3 bags for all natural, a very good price. I love the blueberries in this, they are soft not overly chewy like some dehydrated fruits. My only complaint is I would like more blueberries in this. Will definitely purchase!

review/summary: Rancid Product, Will Avoid KIND products
review/text: The Bag I received had a rancid ingredient in it. The Exp. date was 8/29/2012. Something made it through quality control. It is a product I would try again, though. There is a good ratio of protein to sugars. The bite I did have was mildly sweet, which I prefer.<br /><br />Update: I contacted the company about the product and provided the exp. date and batch information. They believe it could be due to storage and handling of the product. From the way I received the product I could see that as a possibility. When I get more information I will add that to my review.<br /><br />Update 11/28/11: Looks like customer service is either overworked or inept. I am guessing the later. As mentioned above, I sent a short email with the date and batch number. The response I received back asked for that information. I gave my address and after confirming a post-paid envelope was coming, I responded three weeks later saying I never received it. I received a response back saying he mailed it on 11/4. I emailed him my address on 11/7. I have no way to contact the CEO, so maybe the company is inept as well.<br /><br />Update 12/8/11: The customer service rep sent me another bag to try. Mind you, he is fully aware I am reviewing this product on amazon. The second product was slightly stale tasting. The clusters ranged from granola type flakes all the way to a 2x3 inch chunk. The taste varied by cluster the first one I had was bland, the second sweet and excessive with the cinnamon. Basically, this product should have never passed quality control. The only positive I can say is they communicated.<br /><br />I must recommend avoiding KIND snacks. A companies product is only as good as its organization in my opinion.

review/summary: Powdery
review/text: Clusters? I didn't get any clusters. A couple of residual clumps, but thanks to insufficient packaging, all I got was essentially a bag of powder.<br /><br />I'd attribute part of that to Amazon choosing to send me the single bag in nothing more substantial than a bubble mailer, but the factory packaging should be air-tight, and have enough air (well, nitrogen to keep it fresh) to survive a trip from Seattle to northwest Oregon. I could mail a bag of potato chips (of most major brands) and the chips ought to survive the trip intact.<br /><br />The powder tastes okay. But crushed that much, I can't really consider this a snack anymore. I am very disappointed.<br /><br />Maybe I'll try some from the grocery store where I can make sure it's not already crushed, and then transport it myself in a suitable fashion, but even if it turns out to be good, I can't recommend buying it from Amazon unless they find a better way to ship it than a bubble mailer. I can't believe anyone could have thought that was a good idea!

review/summary: It's Good Granola
review/text: While the label may describe this product as cinnamon oat clusters, my meat-eating palate recognizes this as granola.  I happen to like granola, so that's not a bad thing, and I recognize that the words cinnamon oat clusters carries with it significantly more cachet than does the word 'granola.'  My review of this treat - First the Good:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*  Taste - This is good-tasting stuff and happens also to be good for you.  While it does have some sugars added, it is in the form of evaporated cane juice and molasses and it seems to me there is just a pinch of it, adding only a hint of sweetness which is not overpowering.  Sugars weigh in at 6g per serving.  The grains are tasty, fresh, and crunchy.<br /><br />*  Simple Ingredients - This is important to me, as I prefer to be able to pronounce the names on the ingredients list.  This is packed with grains:  oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa.  Other ingredients include flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, molasses, cinnamon, sea salt, and vitamin E in the form of D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate.  OK, so I could pronounce most of it<br /><br />*  Fiber - As you would suspect of this kind of food, it is all about fiber:  fully 5g of dietary fiber according to the label, per 1/3 cup serving.  That's pretty good, in my book.<br /><br />*  Satisfying - This reviewer prefers this for breakfast, either with milk or mixed in with fruit yogurt, and it keeps me full and satisfied through lunch.  It is healthy and filling.<br /><br />Mixed:<br /><br />*  Aroma - The aroma of this is much like the aroma of most bags of grain:  earthy and slightly musty smelling.  That's not a bad thing.  It's just that this reviewer does not find it particularly mouth-watering.  There is the faintest hint of cinnamon, but to me it smells much like a sack of brown rice or like most of the granola I've ever eaten.<br /><br />*  Feel Good Message - I've got mixed feelings about this.  Ordinarily, the packaging or the company of a product doesn't get a mention when I'm reviewing a product - it's always about my experience with the product itself.  In this case, however, the product is inextricably tied to a message from the company:  KIND LLC.  I am always appreciative of companies whose founders or owners direct the company toward social or environmental good and indeed I am drawn towards those products that also contribute towards causes I believe in.  At the same time, I understand that companies' primary aim is to make profit and a feel good message becomes part of the marketing campaign; I believe that doing good comes from one's character and upbringing, not what one sees on the bottom of a product's packaging.  In this case it is 'Kinding Mission #99...'  Does this affect my rating?  No, but this reviewer thinks it is worth a mention.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br /><br />I enjoyed this product and found it to be tasty, fresh, and healthy.  Yet I struggled with my rating, wanting to give it between three and four stars - ultimately giving it the benefit of the doubt at four.  Why?  Because as tasty as this was, it was still no more tasty or healthy or fresh as many other granola that I have tried, including the very best I've had:  that made in my very own oven.  So basically, despite the message of kindness toward others and the earth, at the end of the day it is just granola.<br /><br />A quick word about bias, as that enters into any review where preference comes into play.  I am neither vegan nor exclusive carnivore.  While I like eating meat, I don't eat it for every meal and endeavor to replace as much of it as I can on a regular basis with fresh vegetables and grains.  While I like this product, it seems to me that it is seeking a niche in a crowded market, where granola is basically a commodity.  As such, value needs to be considered with competing products that are basically equivalent.  I mention this because there is so much excellent healthy granola out there, so price should be considered when shopping.

review/summary: Feh
review/text: I've got nothing new to say here; I'll just pile on with the rest.<br />The texture is ... friable. It's loose granular granola. The clusters have de-clustered. This doesn't bother me.<br />The acrid aroma does bother me. It smells like a drying oil portrait. In other words, like rancid linseed. This odor accompanies each spoonful down your gullet. If you care about healthy-eating things, you wonder about the oxidative-stress, anti-health effects of rancid fats as you finish your bowl, because this stuff is expensive and there's no way you're gonna waste it, free radicals or not.<br />Several have commented on the price. Note that it's gluten-free. If you had to eat gluten-free all the time (and I do), you'd be accustomed to this kind of gouging: $6 loaves of bread, $7 frozen pizzas, and now, $6, 11-oz bags (that's about 3 or 4 bowls IRL) of gluten-free granola. "Gluten-free," translated into English, means "Give me your money."  Celiacs' diets are limited to what's available, and a lot of it isn't very satisfying.<br />Fortunately there are many other less expensive and less rancid tasting cereals/granolas available.<br />Because I feel sort of bad for KIND, I will say here that I like their nut- and fruit-based bars very much.<br />[You may or may not be interested in the following: Oats by themselves are gluten-free. However, commercial oats sold on the world market are extensively contaminated with gluten-containing wheat, rye and barley, and are therefore not suitable for a gluten-free diet - this includes grocery store oatmeal and products made with oats. However, in the past 8 or so years, oats have been grown in dedicated fields using scanned seeds, and the crop tested for gluten. These are known in the celiac world as "gluten-free oats." These GF oats cost about five times as much as regular oats, and are the type used in KIND, friable, cinnamon-linseed granola.]

This was a nice find as it tastes good and is a healthy alternative to super sugary breakfast cereals.  There are only 6g of sugar in a serving (1/3 cup) which is great! The flax seeds provide omega-3s, which seems to be quite the buzz word among the foods folks these days.  I haven't had this with yogurt, but would imagine that it would be quite good.  Be sure to not make the mistake I did and think it would also be a good dry snack to keep in my desk... it's just too messy without a bowl a spoon.  I would recommend it!

review/text: One of my granola bags had a hole in it! So the granola came out in the packaging. I am happy with them because I have never had this happen before but this one time, it did.

review/summary: Good As Cereal
review/text: Having recently had to go gluten-free, I was thrilled to find this.  Unfortunately, I found it to have a "weird" aftertaste, so I don't care for it as an eat-out-of-hand snack.  It is pretty tasty as cereal, though (topped with milk and eaten with a spoon) - the aftertaste isn't evident when it's eaten this way.  And the cinnamon is good to eat with the the carbs, to help balance blood sugar.

review/text: These crunchy clusters are very healthy, with flax, oats, and other good products, and they taste good too. The price seems a little steep to me, otherwise I'd buy them more often. Excellent healthy snack product otherwise.

review/summary: Big Chunks; Kids Love; A+!
review/text: Given a choice, my daughter would eat nothing but Goldfish crackers, so we are always looking for healthy snack alternatives. This does the trick! She loves this plain or on yogurt (calcium! protein! probiotics! yes!). and even after the bag has been opened, the contents don't crumble to smithereens like the store brands tend to do. The only downside is the struggle to keep the rest of the family from devouring the bag during midnight pantry raids. Fortunately, it comes in a pack of 3. Don't hesitate to give this a try!

review/summary: low sodium, high flavor
review/text: This meat tenderizer is flavorful without being too spicey! It has no salt and tenderizes meat well. My husband has Diabetes,high blood pressure and heart disease so you can imagine how happy I was to find this product! I printed off the product info for my husband's dietician so she could let others know about it! Product comes in a very large bottle and has no sprinkle top so you might want to put it in a shaker to dispense. Price is VERY reasonable and spices are fresh! It's great in meatloaf, and I add it to meat when I cook it in the crockpot. If you need to lower your salt intake don't miss this product! Can also be used just for seasoning!

review/summary: Very Tasty Beef Jerky!
review/text: This is quite possibly the best tasting beef Jerky I have ever eaten. It has a very tasty peppered flavor. High quality lean beef is used so there's almost no sign of fat. You don't get that annoying leftover ball of fat to chew on afterward like you get with most beef jerky. And if you ever do, it's an extremely tiny ball of fat. This jerky is pricy but well worth the money. If you have someone to go in on 2 packages with you, you'll only be charged one shipping fee. That's what my friend and I did. We are ordering it again.

review/summary: Gentlease has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula
review/text: A good way to start shopping for this product is to call Enfamil to see their current pricing, keeping in mind any differences in can size and number of cans in a case. I have purchased this product through Enfamil, Amazon and a few other places, always taking advantage of the best deals.<br /><br />Next... The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age. But here in the U.S. after your 3 months maternity leave, are you able to pump enough and store in a refrigerator at work? And you might need formula anyway as we do. I mention this because some imply their formula is as good as human breast milk.<br /><br />We're blessed with twins. They started out colicky and we found that Nutramigen worked at that time. They got through that phase and we've been using Gentlease and solids. After they're a year old it will be all solids. Our pediatrician recommended Gentlease. It has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula.<br /><br />I really researched formulas. There are even organizations promoting the sale of human breast milk and there are organizations wanting to stop the sale of human breast milk for fear of health hazards that the FDA cannot control. No matter, those offering breast milk do so at prohibitively high prices - nothing charitable about it.<br /><br />All the brands that I've seen have DHA and ARA, nutrients found in breast milk that promote brain and eye development, iron which is necessary for growth and many more ingredients. The government requires them to have certain ingredients. The major brands do not seem highly differentiated to me except for their specialy models. Gentlease is one of those. I have purchased Gentlease in different size cans and cases and am still using it with my twins.<br /><br />Gentlease is one of the special formulas because it has a much lower amount of lactose as well as broken down proteins to make it easier to digest.<br /><br />The prices vary and so do the size of the cans and the number of cans in a case. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Gentlease in big cans at the big box stores. One can also check at the local pharmacy or grocery store for comparison purposes. Keep an eye out for coupons too. You've got to keep constant watch for the best price, and there have been times when the Amazon price prevails.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: My newborn was very uncomfortable with regular formula (scalding skin burns on his anus, screaming and clutching his stomach after eating).  Although not lactose intolerant (he was not throwing up the formula) he is lactose sensitive.  This formula is wonderful.  He has been gaining weight and has no more discomfort.  He loves it and I can also feel good about the fact that he is still getting a milk based formula.  A wonderful product - I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Get a sample from your child's pediatrician
review/text: I was given a sample of Gentleease for our daughter, who's been having gastro-intestinal issues, but she refused to drink it. No matter how hungry she was, or how long we would try, she'd refuse to drink this formula. As the other 1-star reviewer noted: This stuff tastes nothing like regular enfamil. So, before you go and buy, check with your baby's pediatrician to see if they have a sample available at their office.

review/summary: My son totally rejected it - Tastes awful
review/text: The pediatrician told us to try the Gentlease Enfamil since our son was a little gassy but he totally rejected it.<br /><br />We even tried a couple times to mix it with the regular Enfamil he was used to (he was having it for a month) but it only took him seconds to taste the Gentlease Enfamil and spit it out.<br /><br />We tried it ourselves and in fact it tastes completely different from the regular Enfamil and also from the Similac that we still had at home. None of them taste good, but this is one is really awful!<br /><br />Maybe he was so used to the regular Enfamil that he wouldn't take it no matter how it tastes but the fact is I was totally disappointed with this product.<br /><br />By the way, since he refused to take it, we simply don't know if it would help him or not with gases.

review/summary: I Love Italian Torrone Candy
review/text: I have been crazy about Italian Torrone Candy ever since our friends brought some back from Italy to my family in the 1950's!  Back then, as a child, I was "hooked" on it after my first bite!  It is not easy to find it in stores, unless you go to an ethnic market in a large city.<br />That thin film on the outside is part of the candy and is edible.  If you are not used to it, I could understand how it would seem strange, or "suspect."<br />I wish I could order more of it, but the price really gets expensive when you have to pay for the shipping too.<br />I would love to find a store that sells it, because I would buy a "ton" of it, and avoid those shipping charges!
