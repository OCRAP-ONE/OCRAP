review/summary: Grill Alert Talking Remote Thermometer
review/text: What a disappointment! Bought last season, worked great (used about 6-8 times). Started up today 3.17.12,  placed nice piece of King Salmon on the grill and the transmitter kept saying that the temperature was 199 degrees and the voice kept saying it was ready. I thought, maybe (the first side I cooked before turning it on) did cook through. Took it off the grill and it was sushi raw inside. I tried everything (in book) to reset, (as my salmon is cooking). After reading all the reviews, the probe cable must have failed. I just was able to rescue the fish in time, cooked the old fashioned way. CANNOT TRUST THIS BECAUSE IT IS NOT RELIABLE, LET ME DOWN. TOO BAD, WHEN IT DID WORK, IT WAS AMAZING!

review/summary: Worked great, at first
review/text: When the unit was working, I loved it! Unfortunately, it stopped working after 4 or 5 turkeys. Supposedly you can buy replacement probes for ~$20, but I don't see why I would continue to invest in something that clearly fails for so many people, and after only a few uses. In the trash it goes...

review/summary: 3 Years & Still Works Great
review/text: I received this as a gift back in 2008 and it still works great. I take the batteries out of it between uses and store it in the box it came in.  I use it about once a month when I am cooking a roast on the grill.  Once in a while if I haven't used it for two or three months I have to re-set it so the probe communicates with the receiver, but that's rare.  I think it is a bit on the pricey side but for me I have no problems or anything negative to say.

review/summary: Saw it, loved it, bought it, still love it
review/text: Went to a friends house for a BBQ and he had one he used on the rib eye steaks. He clipped it to his belt and was told by a lovely voice that the meat was almost ready.  We went to the BBQ and within a couple of minutes we were told again the meat was ready.  These steaks were perfect at med-rare.  When I got home I went directly to the computer and looked it up and ordered it.  My first use was a chicken on the rotisserie.  I had to place the probe in each time I wanted to check it so the wire would not wind around the chicken, but the chicken was perfect when this device said it was ready.  Will be buying more to give to family for Christmas.

review/summary: Reliable and Convenient
review/text: I have used this for the past year with a smoker and have been very pleased with accuracy, ease of use, and terrific convenience. I smoke and grill through the winter and it is important to not open the grill/smoker often. This really helps. With the smoker it doubles both to know the smoker temperature early in the cooking process then insert into meat later to monitor that temperature.<br /><br />The advance warning of food being nearly done and seeing rate of temperature change, especially when it is cold and rainy and extends cooking time, is particularly convenient.

review/summary: quite accurate; not very flexible
review/text: We received one of these as a gift (I didn't purchase it through Amazon). It has only once failed to be spot-on accurate (that one time, it let the meat overcook; it may have been because I changed cooking temp several times). It has once or twice been a bit finicky about sync'ing the base receiver with the remote transmitter, but it always sync'ed up after turning both off and back on.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that it doesn't allow selection of the final temp. I appreciate that they don't want me to be eating raw poultry, but I sometimes need the cooking temp to be a bit lower (or higher) than the settings available, and for pork and poultry, there's only "well done". This means I have to watch the temp myself, so not terribly convenient. Still, as I mentioned before, it's been very accurate, and the results are exactly what you would want. It's much more likely that my dinner will come out as intended than when I estimate based on experience, which is sometimes not sufficient if I'm cooking something unfamiliar, such as a huge roast.<br /><br />Overall, a good product (so far - I haven't had mine fail, yet), if a bit expensive compared with other similar products.

review/text: My parents bought this for me for my birthday a couple of years ago. I only used it for grilling about 4 times. I grilled with charcoal and I was nervous about using it around that much heat. I had no cause to be because it performed perfectly. The last time I remember using it was to test to see that my freezer and 'fridge were at the right settings. I just got a George Foreman indoor/outdoor grill and thought it would be perfect with that. I found the probe but I can't find the receiver! It must still be in the 'frige in my old apartment! I have no clue. But I am going to buy another one! Sorry mom and dad!

review/summary: Works!
review/text: It works very well, and I like the intonation of the voice - very loud and emphatic, not mealy-mouthed or chirpy like others I have tried.  I have also found a number of other uses, since this is basically just a thermometer that happens to talk.  Need a monitor for your compost temp?  Or your chicken coop?  Or your egg incubator?  Works like a charm!<br /><br />You must simply learn how to interpret the voice.  If it says, "Your Entr&eacute;e is Ready!", then your potatoes au gratin gruyere are done to perfection.  If it says, "Almost Ready!", then your baby's diaper needs changing.  Want to know if your poodle has a fever?  Nothing better.  (Be careful, they seem to want to strongly object, at first.)  I do not recommend it for the cat, however.  Apparently, the unfamiliar voice discomfits them.

review/text: About 40% packets had no sugar in them and a bunch others were open and leaking. The sugar grains were clumpy and in some packets stuck into a square mass. The product seemed old and not freshly packed as I have noticed the fair trade packets to be in for example the local Starbucks locations. The product is not returnable hence a total waste of the $30, since our aim was to have received a fresh tasting and looking batch of sugar in packets to serve to our clients. Do not recommend to anybody. Would prefer our money back but there seems to be not way of requesting it through returns center. Not buying grocery items from Amazon any more. Too risky!

Everyone is being paid fairly for their labors and its not coming out of MY pocket!  I felt it was win win for the sugar workers and for me...  Until I started feeling like something was weird.  Every morning when I would make my coffee, it would never taste the same even though I always put 3 sugar packs in.  It slowly dawned on me that every single pack has a totally different amount of sugar in it!!!!!!!!  Some packs had about 20 grains (literally!!!) and some were so full, they burst when I tore them open.  WHat the (*&@!#(*!&@?!??!  Who does this? I started thinking that maybe the people who made the sugar were OVERPAID for their efforts and smoking a little too much hashish.  Although the taste of the sugar was great...

It will go to a little stream like if you do not pump enough or at the end of your spray.  But it works every time I get it out the the cabinet.<br /><br />The major selling point was that I can recycle the bottle when done.  AND it is SOY FREE!!!!  That was the major reason for wanting this.  They put soy in everything and when you don't want to eat soy you tend to pay more.<br /><br />I have this on subscribe and save and will continue to use it as long as it is made.  Excellent buy.

Perfect for salad dressings, sauteing, baking, etc. There's nothing I wont use this oil in. Another plus is the sleek packaging, You can leave it on your counter for display.

review/summary: Good, but the pumping mechanism is a bit hit and miss
review/text: I've been using Pam for years, but decided to start using an olive-oil-based cooking spray since I'm trying to move to more all-natural products. Originally, I was going to order a mister that I would put my own olive oil in, but the reviews for the ones I looked at were all pretty hit and miss, so I decided to get this instead.<br /><br />While it works well when you first start squirting it out, if you haven't pumped it enough, it will suddenly stop misting and send out a big squirt of oil in one spot.  I don't want to overpump it since I know that can cause problems, too, so I'm still trying to play with this to see what the magic number seems to be.  It seems as if six or seven pumps will set me up for most of my spraying needs.<br /><br />Also, I had been hoping that it could replace Pam, and it really can't; it's not good for getting things to not stick to your pans.  I'm not marking stars off for that since it's not advertised as being a cooking spray, but more because the pumping mechanism is so spotty.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good product, but, as I mentioned in my review title, the pumping mechanism is a bit hit and miss for me.

review/text: I love the bar, this bar packs a lot in a small bar.  My issue isn't with the product, but with the pricing from the merchant.  I originally thought I was buying a box of 12 not 6.  I wouldn't have purchased from this vendor if I knew it was for 6 bars.  Obviously my mistake, but one that I won't make again.

review/summary: Nice old fashioned sandwich bags
review/text: How do you review a brown lunch sandwich bag?  To start - it's large enough for an overstuffed sandwich.  I love the crinkle sound of the bag, it holds a crease at the top.  It is going to make the same old sandwiches seem to take on a new life with this new bag - nostalgic. It will be good to put muffins I bake in the 'donut hole maker' into this for quick grab snacks.  This won't cause any moisture mushiness like a plastic wrap will.  No waxy feel - all biodegradable.  I like it.<br /><br />UPDATE Sept 13: I've been using these bags since they arrived...they are wonderful.  My brother gives them 5 stars.  I make him 2 sandwiches a day, one for breakfast and one for lunch.  When he returns home, I notice he carefully folds the bags up for me to reuse.  I can use the same 2 bags, every day, for a week without a problem.  They are sturdy and hold up well.  Even with crinkles in the paper, they still hold a good crease.  I make the sandwiches the night before and they don't dry out nor become soggy in the fridge over-night or until his last sandwich at lunch.  I notice when I use plastic wrap or foil he throws those away...these bags are nicely folded and brought back home, so I guess they are a money-saver in the long run.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug 22, 2012:  It's been a year since first trying these bags.  I've upped the stars from 4 to 5 stars.  I absolutely love this product.  It's come in handy for so many things.  It works almost like parchment paper, too.  I've baked in these for wrapped meals, knowing it is all safe against foods.  Tomorrow I'm trying large diced potatoes, cheese and bacon put into the bag - pop into an oven and bake about 45 minutes at 350, top with fresh green onions (scallions).  So many uses for these bags.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug 23, 2012: Do not use these as a substitute for parchment paper.  When I cooked the potatoes in the bag with cheese and bacon - the cheese stuck!  I think it would have been okay had I not used cheese.  I invested in their parchment paper: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZIC8I">If You Care 100% Unbleached Silicone Parchment Paper, 70-Foot Roll (Pack of 4)</a> and will use this either alone or added into the sandwich bags when I bake with them.  The sandwich bags did hold up well in a 425 degree toaster oven.<br /><br />**I LOVE their paper cupcake liners.  I have the large and Jumbo. (large equals a standard sized muffin cup)  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAIR96">If You Care Unbleached Large Baking Cups, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>  NOTHING sticks to these at all.  Your baking cup paper will peel right off of your cupcakes and muffins with ease, never tearing at even the most delicate cakes. I give a box for a little gift when visiting.  These are the best and with the initial investment you won't be buying them for a long time.  The brown paper is excellent for us adults who are tired of fake inks and cutesy flowers...the color is very becoming and stays the same before and after the oven.  I love the "If You Care" brand.

review/summary: Earth-friendly option for sandwich lunch
review/text: I previously purchased Natural Value Unbleached Wax Sandwich bags which I will give points for being longer (7 13/16" over 7 1/2") than this brand If You Care. This is slightly more expensive per bag, but I think the If You Care brand is a better quality paper. Overall, I like the feel of this bag better as it feels more like paper, less waxy. It also seems thicker and more durable. In the past 6 years I've used a "Laptop Lunch" system, but now that my daughter is in Middle School with no locker access it's become necessary to pack as light as possible. She has to cross the entire campus a few times before lunch and carries a lot of materials making a Laptop Lunch impractical and likely "less cool". I refuse to do plastic bags so this is our compromise. At least I know it's the best choice we can make. I would recommend these bags.

review/summary: Work better than described
review/text: These paper sandwich (or snack) bags perform better than described.  Our sandwiches stayed fresh for 8 hours and probably would have stayed fresh even longer.  As long as the fold is creased well (such as running a fingernail over the crease), the fold stays shut.  Even better, make a well creased fold across the top and then fold in the corners a bit too.  I like that they are unbleached and better for the environment than plastic baggies - especially for an item that is usually used just once and then thrown away.  Bonus that the paper is slightly more rigid than plastic bags so our sandwiches were less likely to get all squished.

In my opinion Red Star is the best yeast out there, but not always available at my supermarket and you can't beat the price,1 pounds for $7.95 sure beats $8.99 for a 4 ounce jar at the supermarket

review/summary: Earthy, Grassy, Mild Green Tea
review/text: *****<br />Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is a premium Numi tea. It is a low-caffeine green tea, is certified organic, and is kosher. It is very earthy and mild, and it seems that in general people either love it or they hate it. I think that people who will enjoy this will be those who like subtle flavors and earthy, grassy teas. I think it's a great green tea!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Our whole leaf Temple of Heaven - Gunpowder Green Tea is gently steamed within hours of being plucked, then skillfully hand rolled into small tight pearls. This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas. Steeped in hot water, the leaves unfurl, releasing a well-rounded, full-bodied flavor. Rich in fluoride, calcium, and anti-oxidants - and with very little caffeine - this is a perfect choice to greet the evening."<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

While it will never compare to loose-leaf, it's the closest you can get.  Just be sure to steep it for 2-3 minutes, no more, no less.  If you keep the bag in after that time has passed you will only be tasting tannins, as with all green tea.

review/text: Gunpowder tea is supposed to have a delicate flavor and emit a smokey bouquet that does not interfere with the taste.<br /><br />Numi gets the delicate flavor. Unfortunately, there is no aroma to their version. This improves if the drinker tears open the tea bag and steeps Numi's offering as loose-leaf, or if the drinker tries to go the "whipped tea" route, but the experience is still only about half there.<br /><br />Three stars out of five: if you want gunpowder with a less intense experience, go for Numi. If you want the full shot, seek out Twinings.

review/text: After reading the many glowing reviews for this tea, I just have to come forward and voice my support for JS's review. Almost completely devoid of aroma and flavor, the only thing letting me know I wasn't drinking plain hot water is the dark golden color of the liquor. So, clearly, there's SOMETHING there, but not a heck of a lot. Gunpowder green tea is one of the most intense and aromatic Chinese green teas; it should have an aroma of burnt wood and a charred flavor that is lightly vegetal. I expected much more based on the price of the tea, the fact that it's full leaf, and all these positive reviews.

Both scales reflected a weight of 14 ounces. That is certainly not the 16 ounces, (a pound), that I paid for so I was not happy. Two ounces do not seem like a lot to be concerned about, but you should get what you pay for when you order from a company by weight.

The center portions of each stick was softer.  Disappointing purchase.

review/text: I bought these to put into a cake recipe [...].  They are flavorful yet not too overpowering and went well in the cake.  They are tasty enough to just eat by themselves - not very bitter and smooth overall.  Their small, flat size made them easy to melt and measure as well.

review/summary: Cinnamon Fresh Cream Truffles with Cinnamon
review/text: This year I took a chance on this chocolate. I normally use a block<br />of chocolate but the callets are so much easier to work with and<br />melt even more easily. The one kilogram bag is enough to make<br />one recipe of truffles. You will have some left over for chocolate<br />chip cookies.<br /><br />Ingredients: unsweetened chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, natural<br />vanilla flavor. May contain traces of milk protein.<br /><br />Here is the recipe I made up for chocolates during<br />the holiday season. The addition of cinnamon is really delicious.<br /><br />Fresh Cream Truffles with Cinnamon<br /><br />A double boiler is not recommended for melting the chocolate. Use your crockery cooker for the best results. The creamy ganache (ga-nosh) is dipped in melted chocolate and should be stored in the refrigerator. Bring the truffles to room temperature an hour before serving.<br /><br />Ganache<br /><br />6 ounces Callebaut semisweet chocolate callets<br />3/4 cup whipping cream<br />1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />1 teaspoon Saigon cinnamon<br /><br />Dipping Chocolate<br /><br />1 pound Callebaut semisweet chocolate callets<br />Parchment paper<br /><br />2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar<br />1 teaspoon cinnamon<br /><br />1.  Place the 6 ounces chocolate in a medium sized bowl.<br /><br />2.  Heat the cream just until it comes to a boil. Pour over<br />  chocolate. Stir until the chocolate melts. Cool to 90 degrees.<br /><br />3.  Cream all the butter in a deep bowl with a wooden<br />  spoon. Stir  in tablespoonfuls of cooled chocolate,<br />  beating well after each addition. Mixture should be<br />  creamy. If the butter starts to melt, the chocolate is<br />  still too warm. Lastly, stir in the vanilla and cinnamon.<br /><br />4.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br />  Fit a piping bag with a size 807 decorating tip. Pipe a<br />  round the size of a quarter onto parchment paper,<br />  start piping second level then lift. Place in the freezer<br />  to chill for 20 minutes.<br /><br />5.  Place the one pound dipping chocolate in a 6-quart crockery<br />  cooker, heat on low. Stir a few times until all chocolate<br />  has melted. Turn cooker off when chocolate<br />  has melted. The temperature should not go above<br />  120 degrees. Pour chocolate into a medium bowl.<br /><br />8.  Mix the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon together.<br />  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br />  Use a truffle fork to dip chocolates. When all<br />  chocolates have been dipped use a sifter to sprinkle<br />  cinnamon confectioners' sugar over truffles.<br /><br />9.  Place truffles in the freezer for 20 minutes to set<br />  chocolate. Then, keep them in the refrigerator until<br />  about an hour before serving.<br /><br />Happy Holidays!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Excellent Chocolate
review/text: I use this chocolate for special occasions when I need a great tasting chocolate ganache for cakes or cookies, or to make truffles.  The small pieces melt easily and the chocolate is not temperamental to work with.  It tastes very pleasant - it is not bitter, but has a nice rounded flavor (which also makes it easy to eat straight out of the bag!)  I store my chocolate in a cool dark place, or frozen.  I had one bag I misplaced for approximately 9 months, but noticed no changes or degradation in the product.

review/summary: World's Finest Earl Grey
review/text: Williamson, previously Williamson & Magor, make a rich, well blended Earl Grey with a deep delicate spicy flavor that is without equal.  I used to think that Harrod's No. 42 Earl Grey was the best I had tasted.  It is, however, unavailable in the US, and must be purchased in Britain.  Some Internet research uncovered that it is blended for Harrod's by Williamson, so I tracked down their Earl Grey which was then avaliable on two US websites.  It is even better than Harrod's.  Harrod's Earl Grey, by the way, is best purchased as you leave the UK.  There is a Harrod's store in the international departure area at Heathrow - they do not charge the 18% VAT.  Willaimson reorganized last year and their tea was supposedly unavailable in the US, so its appearance on Amazon - and with Amazon Prime elegibility - is more than welcome.  This is the finest.<br />Another fact: Williamson is reputed to blend the tea for the Royal Family in Britain.<br />Some added thoughts: I did a little research on the Williamson website.  They now grow their tea on their own farms in the hioghlands of Kenya.  Undoubtedly the superior flavor of the tea comes from the quality of the base tea.  They mention picking only the bud and first two leaves.  That cannot be beat.  Some teas are the first three; Argentine tea (known for being some ofthe world's worst) is "harvested" with a machine that looks like a hedge trimmer.  Any leaves past the first three have no tea flavor.  So excellent harvesting is a laborious hand process.

It has a wonderful aroma and great flavor.  As you can well imagine we drank a great deal of tea while she was here.  I can see the pretty teapot on the coffee table with a small plate of sliced lemons (she loves lemon in her tea, I like mine plain) as we drank out of china teacups and chatted about our day.  I was so delighted when I found your site and was able to renew my waning supply.

review/text: As a child born in the 80s and growing up in the 90's this was always my favorite lunchbox snack. The flavors are delicious and the texture isn't like some gummies that get stuck in your teeth or gummies that are too soft. Everyone seems to favor the white "mystery" flavor sharks, but grape will always be my personal favorite. I continue to buy these now that I'm adult. I only wish they made "adult size" pouches, because now that I am older, the pouches seem like they've gotten smaller!

review/summary: Puroast Low Acid Coffee Colombian--DON'T
review/text: I'm usually pleased with recommendations from consumers on amazon, but this one was off by a mile. If you're a regular serious colombian coffee drinker and decaf and instant would never do--you're going to be greatly disappointed. I gave my 5lb bag away to a neighbor who is used to drinking stale instant. For me, this took me back to the days of managing psychiatric facilities where coffee wasn't even instant decaf--it was something horrible called "postum" (I think) that didn't even resemble coffee. Heck, I would have rather drank ground-up post-it notes and old cardboard than this stuff. I tried everything, even mixing it in with regular colombian coffee--no go. My advice, don't waste the money, purchase papaya enzyme tablets and tums instead, bulk up on the nexium, but just don't go near Puroroast. Buy the real leaded coffee, instead.

review/summary: Exceptionally high quality dog food - best on the market
review/text: Blue Buffalo Wilderness is a virtually pure protein dogfood.  It's free of any additives or junk.  It's also free of all those grains and carbs that they fill up other dog foods with -- like corn (which dogs can't digest anyway), soy, etc.  If you have a dog who is diabetic (and lately diabetes is as much an epidemic among dogs as it is among people), Blue Buffalo is essential to you.  Since we started our 6 year old diabetic pug on Blue Buffalo Wilderness, his blood glucose levels have stabilized, he has lost weight, his overall health has improved and he has more energy.  Prior to finding this dog food we had been making his food ourselves and with two other dogs and two cats, that ain't easy!  Thank you Blue Buffalo for creating a product that diabetic canine parents can give their dogs without worrying about a bad impact on our dog's health.<br /><br />And, please ignore the poor review left for this product which was actually a criticism of Amazon's packaging.  That is an inappropriate product review -- it has NOTHING to do with the quality of this product and should not be posted at all.

review/summary: Taste is just ok - more importantly, are they really organic?
review/text: Today I received my order of Goji berries - strangely, they were packaged inside another shipper that appeared to be direct from the distributor (Organic Nectars) - but they arrived in good order and as promised.<br /><br />The taste of the berries straight out of the bag is somewhat unremarkable. The label states "sweet, chewy and fragrant" but I would just barely rank them with marks in any of those categories. At first I thought I was missing something - these little red nubs received great reviews on other sites and postings and I just didn't see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />I did a little digging on the internet and discovered that there is some grey area between a wolfberry (Chinese in origin) and the goji berry (Tibetan, purportedly), leading me to wonder which exactly these were? Also, neither Amazon nor the Organic Nectars site specifically promises that these berries are organic (another concern highlighted on other sites), even though the label indicates they were "grown and harvested in pesticide-free Tibetan valleys". I probably ate two handfuls of them and my lips were tingling; this often happens if I don't wash peaches or nectarines well enough before eating (two fruits rated very high on the Environmental Working Group's pesticide watch for produce). I didn't experience any other effects, adverse or beneficial although I read that goji berries contain a compound that can increase the risk of bleeding for folks who take warfarin or other blood thinners so please exercise mindful caution if you fall into that population before eating the berries or having them in other preparations.<br /><br />I'll continue to eat them and will try some of the other suggested methods of preparation (tea, shakes, oatmeal) but I'm not sold on the idea of these as a "superfruit" or "superfood" just yet.

This one was distinct with added dried cabbage, etc.; dried chicken (I think), and a thick, dark mystery sauce that is added at the end, and while it is not gourmet, it does its job. Cover is pulled almost halfway back, veggies are added on side, and lukewarm water is added to fill line. Nuke it for five minutes, let sit for one, add sauce, release mandible, add noodles and saliva, and purr.

Another thing is that these have more taste than the others. They include small dried veggies and soy sauce kind of stuff to add flavor. We found our's at Wallmart in singles for only 88 cents! The best part is that you don't have to wait for the water to boil on the stove. These are microwavable in just five minutes!!!! Love them, and will continue to buy!

review/text: I would like to stress, when you are REALLY hungry, these Chow Mein Noodles are a blessing! They really are darn good for a less than a dollar processed instant food, and they are easy to fix!<br /><br />I use these on the road as a truck driver when I get to the end of my shift and all restaurants are closed (2 or 3 am!), and usually add a packet of crushed red pepper left over from a previous pizza feeding. I think I should carry a can of oysters to chop up and add to this dish, that just might make it even better!<br /><br />The arrows or "fill line" is really hard to see, but is there. I made the mistake of adding a little above it once, and ended up with excess water/juice in my meal. I guess I didn't think the packet of sauce added that much more moisture, but once I just added water to the fill line, and let it sit for 5 minutes after the cooking time, all was better! :)

I usually eat one of these with a 12 ounce frozen mixed veggies from the supermarket which costs about 2.50, and summing up to a less than 4 dollar meal. The meal itself does not satisfy me but it would hold me off til the next time I would eat..<br /><br />Easy to make meal - Just peel the top paper to the line, add the nasty veggies and (warm) water to fill line, microwave for 5 mins and add the packet of sauce after and stir.. all finished.

It states to add water to the arrows, except I found no arrows, so I had to guess.<br />All the discription of the "wonderful" flavor is hooey. It was mostly soy sauce and sugar.<br />It state chicken flavor, but I tasted none.<br />The noodles are good, a bit larger than ramen, but about the same taste.Next time I will use the noodles and dried veggies, but throw the sauce away and add Campbells chicken broth instead.

review/summary: Winterblue Stride, Keeps its Taste and it's Sugar Free
review/text: Never have I had sugarfree gum that lasted so long! At first, I watched the commercial and imagined it to last just as long as any other gum, but I was proven wrong. This stuff really lasts longer, and if you are sick of spitting out tasteless gum after the first few minutes, them Stride is defiantly for you. I have to say this is an amazing progression in the gum industry. I could buy packs of this stuff and live off of it, because it lasts so long. If you try this because you won't regret it. I recommend for everyone, especially gum lovers like yours truly.

review/summary: good sugar-free gum
review/text: I love gum, but the sugar was killing my teeth.  Have been searching for sugarless gums and found them to be great at first, but lose flavor quickly.  Stride is different.  It is good for a long, long time!!  The only thing I don't like about this gum is that it can sometimes get a little weird if it gets heated up, like in your pocket.  It's like it starts to deteriorate or something.  Keep it in your purse and you're good to go though.<br /><br />This is the best sugarless gum I have found.  You will like it and your teeth will thank you!

review/summary: My favorite so far!!!
review/text: Last week I made my first cake with Pettinice. I was scared that I wouldn't like it. I've tried Fondariffic, but it was way too soft and sticky. I used Choco Pan once, but it dried out faster than other brands. I used to make my own MMF to save $, but it's just such a pain. Satin Ice was my brand of choice, but was prone to elephant skin. I even tried Duff's fondant, and while it covers well, it doesn't taste good (although nothing is as bad as Wilton- blech). Let me just say I LOOOOOOVED Pettinice!!! It was so easy to use, it covered well, no elephant skin, and it tastes good both before and after drying (something I can't say of Satin Ice). Kneading was no problem- didn't even have to heat it as some reviews have noted. Some people even said they had to add glycerine to soften it up, and while I had it ready, it soooo didn't need it. There are still a few brands I'd like to try, but I think I found my brand of choice (aside from times when I need really deep colors).

review/summary: Prompt delivery - Bad chocolate
review/text: The chocolate used in these jordan almonds is not good at all. These were intended to be wedding favors, but it was so bad, that we threw these out ordered regular jordan almonds instead. The almonds came packed with ice and delivered promptly.

review/summary: cute and yummy
review/text: Even though im 20 now, I still love the little animals and phrases on the sticks! Even when the phrase is kinda random, for example "Stag Beetle - Love It" or they print the sound the animal makes. Anyways they are cute and are sweet little tasty sticks.

review/summary: Love the product.. Not the shipping
review/text: These snacks are fairly priced at $0.89. BUT the shipping cost is horrendous! $4.62?!<br /><br />Now, back to the review of the actual product, I love the strawberry one. Chocolate not so much, there's also a vanilla one but they both can't come close to the sweet flavor of strawberry. Damn.. Makes me wanna go to Ranch 99 now lol.

review/summary: Hibiscus-y and Raspberry-esque!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: This tea has a nice flavor although I wish it was a little stronger.  I have brewed way it states and even tried letting it sit longer  to get a stronger cup but it didn't work.  Am pleased with purchase and flavor overall.
