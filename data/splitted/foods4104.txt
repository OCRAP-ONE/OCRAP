review/summary: Pleasant berry taste with just a trace of vanilla
review/text: Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla herbal tea comes in a cute little bag shaped like a pyramid.  The flavors of blackberry and raspberry are a pleasant change from the norm, with the smallest trace of vanilla.<br /><br />I will use this product again.  It's a very nice way to fill my teacup.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I'm a big tea drinker and am always looking for different flavors and varieties to try. Blackberry Vanilla is an aromatic combination; this tea is that and a flavorful drink, too. I steeped one tea pyramid in a cup of hot water for eight minutes (the box recommends six) and was surprised by the beautiful color and nice flavor: not too overwhelming taste of blackberries with vanilla sailing in after the first sip. This also makes a great iced tea.<br /><br />The biggest concern I had was when I read the ingredients on the side of the box. Like a previous reviewer said, the first ingredient is hibiscus--for a blackberry vanilla tea. How strange.<br /><br />Good for any occasion.

review/summary: delicious
review/text: First off, I love the pyramid versus the regular tea bag.  I don't know why it works better, but it does.  The leaves stay put so there's nothing floating around in the tea and the flavor is fantastic.  Now as for this particular flavor, Blackberry Vanilla, it's amazing.  I can taste the blackberry and hibiscus flowers far more than the vanilla, but since I love blackberries and the other flavorings (blueberries and raspberries among others), it's perfect for me.  I didn't even have to add any sort of sweetener.  An added bonus:  the smell is heavenly.

review/summary: Excellent decaf herbal tea!
review/text: Lipton's Blackberry-Vanilla is a great decaf tea packing major hibiscus/raspberry/rosehip flavor. The aroma is fantastic with just a hint of vanilla, and the tea is fairly tart - a bit surprisingly tart at first sip. The blackberry and vanilla come through in the flavor - but the rosehip/hibiscus/raspberry is definitely the primary taste. I've tried this tea both hot and iced, and enjoyed both. Bonus points for being decaffeinated!

review/summary: fruity berry fragrance and flavor
review/text: Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags, Blackberry Vanilla, has bits of blackberry, but also other berry flavors and black currant. To me, the black currant fragrance almost dominates, but if you like a fruity tea, this is a good one. The rich dark-fruit accents and the blackberries catch your attention before you even open the box. The color of the tea is an appealing dark red-violet, and it is good hot or iced. I would sweeten it a bit and consider a splash of lemon.

review/summary: Lipton Herbal Pyramind Tea
review/text: During the cooler months, I love to drink a good cup of tea. But there's nothing worse than getting everything ready to find that your tea bag broke and your have leaves floating in your tea. So now with the Lipton Pyramid, you won't have that problem anymore. The pyramid itself is made of a mesh material that's very strong so it won't have a problem with breaking. And the tea itself is delicious. The flavor of it was very delicate and relaxing. Overall it's a much better way to brew tea.

review/summary: Amazing color. Flavor... not so much
review/text: Please see "tea.jpg" photo on this page. The color once steeped is tremendous, a really great ruby-red that looks like it's out of a 1940s Technicolor movie. The aroma is very pleasant, sweet and floral. The taste, however, leaves a bit to be desired. The aroma is promising you the moon and your brain is going "Yes, yes, yes!" and then the taste doesn't have the goods, you know? Kind of thin-tasting. I've had a locally-produced hibiscus tea which has a more assertive flavor (if not the incredible color). I'm going to let this cool down and make some iced tea later and see if that doesn't help this tea out a bit. Another sip. The aroma is heavenly. But the taste is absent.<br /><br />This comes not in a teabag, but a clever little synthetic-material pyramid for some reason. Very novel. Novelty is valuable. Really just the fact that this stuff is so different and comes in a little pyramid tea infuser would make it a nice stocking-stuffer type gift for the tea lover(s) in your life. Or "teabags" as a British ex-roommate once described dedicated tea drinkers. Another sip. Still kind of weak-tasting, but I wonder if you couldn't put this stuff in a room humidifier... (don't try this, it's just a thought because this tea smells so great)...<br /><br />The flavor is growing on me, but it's still thin-tasting compared to the incredible aroma...<br /><br />---<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea wasn't very good as iced tea. Kind of tasted like watered-down fruit punch.

review/summary: Nice tart herbal tea
review/text: This was my first experience with a "pyramid" tea bag, and I quite liked it. I'm not sure what it is made of; but allows you to see quite well what your tea looks like and allows for water to flow through without soaking much up.<br /><br />Opening the overwrap of the box there wasn't a lot of aroma & I was a bit worried. However, I have had teas that smelled great in the box and fell flat in the cup. As soon as the water (cold) hit the bag, it started coloring. That was a little worrying too...I've had herbal teas that were a lot of dye and no taste.<br /><br />Once this came out of the microwave, it smelled great. I have to say i didn't get a lot of vanilla, but there was a tartness that was quite pleasant. We had blackberries often this summer & while I am sure there were blackberries in the mix, I didn't get a lot of blackberry flavor either...but the "other natural flavors" (hibiscus etc) were enjoyable. And at 2.70 a box...I think this well worth the price.<br /><br />We are looking forward to trying a few other flavors.

review/text: I honestly expected to not like Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla herbal tea. Mostly because I don't really like herbal tea. I like English Breakfast and green tea. Everything else has been "Oh that's nice. You can have the rest. Really, you can take it. I won't mind."<br /><br />But this was really good. All the ladies at lunch agreed as well.<br /><br />It has a nice color. Purple for the blackberries. The vanilla isn't strong but it is a natural sweetener so I didn't have to put sugar in it. The berry taste is primary but not like a juice. It was just delicious and light and went great with the wafer cookies that we had as an after-lunch dessert.<br /><br />Very pleased and will definitely add to my limited list of teas to drink.

It is good and flavorful enough to even drink straight, hot or cold  although I pefer hot, with a dash of honey. Lipton might not be my choice for breakfast teas - since I really prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CJJZYI">Wagh Bakri Tea (Special International Blend) - 1lb</a> for my breakfast cuppa, but as herb teas go, this is one of the best.

review/summary: Strong Blackberry Flavor, More Subtle Vanilla
review/text: Upon first sip, the blackberry flavor is predominant. The vanilla notes are more subtle, and occur to me after I've tasted the strong blackberry. I don't mind the two-stage flavor effect, but if I could change anything about this tea, I'd want the vanilla flavor to be a little stronger.

review/summary: Good flavor, if potentially on the strong side
review/text: I admit to being a bit of a tea snob, but I'm willing to try new ones.  This was a new one on me.  I like Lipton's vanilla caramel tea, so I thought I might not mind this one.  I was right.  The vanilla flavor manages to come through even with the berry flavors being so present.  I would not call this refreshing but rather bold.  I tried it about an hour before bed and it did not keep me up at all, so it is caffeine free as advertised.  I also like the pyramid bag as I feel it brews a lot faster.  I admit to liking my tea strong, but I still had to pull this one out pretty quick because the flavors are so big.<br /><br />At any rate, it's pretty good if you like berry flavors with your herbal tea.  The vanilla flavor balances the drink a bit but I find I have to be in the mood to drink this.  I wouldn't say it is great as I'm still partial to other flavors and brands, but I was not disappointed by Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla tea.

review/summary: 5 Star Tea, 1 Star Packaging
review/text: I have been a longtime Celestial Seasonings drinker for years, but they do not have a blackberry flavor among their "Zingers".  That is why I decided to try this Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea from Lipton.  I use a large cup; therefore, I used two tea bags like I do for all of my other hot teas.  After brewing my first cup, I was very pleased with the flavor.  It started out with a strong blackberry flavor, but the hint of vanilla gives it a very mellow finish.  The "Zinger" teas by comparison can have a somewhat harsh finish.  If it were only about first impressions of taste, this would be a hands down five star product.  However, I have a couple of complaints about the packaging.  The tea bags are loose in the box with no container.  Once you open the shrink wrap, the flavor will decay fairly quickly as the box does not close tightly.  In addition, the is a small piece of tape or adhesive strip on the string attaching it to the tea bag and taking up the excess string.  I understand that this is to keep the loose bags from becoming a tangled mess.  However, wrapping each tea bag individually would solve all of the problems noted.  If Lipton would do this, they would have a true five star product.  Until then, they lose two stars.  I would only recommend this if you intend to use the entire box quickly.  Otherwise the flavor from your first cup will only be a faint memory on the last cup from the box.

review/summary: A nice change of pace.
review/text: I am a big tea drinker.  I drink caffeinated tea during the day, but switch to white or green tea in the evening.  I usually drink loose leaf tea, but I thought I'd give this a try.  You definitely get the berry flavor and color from this tea.  I was surprised that it didn't contain artificial colors after brewing my first cup.  It is a little on the tart side as the box says.  If you don't like that, you can add a bit of sugar or honey.  I like it with just a touch of sugar.  The little pyramid bags are very cute and the tea is spread out better than in a folded bag, and the lightweight material seems like it allow better circulation.<br />I have started drinking this in the evening when I sit down to read.  It has a very soothing quality to the aroma and flavor.

review/summary: Rich, Tart and Balanced Herbal Tea +++
review/text: This fine herbal tea features rich blackberry balanced well with other tart herbs and  mellow vanilla for a very tasty result -- that is offered in pyramid fine net bags for ease of brewing. I have tried it in aumber of ways -- including hot and icy by itself, hot and icy with black tea and with a black currant black tea -- icy in a vacuum thermos for hiking. I have enjoyed this tea in all those modes of usage -- most especially via that last mode -- being some of the most refreshing drink I've had during [and after] fairly hard hiking. For that last black tea, black currant, black berry vanilla iced tea, I used one bag of this herbal blackberry vanilla tea for every two bags of the other black currant black tea with ice added later -- for about three combo bags for every 12 ounces of iced tea. For those concerned with freshness -- keep the little [18 count] boxes of the review tea in your freezer -- bet they will go fast anyway +++

review/summary: Like the pyramid, but the tea is a little bitter....
review/text: I've been drinking lipton tea lately, the antioxidant ones with vanilla and fruits and thought the new ones in the pyramid bags would be fun to try.  I like the bags, but I just couldn't get excited about the flavor of this tea.  I could not make out any vanilla flavor and the tea had a bit of a bite, I could only make out the hibiscus in this tea.  It's not a bad thing necessarily, but I usually would drink this in the morning at work, sans sugar and I found that it really, REALLY needs the sugar to give it flavor and lessen the bite. Once the sugar was mixed in it was fine.  Not great, but definitely much better.  For me, I would continue to buy my other teas, but would perhaps try this in a different flavor to see if maybe a different flavor would make the difference.

review/summary: A Dessert for Your Mouth!
review/text: The tea bags are quite unique. Notice the triangular shape, which allows more of the ingredients to infuse with the water while steeping. I have to tell you, the aroma of this tea while steeping is like a warm oven baking blackberry cobbler on a winter's day! Heavenly!!! The tea contains hibiscus flowers which lends a somewhat element of surprise to the flavor. The tongue gets this almost sweet taste of the blackberry and vanilla on the tip and top, but back along the sides of the tongue, one is treated to a tart aftertaste. Quite good! I can see me going to this on a winter's day. And especially when you want something after dinner, but don't want the calories of an actual dessert! So yummy!!! I highly recommend this delicious tea.<br /><br />****DISCLOSURE: This product was provided by Amazon Vine in exchange for an independent and non-biased review.

review/summary: Pleasant Herbal Tea and a Fancy Pyramind Tea Bag
review/text: This Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea by Lipton makes a very pleasant tea very quickly.  Its list of ingredients are:  Hibiscus, Rosehips, Sweet Blackberry leaves, Natural Flavor, Dried Black Current pieces, Dried Blackberry pieces, Blueberry pieces, Dried raspberry pieces, and Sunflower lecithin.  I like the list of ingredients and like that it has a lot of real dried pieces of real dried fruit to enhance the flavor.  Although the box says that one cup of tea is not a significant source of vitamins, minerals, or nutrients, I notice that many of the ingredients are known for some vitamin C and suspect one is getting some very low dose of good vitamin C and some cofactors for absorbing it (and a little bit of choline from the sunflower lecithin to build a little acetyl choline in the brain).  I assume that the "natural flavor" is vanillin, because vanilla is mentioned as a flavor on the package but is not found in its herbal form in the ingredients.  I personally do not like "natural flavor" as a ingredient, because MSG can hide under this label.  I do not suspect that MSG is in this brew, but I am never quite sure what is actually hiding behind the label "natural flavor" and would rather have a fuller disclosure instead.  I found the taste pleasant and can taste the fruit flavors and the vanillin.  I suspect it would make a good iced tea, but only tasted it as a hot tea.<br /><br />I really liked the pyramid tea bags!  You get 18 of them per a box.  The herbal ingredients, when they are soaked in hot water, weight the pyramid downwards, while the upper part of the pyramid traps some hot air bubbles during brewing.  The result is the pyramid tends to float erect and creates a lot of space for the herbs and the water to mix.  It looks like more of the ingredients are being extracted into the water.  I think that Lipton is really on to something with this kind of tea bag.<br /><br />I found the flavor pleasant and enjoyable.  I usually sweeten my teas with stevia (sugar free naturally sweet healing herb).  There is nothing too earth shaking about the taste, but I did find something I liked about the tea.  It seems to work very well when mixed with other herbal teas and does enhance the flavor of a green tea without overpowering the flavor of green tea.  As a support tea, I found these tea bags to be very good.  By themselves, they are okay.  I realize that some might want to get this tea because it is a no caffeine one, but it does work well with green tea (which is caffeinated).  I found it worked well with some ginger and mint too.<br /><br />All in all, the flavor is pleasant, fruity, and okay by itself, but seems to shine as a support for other teas, especially green tea.  The tea bags seem to really help the brewing process and the fuller use of the ingredients.  I give it 4 stars rather than 5 stars because of using "natural flavor" in the ingredients list, rather than detailing out what is really in there.

review/summary: Pretty Good Tea, but the Name is Misleading...
review/text: First off, let me say that I'm a pretty experienced tea drinker.  I've tried out a ton of different brands of tea, and I make my own tea blend from loose leaf dried herbs regularly.  Of course, I jumped on the chance to try out a new flavor.  "Blackberry Vanilla" sounds great!<br /><br />Well...  The tea does indeed taste great.  However, I feel the name is a bit misleading.  It has so little vanilla in it that it's basically undetectable, and it tastes far more like hibiscus and raspberry.  It's a bit of a tart tea (a direct result of all the hibiscus) and it actually includes raspberry, black current, blueberry, and rose hips in addition to the blackberry, which is actually a minor ingredient.  So, the end result is a pleasant tea that tastes fruity, but mostly of raspberry and hibiscus.  If you like that (which I did), you'll be pleased, but anyone who actually expected it to taste of blackberries and vanilla will be disappointed.  Oh, and a bit of advice.  If you find it too tart, you can either just wait a few minutes or drink it chilled.  I've found out that the tartness of hibiscus seems to wear off after a few minutes, and chilling seems to kill it off quite a bit too.<br /><br />On a side note, I'm a bit disappointed in the "natural flavors" part of the ingredient list and the sunflower lecithin part of the list.  Why do tea companies always feel the need to add in extra fillers and crap?  Plus, "natural flavors" could be anything.  It always felt kind of like cheating to me; almost as if they just couldn't craft a pleasing tea without adding in a bunch of crutches to boost the flavor.  That being said, at least it tastes good.  I can't argue much about that.<br /><br />So, do I recommend this tea?  If the previous description of the flavor sounded good to you, then by all means, enjoy this tea.  If it sounds disappointing to you, then you may wish to let this one pass.

review/summary: Better than most fruit teas
review/text: A lot of fruit flavored teas are very sour, but this one is the least sour I've experienced.  It seems the drying process makes it so that a lot of sugar is required to balance it out.  This is not bad, but is best coupled with some agave or honey to mellow it out.  Still, good fruit and vanilla flavor.  Recommended.

review/summary: good flavor in a interesting package
review/text: With the coming of fall I'm back in the swing of hot-tea drinking.  When I saw the Lipton Pyramid Tea Bags, I was curious as to whether the shape would make any difference.<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure if it is the pyramid shape, or the extremely light netting used, but the bags seem able to make a difference in the quality of the tea.<br /><br />I followed the directions (4 to 6 minutes) and brewed for 4 minutes with hot water. The tea was pretty weak at this point. I continued to brew to 5 (better) then to 6 minutes (just right for my taste.<br /><br />There are 18 bags in the box and each bag "brews" one cup of tea.  I found that if done quickly, I could reuse the bag for a second cup without a lot of loss of flavor. (brewed at 6 minutes the 2nd time)

So, I made her a cup of tea with this Lipton Blackberry Vanilla and had her give me feedback on the experience.<br />The berry flavor in this tea is very pronounced while the vanilla lingers in the background. This is common with berry teas for some reason and this tea is no exception.<br />This is a tea that would be best when you can curl up in a blanket during a snowstorm and enjoy the strong berry flavor. My wife liked this flavor and was very satisfied with the product.

review/summary: I've just found a new favorite!
review/text: Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea is, to put it simply, divine. Packaged in a pyramid bag made of a mesh that is much more durable than what normal tea bags use, the all natural ingredients combine gorgeously together for a wonderful cup of tea. The ingredients are as follows: hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black current pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, and sunflower lecithin. So not only is it a blackberry tea, it also has black current, blueberry, and raspberry, making it tailor-made for me since I adore <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UEJ8CO">Twinings Mixed Berry Tea, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, though since that uses black tea and different berries has a completely contrasting, but delicious, taste. At first sip, the strong berry flavors seem to overwhelm the vanilla, but after savoring the tea a bit, the vanilla's undertone actually balances with the berry flavors perfectly. Since I generally only add honey to tea, I first tried it with that, which complements the flavors of Lipton's Blackberry extremely well and recommend over other sweeteners. I love this tea, it's fast become my new favorite, and as someone who's sensitive to caffeine, the fact that it's free of caffeine makes it even better. Lipton has developed a delightful new tea that I'll definitely be getting again!

review/text: I am a confirmed tea addict, and I keep a wide selection of regular, flavored, and herbal teas on hand, so the chance to test a new flavor of herbal tea was a no-brainer.  I was more than pleasantly surprised to find that, though this is an entirely herbal concoction, it has the nice flavor of black tea.  I don't know how they did that.  There's a definite blackberry taste and the vanilla keeps all the other flavors calm and happy, but whereas some herbals have an overpowering single-flower note (usually some sort of citrus stomping heavily on the lighter flavors), there is no such thing going on in this cup.  Honestly, I would not have expected such a nice touch from Lipton.  I tend to be a little tea-snob, and I would have expected this from one of the exotic producers of primarily herbal blends.  My hat is off to Lipton for out-herbaling the best of the rest.<br /><br />Highly recommend this lovely, caffeine-free herbal for any time of the day or night when only tea will do.

review/summary: Very easy to brew, tastes and smells great, could be sweeter
review/text: Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags, Blackberry Vanilla<br /><br />These pyramid tea bags are quite functional by allowing the contents to release their flavoring more consistently and fully. Upon opening the box, I could smell the berries and vanilla which did not dissipate while brewing the tea. When the dried contents of the bag were reconstituted, I could tell that they're real berries.<br />The tea tastes fairly smooth and I could detect its acidity. I think it would work better if it were slightly sweeter. The fact it is caffeine-free makes this a great tea to drink before sleeping.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars, very easy to brew with the pyramid bags, smells and tastest great, could be slightly sweeter

review/summary: 'Nother Cup, Please!
review/text: This is a great tasting tea--but has no nutritional value.  No matter--it is palatable without sweetners and a treat with sugar.  Hot, cold, half-strength or double, a variety of flavor experiences in the same box.<br />The mesh pryamid-shaped bags make it brew up fast, too.  Just add hot water.<br />I have drank other Lipton products, including some of their other herbal teas.  It is a break from the run of the mill routine coffee, and caffine-free, too.  The vanilla adds something to the blackberry base, and the rose hips flavor it somewhat--but I wouldn't know hibiscus if it bit me!  I didn't recognize the black current and raspberry flavors--I am no gourmet.  All I can tell you is that I like this brew.  The remainder of this box will be very welcome on cold graveyard shifts!  I plan to add this tea to my shopping list the next time I'm in the supermarket.

review/text: Opening the box, I got a good first impression: these tea bags have a pleasant aroma and are designed with a pyramid design to maximize their steeping power. But what really surprised me is how full-bodied and hearty this is for an herbal tea: a rich berry flavor tempered with notes of vanilla.  This is not some flowery, pantywaist tea - it's genuinely satisfying.  I'm more of a cold-weather hot tea drinker, and I can't wait to cozy up with a cup of this on a frosty winter day.

review/text: This is a really nice infusion, with a sweet blackberry taste that is refreshing and not overpowering. There is not much of a vanilla taste that I can tell, however I smell a hint of vanilla as I drink it. The teabags themselves are great, in a pyramid shape that helps it to infuse but with no leaking. I like that it's clear so I can see the herbs inside. I would definitely recommend this tea to anyone who likes the taste of blackberry, although not to someone who is hoping for a distinct vanilla flavor.

review/text: This is nice different tea. It is not too sweet but flavorful. Although it says Blackberry Vanilla, neither flavor is overwhelming. It brews readily and you can actually get probably a cup and a half from one teabag. I really like the new tea bags that seem to get the flavor out quicker than the old style teabags. I probably won't buy this tea as I prefer the regular tea as it has a stronger flavor. This tea would be nice for someone looking for a flavorful non-caffeinated tea.

review/text: I really like this tea.  I was leery because I did not want the vanilla to overpower the fruity notes but it was great. The vanilla is more of a light undertone as opposed to sitting side-by-side with the blackberry flavor. I've only drank it hot with Splenda and it exceeded my expectations. I didn't overdo the water (about 6oz.) and it resulted in a strong flavor that was really pleasant.<br /><br />The tea bag is made out of a material that isn't as messy as typical tea bags. I was able to pull it out without it dripping everywhere.<br /><br />I would suggest it if you are into hot teas.

review/text: I always enjoy how a flavored coffee or tea smells.  I've usually found that the taste is never as good as the smell.  In the case of Lipton Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags, this has been my experience.  The bag is an eye-catching design that entices because of the texture of the tea and infusions.  The smell is amazing!  I would make this into an air freshener in a heartbeat!  The flavor wasn't bad, but it was overpoweringly blackberry.  I couldn't even taste the vanilla.<br /><br />This would be an outstanding blackberry tea, but this product doesn't live up to the description on the carton.

review/summary: Takes time to appreciate, then WOW!
review/text: At first sip, I thought the Lipton Herbal Blackberry Vanilla Tea tasted too much like cherry cough medicine, with the blackberry-vanilla flavor just a bit too strident and artificial tasting. Kind of like overloaded hazelnut coffee. On second taste, I fell in love with this, feeling like it had a sustaining and alluring flavor. I can't explain why it feels sustaining, as it is caffeine free, perhaps the richness of flavor is at work.<br /><br />I triangulated with my housemates on this:<br /><br />Housemate the 1st: "It has an interesting back note."<br /><br />Housemate the 2nd (an oratorical type): "It revives a feeling of nostalgia. It's not very tinged, not a wake-up coffee, it's a very mild tea. This is very, very good. This kind of tea leaves a taste on your taste buds, and doesn't stick to your teeth. I'm going to heat another cup."<br /><br />So -- this is certainly worth a try if you like fun brassy flavors in tea. It contains real hibiscus flowers, rose hips, sweet blackberry leaves, dried black currant pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces and sunflower lecithin. It comes in an infusion pyramid rather than a paper bag, somewhat more tricky to compost but not a big deal.

review/summary: Perfect For The Hot Tea Drinker!
review/text: I'm definitely a hot tea snob when Autumn and Winter set in.  I love to buy various flavors and rare brands, and sip a cup at night after work or several cups on the weekend. Lipton has long been a name synonymous with your everyday cold summer sweet tea accented with a wedge of lemon, but in recent years they've really stepped up their game and tapped into the hot tea market with much success. Their Blackberry Vanilla Pyramid Tea bags is a perfect example.<br /><br />First, one might ask what is the purpose of the pyramid tea bag?  Well, it's a new trend for specialty teas and mimics the silk patch that our ancestors used to brew a single cup a long time ago. Pyramid tea bags are usually constructed of nylon which has larger holes than your conventional tea bags. This allows for quicker steeping times since the water can come in contact with more of the tea and much quicker. This type bag also allows the tea to move around more freely instead of being compacted; this motion allows the bag to act the same as an infuser would - infusing the flavor quicker and making it stronger.<br /><br />Speaking of stronger, if you don't sweeten your tea, you'll find this flavor to be very bitter at first so you may not like it.  I tried it with a packet of Splenda and found it to be much more enjoyable. It has a nice rich aroma to it. The color is fun - a bit purple at first but darkens to a wine-like color. And the taste is a nice tart berry flavor with that hint of vanilla that really mellows it out. A second cup tasted just the same with a touch of honey.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy this brand and flavor again, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys flavored single cup teas like I do.

review/summary: Made with real blackberries! Tastes real good
review/text: I am an avid drinker of lipton black tea, I drink it every morning but I love trying different flavor teas as well.<br /><br />The blackberry vanilla herbal pyramid tea at first look doesn't seem to be much tea in the pyramid. Which worries me that it won't have much flavor. As soon as I steep the tea bag in my hot water the water quickly soaks up the string and to the label which I don't like much. The water turns a brillant purplish maroon color very pretty.<br /><br />I usually drink my tea with sugar, but I started this one off with no sugar just to see what the original flavor would be. It is slightly sweet and instantly I get the taste of blackberry the vanilla is more subtle but when I smell the tea I can smell both the blackberry and vanilla. Even though there doesn't seem to be a lot of tea in the pyramid, you really can't tell when drinking it has a lot of flavor in my opinion. I don't really need to put any sugar in it to enhance it. But I did add sugar as well and it really does bring out the flavor more and taste good that way as well. But this is one of those teas I can drink with or without sugar. Regular lipton tea I have to drink with sugar.<br /><br />This tea can be drank hot or cold. I am only drinking it hot but I think cold would be excellent as well. You just brew it like you are having hot tea and then chill or add ice.<br /><br />The ingredients shows there is also hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black current pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with the taste. It makes me want to try other flavors of lipton pyramid teas. Can really taste the blackberry and a bit of raspberry and with added sugar I can taste more of the vanilla as well.

review/text: The smell of this when you pour hot water over it is delightful; the taste less so, but still pretty good.  You definitely get the vanilla and berries.  There is a bit of sourness; you might want some sweetener.  I do enjoy it, although I find it a little overpowering for a regular size cup; I use a big (clean) coffee mug with this tea.<br /><br />I have to confess though, that I mostly use these by adding a bag to a large pot of green tea.  The resulting flavor is nice, and I get the benefits of green tea without the bitterness.

review/summary: Tart, but the vanilla mellows it out
review/text: With fall coming, I was in the mood for a new tea. I was a little apprehensive over the addition of vanilla to the blackberry, I must admit, since vanilla is one of those flavors that can so often make or break a tea. If it's too strong, the tea becomes undrinkable for me and if it's too light then it ruins the whole purpose of adding vanilla in the first place.<br /><br />The vanilla taste of this is more of a hint than a strong flavor, which is how I prefer it. It does a lot to even out the tartness of the blackberry, which is something that I both like and regret. Sometimes you just want a nice tart tea, although I'll probably get more mileage out of this since it's such a mellow drink. I emphasize mellow, as this isn't a very intense beverage. If you're looking for something with an overwhelmingly strong flavor then you'll probably want to move on to some of the other flavors out there. However, if you want something that would be good to drink before bedtime then this would be the thing since it won't shock your tastebuds into full alert and it's caffeine free, which means that it won't keep you up.<br /><br />One of the features on the box is the pyramid tea bag shape, which I can verify is a great tea bag shape. It allows the tea bits to swirl around and brew up faster. I've used various brands that have this design and they tend to brew faster and with less "squeezing" of the tea bag to get the tea out. It's also a prettier tea bag, although that probably won't factor in much with most buyers. The only thing I'd warn about is that once in a blue moon the tea bag will rip if you yank the string too hard when removing it from around the teabag. In almost every case I've had the tea bag be perfectly fine, but if you're exceptionally clumsy and/or strong then you'll want to be a little more delicate.

review/summary: More aromatic than tasty, but good nonetheless
review/text: Actually, my daughter and wife are the tea connoisseurs at our house, but I thought I'd give this tea a try, as well. It comes in a hinged box containing a resealable bag that, in turn, contains eighteen pyramid-shaped "teabags" of a fine plastic fiber. I am not certain how that teabag is of benefit aside from its being much more readily permeable than a conventional teabag. Steeping the teabag releases a pleasant scent of blackberry, and the tea's taste has a subtle hint of vanilla, but it is mostly a slightly tart blackberry taste with no sweetness. I did not attempt to sweeten the tea; the flavor suited me, but I can see how it would be a good complement to a baked dessert. Recommended.

review/text: When I first ordered this, I really didn't think it would taste that good. Vanilla and Blackberry sounded really weird. The big surprise was that the vanilla didn't overwhelm the blackberry, and the whole flavor was well blended, like blackberry with only a hint of vanilla.<br /><br />If you've ever eaten wild blackberries after they've been freshly picked, then you know exactly what this tastes like: sweet on the front, with a slightly tart taste at the end. The best part is that you don't even need sugar to enjoy this and get the full effect of the flavors. It tastes so wonderful without it.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy this product in the future, and I'll mix it with my green tea so I get the healthy of green tea and the sweet flavor of this.

review/summary: Oh, very nice, indeed
review/text: This was a free item for review. I do not drink a lot of herbal teas, but I do have a few that I like to keep on hand. Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla will become one of those teas. I was a little unsure about the taste combination, but I like both flavors, so I wanted to give it a try. When I first opened the box, and each time I made the tea, I was really pleased with the aroma. My nose caught a yummy smell that reminded me of dessert; something this gal does not get to have very often.<br />I made the tea in both iced and hot forms. Both were very tasty, but I think when I do the iced again, I will use two bags because the ice watered the tea down a bit. The hot was very tasty, and I did not need to add sweetener to it because the vanilla balanced the blackberry flavor nicely, with just a hint of sweetness. The little triangle bag the tea comes in did not tear and was easy to take out of my mug when I was done steeping the tea. What's more, the brew is a pretty color and looked nice in the small clear pitcher when I prepared it for iced tea. I think it would make a lovely luncheon tea, even for the little ones. All in all, this was a very pleasant find.

review/text: Despite the fact that its ingredients are primarily hibiscus and rosehips, this tea is quite sweet and does taste like blackberry with maybe just a subtle hint of vanilla (I think if it were stronger the two flavors might very well conflict).  Normally, I don't put sweetener of any kind into tea (even iced tea).  Indeed, this tea is a bit too sweet for my taste.  However, I find that sometimes I need a tea without caffeine and I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TQIJ94">Sinus Formula 1oz</a> which has a fairly strong minty flavor.  So, I tried the two together and it worked very well.  The tea toned down the mint flavor and the sinus formula toned down the sweetness.  So now it tastes great and clears up my sinuses as well.

review/summary: Nice flavor but a bit tart
review/text: Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla tea has a light, pleasant blackberry scent, beautiful color, and the pyramid shape of the tea bag allows herbal mixture to infuse quickly. It took less than three minutes to steep.<br /><br />The flavor was nice, however I found it a bit tart and a little on the harsh side. Adding a half teaspoon of honey helped and made it smoother and more to my liking. The hibiscus and rosehips dominate with a hint of blackberry flavor and very little vanilla. It tasted best when piping hot; after it cooled to room temperature the flavor became a little sour and required re-heating.<br /><br />The pyramid style tea bags do not come individually wrapped. If you go through a box of tea quickly this shouldn't be a problem. I like to have a variety of teas open at the same time and like the extra shelf time the individual packets provide.<br /><br />Overall a nice tea and I wouldn't hesitate to try another of the herbal flavors.

review/summary: Tastes good...if you like fruity tea
review/text: This is an herbal fruity tea in one of those newfangled pyramid bags.  I am not sure what they are made of and wonder about chemicals.  They function no better than the old bags as far as I can tell.  They just look cooler.  I drink tea with sweatener and so I get a sweet glass of hot tea with definite vanilla notes and blackberry as promised. No bad aftertastes detectable.  I wish I could get teas like this that contained caffeine.  This does not.<br /><br />Not too much more to say about these.  It is really personal taste here.  You have to try it if you like these type teas to see if this hits the spot.

review/text: I don't know if the pyramid bags had anything to do with it, but this tea seemed to steep more quickly than most.  The tea itself, is delicious with a tart berry flavor.  It is wonderful on its own, or tossed in with a regular tea bag to make a flavorful pot of iced tea.

review/summary: Cute bag... tea taste is a bit "sour fruity"...
review/text: This Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea (Blackberry Vanilla), is a bit too "sour fruity" for me, but I have to admit I went through a recent phase of drinking quite a bit of Turkish tea.  As with many teas, they can be an acquired taste.  I haven't acquired this one.<br /><br />As a product, however, the tea bags worked nicely in their "Pyramid" format, and I like that the tea bag seemed to drain better as I pulled it out compared to the traditional tea bag.<br /><br />Take a look at this product if you like fruity teas with no caffeine.

review/summary: A very sweet tea-mostly berry with a hint of vanilla
review/text: The Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea by Lipton is caffeine free tea with real pieces of blackberry in a neat little pyramid-shaped mesh bag.  It is very fancy so drink with your pinky up!<br /><br />Ok, so seriously it is a very different tea from what I am used to drinking.  Inside the cool bag are little pieces of the following: hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, dried blackberry current, dried blueberry and dried raspberry pieces.  The smell is is lovely.  It steeps a very pretty purplish color.<br /><br />At first I tried it hot and straight, sans sweetener, and found it kind of sour. It was also naturally sweet too if that makes any sense.  The vanilla is not very strong but it is there.  When I added a packet of Stevia it became very sweet, almost too sweet.  Next I tried it as an iced tea.  I enjoyed the sweet yet sour taste much better this way.  It also looked very pretty in the clear glass with its beautiful color.<br /><br />This is not a bad tea, but it is not really the kind of tea I go for.  I prefer it cold to hot and I would be careful of how much sweetener you add to it. Maybe half a packet will do ya.  I don't think I would buy it again, but I am not going to throw it in the trash either.  I wanted to love it so I am sad I do not.

review/summary: improvement over bagged tea but could be better
review/text: We enjoy drinking tea at home and recently had tried Forte tea while on vacation.  The Forte tea tastes like very high quality leaves which come in a pyramid style similar to these from Lipton.  However, I noticed as soon as taking these tea pyramids out of the box, the string was a little tough to completely detach.  Often when pulling the string away, it left a small hole in the pyramid.  If you are not a fan of getting little tea "dust" in the bottom of your cup this is a little annoying.<br /><br />But more importantly, the flavor.  The tea seems sweet all on its own, making me suspicious of what "natural flavors" is really about.  I enjoy the overall fruity flavor on first sip but notice soon after there is something a little "off", not quite an aftertaste but just enough to have doubts about the ingredients.  The concept of the pyramid to help enhance the steeping is excellent, but will likely look for higher quality loose teas in pyramid style bags to try out.

review/summary: pleasant  tasting but a tad weak
review/text: This is a very smooth tasting herbal tea.  The flavor is not very pronounced  but the combination of vanilla and blackberry is quite pleasant. These teabags are  pyramid  shaped and appear to be made of a fabric like material rather than paper so the bags seem rather more permanent and substantial than they need to be and they take up so much room in the cup that it is impractical to double bag which I like to do in order to increase the flavor. One pyramid shaped bag makes one rather weak  8 ounce cup of tea. The flavor is good  its just quite mild.

review/summary: Well balanced- complex-unique
review/text: I've bought these Lipton pyramid tea bag blends before, so I already knew to expect quality. But LIPTON BLACKBERRY VANILLA tea, exceeded my expectations. The aroma has strong vanilla notes, with the Blackberry aroma present as a citrus tang overtone. After it was prepared, and sweetened, I tasted it. Incredible. Who knew that this balance between the sweetness of all natural vanilla, with the tangyness of blackberries, would create such a delicious tea? I've never tasted ANY herbal tea, with a complexity like this. I've tried to add a little pomegranate juice (as one would add lemon to their tea), and the taste was ruined. If i added more vanilla, the taste was ruined.  Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla is just right, and my new favorite herbal tea flavor.

review/summary: Fine pairing with light fruit cakes or muffins
review/text: While mainly hibiscus leaves and rosehips, as the label indicates, the vanilla adds a bright aroma and the raspberry a hefty mouthfeel. I did not taste a lot of vanilla; the berry factor weighs more perhaps in the color and the thick quality of the brew. It's not a processed black tea but an herbal one in its lack of caffeination. The amount of leaves in the pyramidal bag is less than I expected, but immersion for 6 minutes (4-6 recommended) brought out the stronger flavor I favor.<br /><br />I paired this with fruit muffins; a dessert tart or cake would also fit this beverage well. The taste is not overpowering, and maybe subtler than I expected, but it tastes "clean" and with sweetener (I tried Splenda's "Nectresse" also reviewed), it brings out more liveliness. Without that addition, I found the tea lacked the kick I desired. All in all, delicate, but refined.

review/summary: A VERY PLEASANT NON-CAFFEINATED TISANE
review/text: As a caffeine addict, I mostly drink caffeinated teas or coffees but I like to have one or two high quality non-caffeine brews at hand in case I don't want more of a buzz or just want a soothing drink. This blend is one of the best I've come across. I usually add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of sugar to my drink anyways but I was surprised to read that one of the reviewers found it sour. Because I didn't at all. I thought it had a truly pleasing balance between fruity and sweet, and after I'd drunk it, I felt ... relaxed.<br /><br />I have long been an advocate of the pyramid shape for teabags. The water circulates better around the tea blend and a more balanced brew --less acrid-- is the result.<br /><br />This tea is pricy but I will buy it when I run out of the sample I got for review.<br /><br />Why don't I give it 5 stars? I'm not sure but probably because I would save 5 stars for a gentle green or white tea blend, regardless of the caffeine.

review/text: I'm not much of a tea drinker, but I decided to give this a whirl.  I used my coffee pot to brew it and threw in 3 teabags.  I added some sugar and ice and had a fantastic glass of iced tea.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is supposed to be hot tea or what, not being a tea fan, but I really enjoyed the Blackberry flavoring with just a hint of vanilla.  You can really taste the rose hips so if you aren't a fan of that I would dodge this tea.<br /><br />I have to admit that the little silky bags really made me happy, and I'm not exactly sure why.<br /><br />My room mate love this tea as well and it has since been added to the grocery list.  I will be making much more of this in the future because it makes an excellent choice for before bed when I'm not in the mood for a glass of water but don't want to add caffeine to the insomniac arsenal.  Very flavorful, brightly colored and fun to drink, I recommend this for a step away from regular tea.

review/summary: I like it
review/text: First let me say that I am a cold tea drinker or i like ice in my tea and only on really cold outside conditions do I ever drink hot tea.<br /><br />Lipton has a really unusual bag here and already have a few of their flavors but wanted to try the blackberry. Although the box states it is Blackberry Vanilla, the vanilla is just a hint of a flavor and that is alright with me.<br /><br />The flavor is mild and there are only 18 bags in this box whereas most of the other teas like Bigelow and Tazo have 20 in theirs. But, the price is slightly lower at the store where I checked but not only are the number of bags lower, the ounces in the bags are lower too.<br /><br />I can't see where the different tea bag actually makes the flow any better.  I tried both of the different bags and both floated for a time if I didn't push them down.<br /><br />This is a nice flavor but it is so mild that it is almost non existant and i had to use another bag to get a good bold flavor.  This flavor is caffeine free, which is a plus for night time use.

review/text: I really like these Pyramid Tea Bags from Lipton.  Besides being pretty to look at and fun to use, the tea itself is tasty.  When drank straight with no sugar, the blackberry flavor is really evident, and it leans toward pretty tart.  Add a little sweetener, and the vanilla flavor comes out more.  I like it either way.<br /><br />Because this tea is caffeine-free, it's good to drink at any time of the day without fear of being even a little wired from caffeine.  I like to drink a cup of this tea when I get a little chilly.

review/summary: Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea
review/text: I received this item through the Amazon Vine Program.  My overall impression of this tea is that it is alright, but nothing to get excited about.  Let me be more specific:<br /><br />The predominate flavor that comes through is Hibiscus, which makes sense since it is the number one item in the list of ingredients (ingredients are listed from the largest concentration to the lowest concentration in the product).  If you are a fan of hibiscus, this will not bother you.  The blackberry is in there, but I have a very difficult time finding any vanilla flavor.  No where in the list of ingredients is vanilla listed.<br /><br />The tea bag is unique, but I am not sure that it really adds anything.  In fact, it seems to take a bit away in the aspect that it does not appear to be a recyclable material.  Paper composts well, but I am not sure about the material that this weave is made from. There is no indication on the package as to what is being used. As for brewing, I do not find that this bag allows it to brew any faster or better than any of the bags that I have used on other products, including ones from Lipton.<br /><br />While this is an ok tea, I do not find anything in it to make me want to recommend it to anyone.

review/text: I love tea, tea of all kinds.  I prefer loose tea or cake tea that you have to break off a piece and steep it in hot water, or I go in my backyard and gather some leaves from plants like wild strawberries, or Perillo.  I sometimes mix them together, so when I opened this box and found this new, to me, pyramid tea bag I was surprised.  I liked it, I boiled the water and let it steep for about 10 minutes.  I do not usually use any sweeter, if I do it would be raw honey from a friends' hives.<br />Time to taste, I do not like this tea. First it claims to be Blackberry Vanilla tea, you would think that meant Blackberry Vanilla, here are the ingredients in order of their appearance,<br /><br />Hibiscus flowers<br />Rosehips<br />Sweet blackberry leaves<br />Natural Flavor<br />Dried Black Currant pieces<br />Dried Blacberry pieces<br />Dried Raspberry pieces<br />Sunflower Lecithin<br /><br />I don't think so, where are the Blackberries? Some leaves that is all no blackberry like it says on the label?. I could make my own blackberry teas with my own blackberry leaves I thought this would taste better. When I see blackberry tea I expect blackberries and not Rose hips and Hibiscus flowers.  It is very tart  I guess I am spoiled with my natural tea I pick myself.  I cannot put enough honey in this to make it taste good enough.<br />I am sorry this is not for me. It is leaving a very odd taste in my mouth one I do not want again.

For a better blackberry type of taste at a similar (and lower) price point, try Bigelow Blackcurrant tea, which happens to have rounder, smoother, and more pleasing flavor--in a traditional tea bag, nonetheless!

review/text: This Lipton Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea is sweet and tasty, and comes in little pyramid bags, which I'm very partial to and I`ve only found in Japanese teas before. You can see that it contains tiny dried pieces of fruit (black currant, blackberry, blueberry and raspberry) as well as blackberry leaves, hibiscus flowers and rosehips. It is caffeine free, so makes a lovely after-dinner drink, and is delicately sweet enough that dieters might use it as "dessert."<br /><br />For a commercial tea company, this is a truly lovely tea, and in a blind tea test with more expensive teas, might fare quite well. I've tried it both hot and chilled, and it is good either way. And those little pyramid bags are such an aesthetically pleasing touch! I will certainly buy Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea again.

While there IS blackberry in the ingredients list, I can't say that I can single it out when tasting.<br />- the "Pyramid" bags (technically, they are tetrahedron-shaped, not pyramid) are, I believe, made of PET (polyethylene terephthalate)*, which causes me concern for both health and biodegradeable/environmental reasons.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend trying this product if you like rose hip tea; if vanilla is important, then pass. I would like to see Lipton consider changing the bag material to paper, though (and keep the tetrahedron design).<br /><br />*based on some basic web searching; several blogs and forums say it's PET, although I couldn't find any specifics on Lipton's website.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!

review/summary: Lovely and relaxing
review/text: As someone trying to reduce caffeine, cold days leave me missing my coffee, so more and more lately I have turned to hot tea.  Lipton is a brand I have used since childhood, and a brand I trust.  I have tried their other flavored teas using the pyramid shaped tea bag, and I love them.<br /><br />The pyramid shaped bag allows me to get full flavor of the tea.  Typically, I use my Keurig to dispense a cup of plain hot water into a mug that contains the tea bag.  If I plan on sweetening the tea, I add the sweetener as the water dispenses, so that it fully dissolves into the flavor of the tea.  For me this is a tried and true method for a quick cup that is the perfect temperature.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the pairing of blackberry and vanilla flavors.  Because I added sweetener, I did not find this tea at all bitter, on the contrary the flavor was quite lovely.  I added a bit of milk and the tea was a lovely lilac color in my mug.  The flavor and aroma both proved very relaxing.  All in all, a nice, mellow bodied taste that will become a permanent part of my tea repertoire.

review/summary: Good, Not Great
review/text: Lipton's Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags in Blackberry Vanilla make for a subtly sweet delicious cup of tea.  Tasters will see the pieces of real blackberries and hibicus flowers that enhance this beverage.  I'm not sure that the shape of the bag plays any specific role in making a better cup of tea.  It was good, not great.

review/text: I drank a cup of this tea one evening to wind down (as it is caffeine free), and although I enjoyed the fruity flavor,<br />I found the vanilla part of the taste to be a bit too potent.<br /><br />I think this flavor is more of a "daytime" tea and better "iced" than hot.<br /><br />The teabags are made of an interesting and very durable mesh that held the contents wonderfully and distributed the flavors well.

review/summary: An affordable and mildy enjoyable tea, but a few concerns
review/text: We drink a multitude of beverages in our house.  Everything from soda, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and flavored water, so we always enjoy giving new drinks a try.  "Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags, Blackberry Vanilla" is pretty standard flavored tea, here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ As with most tea, it's easy to make.<br /><br />+ Caffeine free.<br /><br />+ Contains real blackberry pieces.<br /><br />+ Affordable<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Taste is a bit mild.  Had to use two bags for a real taste.<br /><br />- Vanilla flavoring is a bit too weak.<br /><br />- Aftertaste can be bitter.<br /><br />- Poor packaging doesn't ensure freshness once opened.<br /><br />"Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags, Blackberry Vanilla" received a lukewarm reception in our house.  A lot of tea is really, well just tea and this is a perfect example of that.  "Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags, Blackberry Vanilla" isn't a bad tea by any means, but it wasn't particularly memorable either.  While it was only mildly enjoyable it is affordable and I may consider purchasing it again in the future.

review/summary: There's no vanilla in the ingredient list, so where does that flavor come from?
review/text: Although this is supposedly a blackberry vanilla tea, there is no vanilla in it according to the ingredients list. Instead, one presumes the vanilla flavor is listed as "natural flavor." You do know that the "natural flavor" which is often used to mimic real vanilla comes from the castor sacs of beavers, don't you? Yikes. According to wikipedia: "In the United States, castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of mature beavers, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a food additive,often referenced simply as a "natural flavoring" in the product's list of ingredients. It is commonly used in both food and beverages, especially as vanilla and raspberry flavoring."<br /><br />Ingredients: Hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black currant pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin.

review/summary: Great Idea, But Bad Packaging
review/text: The Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags are a great idea.  On the one hand, the pyramid shaped stiff mesh bag allows the tea inside to brew well, giving good flavor.  On the other hand, however, this tea is packaged very poorly.  The tea bags sit in a cardboard flip top container which is not very secure, and there is nothing to preserve the tea inside from waning quickly in flavor and quality.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is great- fruity without too much vanilla although there are added flavors which I am not sure I completely like.  With a touch of honey, a bag makes a coffee mug sized tea mug pretty well making it a decent strength.  Compared to soft drinks or other artificial beverages that people often drink, this is far nicer and refreshing.  The little bit of added flavors don't overpower the tea itself.<br /><br />If they would package these in individual bags or allow for some sort of re-sealable foil or plastic packaging inside the box that would keep them fresh longer, they would be much better.  For the price, however, if you use them up fairly quickly (a month or two) then it is worth it.<br /><br />If you are the type of person who likes variety and not to use up every package immediately, you may find this tea to fade too quickly.

review/summary: A Warm Season Beverage
review/text: Not what I would call a cold season tea, Blackberry Vanilla Caffeine Free Herbal Tea from Lipton has a very interesting fruity flavor, more reminiscent of a spring day than the upcoming fall season.<br /><br />The tea has a strong tart side so I would recommend reducing the brew time from the recommended 4 to 6 minutes.  Do not be put off by the deep red color, it makes you think raspberry but that is not the flavor that you will taste.<br /><br />For a change, I brewed four pyramid bags in three cups of water and after it cooled, poured it over a glass of ice.  This is my preferred method of drinking it.  I do not like sugar in my tea, but decided to give it a little whirl.  Something happened with this mix, because I came away with an artificial aftertaste.  If you prefer more of a black tea taste in you iced tea, add an extra Lipton orange pekoe bag.  A perfect combination.<br /><br />Overall, a good product for warm weather drinking, excellent iced and the tart flavor hits the right spot.

review/summary: Pleasant blackberry flavor
review/text: This tea is a vast improvement over other 'fruit flavored' teas I have tried. The flow-easy poly teabags literally gush flavor into the hot water and the tea does indeed taste as if it is infused with blackberries. The name cites vanilla as an additional flavor, and I suppose I would have to taste it without the vanilla to tell, but if there is vanilla in it, it seems to exist only on the back end of the sip of tea - meaning after you've swallowed it, if you exhale you can smell a hint of vanilla. The tea is fairly astringent, made smoother with a bit of sweetening - I like plain old sugar, (sorry, you honey-purists) but that gave it a hint of cough-medicine taste. One major gripe - or I would have given it four stars - is the ingredient named 'NATURAL FLAVOR' which is usually food-industry-speak for MSG. I'm not saying there is MSG in this tea, just that there is some mystery substance probably created in a lab somewhere. Honestly, I'd rather not consume the chemistry experiment.<br />Still, for a berry tea, it isn't bad. I'll keep it as an option to black or green and herbal teas to guests who are not as persnickety about ingredients as I, but I prefer teas to have identifiable ingredients.

review/text: I drink quite a bit of tea and am always on the lookout for different flavors of tea. This tea was a pleasant surprise! It is a fruity tea without having an overpowering fruity taste. The balance of blackberry and vanilla is well balanced and smooth. I did sweeten my tea with a smidge of Nectresse(sweetener). The tea bag are in the shape of a pyramid which helps to release the flavors into your hot water quickly. Lipton has outdone themselves with this line of tea. I look forward to trying out more of the flavors.

review/summary: Ahhh.... Very good for afternoon break
review/text: I am now enjoying my first cup of this tea; the postal carrier delivered my box today.<br /><br />The top scent/flavor is blackberry.  Yes, it is tart, but wild blackberries are rather tart here in Texas.  Your favorite sweetening agent (sugar, Splenda, whatever you like) can fix that, just as it does with the fresh berries. Granted, I don't like a very sweet tea, as many do in the South and Southwest, but I don't like my tea (regular or herbal) unsweetened, either.<br /><br />Vanilla is the second scent/flavor.  Oh, the scent and taste of home-baked cookies!  Though vanilla is the second scent/flavor, it does overtake the blackberry sometimes as a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The box listed hibiscus and other flavors in the tea as well.  They are not as dominant, of course, as the berry and vanilla; I barely taste them.  However, people with certain allergies might still need to take care.<br /><br />This is a good tea to enjoy when taking a break in the afternoon, when people often need a little something to go on until dinner but don't want caffeine.  I requested this through Vine, and I'd definitely consider buying more.

review/text: The ingredient list tells the tale: hibiscus flowers, rosehips, blackberry leaves, natural flavor (presumably the vanilla), dried black current (sic) pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin.  This isn't blackberry vanilla tea; this is hibiscus rosehip tea with some added flavoring.<br /><br />The problem is that hibiscus is an acquired taste that I never successfully acquired and do not appreciate here, but lovers of hibiscus and/or rosehip tea should add a star for each love.<br /><br />At least the pyramid shaped teabag works as advertised.

review/summary: Astringent and Sour
review/text: I have been drinking Lipton's tea since I was a child but as an adult I have expanded my horizons and have been drinking many other brands.  I'm not sure if this fact has influenced my palate or not but I found this tea unpalatable.  First of all I love the idea of the Pyramid.  Teas that have this shape of tea bag always release their essence much faster and more fully.  So, I really enjoy the shape because of this function and the shape is also esthetically pleasing.<br />The color of the tea in the cup is beautiful.  It is a rich purple color and the aroma of the tea is quite nice.  You can smell the fruit and that hint of vanilla.  However, I had about 3 or 4 swallows and that was enough for me.  I found the tea harsh, astringent, and really on the sour side.  If you have ever gotten berries that are sour (just not ripe enough), that is the taste of this tea.  For that reason I just could not drink it.  It is a great idea but when I have tea I am looking for something mellow and smooth.  While I do love my full caffeine teas (I often drink Tazo Chi), I do like a nice caffeine free herbal especially at night.  One of my favorites is Twinnings Honeybush, Mandarin, and Orange.  Now that is one smooth and flavorful herbal tea.<br /><br />I really like the idea of mixing blackberry with vanilla but this tea just do not sit well on my palate.

review/text: I like everything about Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea!  First of all, the box is very practical as it "snaps" closed to keep the tea bags fresh, which is always a good thing!  The picture on the box is appealing and shows what the flavor is to a "tea" (pun intended).  The pyramid tea bags are great for diffusion. And the flavor is wonderful!  You don't need to add sugar or sweetener but it tastes good either way.  Even a bit of honey can change the flavor but it's all good.<br /><br />I give this product 5 stars!

review/text: I love this tea.  When I made it, it was a purplish color, and kind of strong.  If you wanted it weaker you might want to not let it steep as long as I did.  You can definitely make out both the blackberry and vanilla, and they blend very nicely.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it isn't unpleasant.  I made it hot, but didn't finish it and the air conditioning was on, so it got cold.  It was quite cold when I tried it for the second time, and it tasted great!  This is the type of tea I like drinking in the afternoon; I won't be switching my morning Lady Grey tea for this.<br /><br />I love the tea bag design.  With the pyramid tea bag I can see what the tea is, rather than look through an opaque square tea bag.  The tea tasted very fresh, too.

review/text: I love tea!  I was hoping that this would be as tasty as it sounds-- blackberries! vanilla! caffeine free!  But... eh.  Sorry for the bad pun that I used for my title, but really-- it's not for me.  It smelled great in the box, so I guess that's another reason why I was so disappointed in its flavor.  I had it with honey, and it still wasn't very tasty.  The reason why I gave it two stars is that it does taste slightly better as an iced tea, but still, not something I'd routinely drink.<br /><br />As for the tea bags, they're really nice-- I love the shape and how sturdy they are.  I might have to try another one of Lipton Pyramid Teas.

review/text: These triangle tea bags are small, so I thought they might make a weak herb tea.  But it's quite pleasant in flavor, not weak, not overpowering.  My taste buds first picked up the blackberry, with a candy-like flavor, followed by the vanilla.  Best flavor is experienced when the tea is allowed to cool 5 minutes before consumption.  I do not find a sweetener necessary in this tea.

review/summary: Nice iced; not hot.
review/text: Not caring for regular tea or the caffeine, I drink herbal tea exclusively and am always on the lookout for fun new flavors.  This Blackberry Vanilla sounded delicious,, not a flavor combination I had seen before.  I should also mention that my true test for how well I end up really liking a tea's flavor is whether or not I need sweetener.  If I need it then the flavor is most likely too bitter for me.<br /><br />Out of the box, the tea bags have a bit of a dried flowers smell, not very fruity.  However, when it is brewing the fragrance is delicious!  The berries wake up, and the vanilla too.<br /><br />I tried this tea both hot and iced.  As a hot tea, the flavor was alright, but it was like there were too many herbs and not enough berries.  I did end up needing a bit of sweetener, as I felt the flavor was too earthy.  The vanilla was too subtle to detect.<br /><br />It was when I tried this tea iced that I found I really enjoyed it.  The cold seems to suit the berry flavors nicely, I can taste the vanilla, and I didn't need any sweetener at all.<br /><br />I have never cared for Lipton's pyramid tea bag packaging.  There is nothing protecting the tea bags inside of the box, such as a paper liner, and since the pyramid shaped tea bags are too awkward to be individually wrapped, it's just open tea bags sitting together in a paperboard box.  Also, the bags and string are some sort of plastic-like material, so I cannot put them in my compost bin.<br /><br />As an iced tea, I liked the Blackberry Vanilla.  But the flavor as hot tea and the less-than-desirable packaging keep me from getting excited about it.

The pyramid-shaped tea bags are novel and look rather expensive since they appear to be fabric, but the tea itself doesn't excite me at all.

review/text: Admittedly I'm much more of a coffee drinker, and I opted to try this product more for the pyramid teabag design than the flavor.<br /><br />The phramid bag design allowed for a much greater flow of water through the actual bag and, as a result, more of the ingredients are evenly infused. Additionally, when you pull the bag out of the water, the string design allows for automatic "squeezing" of the bag. No more using your hands or a spoon to press extra water and flavor out.<br /><br />Not a fan of the flavor. While I do like blackberry and vanilla, this tea, even when steeped less than the required time, seemed extremely sweet.

review/summary: Good Tea - Great bags!
review/text: Sipping a cup of tea while I write this review on a rainy day...ahh. Good times!<br /><br />Pros: the tea bags. The pyramid bag is the greatest invention Lipton could have done for their teas. Easy to bob in and out of the water, quick to steep and nice to leave in the water, strong enough to go back for refill without the tea tasting too watered down. The best? Mix a little bit of agave or stevia and it takes the drink to the next level!<br /><br />Pro: Good even as ice tea. Does take two bags for a gallon of tea, but I actually liked it a little bit better as an ice tea than a hot tea.<br /><br />Con: I wanted the taste to be stronger on the vanilla side. It didn't have the smooth taste I was expecting and associated with vanilla. It tasted very much like an herb tea, which isn't a bad thing, I just wanted the stronger combination.<br /><br />Con: the tea bag only lasts about one cup of tea. I was used to Lipton having a reputation to last forever and 'ever. But let it sit in a dish over night, there is no tea left for another cup. It's a one and done, kind of tea.<br /><br />Overall, I did like it. Good flavor, great packaging (again, love that bag!), it just didn't have the power of flavor I had hoped for.

review/text: I very seldom drink hot tea, so factor that into your reactions, please.  I drink a lot of iced tea, and this Lipton flavor makes wonderful iced tea.  I've never tasted anything like it.  The blackberry tartness is definitely there, but without making that little spot behind your ear hurt (think a very sour pickle).  The vanilla stands up to the blackberry flavor and helps cut the tartness.  I like unsweetened tea, with some form of fake sugar (Sweet-n-Low, Splenda, etc.) in it.  Even without the sweetener, I can easily drink this tea.  It doesn't get murky when refrigerated for a day or so.  And it smells good while it's steeping.

review/summary: Tea is drunk to forget the din of the world.  ~T'ien Yiheng
review/text: Being raised by European grandparents and marrying a Brit, tea has been a constant in my life. There are plenty of herbal teas out there but with company's passion for adding GREEN TEA to most blends, I've avoided the herbal teas like a plague since I'm the only person on the planet who can't abide the taste or aroma of green tea, no matter HOW it's masked with other flavours. So, I was very excited to try Lipton's Herbal blends.<br /><br />Upon opening the box, I was blown away by the heady/fruity scent! I also adored the pyramidal tea bag shape; it made sense that it would help with the brewing. I made my first cup, added a spoon of Tupelo Honey and sat down to try it. Fifteen minutes later, I made another cup. Fifteen minutes after that, I made an entire pot! Oh.What.Joy!<br /><br />Exceedingly fruity but in an utterly natural way, not as in an "artifical additive" way. The vanilla was not cloying or overwhelming but just added to the heady taste and aroma. I have since tried this blend without sweetener (nice) and iced (even nicer!) with a squeeze of fresh lime juice, which appears to amplify the blackberry taste.<br /><br />Looking at the other varieties that Lipton is offering in their herbal blends, I now have some more tasty treats to keep me company when I cozy up with my e-book and cats. (and perhaps a bit of shortbread, too) ;)

review/summary: Lovely tea
review/text: I have to say, Lipton did not disappoint with this lovely tea! The berry flavor was vibrant but the vanilla was almost non existent but the berry was a strong and solid flavor! Will definitely add to my tea collection! Oh and I didn't add any sugar or honey, wasn't needed!

review/summary: Smooth and flavorful
review/text: This is a smooth tea with no bitterness and just the right amount of blackberry and vanilla flavors.  I liked the pyramid shaped tea bags.  I think it made for a faster cup of tea.  This is decaf which makes it a perfect tea for evening time.  Heartily recommend.

review/summary: Surprising
review/text: I love tea. It is my favorite warm beverage, so I have to say I was a little skeptical with a Lipton product. I was so pleasantly surprised. If you like vanilla and berry, this is a nice sweet tea flavor, without being super sweet. I would buy this again.

review/summary: Yummy Blackberry Tea
review/text: I have only recently become fond of drinking hot tea and usually prefer a spiced chai. I decided to take a chance on the Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags when they were offered as a choice in the VINE program. I am so glad that I did. This tea has a strong real blackberry flavor that is good with or without cream. When I added half and half, I almost thought I was drinking a blackberry cobbler with ice cream which is a good thing when you need to avoid desserts. I shared a cup with a friend last week who also loved it. I'm pretty sure she will buy some for herself soon. The only negative thing I noticed is that my half and half curdled when added to the hot tea. I thought I might have some bad milk but it only curdled in the blackberry tea and not my coffee or chai. I'm not sure what to think of that but it still tasted just fine.

review/summary: Impress with strong berry taste
review/text: This is my first time trying Lipton pyramid tea bags. The tea bags are triangle-shaped, and have a silky texture. The tea bags are big enough so that when you drop them into your cup of tea, you get more flavor out of the ingredients.<br /><br />It has a strong berry taste with just a hit of vanilla. If you love fruity teas, you'll love this tea!

review/summary: Pleasing flavor, but vanilla is a bit weak
review/text: The Lipton blackberry vanilla tea has a very nice fruity taste. There is hibiscus in the tea, which helps give it a deep ruby color and adds to the flavor. Unfortunately the vanilla flavor is a bit difficult to detect because I think the hibiscus overwhelms it, so I gave it only 4 stars. But the tea tastes good -- it's just not very vanilla-ey.<br /><br />When I first opened the package and saw the little pyramid-shaped tea bags I was skeptical because it really did not look like there was enough tea in the bag to brew a cup of tea. But perhaps pyramid power worked its magic, because the tea brewed up tasty enough, even with a 12-ounce cup of water.<br /><br />This is a herbal tea so there is no caffeine. The tea tastes just fine once it cools and would probably make a great iced tea as well. However, I'm a hot tea fan, so I haven't tried this yet. There is no bitter aftertaste.

review/summary: Tea Time
review/text: Right off the bat the aroma from the opening the box will grab you!  Sweetly fragrant, this tastes as good as smells.  With just enough vanilla to balance the blackberry flavor, it makes a delicious cup of tea.  I shared it with friends and co-workers and they all loved it as well.  Lipton serves up a winner!
