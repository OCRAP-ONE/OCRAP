review/text: As far as instant coffee goes, this is the best I've found so far. It is flavorful and not bitter. Just make sure you thoroughly stir it as soon as you add the hot water. Recommended if you need a cheap, easy solution for coffee on the go.

review/text: I only drink decaf, and it's not always available at breakfast in hotels when I travel outside the US. Carrying packets of Via is a great way around this. If you use the product frequently, as I do, buying packs of 50 is a good idea. At around 60 cents a serving, the price can't be beat. I ordered in April, and my expiration date was in late 2012. It will be long gone by then!

I digress, kidding... Really if you are on the run and only can find a micro wave or a water machine that gives hot water then you're in luck Starbucks!! Ok I have tried the other "freeze dried" coffees, and they suck! Starbucks did a good job on their's. There is only a very slight hint of the freeze dried taste. Make sure your water is hot so that the coffee crystals dissolve...

review/summary: in-store 82 cents vs. 59 cents for 50-pack
review/text: In preparation for an international trip, where coffee quality would be uncertain, I bought a 12-pack at our local Starbucks store.  I like the quality and convenience so much that I use them at home.<br /><br />This is a very good price for the 50-pack, compared to packets bought in the store (12 for $9.95 = 83 cents each). Perhaps there is a similar discount on 50-packs purchased in the store but I've not seen 50-packs in any of the four Starbucks near us.

review/summary: tiny packet, huge flavor
review/text: WOW I've got to say I am a big fan of the Starbucks Via line now. I've seen it before and always fluffed it off as being a unnecessary waste of money. I mean, instant coffee isn't exactly known for bold taste, which I prefer. I'm  a "coffee snob" who needs a black or bold roast cup of cofeee every morning or I'll be intolerable. My favorite from Starbucks has always been french roast (smoky and strong). After hearing a friend rave about these, I decided to purchase them given how similar our tastes are. I tried both the Italian and French Roast Via in small packs (from target and starbuck stores). Unlike other instant coffee, it doe not include any creamer or sugar. It's just plain black coffee. Each serving pack is so small but it makes a very strong cup with the same quality taste as you would get from Starbucks itself (and so much cheaper too). Alot of people buy this because it's packaging is very convenient for daily use (throw it in your wallet/purse), as well as for travel (I hate hotel/airplane coffee). All you need is hot water, it doesn't even have to be boiling temperature. So fast, so easy. Great for making ice coffee, coffee desserts, frapuchinos, or just your plain cup of joe. Try it!

review/summary: Have You Tried It Iced?
review/text: My favorite is the Italian Roast.  I never liked 'instant' until I tried this.<br /><br />This might sound a bit odd, but I love this even more iced (or at least chilled).  I needed to go spend the day visiting an ailing relative at the hospital a couple of years ago.  I dreaded not being near some decent coffee.  I got the idea to pour a packet into a bottle (16oz) of water that I was taking along.  At least I would have some coffee with me, right.  How bad could it be?  It was great!!<br /><br />Let me say that it takes a while (5-6 minutes) to dissolve and mix properly.  I usually open the bottle, take a small sip of water (leaves a bit more room for 'shaking'), add the packet, shake, and then let it sit a couple of minutes before shaking again.  Instant cold coffee.  I later tried the Starbuck's Iced Coffee packets, but those are way too sweet for me.  I do not like it sweetened.  Those are made to dissolve quickly, but I would rather shake a little longer and wait a few minutes to have this Italian Roast.<br />Of course, you could just add the VIA to a small glass of water, stir, and add ice (which I do if I am home).<br /><br />I find I use the 'bottle method' whenever I will be away from the house for hours.  For me, I use a purse which fits a water bottle perfectly and it's nice to have.  It's also very convenient to throw a few packets of VIA in my purse while I am traveling or away from the house all day just to have with me.  You can get water anywhere, but not always a decent coffee.<br /><br />I realize the review should be ALL about the coffee, but I think anyone looking to purchase this product can be pretty confindent by the *star* rating that the taste is good.  It is!  I just wanted to add that Starbuck's made a customer of me BECAUSE of their VIA Ready Brew and not because I stand in line in one of their stores trying to figure out how to order a coffee.  lol!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00438ZXAM">Starbucks VIA� Ready Brew Italian Roast Coffee (50 count)</a>

They come in very handy when you need a mid afternoon coffee break while visiting relatives.  My coffee arrived directly from Starbucks with an April 2012 expiration date-about 5 months away.  The only improvement they could make on this product is to design a package that is easier to open.  While the packs are small and easy to carry, I haven't been able to open one without scissors.<br />Great product-highly recommended.  I think I'll try to add one to some hot chocolate next.

I would have to put twice the suggested amount to make it drinkable, and the taste is still bleh.<br /><br />VIA tastes good, and the Italian roast is nice and strong.  The instructions suggest 8oz of water, I believe.  But I usually put 12oz or a little more of water.  Near the end of the cup, there are still some micro grounds that never dissolved.<br /><br />Overall, good stuff.  Once I finish this 50 pack, I might look into other options, but this one seems pretty good.

My office uses the single pod type coffees and I always find them too weak or flat in taste.<br /><br />I like the convenience of only needing hot water to make a cup of coffee. I sometimes do not feel like brewing a whole pot. I especially love the decaf version for later at night when I want a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Buying the 50 count does work out cheaper than the grocery store or Starbucks retail stores per packet. My package had a good expiration date although it took me less than a month to finish the whole box between home and office.<br /><br />I am ordering more of the regular Italian Roast and the decaf version.

I stayed away from the Via when it first came out because I'd never had an instant coffee that wasnt nasty. But when Starbucks ran a big promotion I decided to give it a try and I'm SO glad I did. This stuff tastes to me every bit as good as a regular cup of coffee but it's WAY less expensive and super convenient. Instead of messing with coffee pots, old coffee that's been sitting for who knows how long and the like, I keep packets of this on hand at home and work and always have a fresh cup of delicious coffee at a moment's notice. It eliminates the waste of partially used pots, too.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this product and I recommend it to everyone!

review/summary: Amazing Coffee, Good Expiration Date, In Retail Packaging
review/text: Hi.<br /><br />I have been using the VIA instant coffee at the office for a while now.  This is my fourth or fifth order from Amazon for it.  The last two orders have been in modern, retail packaging with expiration dates four to six months in the future (which is fine for me).  I find that the expiration dates *do* matter with this coffee, as it tastes fresher (to me) before it is expired than after (I have had both on hand at the same time and have done a side-by-side taste comparison).  Early shipments were in what appeared to be commercial packaging not for display or retail purchase, and the expiration dates were very close (less than one month in some cases).  I promised myself that if the expiration dates did not improve that I would stop purchasing this product.  My past two purchases have been perfect, so I can only assume that the feedback from these reviews, and fixing whatever bugs there were in the pipeline, if any, has fixed the problem of expiration dates.<br /><br />As far as the product goes, it is amazing to me to taste an instant coffee that truly rivals the quality of what i can make at home with focused effort (grinding, measuring, vacuum sealing, filtering, etc.).  At work the water is of variable quality, so I bring my own spring water, use a cuisinart hot pot (on the green tea setting :-), and in a minute I have a quality-controlled, excellent cup of coffee (or a great Yerba Mate in the afternoon).  Life is good :-).

review/text: I bring these on backpacking trips. The individual packages are very handy, and the Starbucks instant coffee tastes better than most. If you want a coffee for camping, backpacking, boating, or other outdoor activities, this is a great choice. It definitely does not taste quite like real coffee, but it is good enough. I keep some of these at the office if I want a quick cup. My only complaint is the taste is a little bitter, but if you mix in a little milk it helps calm the bitter flavor.

review/summary: Easy to mistake for fresh brewed, high quality coffee
review/text: I took the Via Taste Test at my local Starbucks. I was served a cup of Via and a cup of fresh brewed. I guessed correctly which was which, but I must say it was by no means obvious and I wasn't sure. This does not resemble any other instant coffee I have ever tasted in any way, shape or form whatsoever. This is the perfect substitute when you cannot brew your coffee, like when you are travelling and your hotel doesn't offer a coffee maker but has a microwave you can zap your water in. In fact, Starbucks Via instant tastes BETTER than the "cheap" fresh brewed brands, and if money isn't tight you may even want to use it when your room does have one of those coffee makers but with the cheap coffee. This is an excellent substitute when I don't have acess to my Keurig brewer and high quality coffee at home. And it takes only a minute to make.

review/summary: Best price I've been able to find
review/text: Starbuck's VIA is a known quantity (well, for me, anyway, and probably for you as well) -- without question the best instant coffee product you'll find.  But it's very difficult to find anyone who'll sell at a significant discount off the roughly $0.85 per cup Starbucks charges in their retail shops.  I like to keep a good supply around, and typically go through on average about a cup a day.  So far this has been the best volume deal I've been able to find, with 50 packet quantities at around $30 or so coming to about $0.60/cup.  Still not cheap compared to run-of-the-mill Nescafe, but if you go through this stuff like I do, it's a good savings over typical retail.<br /><br />I didn't check the expiration dates on the boxes I received, but I've now been through two orders and noticed no quality problems of any kind with the product.  My only beef is that I really wish Amazon would put this product on their subscription plan . . . .

review/summary: Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee
review/text: I love these Starbuck's VIA packets. I'm one of those people who want a cup of coffee right after getting up and sometimes that's a problem when I travel. Even if there is a coffee maker in a motel room, the coffee provided is usually pretty marginal at best. The Starbucks instant packets make a very tasty cup of coffee with minimal fuss. It's the closest thing to well brewed coffee I've found and a far cry from the instant coffee available in stores.<br /><br />I use them for hiking and camping and always stash a few packets in my pack or suitcase just incase. They are an absolute necessity when traveling abroad, particularly in remote areas or in areas where coffee is not available or the alternative is Nescafe.<br /><br />The price is very good.

review/text: Ok that might be an extreme title, but it is sort of true.  I tried giving up caffeine many times before but never stuck with it, because most decaf coffee tasted like dirty dish water.  Since I am pretty much the only one that drinks (or tries to drink) decaf, I decided instant was more convenient.  Since purchasing Via Decaf Italian Roast, I don't have a need for the regular coffee anymore.  This is deep, rich coffee that tastes like the "real thing".  I am totally over caffeine withdrawal and I never feel deprived of a good solid cup of joe in the AM.

Buying a pack of 50 was too much since I have no idea how it tastes like so I bought a 3 pack sample from my local Starbucks. I've got to say this is definitely one the better tasting instant coffee's I have tried. I haven't tried that many to be sure but with many of the other brands, you can definitely tell that you were drinking cheap instant coffee. Those definitely got the job done but it just wasn't very fun drinking them. With the VIA, the coffee actually tastes fresh and lively. I'm not really a coffee snob and so there's not much bad to say in the taste department.<br /><br />Because I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, it can be a hassle sometimes to grind the beans and use my french press. For those times when I'm feeling especially lazy, I can now count on brewing a cup of this instant coffee. No mess to cleanup and it tastes great as well. What more can you ask for in a instant cup of coffee?!

review/summary: Not much good to say...
review/text: I bought the 12 pack of Italian roast decaf at the nearby Starbucks store, which I love and go to frequently, for those rare occasions when I want a cup of decaf at night but don't want to brew it.  But this product is not SB's best effort.  First, the packaging isn't well designed.  Tearing the top off at the "tear here" line always leaves part of the top intact, making getting the coffee out a chore, and trying to tear off the rest of the sticky top is not worth the effort.  Next, the flavor.  I know Italian is supposed to be bold and bitter, but this stuff takes bitter to a whole new level.  Not good.  Then there's the expiration.  I didn't plan to use this very often, but I'd better, because it expires in less than a month.  What?  Finally, the cost.  At nearly a dollar a cup, this wouldn't be worth it even if it didn't suffer from its other inadequacies.  A definite DO NOT RECOMMEND.

review/summary: Fantastic Coffee, BUT...
review/text: BEST INSTANT, PERIOD! BUT... I can't drink VIA made according to it's instructions. It's just way, WAY, too strong. (I'm talking seriously stronger than what you get at a local Starbucks.) Let me explain. When I make brewed coffee, I freshly grind beans to a very fine texture, using two or three tablespoons of grounds per 6 ounces of water. So I'm used to a strong cup of coffee. Since one packet of VIA makes even a large mug of water into an un-drinkablly strong brew, I use only half a packet. The problem is, a couple hours later, the left-over half becomes an unusable blob that won't come out of the packet. No great loss... I've had a GREAT cup of coffee, and I can just toss the other half packet, right? Well, acutally, that's a problem for me. I'm of the 'clean your plate / starving kids in Biafra' generation. I would prefer a smaller packet at a smaller price. So one star off from someone who was taught 'waste not, want not' and is too old to change ;-)

review/summary: Pretty good for instant coffee
review/text: I am a serious coffee drinker, I grid my beans just before I brew the coffee, and yes, I taste the difference between burr grinder and blade grinder. Oh, yeah, I am that serious. So you probably can imagine why I have been against instant coffee for years. Becasue they normally taste aweful! Sour and chemical taste, no fragrance at all. So, when a friend told me about VIA, I giggled, called her "one of those" and joked about how she used coffee to flavor her milk. (I applogize! I do i do). Until one day, another friend ask me to buy instant coffee for him. I laughted at him too. But no request from a friend is too much. I bought the smallest VIA package possible, and tasted it. To my surprise, it doesn't have that sour taste, and the chemical taste was very low and can be ignored, especially if you drink your coffee with sugar (which I strongly against).<br /><br />I like the skinny long bag. when I was choosing between scissors and teeth to open the bag, the bag was teared open so easily from the top with just my fingers. Of course, that alerted me to hide it away from my toddlers. Next thing I did was no brainer, I dumped the powder into a coffee mug, and poured the hot water in it. I doubted if I really needed to stir it, but I did it anyway. The smell was not as strong as my fresh burr grinded cofee, but good enough to believe that it was coffee. I confess, I almost helded my breath when I had my first sip, ready for all sorts of aweful taste. But to my surprise, the taste was not sour at all. I had no trouble drinking the whole cup down and licked my lips and thinking "hmm, not bad". the second thought was "I am only hot water away from another cup".<br /><br />Now, here comes to final judgement:<br />For instant coffee, this is awesome! No grinder, no loud noise. You can carry it with you anywhere you go. no scissors needed. a good cup of coffee is just some hot water away. But, can it replace the old fashioned fresh grinded coffee? No, No No. Still not there yet. But I am keeping them around th house now for the time when the house needs to be dead quiet and I was craving for a cup of coffee.<br /><br />4 star because it is still not as good as fresh grinded coffee.

review/summary: Take a sharp object to defend your self
review/text: Unlike most people, I prefer not a weak coffee but a milder roast than the burnt stuff most coffee houses make that requires many accoutrements to mask like cream, sugar and artificial flavors. Therefore, I purposely only tried the Columbian.<br /><br />I work in a place that has poorly serviced coffee "dispensing machines." They are fun in that you never know what will come out in a day-to-day basis. Some time just your coins back. A few people have illicit electric coffee pots, others use a French press, and still others sneak out for the real thing.<br /><br />Now that I discovered the Columbian Via. I have to defend my cup from all those noses that circle my cup. I know there are directions on the pack; however, I now have my own ritual. Clean cup, fill 2/3rds filtered water. 90 seconds in the microwave. Shake contents to bottom of pack. Rip the whole top off the pack with teeth. Pour pack in coup and watch sizzle. Stir for a few seconds. Add a tad of ice. Hope I can make it back to my desk before the cup empties.<br /><br />I was never a fan of reconstituted coffee however I think it is the addition of the micro-ground coffee that adds the edge necessary.<br /><br />In any event you owe it to yourself to try it.

review/text: I had to save money by breaking my $30-a-week Starbucks habit. These are great value - I bought the 50 pack for about $30 - so that's 60 cents a cup! This is by far the best-tasting instant coffee I have found, after trying lots of premium instants. I will probably buy a Keurig or Tassimo once they figure out how to produce K-cups that are recyclable. Until then, I'm very happy with my Vias.

review/summary: Great Starbucks Taste for a Quick Fix!
review/text: Starbucks has outdone themselves on their VIA line of products.  As a full-time medical student, I am definitely a caffeine addict.  Coffee is my drink of choice when I need to stay awake during long stretches in the semester, but I frequently study with classmates that don't drink coffee.  Starbucks VIA packets are the PERFECT solution for me.  I don't need to bring a coffee maker and coffee.  I just pack a few packets into my bag and go.  I must say that I was genuinely surprised at how fresh and full this coffee tastes.  Whenever I make a cup, I'm amazed because I never get that instant coffee bitterness/staleness found elsewhere.  If you like coffee, have an unpredictable schedule, or travel, I highly recommend picking up a pack of Starbucks VIA packets.  You won't be disappointed.

review/text: Once a diehard bean-grinder, I'm now a convert to Starbuck's instant Italian roast coffee; it makes a lovely dark, robust brew that tastes utterly real. It's also a great way to flavor homemade ice cream. I'm not so crazy about the milder flavor or their instant iced coffee, but this one's a winner.

review/summary: This is not your Dad's instant coffee
review/text: I lived on instant coffee all through college, and came to know its taste and texture all too well.  Because of that, I was skeptical about Starbucks "instant" coffee.  That skepticism was short lived though, after a friend gave me a small batch of Via packets as a gift.  You pour it in the cup and add hot water, give it a little stir, and presto, you have real coffee, not "instant."  I was very surprised.  It tastes good, smells good, and feels good.  It doesn't have that unpleasant, overly watery and grimy texture of the world's most famous instant coffee brand.  I would rate Via at about 94% of the quality of a cup of traditional brewed coffee. I don't use it as a replacement for my brewed coffee, but if the coffee pot at work is empty and I need a quick pick-me up, Via is just the ticket.  This could work just fine as a substitute for brewed coffee, but as long as I have a coffee pot, it is a bit cheaper than Via.

So I guess it really is up to one's own taste buds as to whether it is as enjoyable for you as it is for me. I have noticed that the first package of this instant coffee seemed to have a richer odor than the one I am using now but the taste is the same.

I gave it back to her because the Starbucks coffee is so superior & so easy, not to mention inexpensive.  Actually, when you purchase the Starbucks VIA from the internet it costs about 53 cents for 1 cup of coffee.  Which is more than 30 cents less than buying it at Starbucks itself.  The coffee is AMAZINGLY delicious.  The delivery is outstanding as well.

review/summary: Yum, but packet difficult to use
review/text: Man is this instant coffee delicious.  I love a strong coffee taste and this is almost at my limit for too strong, but not quite.  It's wonderful as iced coffee.  I didn't have a problem with the expiration date.  First order was in March and expired in December; second order in May, expired end of November and anyway, how bad can coffee get in individual packets even 5 years after the expiration date really?<br /><br />My problem is that the description says 1. POUR IN PACKET 2. ADD HOT WATER 3. STIR AND ENJOY - which is fine if you use a tea kettle.  If you microwave water in the mug first and try to use the pencil-sized opening at the top of the packet as indicated (which isn't super easy to use anyway), it steams up the opening and the coffee gets stuck.  It's messy to work around it by prying open the rest of the packet so the opening is larger, or cutting diagonally with scissors.  Even heating the water in a separate container the packet gets five out of ten for ease of use as the video demonstrates.<br /><br />Starbucks - this could easily be resolved by adding another quarter inch at the top and engineering a wider opening at the top.

review/text: I wasn't much of a coffee drinker before. Once in awhile I'd go to Starbucks to get an iced coffee but that was probably once a month and for awhile not having any coffee at all for a year. So it's not something I drank much.<br /><br />I have tried some other instant coffees from my girlfriend but didn't like them so much.<br /><br />Then we tried the Starbucks VIA. The flavor of it is perfect for what I like! It's so easy to make. The instant coffee tastes better than anything I can buy at Starbucks so I never go and buy a coffee. This saves me a lot of money.<br /><br />Since I don't drink much coffee, one cup of this has enough "kick" to keep me up all day long.<br /><br />Now I drink a cup of coffee but I go running and it makes me feel like I can run much longer.<br /><br />So I would highly recommend this. Again I wasn't a two cup of coffee per day person but now 2-3 times a week, I enjoy a cup of Starbucks VIA.

This price was cheaper than anywhere I've found for this quantity so I ordered.  I thought it would take a few days to get here in a plastic envelope.  Nope, 12 (TWELVE) days later it arrived and was shipped from Tennessee with a packing slip with the official starbucks maiden on the invoice.  Come on, Starbucks, Does all of your roasted coffee ship to your coffee shops from the same location.....no distribution centers or anything that could mail a package a little more efficiently.  12 days from time of order to receipt is a long time for a package.  I mail letters from Seattle to the Southeast every week that arrive in 3 days.  This was slower than media mail.
