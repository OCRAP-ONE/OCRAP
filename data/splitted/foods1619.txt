review/summary: CAN CAUSE`SERIOUS ILLNESS DEATH- NOT DIGESTABLE
review/text: SADLY, I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY THAT THESE MOO BULLY STICKS ARE NOT 100% DIGESTIBLE! MY DOG ALMOST DIED AFTER A PIECE DID NOT DISSOLVE IN HER STOMACH.My 3 dogs loved these Moo Bully sticks. I was buying them and giving them because I felt it might causes a chocking danger. I always had plenty of water close by. One day I noticed my dog,Lily, was having very loose stools and that were jelly like in consistency.This same day she stopped eating and began vomiting.I immediately rushed her to my veterinarian.Upon his physical exam he noted that her abdomen was hard and distended.He wanted me to leave her with him so he could do a x-ray. He did and found that she had a bloackege in her stomach!He then started a series of Barium x-rays to watch the blockage to see if it was going to pass. Over a 4 hour period of watching and repeating these barium x-rays it not only showed that the blockage was not passing, but the "item" causing the blockage was swelling in size, absorbing the stomach fluids.I was told he had to do emergency surgery to get this blockage out of her ASAP. What he found in her stomach was most definitely a piece of the Moo Bully stick! It had not digested as claimed  by the manufacture if swallowed.My veterinarian told me if he had not brought Lily in as promptly as I did,to remove this blockage, she most definitely would have died!He told me that this was not 100% digestible as the manufacture had claimed it to be . If it had been, it would have dissolved in her stomach! lily had major abdominal exploratory surgery  that lasted over 3hours, to remove this piece the piece of Moo Bully stick !She was hospitalized afterwards for 4 nights and 5 days. She almost did not make. Lily refused eat for 5 days. She therefore lost a lot of weight,became very frail and lethargic. Thank god, my veterinarian was fabulous.He was so concerned for Lily, that he actually stayed by her side at night,every night making sure he did everything he could to pull her through this.Once home she was weak and could barely walk. I tried to get her to eat and she refused. I was offering her cooked chicken liver and even this did not even entice her to eat. Finally, the next day, she did begin to nibble on some food. It was a very slow healing process and took Lily over a month until she was herself again.The thought of losing Lily tore me apart. Watching the pain and suffering she went though cannot be put into words.I felt so helpless. It was nothing but a pure hell that she and I went though for weeks on end.I was also feeling so guilty because I gave her the MOO Bully stick.You see, I only feed my dogs the very best, high quality organic dog foods. I never ever ever would give my dogs anything that was not the best and the safest. I never gave my dogs raw hide chewies or greenies( Any dog owner that cares about the welfare of their a dog knows how dangerous and deadly these products are) I started giving my dogs the Moo bully sticks because everything I had read and researched lead me to believe not only were they safe,  100%  DIGESTIBLE, but that they came from Brazil cattle that only grazed on non chemically treated grass, were not feed any hormones and drank from fresh natural spring water.There was nothing harmful in this product. So I stared giving my dogs these MOO bully sticks.I am a very dedicated,caring, responsible animal lover and owner. I wrote letters to the companies I purchased the Moo Bully sticks form as well as the manufacturer. Only one retailer responded to my letter by referring me to the manufacturer.The manufacturer of these Moo Bully Sticks, " Free Range Dog Products " totally ignored both of my certified letters. So many owners have no clue that their dogs may have become sick or died due to a piece of a Bully stick that did not digest. What if their vet missed the symptoms? What if they never took their dog to a vet after becoming ill and the dog died? What if they never discovered what killed their dog? Not everyone can afford to pay for surgery on their dogs, x-rays,lab work,medicines,and a hospital stay. My vet bill was almost $5,000.00 My vet even discounted most of what he did, as well not charge me for everything.In fact, he  he felt so bad, that he did not charge me for staying by her side for all through the night, on those  4 nights. What if a dog died or got very ill when ingesting a piece of these Bully sticks and never came forth to inform the public ? Maybe mine is the very first case? But all it should take is one, to satisfy anyone not to ever buy this product and give it their beloved dogs. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT EVER GIVE YOUR DOGS ANY TYPE OF A BULLY STICK PRODUCT!PASS THIS INFO ALONG TO ANYONE THAT YOU KNOW HAS A DOG. YOU MIGHT JUST SAVE A DOGS LIFE.I HAD TO HIGHLIGHT ONE STAR TO GET THE SITE TO POST THIS. :-(

review/summary: Awesome, no smell and picky dogs like it!
review/text: My two very picky dogs LOVE this thing!  I bought a braided one at Trader Joes and neither dog took much interest. My 15lb papillon mix chewed it for a little bit but then lost interest.  My maltese wanted nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I bought these yesterday at a local "uptown" dog store for $2.99 each.  They were sold exactly as pictured, with the label wrapped around. I think the shipping is too high to order just a couple from this seller so I looked on the company website and it looks like their distribution outlet is pretty wide (at least in SoCal).  [...]<br />There is absolutely NO SMELL to it.<br /><br />Lastly, I have a foster dog and the rescue organization gave me one of their bulk purchased 6" bully stick for her and when you compare them side by side -- the color ad thickness really differ.<br /><br />These are more of a golden/roasted color where the bulk bully stick is browner and "flatter" in color.<br /><br />I looked up the company info and it looks like a family run business. I would highly recommend!!

review/text: Tastes very tropical.  Hibiscus is naturally a very sour herb, though, be warned.  Sweetener of some sort brings out the complexity, so that you can taste something besides sour.  I recommend putting honey in it.  It's a all around great tea, good for kids or people who can't handle caffine.  I typically have it at night b/c I can't have caffine after four in the evening.  It's good for colds, too, b/c it has vitamin C in it naturally.

review/text: I love wings and unless I make them homemade, I purchase Tyson as they are the only ones sold in stores here in town but they suck in my opinion.  I was bored, scanning Amazon and thought I'd try these.  I love them.  Spicy, meaty and very, very good.  I was not thrilled with the blue cheese dip as it tasted to me like bottled Kraft but I didn't order these wings for the dip so I am still giving 5 stars!

review/summary: Big tasty capers but very salty. Dont like the jar and that they are not sealed. Two leaked.
review/text: This capers are twice the size of standard capers you buy in stores, and very convenient in the price.<br />I find them a bit too salty, even after washing them off, but most canned products are salty.<br /><br />One thing that I personally dont like is the jar: it is so tiny and long that it gets hard to pick up few capers. I usually pick up some with a fork, this way those left in the jar will remain in the liquid and last for longer. The jar small opening makes it difficult to reach them even with a very small fork. In this case, also, the capers at the bottom seem to get stuck in the jar.<br /><br />Another thing I don't like is that they were not sealed. This makes them less hygienic and especially easy to leak, in fact two jars leaked half of their liquid out during shipping. Not pleasant, also because they will last less without their preserving liquid.<br /><br />As noted by another person, the liquid they come in is not balsamic vinegar  (like the picture claims) but a less expensive mix of: water, acetic acid, salt.<br /><br />Overall I would still recommend them, despite they have some cons.

None of the others I have tried can equal the taste of St. Dalfour... and I've tried most of them. The problem is that it is becoming more and more difficult to find in any stores. I was therefore very grateful to see that I could purchase it through Amazon.

review/summary: First Rate Blend.
review/text: I really enjoy coffee, and I have ever since my teenage years. My tastes have gradually evolved and escalated. The first to go was any kind of instant coffee. How anyone could drink that swill is beyond me. Next to go was any kind of additive, such as cream or sugar. The next to go was any kind of ground coffee in a can. Some is marginally OK, but compared to whole-bean coffee, it just doesn't cut it. No, whole-bean coffee without any additives and ground on the spot is the only coffee I'll drink, short of some kind of emergency.<br /><br />When It comes to whole-bean coffees, there's quite an amazing variety. I found Trader Joe's to have an excellent selection from all over the world, and the cost (on a per pound basis) was typically about 50% that of what you might expect to pay in the local super market. I particularly liked their Columbian Supremo. The problem is, the local Trader Joe"s is a long way off and I sometimes run out between visits. Well, I've then picked up some large bags of beans, one of which was Starbucks French Roast, at my local Costco store and it was quite excellent. Starbucks is first rate, but tends to be somewhat pricey, even when purchased at Costco.<br /><br />Well, one day I discovered the Kirkland Signature House Blend bags of whole-bean coffee at Costco. In my opinion, Kirkland Signature products have always been of the highest quality but at a substantially reduced price. For example, this Kirkland coffee is almost half the cost (on a per pound basis) of Starbucks French Roast. But, right on the front of the Kirkland package it says "Roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co." Hmmmm. I just had to try this one. Well, it's excellent. It's a little less robust than my Starbucks French Roast, but I prefer it that way. I'd say it's first rate coffee at a bargain basement price. Buying whole-bean coffee at the local supermarket is now out of the question.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Prefect for Jura expresso machine
review/text: I have a Jura Capresso automatic espresso machine.  I like it, but I have found it difficult to find beans that make expresso that takes much like what you might get at a Starbucks.  The beans have to be very robust, but they can't be French or Italian roasted because that makes them too oily (which can clog the machine).  I've tried lots and lots of different beans, some quite expensive (like more than $20 / lb.).  I saw these at Costco and decided to give them a try.  They are perfect.  The flavor is great, and the roast is pretty dry so they work beautifully in my machine.

Unlike some other reviewers I am having no trouble producing a strong, rich espresso from these beans.

This is a large bag I ordered and I left the whole bag out on the counter and used it from there, but it got a little stale before I used it all.

review/summary: Promising Aroma, but Disappointing Coffee.
review/text: I enjoy whole-roasted coffee beans. Once you grind your own coffee you just can never go back to coffee in a can, or certainly not instant coffee. Well, whole bean coffees are expensive in a grocery store or supermarket. I've discovered a lower-cost alternative. I pick up two or three pound containers at Trader Joe's or Costco. The Costco source is particularly interesting in that they always seem to have two or three different kinds, but the kinds seem to change on every other visit. Over the years, I've had coffees from all over the world. This latest time there was a pallet of Kirkland Signature Dark Roast Espresso Blend (with a little tag that said roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.) The aroma around the display was excellent and I couldn't resist.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the rich aroma was almost overwhelming. My wife even loved it and she isn't a coffee drinker. The coffee itself isn't all that impressive. It has a good light tasty flavor that seems mild and slightly sweet and goes down quite easily. I'd have to guess that the caffeine content was not up to the level I was used to in other whole-bean coffees and it doesn't provide that good morning jolt. I was expecting something richer and more robust, more like a dark roast. Well, this is a nice coffee, but if you're looking for something that will grow hair on your chest, this is not the one. It has a good flavor, but it's weak. I'll have no trouble finishing the bag, but I'm disappointed. The aroma was so promising and the coffee just wasn't up to it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

So, clearly, this has been sitting around somewhere. I buy other Kirkland coffee's at my local Costco and they usually don't expire for 12 to 18 months. Unfortunately, the Kirkland Espresso hasn't made it to the East Coast (last year or so far this year), at least not at the Costco's around me, and I wanted to try it, since, even at this inflated price it's priced about the same as 2 pounds of Lavazza, etc.<br /><br />So, hopefully it will be fine when I open it, but don't buy this expecting to use it this winter!

review/summary: Outstanding!!
review/text: This reminds me of the Chicken a la King that my mother used to make and serve over bisquits. It has great big chunks of chicken, too!<br /><br />This was a great find. I've added it to my permanent list.<br /><br />[One caveat: Rather that a six-pack of cans placed side by side, I received six cans placed three on top of three. There wasn't enough packing material to keep the box from getting crushed, so one can popped through the top of the can beneath it and opened it, spilling chili all over the inside of the package. The other five survived just fine, though.]

review/summary: This chili is amazing!
review/text: I have never had chili out of a can that tasted this great, it's flavorful, it's spicy, but not too spicy, it has chicken, beans, chilies, tastes like their maybe some roasted red pepper in there. I like to put tortilla chips on the bottom of the bowl, pour the chili on top and then garnish with sour cream, cheese,and salsa Verde. Delish!

review/summary: Great nutrition in a small package - updated review
review/text: This is really a great product from Seeds of Change. An honest product that lends itself perfectly to making my whole dinner nutritious in one swoop. I order this every three months, and I combine it with a wide variety of other meal options and sauces. The spice mix that accompanies it is not very strong so I find I always need to add some sauce or spices myself. Highly recommended for a balanced diet with a good combination of grains. Actually, I add quinoa to it to make it even more healthy.<br /><br />UPDATED<br />We just received another shipment and it turns out either Amazon or the shipper doesn't store their inventory properly (overheating in a warehouse?) or the sell-by date is just plain incorrect. We go through a 12-box shipment in about 6 weeks and Amazon shipped us another one with expiration date February 2010 - but it's already expired. I got sick after eating the rice, and when we opened another package it clearly smelled spoiled. Amazon doesn't let you return food products so the only recourse is through the manufacturer's Web site. My suggestion, if Amazon says "only 4 left in stock", wait until that disappears and they get a new shipment in. That's what I'll do now.

review/summary: Okay taste, bad texture and directions
review/text: This is about the worst boxed pilaf I have ever had. Most likely due to an error in the directions when it calls for 2 and 3/4 cups water. It was soup. After the designated cooking time I had to continue cooking it with the lid off to cook off excess moisture. And even with that additional cooking time it tasted unpleasantly chewy and underdone, and caused irritating delays in preparing dinner.<br /><br />I've given this three stars because it didn't exactly taste bad (though, nothing to write home about) and might have been enjoyable if cooked properly with correct directions. However, I don't feel compelled to try it again with less water to see how it goes.<br /><br />I think the root flaw is that it is so multigrain. Different grains require different cooking times and mixing so many together like this is going to yield uneven results.<br /><br />(To clarify things I had the 'Persia Seven Whole Grain Pilaf Blend', which is otherwise identical to this. And out of curiosity, what in the world is tamari doing in a Persian flavored pilaf?)

review/text: OK.  So the back of the box says add 2 - 3/4 cups of water.  Doesnt that mean 2 cups and 3/4?  I ended up with soup!  Maybe they mean "2"  "1/2" cups which would be 1 1/2 cup?<br />The flavor seemed good and I like the fact that it is actually 100% whole grain unlike many other boxed pilafs.  Maybe Ill call customer service and see if I read the directions wrong.

review/text: This is one of the worst food products I have ever purchased.  I gave it one star only because it was not possible to give it no stars.  My dog wouldn't eat this crud. It did not even come close to the company's promise that "Every bite brings us back to those table overflowing with herbs at Velleron."  Unless the folks at Velleron use this as feed for their pigs, that claim is an outrageous lie.  I wasted my money and disappointed my family with this gruel.

review/text: Taza chocolate is hands down one of the greatest tasting chocolates one can buy.  The consistency may not be for everyone (some people don't seem to like the somewhat grainy texture) but I find it enhances the flavors.  These small discs contain such intense flavor and taste, you will not be disappointed.  I've had several different flavors and they are all amazing.  Taza has the taste of fresh, quality ingredients and carefully selected flavors.  There are fancier, more expensive chocolates out there but few compare to Taza.

review/summary: Not your run of the mill chocolate bar...DELICIOUS!
review/text: I bought this while on one of my many hospital visits to Riley in Indy to visit my grandson. I have to admit, I was reluctant to buy it, but was craving a "good" piece of chocolate. It was well worth the price I paid(I think it was 6 or 7 dollars). The texture is different from normal chocolate. It's slightly coarse, which was a nice change of pace. The taste was very bold chocolate, and it's nicely sweetened with pure cane sugar. In fact, those are the only 2 ingredients: cocoa beans and cane sugar. As you can see, I am now scouting for some more! DELISH!

review/text: I first tried this cereal in Orlando, in 2008.  It was really good.  Two years later we bought some more at Publix while in Florida again on vacation.  This time I wrote the name down and sought it in Ohio when we returned home.  Nobody had it.  Finally I found it on Amazon.<br /><br />Why do we like it?  The taste is really good, and I was surprised that it only had 7 grams of sugar.  In this day of escalating diabetic conditions, we try to limit our sugar as a preventative measure.  Newman's cereal is a well balanced blend of taste & healthy ingredients.  We need more like it!

review/summary: Great Cereal -- It *is* sweet enough.
review/text: I came to Newman's Own Vanilla Almond cereal only because I was obsessed with another cereal: Kellog's Smart Start. However, I finally realized how much sugar I was eating and was wondering if I could still have a somewhat sweet cereal but one that wasn't so sugary -- he organic part is a bonus. While Smart start has 43 g carbs (14 g sugar), this cereal only has 24 g carbs (7 g Sugar) -- half the sugar! And it's sweetened with some sugar, but some honey as well, which is a healthier sugar and doesn't cause your blood sugar to spike so much. And no high fructose corn syrup, which I'm not that against, but it some really try to avoid it.<br /><br />I don't think I'll ever get rid of my sweet tooth, but I'm sold on this cereal. My favorite way to eat it is with 1/2 a banana and a hand full of blueberries. Yum.<br /><br /> And by buying bulk, I can save $1-1.50 of what they charge in the store; for some reason you can't save any $ by buying Smart Start in bulk.

review/summary: Super Links-KEEP THEM IN STOCK, PLEASE
review/text: As a vegetarian, I have enjoyed Worthington's Super Links for years.  Last summer (2008), they became very difficult to find in ANY local stores and I got nowhere with the company when I tried to find a place to buy/order them.  One day, I tried a search on Amazon, found them listed and before I could order, they were out of stock, much to my disappointment.  However, Amazon was wonderful as they sent me an email to let me know they were back in stock, at which time I ordered a case.  THANKS, Amazon!!!<br />As for the product, we enjoy them broiled or grilled.  They are simply the best tasting hot dog substitute on the market.

review/summary: Super-Links are terrific
review/text: Super Links are terrific vegetarian weiners. Their flavor is a little like Morning Star Farms Breakfast links - but more weiner-ish. Their texture is firm and their size is plump like Big Franks. Veja Links are good, but Super Links taste much better than Veja Links. However, Big Franks have a savory flavor unlike real weiners that I like even better than Super Links. But, be warned that Big Franks are more tender in texture and not quite as firm for those who like a firm veggie dog.

review/text: I did a blind taste test of Super Links, Big Franks, Big Franks Low Fat, Cedar Lake Deli-Links and Tofu-Links, as well as Lightlife TofuPups, SmartDogs, Tofurkey dogs, and the Yves brand. Super Links won by a landslide, for both me and my meat-eater boyfriend. I tried charcoal grilling them and frying them all on the Foreman Grill. Super Links is better in both cases- slightly firmer, juicier, and grills better. Big Franks is a good runner-up, but don't get the low fat version. Big Franks does get extra points for being vegan, however. Super Links contain eggs.<br /><br />Next I'm going to try them sliced up and put in mac & cheese!

review/text: I hope these come in stock, and soon!  I'm a Seventh-day Adventist (a lot of us are vegetarians and know good veggie stuff) and would normally get Super-Links from the Potomac Adventist Book and Health Food Store in Silver Spring, Maryland.  However, they're not that close so the nearest option is Safeway but they're almost $9.00 for a single can...rather outrageous.<br /><br />I didn't grow up vegetarian but if I had a supply of these I would never miss the real thing.  They're good right out of the can (heated quickly) and into a hot dog bun.  Most of all, I love chopping a few into small rounds and cooking with sauteed onions, stewed tomatoes, sweet corn, and little bit of sugar (to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes).  Delicious over rice!  Enjoy!

review/text: The super links are very delicious. I broil them to a crispy perfection and prepare them like a regular hot dog with chopped onions, sweet relish and mustard. Toast the hotdog roll and melt your favorite cheese on it for an even greater treat. These links are the best vegetarian links on the market. One more thing, these links are good all by themselves. They can also be microwaved or boiled or fried whole or split in half for a quick meal. Enjoy them anyway you would a hot dog; even in vegetarian beans or eggs, BBQ, or smothered in peppers,onions and potatoes. How about an Italian hotdog? You will not be disappointed with this product. My friends are amazed that these links are as good as the beef or pork hot dogs that they are acustomed to. Thank you.

How could a canned vegi dogs be good?<br /><br />These vegi dogs are delicious.  They are probably the most authentic on the market flavor-wise.  Kroger used to carry them in their natural food section until someone read the ingredients and demanded they be discontinued.  Their (and my) loss; they had the best price for them in my area.<br /><br />My teenagers have grown up on these.  I like them best grilled, but my kids can eat them directly from the can.  They can be frozen if you happen to have leftovers, and will keep in a Tupperware container for several days.  While they may not be optimal for their ingredients, they are a staple in my house.

review/summary: Super Links: A Great Tasting Veggie Product
review/text: I've been eating the Worthington brand Super links for over 20 years.  I was thrilled when I found out I could buy them at Amazon. It was getting increasingly difficult for me to find them and when I did they were so much more expensive. It must be a good product for me to have stuck with them this long.  I've tried a number of other meat substitute products and none can compare to these.  They have a good firm consistency much like real meat hotdogs. The taste is the closest to real meat hotdogs as well.  Not artificial tasting. They are great on the bar-b-Q grill but you do have to use a cooking spray to prevent sticking.  They don't put out the oil and grease that real meat would but they still are not dry tasting. They cook well boiled or in the frying pan (again use cooking spray to prevent sticking). Much lower in fat and overall healthier than meat hotdogs.  I've seen this product recommended by "Weight Watchers". I raised my own children eating Super Links. Worthington also makes a product called Veja Links which I have eaten as well.  They are skinnier veggie hotdogs (sold as 10 in a can) but I prefer the Super Links which are fatter in size (sold as 8 per can). I've also tried Worthington's "Loma Linda Big Franks".  Again not very good.  Stick with the Super Links.

review/summary: More like split pea stew
review/text: When I was growing up, split pea soup was a uniform slurry of slow-cooked peas, flavored with a ham bone that would sometimes have small pieces of ham and/or carrots added in to serve. This is a different beast, but it's quite good. The base is that same split pea soup I know, but there's a lot of whole peas (not too mushy, which is nice), potatoes, carrots and chunks of ham. It really eats more like a stew than a pea soup, but it's flavorful and filling.<br /><br />The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the quality of the meat. It's not bad, but it's not 5-stars, either. A bit tough and not enough fat content to be interesting, it's really just a textural variation in the stew.

review/summary: Not as good as I expected.
review/text: I just had my first taste of Dinty Moore Meatball Stew, and I am not sure if I will order it again. Perhaps I should wait until I've had a couple more cans before writing a review, but anyway, here it goes. The stuff tastes pretty good, the sauce, a hadful of potato mini-chunks, a couple slices of carrot. The little meatballs were closer to the consistency of a hot dog than of ground meat. I think there were 5 or 6 of them, all told. Most of the content was sauce. As such, this item would be more apropos when used in place of beef gravy, say on mashed potatoes. You'd still need your main course, though. Say you cook some beef chunks and peas on the side, then mix it all together, including the meatball stew, that might work out to be a halfway decent meal. Thanks for your time.

review/summary: Best Tasting Canned Food I've Had in Some Time
review/text: I just discovered Dinty Moore's Meatball Stew this month and I love it - it's the most delicious new canned food I've tasted in some time. I have no idea how long this product has been around - it's never been available in my area before the local Big Lots began carrying it.  I find it far better tasting than Dinty Moore's more famous and easily available Beef Stew.<br /><br />I'm happy to see the meatballs here are beef and hope they stay that way as so many canned and frozen foods have recently changed the meat in their products from beef to pork or a beef-pork mix. I now always check what's in the product if it does say right out in the title or front label even if it's something I've bought for years. It would be great if Amazon would post the ingredients to this product in their listing as I'm sure many would like to know just exactly what is in the food product they are buying.

review/summary: All the basic food groups! In a can!
review/text: Ever have trouble deciding what to eat? If you're like me, that issue happens daily, almost for every single meal. And if you're like me, your two favorite foods in the whole world are meatballs and stew.<br /><br />But which to pick? You can't make meatballs AND put them in stew. Let's get real - that would take way too much time. You'd probably need a kitchen like they have on "Chopped" or "Iron Chef" (where this product may have been born). And the whole process of putting the meatballs INTO the stew? Well, that's just crazy talk.<br /><br />But Dinty Moore found a way to do it. They did it and they put it in a metal can, so even hobos can enjoy this delightful treat.<br /><br />To be honest, I found the meatballs rather un-Italian in composition and flavor, but the stew was rugged enough to satiate my lumberjack sensibilities. The only way they could've made this better is by cramming an entire block of pepper jack cheese into the can as well. But this will definitely do.<br /><br />YUM!!

review/summary: Yummy stew. Arrived promptly without issues.
review/text: I've always loved Dinty Moore beef stew for a quick meal. No, it isn't healthly, but when time is at a premium, a quickly heated bowl will do your taste buds and tummy good. I bought these based on other reviews and I was pleased buy the taste. I bought this along with some other canned goods. (See other reviews.) I'm working on building up my emergency food and kits and this 6pk of cans fit the bill nicely in quantity, price and expiration date of 12/14. Name brands aren't important to me as price, but this package was a good deal.<br />The pop-up cans arrived promptly in advertised condtion without dents. No issues here. Whether you're stocking up your home or emergency food supply, I can recommend these without any hesitation.

review/text: I have been using these treats for years.  I believe that dogs need some organ meat in their diets and I actually add these to their food (which is all homemade, FYI).  Be careful to calculate the cost on the different sized bags. Apparently Amazon, or Pooch Passions is not concerned with saving the planet by reducing packaging materials and shipping costs.  The smaller sized 14 oz. bag 1s currently the best price per ounce (11/27/08).  It's a shame.  I would have ordered the largest size bag if not.

review/text: These freeze-dried liver treats from Pooch Passions are the best ever. My little Shih Tzu and Lhaso Apso love the flavor and texture. They race to their beds at the end of the day to get Pooch Passions treats. (I used Gimborn beef liver treats and wasn't satisfied with them. I even wrote the company when the quality of the treats deteriorated and over half of a bucket would be unusable.) The quality of Pooch Passions Liver Treats is consistently high. These Pooch Passions treats can be cut in half for tiny little guys like mine. I'm 100% satisfied and recommend these without reservation. Pet test them yourself with your dog and you'll soon be buying them in the large 21 ounce bags as I do. BEST EVER TREATS!!!!

review/summary: I'm only meh about this particular Lavazza coffee.
review/text: Let me start by saying I love Lavazza coffee.  I generally get the Crema e Gusto or the Qualita Rossa and I find them both incredibly delicious coffees.  I thought I'd expand my Lavazza palate a bit and try the Tierra and so I confidently ordered the 3 can pack, but as I'm beginning can #2, I'm finding myself simply waiting out the use of cans 2 and 3 so I can go back to my regular Crema.<br /><br />The Tierra is not bad coffee - not by a long shot. It's smooth and... the word I keep thinking of is "light", especially if you're used to drinking a darker, richer roast.  It has that slight lemon aftertaste on my tongue that Columbian coffee has, and I don't like that at all so I add flavored creamer to disguise that after taste rather than my normal warmed regular cream . And once the flavored creamer is added, it disguises the good as well as the bad flavors so I'm left feeling like I'm missing out on the coffeeness of my coffee.  Also, I find myself using nearly twice as much ground coffee to make a pot as I use of the Crema or Qualita Rossa, so the cans themselves will only last half as long.<br /><br />Having said all that, I'm giving it four stars because my parents are visiting and this morning I made them the Tierra for breakfast and they really loved it.  They both prefer a lighter roast and usually cream the heck out of their coffee at my house to dilute it down a bit.  The Tierra they found delicious.  So I'm giving it 4 stars to differentiate it from my favorite Lavazzas (which are 5s!) but also to acknowledge that this is probably really good coffee for those who enjoy a lighter roast.

review/summary: Not my cup of joe...
review/text: I purchased this based on the very good reviews and while it was on a sale.  I am so happy that I didn't pay full price.<br /><br />I do not like this coffee at all.  When I opened the first tin I was concerned because it was such a light roast.  This is not at all what I would call a robust coffee.  This is more in line with Dunkin' Donuts or a Deli cup of coffee.  If you are a fan of Starbuck's or Seattle's Best roasts this will be a let down.  I wound up mixing the coffee with a darker roast in an attempt to make it more palitable.  Now I have two cans left that I don't want.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this is awful coffee, but it's not for me and may not be for you if you're used to darker roasts and stronger coffee.  I was really disappointed because people generally seem to really like this brand, and I liked the idea that it was sustainably grown.

review/text: I use this exclusively for my cappuccino maker, so right away this blend gets brewed to its potential.  I can't speak for regular drip-grind or perculators.  When used as cappuccino in a dedicated cappuccino maker, this brand can't be beat.<br /><br />Right away a cup of this coffee reminded me of a few gourmet brands I've tried lately.  It reminds me of a rich Colombian; not too weak and not too bold and worthy of daily enjoyment.  The coffee is not bitter.<br /><br />These beans are a fine grind with a golden brown hue.  Regular drip brewers may find the grind too fine.  It worked well in my espresso maker and makes a tasty cappuccino.  Don't let the light hue trick you into thinking this is weak coffee.  It is not!  When brewed correctly, it is a wonderful blend.<br />I downloaded a photo of the coffee grounds. One can see the golden-brown hue of the beans and the fine grind.<br /><br />Edit 11 Jan 11:  Apparently this brand isn't a big seller at Amazon and the company has a surplus of this in its warehouses.  Amazon has been offering this brand during its Friday sales, sometimes as low as $8.80 for a three-pack.  There is a reason for this:  the last four packages of this coffee have had an expiration date of 30 May 2011.  It's no big deal to me as I use three cans a month on average and will run out of my stock by May, but for someone who may only occassionally brew a pot of gourmet coffee, this may be a concern.  Coffee will remain drinkable months after its expiration date if kept sealed and/or in a dark, cool storage place, but it can not be sold.<br /><br />Edit 12 May 11:  The price has dropped back down to $14.99.  I gave the rating a star back.  I still have quite a few cans from my splurge purchase last fall.  The coffee still tastes great.  Apparently this coffee's price keeps fluctuating so buyer beware:  at $15 or less this coffee is a great deal, but at a higher price you may be better off going elsewhere.<br /><br />Edit 3 Nov 2011:  Holy Coffeebean, the price is now past the mid USD 20s!!!  All of my Lavazza coffees have gone up in price.  I've been drinking the 8.8-ounce bars lately; it's a bit cheaper but tastes just as good.

review/text: This is NOT a grind for a drip machine, but if you're lured by the low price, take a chance and mix a 25% to a drip grind and it will be fine. The problem with a fine drip will be clogged grounds and murky coffee, if used in an auto-drip machine. However this is terrific for a Chemex or Melitta. It is a lighter roast, fairly smooth without a lot of complexity. I bought 3....then bought 3 more that became happily received gifts. Personally I really like this coffee, and while NO coffee can please all people, the price makes it painless to try.

review/text: I happened upon Tierra at a TJMax and thought I'd give it a try.  Best decision I've made.  The  medium roast can only be described as "mellow". It has a rich, smooth, full-bodied flavor without a bite. A cup of this coffee is a great way to start the day. It is the closest coffee to Starbuck's discontinued "Lite Note Blend". I now keep a stash (3 pk) on hand to ensure I don't run out.

review/summary: Amazing Coffee!
review/text: My fiance introduced me to this coffee and I may never find another coffee that is smoother, richer, and makes me feel good about purchasing it!  Being that it is sustainable and fair trade is just bonus points to how amazing it tastes and smells.  I would recommend this product to anyone!

review/summary: Sour flavour, best brewed with drip
review/text: I found this coffee to be quite sour and unpleasant.  I tried various grind sizes, and both drip and espresso machines.  Since I bought 3 tins, I experimented and found that medium grind drip brew worked best for me.

review/summary: Not Bold but Good
review/text: If you're in to bold flavored coffees, then this is probably not the one for you.  I thought it was a step up from Dunkin' Donuts.  Maybe because it does have a little different flavor. I am not a coffee junkie, so sorry I can't give a more detailed review.  But if you want a good cup of coffee, this would more than likely satisfy. I got it on sale for $10, which I thought was a good price.  I would not pay the normal $20+, but for ten bucks, it's worth the price.

review/summary: Lavazza smooth interesting and non bitter great coffee
review/text: This coffee was on sale and after reading reviews I figured I would give it a try.  I bought on accident (long story) nine containers of this coffee when I got the package I was over whelmed. Opening the container the coffee is very finely ground and very light in color but brews a wonderfully delicious cup of coffee and suprisingly dark.  I did add a little more then normal for a stronger brew. Your brewing results will vary as with any coffee factors such as  how it is brewed, the tempature, the water etc can make great coffee not so great.  Most of my cups of this were great and is now one of my favorites.

review/summary: Still an excellent  cup of coffee.
review/text: The Lavazza Qualita Oro is definitely a notch up from this Tierra label the Qualita Oro is a bolder tasting coffee, this being said, the Tierra is not bad, in my experience it tastes a bit bitter....  I've tried to adjust the brew (as in faster or slower drip) and you can brew a decent cup of coffee.<br />With coffee it's a matter of taste, but I like my coffee bold tasting, yet not bitter.<br /><br />Best coffee I've tried so far is the: "Douwe Egberts Douwe Egberts Filter Blend Ground Coffee, Medium Roast, 8.8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)", the Lavazza Qualita Oro, the Trader Joe Sumatra coffee among other fine coffee.<br /><br />Bottom line, if Amazon has a Friday Sale and they have the Lavazza Tierra on sale, you can't go wrong, you will surely enjoy this coffee, but for 25$ I push the extra buck and buy the Dauwe Egberts or the Lavazza Qualita Oro coffee.<br /><br />But one thing is for sure, you can have the best coffee, but if you use a bad coffee maker, of a dirty coffee maker/ bad water... it would never taste excellent.

review/summary: Upping the star rating after several months of drinking this coffee..
review/text: 1st cup down, second cup being enjoyed. My can says it expires 5/2011 - I have no idea how far out they set their best used by dates, so I've no idea how long this has been around. However, my first and second cup of coffee were flavorful and NOT bitter or sour. I paid next to nothing for this coffee and would again, but I wouldn't pay the nearly 8 dollars per can it is now when I paid a little more than that for 3 cans. It wasn't a knock your socks off, I can never drink another cup unless it's this cup of joe - but it's smooth, mellow, and enjoyable, especially when I paid next to nothing for it. If I'm going to pay nearly 8 bucks for a 1/2 pound, I'll go up to the local coffee roaster and get it fresh. (oh, normally I don't get my coffee in ground form, I usually grind it myself, but this was soooo inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.)<br /><br />Side note - this is an espresso grind. I had no trouble with it floating or clogging, but I sprinkled it with some cold water to wet the grinds a bit before I started the brewing, that helps keep them from floating up. I also propped open the little spring loaded cover to the coffee basket with a skewer so it was as open as it could get. Result was a clear coffee and no mess. Ratio - one level coffee scoop per cup as measured on the carafe.<br /><br />edit update 3/29/2011 - I've now had about 9 cans of this coffee - it's my go to coffee, it's still smooth mellow and enjoyable and I've given it an extra star for consistency, it's been good through all those cans, when ever it's on a decent sale (usually on the Friday Sale) I buy it again, just got another 3 cans. I also use it for the rub I put on ribeyes and a rub I made up to put on a pork butt for pulled pork...good stuff!  :)

review/summary: Just OK. Similar to DD coffee.
review/text: Just wanted to try it when it was about $8. Nothing to hurt. Just as other Arabica coffees, it gets sour when exposed to air awhile. If you don't like sour coffee, just drink it up as soon as it gets brewed. Medium roast, and somewhat bitter and a bit cheap taste like those cheaper version of Forgers.<br />I wouldn't purchase this again. I didn't really know what it meant by "sustainable ground coffee", and just wanted to try something new.

review/summary: Bright breakfast blend in an espresso grind
review/text: This bright, winey coffee is reminiscent of Kenya AA or Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. Fans of Lavazza's usual espresso roasts may find themselves disappointed by the lighter roast of this Tierra! blend. However, if you enjoy a moderately acidic, medium roast every now and again, this coffee is not only fresh and flavorful, it's ethically and sustainably produced.<br /><br />The fine grind lends itself to use in a stovetop espresso/moka pot, like the Bialetti <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CF3Q6">Bialetti 6799 Moka Express 3-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a> or the more affordable Imusa <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00164QTY0">Imusa Espresso Coffeemaker, 6 cup</a>. If you're using a filtered drip coffee maker, you may want to mix the Tierra! coffee with a coarser grind. Indeed, mixing in this way allows you to mellow the brighter flavors of the Tierra! with a richer, heavier roast to your tastes.<br /><br />Note that this coffee doesn't seem to be a house favorite, so the cans you're sent may have a more immediate "best by" date than others. My late January 2011 purchase has a "best by" date of late June 2011. The way we drink coffee in my house, however, this is not an issue at all. The cans are vacuum packed and the fresh aroma is immediate once you remove the seal. The taste is clean--no oxidation or off-flavors.<br /><br />For the price, you should give this quality coffee a try. With some curiosity and experimentation, you can blend it with your favorite roast to get the flavor and mouthfeel you want, and support sustainability in coffee production at the same time.

review/text: I bought this coffee because it was on sale and fair trade. In the end, the taste wasn't so great. It always tasted like diner coffee which is not up to my standards. I won't buy again.
