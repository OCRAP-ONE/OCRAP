review/summary: DELICIOUS COFFEE
review/text: I purchased these coffee pods for my one-cup coffee makers.  My clients love the coffee.  It's not too light and not too strong.  Just perfect.  After I open the packet, I keep them in the freezer until I use the pods.  They keep perfectly fresh and aromatic.

review/summary: Good coffee, but do watch out for differing batches
review/text: OK so most people seem to like this coffee; it's got a strong rating (4 1/2 at the moment), but there are still those that say they don't. It will always be subjective; many people detest Starbucks coffee, but millions more like it. Some like it bold, some like it weak, some like it mild, some like it bitter, some like it sweet; no way to please everyone.<br /><br />This coffee is on the mild side, meaning it has flavor but its not overpowering, and is moreso on the sweeter side, meaning it's not bitter like diner-house coffee. The great thing about this flavor is that it blends excellent for those that like to flavor their coffee; because it is not bitter but still has a noticeable coffee flavor, it compliments most flavored creamers. I've had many many different types of coffees with many different types of creamers, and it can be a real balancing act to find the right blends. The senseo medium roast so far has been the best "starting point", meaning nobody I've personally made coffee for has said anything but complimentary things about it. Some still like a more bold or bitter coffee, but so far nobody has said poor things about this coffee. I use a single pod in approx. 6oz of coffee in a cheap Hamilton Beach drip machine with filtered water, and it turns out great.<br /><br />One other thing, sometimes batches taste 'slightly' different from one-another; it's a product from a plant when all is said and done, and while controls are put into place to regulate the taste, sometimes batches are slightly more bold or bitter than another, it happens with all manufacturers (including Folgers and other large manufacturers, which I've personally tasted radical variations). I've ordered this 6-pack around 6 times so far, and only one batch was slightly odd tasting (had a much more noticeable/bitter flavor to it), other than that it has been very consistent. I left the bag slightly open on that batch, in essence making it "go flat" so it wasn't so bitter. While these packets are sealed, make sure you store them in a sealed container after opening to preserve the flavor.<br /><br />One other thing to watch out for: increasing costs. This pack is still a great deal on Amazon, but I am worried since they have made the decision to pull from retail outlets that it will increase in cost on Amazon as well. I still love this coffee, but if it goes up to $40 for a 6-pack of this, I may be rethinking the coffee I purchase. Keep it low in cost and at the same level of flavor and we'll all be happy.

review/text: When local stores ceased carrying Senseo coffee pods, we turned to Amazon and found them, surprisingly touted as both "new and used."  We elected "new" for obvious reasons.  Our package arrived earlier than promised and delivered to our doorstep.  The quality is the same as was previously purchased at our local grocery store except there was no need to drive.  What a deal!  Good coffee, too.

review/summary: Sara Lee Senseo Coffee Pods, Dark Roast
review/text: Despite the Douwe Egberts name on the label, Senseo Dark Roast is not particularly good coffee, but the price is right; the pods fit the Senseo coffee maker, and they are probably the least expensive dark roast available, although calling it "French Roast" is a misnomer.  When I feel wealthy and successful, I splurge on Community Dark Roast pods or Lavazza gran filtro, both of which are much better coffee and cost twice as much.  Still, the Senseo system beats the heck out of trying to assemble an espresso machine while half-asleep early in the morning.

I like to put a little milk or cream in the cup before running the Senseo machine - heat it first in the microwave for 20 seconds - turns out like a latte with foam on top.<br />Ordering the coffee pods through Amazon is also a plus. You get a good price and you do not have to worry about looking for the coffee at the store (which is hard to find).

If you have a senseo, this is the one I would recommend.

review/summary: A little disappointed!
review/text: I have been a Senceo coffee fan for quite a few years and have loved the rich taste, aroma and flavor of the "SENCEO" brand coffees. Lately the pods I have received are covered with coffee grounds and invariably each pack of pods has 1 or 2 pods that have separated enough to allow the grounds to leak out. The orifice through which the coffee passes as it is brewed becomes clogged with these grounds and your cup is empty at the end of the brewing cycle. The vacuum that is created during the brewing does not allow you to open the machine until the pressure subsides. The pods must then be removed once the pressure releases and the pod retainer must be removed and cleaned. "I must have the cleanest pod retainer because I am cleaning it after having tried to brew every cup of coffee lately". It seams that the quality control needs some attention! I will continue to use "SENCEO" brands of coffee because there really is no better pod coffee available. I have tried them all. They either do not fit in the pod retainer or the quality of the coffee is suspect!<br />I would love to know when the delux coffee maker will again be offered, I loved the ability to use a taller coffee cup with the adjustable coffee spout.

Another advantage is keeping track of how many cups I drink each morning. Just trying to be Senseo (sensible) about how much I consume each morning! I'm on automatic delivery for this coffee and that makes things a whole lot easier. Thanks Amazon!

review/text: As many now know Sara Lee has sold their beverage business and ceased making this fine product....such a shame<br /><br />We been drinking the dark roast Senseo Coffee for several years and it never disappoints.  The flavor, aroma and wonderful crema of this coffee easily compares to those coffees from coffee shops.  It is easy to use and Amazon makes it easy to buy...with subscribe and save we get the six pack for less than 25 cnets a cup (actully 21 cents).  That's good coffee and good value.  We recommend this coffee without reservation.

review/summary: Senseo Medium Roast and others
review/text: I think it was about 6 years ago that I bought a Senseo Coffee maker.  Since that time, no other coffee has come close to being as good.  I admit, McDonalds Special roast, or whatever they call it, is good, but not nearly as good as Senseo.  I have tried all their unflavored roasts, (mild medium and dark) and they're all good.  I've just really taken a liking to medium roast.  When I go to a restaurant now, their coffee is like colored water in comparison.  I would recommend the Senseo system to anyone.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBH9YO">Senseo Medium Roast Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Rich, strong coffee
review/text: My husband is the big coffee drinker in our household, and he loves the Senseo coffee pod system and the coffee that the pods make. We have the Senseo coffee maker, and he brews the Expresso coffee using the 8 oz setting, because the 4 oz setting that he uses for his Columbian and Sumatra is too strong for the Expresso brew. He loves the flavor occasionally but it's not his favorite -- the Columbian ranks first and the Sumatra second. The great thing about the pod system is that he can brew different flavors and have a cup of each without having to brew a whole pot of any one flavor. The Expresso is very rich and very strong, and a nice change occasionally when he is in the mood for a real coffee "high". If someone added sweetener and creamer, it would probably work to brew the 4 oz cup, but my husband drinks his Expresso blend black, so the 8 oz setting is better for his taste.

review/text: I use Senseo coffees at least twice a day. We have several flavor and roast varieties. Senseo is a Dutch roast coffee but the pads are made in Belgium. The medium blend is a very good tasting coffee and just right for me. This is the pad we use most often, and when making two cups at a time in the Senseo machine, we combine one medium roast with one decaf pad.... gives us a half-caf cup with great body and flavor.

review/text: I have been enjoying medium and dark roast Senseo coffee for several years. I find the quality cosistant and excellent taste. The Senseo coffee machine is simple to use and creates a cup of coffee very rapidly. I particulary like the foam that the machine automatically creates on each cup of coffee which adds a special taste feature to the early sips. Over time all of our guests have always enjoyed and complimented us on the fresh and good coffee. I purchase all my Senseo coffee from Amazon. Their pricing is more favorable and delivery is always efficient.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Senseo DARK ROAST coffee pod was acceptable as an alternative to brewing my usual Sumatra beans from Starbucks. I made the transition ONLY because I was having shoulder surgery, and knew I would have very limited use of my hand to make coffee. I am surviving better than I thought I would, but at some point will go back to brewing. One thing pod-coffee-making lacks is that "wonderful aroma" of the brew! But this works fine for now. Warning--if you crave the aroma as well as the taste of your coffee in the morning, then this is NOT FOR YOU!

review/summary: Hassle Free Coffee!!!!
review/text: This product loses one star because it tastes a bit like instant coffee, but you get used to that flavor fast as the months roll by without need of maintenance. Gone are the days of pulling out a filter, a filter tray, a coffee pot, and for some a grinder for daily washing. You merely take out the tiny pod tray and rinse it off when you're done drinking coffee for the day. If you use filtered water, there won't be any calcium deposits. The only thing you have to watch for is green algae growing in the water reservoir, but that takes a really long time to develop. This coffee and it's hardware are effortless to make and maintain. A little pricy, but such a time saver!!! I would definitely recommend SENSEO.

However, now that Amazon offers the Sensor Pods in Breakfast Blend, I have been very happy, and love my morning coffee now.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product; and, THANK YOU to Sensor for offering it on Amazon.

review/summary: My Senseo
review/text: I can't tell you how happy I am to have found this program and my coffee. It is getting harder and harder to find my coffee for the Senseo machine. It seems to be being pushed out. My machine is perfect and I have a second for backup. I need my coffee. It comes once a month and the cost is actually a few cents less than buying it in the supermarket.  Also there is the entire selection to choose from. I hope this stays around for some time, I love Senseo coffee. It is rich without being bitter.

review/summary: Wonderful cup of coffee
review/text: I was having a hard time finding coffee pods for our Krups coffee maker in the stores in my area.  I purchased these Senseo coffee pods and they are wonderful.  We usually make the 7.5 ounce cup so the coffee is flavorful (medium roast) and not too strong or bitter.  The pods fit nicely in the machine, unlike some that we've tried that are too large so that the machine leaks water everywhere.  I order by the case and it comes every 3 months, so I don't have to worry about hunting them at the store - plus, the price is nice.

review/summary: Don't settle for these!
review/text: Everyone I know that uses a pod brewer at home or work loves it. Fresh coffee made to order, endless variety, no waste, etc. It is a shame that so many settle for the coffee pods made by big commerical roasters like Melitta and Douwe Egberts. The blends used by these big companies are bland and boring compared to all the great coffees offered by smaller roasters. Having had the opportunity to taste a variety of pods, I hope the list below of my favorites is helpful. Many of these are also much better coffee at a lower price! Many of the pods listed below are around 30� per pod, while the Senseo pods are over 31�. All the specialty coffee pods below are also individually wrapped for freshness too.<br /><br />Best dark roasts<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GV22">Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Espresso, Coffee Pods, 25-Count Boxes  (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CCU83E">Wolfgang Puck Coffee Pods, Provence Blend, 18-Count Box (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZX2AG">Reunion Island Privateer Dark, 18-Count Coffee Pods, 0.335 Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Best medium roasts<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O036GU">Reunion Island Colombia Las Hermosas, 18-Count Coffee Pods, 0.335 Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CCXVKG">Wolfgang Puck Coffee Pods, Rodeo Drive Blend, 18-Count Box  (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />Most unique flavored coffees<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQNVTE">Baronet Coffee Vanilla Fudge Swirl Coffee Pods, 18-Count Box (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZX2D8">Reunion Island Chocolate Butter Crunch, 18-Count Flavored Coffee Pods, 0.335 Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Best decaffeinated coffee<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O036HO">Reunion Island Swiss Water Process Decaffeinated Dark, 18-Count  Coffee Pods, 0.335 Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Best fair trade organic coffees<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013M4MC6">Fratello Coffee Company Guatemalan Organic Fair Trade Coffee, Pods 18 Count Box (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CCVTEQ">Wolfgang Puck Coffee Pods, Fair Trade Organic South Pacific Blend, 18-Count Box  (Pack of 3)</a><br />Reunion Island Fair Trade And Organic French Roast, 18-Count Coffee Pods, 0.335 Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I hope the list above is helpful in getting the most from your Senseo!

review/summary: Senseo is back!
review/text: Yay! Senseo has returned! At least the medium roast is available now. We ordered next day service and paid the extra fee just to get our Senseo. I had called DE and talked to them and they were having problems getting the Senseo to the US. Thankfully, my Dutch friend had no problems getting Senseo in Holland and so shipped us some in the meantime. Geez, I could open my own Senseo store! LOL Anyway, our Walmart had Melitta for the immediate need, but nothing is as good as DE's Senseo.<br /><br />Can't wait for breakfast blend and sumatra to return.<br /><br />Alley<br />Grand Prairie, TX, USA

review/summary: Yeah, the product is great, but what's up with the price increase?
review/text: I just ordered the Senseo dark roast pods on the Subscribe & Save plan last week for $23.95.  Now, I checked my Subscription account and see that the price has increased to $30.02 for this plan!!  What's up with that?<br /><br />This increases the price per package to $1 each!!  I'm not having luck finding this product in stores anymore, so I'm kind of stuck with this increased subscription plan as well--since I'm not ready to give up my Senseo machine after a 7 year habit of drinking Senseo coffee.<br /><br />I just want to know why Amazon increased the price on this subscription plan, and why did they not send any emails to inform subscription customers about this?!!  If had not logged on to check my subscription account, my next auto-billing would've come as a surprise and I would not have deducted the correct amount from my bank account for the next shipment!!<br /><br />But yeah, the Senseo machines and Douwe Egberts/Sara Lee pods are the best!!

review/text: My husband and mother did not like the coffee from the Senseo coffee maker. I was about to throw the pot out, then I gave the Kona pods a shot. They loved it, now they'll drink a few cups a day. As a former barista  I recommend definitely giving the Kona pods a try before ruling out the Senseo coffee maker.

A dash of Nutmeg on top.<br />It's close enough to Starbucks for me.  :-)

review/summary: One of the best balanced Senseo Pod Blends
review/text: It is only 10% Kona, so if you are expecting a true Kona taste you may be disappointed.  However, as a general blend, this is far smoother and has a more full flavored (but not full bodied), not burnt taste than most of the Senseo Coffee Blends.<br /><br />I wouldn't have minded if the coffee was a bit stronger or full bodied, but still, as it is, it is my go to blend for my Senseo.

review/summary: Great Coffee..  Great Price
review/text: I've spent the last 5 years or so trying different coffee makers and types of coffee. Jura-Capresso Super Automatic to a Rancilio Silvia a "true espresso lovers" machine. While traveling I needed a small easy coffee maker that would be an easy set up and inexpensive. After reading reviews I purchased the Senseo machine for $50. on Amazon and have tried several different Senseo pod samples..  settling finally on the espresso..  It is truly a wonderful cup of coffee..  Strong, not bitter and very close to the "real thing"  Any coffee lover will appreciate this product after trying several of the coffee varieties.  And although the unit has gone up to around $65. it is still a bargain in my opinion. I now purchse the Senseo Espresso monthly on Amazon and receive a 10-15% discount. A real bargain. Buy it.. you won't be dissapointed!

review/text: Being from Chicago area, I love good strong, full bodied coffee.  And this product is just that.  The Senseo brews it well but these little pads of coffee give you only one European size cup not the big hit-you-in-the-eye cup. So don't go cheap, push the demi-tasse button and drink a real but small cup of coffee.

review/summary: This is so convenient, and I LOVE fresh coffee!
review/text: Imagine having a freshly-brewed cup of coffee every time you want a cup? No more icky, old, disgusting coffee that has been sitting on the warmer for an hour - and you feel you ought to drink it because after all, you made it. Well, this is your answer. These are a nice balance between the old standby can of coffee, and the (very) expensive (for me, anyway) Keurig coffee pods. I only drink one big cup of coffee in the morning anyway, so these are so perfect for me. If I really crave a half cup more, just slip in one pod and make a half cup. It is a little more expensive for me because I use two pods at a time to make my coffee really zing. No more wasted coffee! And a fresh cup every time. I don't think it gets any better than that. Unless you can afford to go to Starbucks every morning - and up here in cold, snowy Michigan, who wants to do that???? I love this coffee!

review/text: Received fairly quickly.  I have been using pods for years so not a new concept.  I bought for use with solofill which is another review.  Did not work that well.  I am now using the pods in my Starbucks French Press mugs with my Keurig.  Just throw the pods in, dispense the boiling water, put the cover on, pump a few times and you can either pour into another mug or just start drinking at your liesure.  I will have to see how the subscription works.  I had enough purchase for free shipping so I will see in two months when the next shipment arrives.  The medium roast is not strong at all.  No floaters to strain through your teeth.

To make your coffee even more delicious using the Senseo machine, always remember to run the machine once without any coffee.  After doing so, immediately brew using this Sumatra coffee, and it will be extra foamy and delicious.

review/text: I initially bought the senseo machine because I wanted a machine that could brew one fresh cup at a time for my office.<br />I don't like the idea of hot water running through a plastic cup as you get with the K cups from Krupps.<br />Additionally, the Kcups are very expensive in comparison.<br />I have tried probably all of the senseo coffees and I love them all.<br />The only recommendation that I have is that they put an organic coffee on the market.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a one cup machine, get the senseo.
