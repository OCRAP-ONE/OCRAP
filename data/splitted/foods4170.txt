review/summary: Horrible Deal
review/text: Seeing such great deals here for Green Mountain Coffees, i assumed they would have the best deal on my Dark Magic blend I love. Most of the come in 2 packs with 24 in a pack. but the Dark Magic is clearly the exception. It is way over priced here. I can get an 18 pack in Target for $10, but low and behold over at coffee cow a 24 pack is 12.99 much better deal.

review/text: In 2010 when I bought my Keurig K-cups were about $.42 each. Now they are $.60 each! My Keurig has been just taking up counter space now. And K-cups are too much plastic and foil waste for the land-fill. I want to like this product but it just doesn't make any sense. And the coffee is bitter.

review/summary: Smooth and rich
review/text: Green Mountain Coffee Roasters began life as a cafe in rural Vermont. They specialized in quality coffee, and continue that tradition through to today.<br /><br />Now, with a name like Dark Magic Extra Bold, you might expect an overpowering coffee - you know, the kind that will grow hair on your chest whether you want it or not? Well, in fact, this coffee is smooth and rich, and (if made right) not overpowering at all. I find this to be a delicious coffee, one that I enjoy any day of the week.<br /><br />(Review of Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold K-cup)

review/summary: Hits the Spot in the Morning
review/text: My Doctor only allows me two cups of caffeinated coffee per day, and if that is all I'm going to get, then by George this is the brand and the roast I'm going to be drinking!<br /><br />Rich, full bodied and aromatic. A hint in the aroma of spices, deep dark color, a taste that will perk you up and get you ready for the day.  There is  no bitterness, and this Dark Magic makes an excellent iced coffee as well as a superb hot coffee.<br />I also drink this later on in the day, (I drink more cups than I would like to admit in public) decaffeinated and it shares the same attributes as the fully caffeinated one.<br /><br />As far as expense goes---well yes it is more expensive than a store brand, but it truly is worth it. Not everyone shares my addiction so it won't be as costly for you as it is for me, and I think it works out to be about 66 cents a cup (without additives of sugar, creamer etc.) a far cry from anything you can get from any coffee shop, or drive thru.

review/text: There is nothing so good as Dark Magic.  I wasn't that crazy about it when they changed it to be stronger a few years ago but now I like it.  I keep my Keurig brewer at the smallest cup setting and use 2 Dark Magics to fill a cup.  It's heaven.<br /><br />My husband likes coffee water (as someone in a review labeled it)and he goes for the Breakfast Blend on a larger cup setting.  But that is the wonderful thing about K-cups.  You can each have what you want.

review/text: The extra bold hints at a flavour that is strong with solid highpoints and this selecion is close to ideal. I have been using the Sumatran for a while but it was not strong enough. This selection is a little stronger but it tastes like a bit more roasting is all that separates the two. If you use this for a travel cup (8oz or more), it will not be as flavourful. I found that this flavour "grows" on you and a work colleague of mine absolutely loves this one.

review/summary: Not the same quality!
review/text: I compared the 18 cup Dark Magic (from Target) to the 50 cup Dark Magic(from Amazon), since the labeling and k-cup is markedly different.  The coffee did not taste as rich, so I became more curious.<br /><br />I opened the k-cups to find the 50 cup filters have a visible cross hatch pattern, as compared to a dense firm paper style.  I used a microscope to see the difference in density, as well.  The weave of the fibers of the 50 pack is not as closely bound.<br /><br />The coffee granules are finer in the 18 cup, giving the coffee a different texture on the fingers.  The 50 pack ground coffee appeared 50%-100% larger under the microscope.<br /><br />I hope that Keurig can shed some light on my findings!  I have photos I can submit.  I notice amazon is out of stock, currently.  Perhaps, Keurig is looking into the matter.

review/text: My partner was getting distressed with the lack of taste in her K-cup coffee (my bad, since I'm the one who buys the coffee), and she requested something with a bolder taste. So, I tried this. We have used Green Mountain Coffee before, but not this particular product.<br /><br />Bottom line. My partner really enjoys this. The taste meets her expectations. Indeed, although I am supposed to keep my intake of caffeine fairly low, I have also tried this on occasion--and I, too, am satisfied.<br /><br />So, if you want a bolder flavor, this is worth considering.

review/text: This is a robust, aromatic and satisfying blend with balanced acidity and no bitterness.  It's a complex roast that's reminiscent of espresso with a subtly sweet taste, I love it.  I have had a difficult time finding truly strong, yet flavorful coffee for my Keurig brewer--Timothy's coffees are too acidic and Van Houtte blends lacked complexity--and  I've finally found several extra bold flavors from Green Mountain roasts that really deliver that morning one-two punch.  For comparison, my other favorites are the Espresso blend (sadly now discontinued) and Double Black Diamond (a bit more of a smoky flavor).  And for the most potent flavor profile, the Barista Prima Italian Roast is magnifico!

I went onto Amazon to purchase a box and discovered they were at least $1 per cup! I couldn't justify spending $1 per k-cup when I usually drink several cups of coffee each morning. I did a search for extra dark coffee and found these for significantly less.  This coffee is perfect.  Rich, dark, flavorful, not at all bitter.  Smooth and delicious.  If you like dark roasts (French, Italian, etc) and have a k-cup machine, this is the coffee for you.

review/text: I just recently got my first Keurig machine (I say first because I love it, and plan to get the bigger pro model eventually), and a couple of sampler boxes. This was the best of the flavors I sampled, and that says alot because I loved most of them. I am a lifelong espresso drinker (Cubans start giving their kids sips at like age 3) so I like a strong coffee. This one is definitely that. It doesn't, however, suffer from the bitter aftertaste or "burnt" flavor of many bold blends. Best of all, with the Keurig machines you get the same flavor EVERY time.

review/summary: Product has changed
review/text: I've bee subscribing to this coffee for months now and have had multiple shipments, all quality until this last shipment.  I opened the new box today, made a cup, and wondered why it was so watery. Made a second thinking it was a fluke. It was not.  Seems now 3 kcups into the box, the whole box is full of kcups with about half the coffee in them there should be.  Instead of it being strong and bold like dark magic is supposed to be (I've drank this coffee daily for two years now so I should know)... It's weak and watery even on making a smaller cup of it.  Amazon won't let me return it.  I'm a dedicated amazon customer and use subscribe and save for many items.  If they won't treat me like a dedicated customer I might be stopping my membership.  Hoping they'll make it right.

review/summary: favorite 50 cent KCup is still elusive
review/text: Am still searching for a 50 cent K-Cup with decent flavor. This particular Extra Bold K-Cup is ok but is not anything special. Looking for discounts is tedious and tiresome. Have pretty much decided that the 50 count or 100 count "value" packs offer the best price available. Others swear by CostCo so it does help to shop around but the 50 cent K-Cup is still elusive. Extra Bold K-Cups as a whole seem to have better flavor than the regular variety.

review/text: We ran out of K-cups and I absolutely cannot begin my day without my coffee-jolt.  (WAY better than Red Bull, etc.)  Green Mountain Coffee is our preferred brand/flavor, so I decided to scan through Amazon.com to see if they carried it.  A 50-count box of Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic, (Extra Bold), was available at a crazy-low price, so I ordered it.  Not only did it arrive in perfect shape, before the promised delivery date, but there was 51 K-cups in the box!  A bonus!  Great coffee and great service at a great price!

review/summary: Awesome coffee
review/text: I bought the Keurig because when I wake up in the morning I'm a zombie that runs into walls and can't see past my nose, so I wanted a machine that would take any possibility of brain power needed out of making coffee for that oh so needed caffein punch in order to wake from my stupor. I have found though that the k-cups tend to produce watery and bland coffee at best, which is why it was such a nice surprise to find these dark magic extra bold k-cups! These things actually taste like decent coffee and aren't watery or acidic. Thanks green mountain for an awesome product and for curing my morning zombie woes! Oh and although a small gesture, I noticed that they shipped me 51 k-cups, thanks for the 1 extra!

review/text: I have been drinking dark magic for a long time, this in no way compares, its horrible, watery. I should have been suspicious when the coffee pods were floating free in the box rather than packed in the company box. I thought the first cup was an accident but today it tastes just as bad. Very disappointing and no return policy. Don't buy it its junk.

review/text: I needed to change up from the coffee that I was drinking due to it being so much money. I tried a breakfast blend but it was so weak I gave the rest away. Decided to give this a try and so glad I did. The taste is right up there with my old favorite Dunkin Donuts coffee and the cost is much lower. I use fat-free half and half and splenda so it does make it alittle weaker, so thats perfect for my taste buds.

review/summary: great trick and delicious for ribs or brisket.
review/text: I've lived in apartments with no outdoor space for years-- but can always get nicely smoked foods by using these bags.  True, your entire home will smell like wood smoke, but not such a bad thing (you can always undercook a bit, take the meat out and finish it outside the bag if you don't want a strong smell to linger).  The times for cooking and the recipes included on the inside are right on target every time, you really can't go wrong.  Makes wonderful brisket-- I let it cool after cooking, slice it, and then add sauce and reheat.  My friends and I agree that the poultry/fish bags aren't quite as good.<br /><br />The first I tried was a similar import from William's Foods, but they no longer carry these.  Wish I could get them locally, but this works!

review/summary: EASY TO USE GREAT SMOKEY FLAVOR!!!
review/text: I have been using these smoker bags for several years. the first time I used them I bought them from my local Cub foods grocery store. i however now just order them on line since I can get them year around. I have used them on the grill, but mostly inside in the oven. I use them mainly for smoking ribs and turkey legs. They always come out perfect. Everyone compliments me on the flavor and tenderness of the meat. I usually finish them up on the gas grill with barbeque sauce for that perfct taste. I have given these away to friends nd family and they are now using them. I would be really surprised if anyone tried them and didn't like them.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I used a smoker bag to make incredible pulled pork. I used a 6 lb pork shoulder and seasoned it. Placed in the smoker bag at 225. I put mine in the oven at midnight and let it slow roast till 7 am. I was afraid at this low heat it would not get smokey enough but it was perfect. I pulled the pork apart in the juices from the bag and it was as good as any pulled pork I've had.

review/text: To the person who rated this low to due getting just 1 bag...read what you order. Very unfair to rate a product 1 star due to your own error.<br />The bags are great!! So far I've only tried the alder one which gives a lighter taste than the mesquite.<br />*Read the instructions WELL on the INside of the cardboard*<br />I bought a 4-pack of rainbow trout from [...] and rubbed kosher salt inside the fish a couple of hours before cooking. Preheated oven to 475F, placed 1 large cubed zucchini and the 4 fish inside the bag, folded closed and placed on a low rack. Lowered temp to 375F after 15 min and continued for another 25-30 min (3 lbs of fish) = perfection! My kids were crazy about eating "fish tummy" and this couldn't have been any easier to cook or easier to clean up.<br />A very light smoke lingered around the kitchen, but nothing that I'd need to even open the windows for. If the smell is a problem, use your bbq (instructions include oven, coal or gas grill).<br />Too bad the price is such a rip off...these are available for under a buck in Finland.

I followed the directions exactly and all I got was a smoky house and smoky clothes. The ribs had a weird and faint wood taste not smoky like you get on the grill. YUCK! The ribs were the worst I ever tasted. I usually don't do reviews unless I feel it's necessary and this is one of those times. I really expected to have good results. I give this one TWO THUMBS DOWN.

review/summary: A Great Tea
review/text: As an iced tea addict I'm always looking for a nice black tea with a lot of flavor, great aroma, without the bitter taste you get from a lot of off the shelf brands. First thing I noticed about this tea was the size and shine of the leaves. The leaves are good sized and all the oils are there. Brewed it has a nice clarity,no cloudiness,and I make it by the gallon. Even with an 8-10 minute brew time,I like strong tea, its not bitter,just full of flavor. Hot or iced it has really impressed me with all the subtle flavors involved. The high end caffeine kick is nice too. Well worth the cost of shipping.

review/summary: Refreshing tea
review/text: This is a great tea for mornings.  It is refreshing, lemony with a subtle mint at the back of your throat.  Sometimes I add mint leaves or a mint tea bag as I'm brewing a pot for an even mintier version.  I would definitely recommend this tea to anyone who likes citrus flavors.  And there's no caffeine, which makes it great for anyone who is caffeine-sensitive.

review/summary: Cockta, Slovenia's Hidden Gem
review/text: I traveled to Slovenia in the Summer of '10 where I saw this in the local food mart! To be honest, I thought the name was funny and wanted to give it a try. Being American, I would have pronounced this "Cock-tuh", but after going on a tour my Slovenian guide pronounced it "Coke-tuh". You can only get this product in Slovenia, or pay an importer for it.<br /><br />It is caffeine free, and is made of natural herbs. While it is a carbonated beverage, it is on the flater side, and while you get a hint of Coke essence, the blend of herbs really comes out in this beverage, making it an especially good Summer beverage as it is light in taste.<br /><br />Truly unique, I love Cockta!

review/text: The only complaint I have is the item is not readily available.  I have been asked to wait and that it will be available shortly.  Otherwise, my family and I are extremely pleased with the product and hope it is available soon!  The cereal is fresh and packaged nicely, and the price is very good compared to what I have seen offered in other places.  This is also the only place I can buy a 40.5 oz. box.  Other stores only offer 16 oz. boxes.  But comparing the price per ounce, it is much more economical to buy through Amazon!

review/text: My local chain stores seem to have problems keeping this cereal in stock. When I buy 3 boxes I get free shipping so I don't have to run around looking for it, it's cheaper than in the store and comes right to my house. What's not to love.<br />I eat this stuff every day, mixed with Barbara's Oat squares. It's a great combo.

review/summary: My Favorite Cereal
review/text: I have been eating Great Grains Raisins Dates and Pecans Cereal for a few years now.  I simply love it!  It is wholesome, crunchy, nutritious, flavorful, and never disappoints me.  I feel like I'm eating something healthful and it stays with me until lunchtime.  I've purchased it from Amazon in these large boxes for a few months now and find that the quality is the same as smaller boxes, if not better.  There are two bags in the box, the only drawback being that they don't have individual boxes, if you can call that a drawback.  I would say it's environmentally friendly.  I just secure the bag I'm using with a large "chip clip", and leave the large box in my pantry until I need the last bag.  The shipments have come packaged well and fresh.  The price is comparable to what I've paid in the past, if not a bit cheaper.  Try it!  I highly recommend!

review/summary: My Favorite Cereal
review/text: CEREAL<br />I love this cereal. I eat it regularly and look forward to it in the morning. It is sweet with a good nut flavor, very balanced. The first time I tried it out of curiosity and immediately loved it. It maintains its texture in milk fairly well, but the flakes go a bit soggy if you let it sit. The pecans are not hard or difficult to chew.<br /><br />PACKAGING<br />It comes in a big box with two individual bags inside. It is typical of the big warehouse store packaging. We have no problems with freshness or crunchiness after opening.<br /><br />VALUE<br />I first found this at my local Costco, but they stopped carrying it. I found it on Amazon for a great price with Subscribe & Save, so that's how I've been getting it for the last few months. For a good quality cereal, it is very reasonably priced. Hopefully they get it back in stock because we use a lot of this at my house.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Love this cereal but I wish it was easier to find the other varieties. Also, yes, this may be a 40.5 oz box but there is WAY less cereal than that. It comes in two bags and each one is only 3/4 full. The bags are also only about 3/4 as tall as the box. So you are not getting THAT much cereal for approx. $8. Probably better to buy this in the store if you can find it.

I was so surprised on 9/4 when I got an e-mail thanking me for my order.  I only ordered 1 small item, I love the fact that I got an e-mail from the president of the company letting me know my order was appreciated.  The order came promptly and in good condition.  And the most important thing - the kitties LOVE it! Thank you.

review/summary: Package weight
review/text: This product page doesn't really say how much actual catnip you get. Under production dimensions, the weight is given as 3.4 ounces, while the shipping weight is only 3.2 ounces (makes you wonder what they don't ship you). On the package, the stated net weight is 1.0 ounces. I've purchased this item twice and the last time I weighted the catnip while it was still in the bag. My postal scale reported a disappointing 0.8 ounces. That's probably just a fluke, but it's disappointing none the less.

review/summary: You Sojos People Have Ruined My Cat!
review/text: Thanks a lot! I am now the owner of a demanding stoner cat who will accept no other catnip. I've only had this nip for a week, and she already knows what the can looks like. The minute I go anywhere near the can, she starts screaming at me like a banshee for her nip. I tried giving her her old nip (which shall remain nameless) and she turned up her little black nose at it. So, yeah, she knows the difference.<br /><br />All I have to say is this: Bob is about 5 years old, so I figure she's probably got at least another good ten years in her.  So, you Sojos people are going to have to keep making this nip for at least another 13 or 14 years, just to be on the safe side. It's not my fault, it's y'all who've created a monster.<br /><br />P.S. Bob loves you guys, and if she could have kittens, she'd name them after you.
