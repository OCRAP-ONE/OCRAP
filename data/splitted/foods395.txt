review/summary: Bahlsen Waffeletten Cookies
review/text: I am very happy with Amazon service including the speedy shipment. I am also very happy the product Amazon is carrying. This product is only available in selected specialty stores in the area. And tend to be expensive. Sometime they only carry small selection in store. You have to wait long time for a special order. Amazon is making the product available with a wide selection of variaty and affortable. Thanks.

review/text: I LOVE these cookies.  Most cookies are too sweet for me -- not these.  However, since they follow the  European trend of using  natural ingredients, they are full of saturated fat from butter and cream.<br /><br />WHO CARES?<br /><br />They are the best cookies, for me, in the world, comparable only to<br />"Feullitees Doree," which can be bought on in France.

review/text: I bought these cookies for myself and as a gift for my dad for his birthday. Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad.

review/text: I really like these cookies.  They are made with pastry dough - lots of thin, flaky, crispy layers with a very light coating of honey (or something like honey).  The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It's a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!

review/text: I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.

review/summary: Daughter-in-law and I LOVE these!
review/text: My daughter-in-law, Tyra, and I were recently at Lincoln City on the Oregon Coast, and were checking out of a store when I spied the Tillamook Pepperoni sticks.  I bought a couple for both of us and we couldn't stop talking about how good they were!  I decided then and there that I would search out the container with these tasty pepperoni sticks.  And, lo and behold!  I found the exact kind here on Amazon, AND I got the last pack of 24.  Waiting now for a new shipment.  Was planning to hold out and give the entire box to my daughter-in-law for Christmas, but I couldn't resist.  So, now I'm waiting for more to show up here. And, just so you know...there is a big difference in these that come in the container, and those that are individually wrapped in the plastic that pulls open from the top.  These are more on the dry side and not moist with some kind of something or other that inside the plastic.  Not nearly as good, but also from Tillamook.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat these salty, spicy, savory sticks is with an apple.  Juicy, sweet Fuji apple and bites of this pepperoni.  Yum!

review/summary: Perfect for Dry Mouth
review/text: I recently started a new medication and unfortunately one of the side effects was dry mouth. My doctor recommended I try sugar free lemon drops to help alleviate the discomfort of dry mouth. After doing some research I decided to give Brach's Sugar Free Lemon Drops a try. I was a bit hesitant ordering a whole box of these lemon drops without knowing how they would taste, what the after-taste would be like and even if it would work. After having used them for couple of weeks, I wholeheartedly recommend this product. I keep a bag in mine and my wife's car, one at work, in my night stand drawer and in a candy dish in the kitchen. My wife usually hates the taste of most sugar-free products because of the after-taste, but I was surprised when she said she really liked these! Give these a try if you too suffer from dry mouth and see if they work as well for you as they have for me.

review/summary: totally fooled my friends with this awesome cake
review/text: This cake tasted as good as a home-made (or better!) cake but took 1/2 the time.<br />Seriously. And I'm a total baking (as well as natural foods) snot!<br />Not convinced of my credentials?<br />You should see the rye, sourdough and challah breads out of my oven today.<br />Not to mention the batches of cookies.<br />The amount of flour and butter I go through on a weekly basis for cookies, cakes and breads would let you know: i'm the one person in 100 whom you'd classify as a good home baker. I'm definitely not a "mix" baker. And while baking my own birthday cake just seemed un-festive,  asking someone else to bake my cake seemed like it'd spell disaster.  But Someone else offered. And that Someone Else, not as comfortable with my cake pans as I, used Naturally Nora. And both of these baker "elves" agree: "it was delicious and easy to make." And from my guests' opinions,<br />no one could tell the difference between this mix and home-made. Soooooo tasty. And the icing mixed up as a breeze.<br />Next year, when I'm considering mixing up my own birthday cake or using a Naturally Nora Mix, the decision is easy. Nora. All the way.<br />!<br />You won't believe how easy and tasty it is.<br />I'd show you a picture, but there's none left.

review/summary: terrific all-natural cake mix
review/text: What a great idea! Nora's chocolate cake and yellow cake mixes are now staples in our kitchen. My daughter discovered that the chocolate cake mix makes great brownies if you decrease the baking time. She makes them for all her sleepovers and everybody thinks they are homemade. She also makes a wonderful coffee cake with the yellow cake mix, spreading a mix of cinnamon and brown sugar and cocoa over the batter and swirling it in with a knife. I'm delighted that she has started to bake on her own and that the ingredients are all natural -- Nora's mixes cost a little more than the artificial-ingredients mixes from Betty Crocker and Duncan Hines, but they are worth every penny. Highly recommended!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DWEZYQ">Naturally Nora Sunny Yellow Cake Mix, 19.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DWEF8W">Naturally Nora Cheerful Chocolate Cake Mix, 19.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Just Okay
review/text: I ordered this cake mix because it has less chemicals and especially for the lack of partially hydrogenated oils.  The reviews were very good and there was a coupon available so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Unfortunately, the cake is a little dry and the flavor is not as strong with chocolate flavor as I would like either.  I have baked it twice now...once as cupcakes and as a cake and the second time I even changed the milk to whole milk and used coffee for half of the liquid. It didn't seem to make much of a difference. It's definitely better than having no chocolate cake, but the flavor of Duncan Hines is more in line with what I'd like to taste. So, after I use the mixes (think I'll try to do less time than recommended for increased mositure)I am going to try and perfect a handmade version.  I had the VERY best chocolate cake at a cafe far from my home a couple of years ago and ever since I just can't get over it.  I hope to some day get close.<br /><br />If less chemicals and more convenience is essential for you, I think this is a good option. Just don't expect it to taste like the normal cake mixes.

review/summary: Very bland
review/text: I ordered this based on the glowing reviews and was so disappointed.  It is the blandest chocolate cake we have ever tasted.  I've made three boxes of it and always end up spitting out my first bite of the final product.  It also calls for a ton of eggs/oil.  It's just not good at all.  I do, however, love that it is natural.  I don't think "natural" should have to mean "bland", though.  In my opinion this needs a much stronger, richer chocolate flavor.  In my last batch I tried adding chocolate chips for some additional flavor and it did not do the trick.  Not sure what to do with the last three boxes.

review/summary: Great for anxiety
review/text: I read about St. John's Wort from a herbal medical book, and bought some for my son. He is in college and is intense on getting good grades. With the difficult study load, his anxiety became worse. He tried a couple of the antidepressant/anti anxiety pills, but they had too many side effects including drowsiness, irritability and fatigue. So, I suggested he try this product. It was recommended in herbal literature I read to use the tea instead of capsule form and that is what I got.<br />He drinks the tea while studying which also seems to help his concentration. Now a couple of his friends drink it. They all say that it works. I tried it just to see how it affected my son. I don't suffer from anxiety but am hyper. I think it does have a calming affect without annoying side effects. I would recommend this but start out with just one cup until you see how it will affect you.

However, these seem to have more teeth cleaning ability than the regular treats.  I am happy with this purchase and will definitely keep them on hand as an alternative snack!

review/summary: Daisy Loves These More Than Hot Dogs!
review/text: I like to feed my dog healthy stuff but one dog trainer wanted me to bring "high currency" treats so I bought some hot dogs and Daisy certainly enjoyed them.<br /><br />However, she actually goes nuts over the Holistix way more than she ever did for hot dogs and I'm happier feeding them to her. And they're not so stinky to carry around, and not perishable either.<br /><br />Daisy is about 14 pounds and I break the Holistix into 3 or 4 pieces. It's a little crumby but that way she gets several treats over the course of the day. I use these to help motivate her not to bark at dogs that we pass on our walk. When I mention "treat" she starts dancing on her hind legs walking backwards sometimes half a block in anticipation of one little morsel of Holistix!<br /><br />I have been buying the Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples, and Blueberries variety. I think we tried another variety once and it was OK but mostly I've just stuck with these. On amazon they are listed as "Menhaden Fish Meal." That is what is listed as the fourth ingredient right before "whitefish." I knew it was the right item by the blue label area and the picture of the bag. Previously I had bought them elsewhere.<br /><br />These are not cheap but if you break them up like I do and ration them out, as you should with all treats, a bag lasts quite a while.

review/summary: A Good Chew
review/text: Our shih tzu Piper had dental surgery to remove four broken teeth. Her dental surgeon vet blamed hard chew treats for the broken teeth. In hindsight some of the chews were so hard that I had to use a saw to cut them in half for sharing between the two dogs. The vet advised us to use the bend test. If the chew isn't flexible, don't give it to your dog.<br /><br />The Nylabone Healthy Edible passes the bend test. Looking at the bone-shaped treat, one would think it is a hard object and a long lasting chew. Piper and Gabby both like these chews. Depending on the dog, these treats can be long lasting without jeapardizing the teeth of the dog.<br /><br />Being a spudophile, I'm pleased that ingredient number four is potato starch. Despite the Nylabone name, these chews contain no plastic. Also lacking are sugar, salt, preservatives, and gluten. The ingredients are natural and it is edible and highly digestible as advertised. Our pooches give the American made Healthy Edibles their barks of approval.

review/text: Our 14 lb Mini Schnauzer easily started splintering this bone in a matter of minutes and being an 'ever hungry' dog he just swallowed these pieces. Seeing this I took the bone away after he ate about a third of it. Less than 24 hrs later when it was time for his breakfast at 7:30 AM (his standard time) he refused to eat! This was the first time he ever refused to break his overnight fast!! But after a few minutes the hunger must have gotten the better of him; he gave in and ate almost all of it (usually he cleans up his little bowl) and about an hour later he threw up all of it in FOUR rounds of puking!<br /><br />I could see small, softened yet still relatively firm pieces of this Healthy Edible "bone" in his vomit. What a shame I went for this thinking it would be a great alternative to feeding my dog indigestible nylon.

review/summary: Dorset cereal
review/text: This is the best cereal. I like to use it as a base and add more oats, nuts and cranberries but it is great by itself too.Not too sweet, no overpowering spices like too much cinnamon and plenty of fiber. Great with fresh berries. I wish Amazon still carried more varieties of this product as it is so hard to find without paying huge shipping costs.

review/summary: Love the cereal, don't care for the new, small size
review/text: I am on the record in several reviews here at Amazon as saying that in my experience, which is pretty good with mueslis in the US and Europe, Dorset Cereals make the best mueslis anywhere. This cereal is no exception. I truly enjoyed this great blend that concentrates on sunflower and pumpkin seeds for a nutty flavor, and on raisins and date for sweetness.<br /><br />What I don't like is Dorset's new packaging in 12-ounce boxes. I have noticed at local stores that this is the new standard size across the board -- a dramatic reduction in size per box of 30-40% compared to the previous standard sizes of 18-21 ounces per box.<br /><br />While sizes have been cut, prices have remained essentially the same. This is basically a price hike of one third or more. Raising prices is actually fine, but doing it by cutting box sizes seems sneaky and rubs me the wrong way. Dorset has priced itself out of the market for me for a while.<br /><br />If the price seems reasonable to you, I repeat that Dorset makes outstanding products and you can't go wrong on that score.

review/text: I read about Dorset Cereals in the British magazine Country Homes & Interiors and was thrilled to find them, for a short time, at local grocery stores. I am so happy amazon carries them because they are amazing.  The quality is very good, and it makes an excellent muesli with yogurt, shredded apple, vanilla yogurt and a bit of maple syrup.  I have tried the blue box (my favorite), the orange box and the purple box.  I can't wait to try the other flavors.  Thank you, amazon, for carrying them.  They are expensive but worth it.

review/summary: Extremely bad packing of product
review/text: I ordered 2 cases of Campbell's soup.  They were obviously packed by an incompetent employee - who just put the tray of cans in the bottom of a much larger box and threw a couple of pieces of bubble wrap on top.  Both cartons arrived with no external damage, but the heavy cans had shifted around, in one carton 3 were open, with soup spilled around.  In both boxes, several cans were dented.  This was not the shipping carrier's fault - this was just incredibly poor packing.  I sent a photo and described the damage in the packaging review that was available right after purchase.  Amazon did not bother to even acknowledge that.  Beware of ordering any canned products from Amazon, I certainly will not do it again.

review/summary: These are Not Gonna Last Long!
review/text: Well, I was cruising the snacks isles of my local Costco Warehouse store and found these Kirkland Signature "Everybody's Nuts California Pistachios with Salt and Pepper" in a three-pound bag. I couldn't resist! Yum! These are great! They're nice and fresh and have a zesty salt and pepper taste. I love just regular pistachios, which I usually buy, but these have an extra and quite delicious kick. Three pounds is a big bag, but these won't last long, I assure you.<br /><br />We're going to have a small party within a few weeks. I'm going to put a bowl of these out with the pre-meal munchies. My bet is that the word will spread fast and they won't last long.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: They tasted awful. I've had many different salted and salt & peppered pistachios, but these are by far the worst I have ever had.

review/summary: WAY OVER-ROASTED!
review/text: These pistachio nuts have a really good flavor.  However, this was compromised by the fact that well over 50% of the nuts were in the roaster too long.  When nuts are roasted too much, as they carbonize they become harder and more bitter.  Instead of "green" in color, too many of these were "brown" which means they were overdone.  I used to roast peanuts and nuts like these would have been fed to the pigs.  These are "supposed" to be guaranteed by Kirkland, however, this is not honored by them. Don't corporations know that lying is a sin?

review/summary: Best Chocolate Anywhere
review/text: I've tried virtually every chocolate out there.  I like dark chocolate, but not too dark.  I find the 85% and even 70% cocoa chocolates a bit too bitter.  The Lindt Bittersweet Chocolate has 49% cocoa content which makes it a dark chocolate, that still retains a smooth chocolate flavor.  Other brands often have a slight aftertaste or other non-chocolate taste that detracts from the chocolate itself.  But the Lindt Swiss Bittersweet Chocolate bar has a smooth pure chocolate taste with no aftertaste of any sort.  The only thing I would suggest to Lindt is to change the "white" wrapper of this chocolate.  It makes too many people think this is a white chocolate...which it is NOT.  It is a dark chocolate. The cover wrapper should make that clear by actually showing a picture of this brown Cocoa chocolate.  Other than that, this is the best chocolate in the world.

review/summary: Best "melt in your mouth" dark chocolate
review/text: I want to affirm what other reviewers have said about this chocolate.  It is a truly "dark" chocolate that is not bitter and thus perhaps too sweet for some who are looking for a bar with a higher cocoa percentage.  This melts great and has a very smooth texture.  I like it especially because I can place a square between my cheek and gum and it will slowly melt giving me lots of chocolate flavor.  I have been having trouble finding it in stores because, I presume, tastes are shifting to a higher cocoa content.  I am happy to be able to find it online.  I suggest not buying a case in the summer as it could be damaged sitting in a hot truck awaiting delivery.

review/summary: The best chocolate on the planet
review/text: In my opinion, Lindt Bittersweet is the most delicious chocolate on earth. It's perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter.  When it's fresh and at room temperature, it's smooth, velvety and completely satisfying.  No matter how many other chocolate bars I try -- and one could try new ones infinitely these days -- Lindt Bittersweet trumps them all.  Every time I come back to this bar, I feel completely satisfied.  A lot of dark chocolate hits only the back of your tongue, or has a chalky undertaste.  This one is more encompassing.  More complex, has just the hint of caramel that even good dark chocolate should provide, and yet it's never cloying.  If they ever stop making this old standby, I will be a chocolate lover without a country!

review/summary: Tone's Cumin, One of Our Favorite Seasonings
review/text: We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TVHLD4">Tone's Ground Cumin (16 oz)</a> rapidly at our house.  We love Mexican food, and we like to use large amounts of cumin in anything we put chili in.<br /><br />I love the earthy taste.  While developing the recipes for The Collard Patch, we found that cumin goes wonderfully with collard greens.  We also like it with crawfish. Cumin is compatible with many flavors.<br /><br />Here is a popular recipe from The Collard Patch using cumin:<br /><br />  Crawfish Tortellini Salad<br />Ingredients<br />� cup thinly sliced green onions with tops<br />1 small jar artichoke hearts, drained<br />1 cup small fresh mushrooms<br />1 cup large pitted ripe olives<br />1 cup fresh red bell pepper, sliced<br />1 cup thinly sliced carrots<br />12 ounces frozen crawfish tails<br />1 cup olive oil<br />1 teaspoon salt-free Creole seasoning<br />� cup red wine vinegar<br />� cup lemon juice<br />1 tablespoon spicy mustard<br />1 teaspoon Splenda�<br />� teaspoon crushed red pepper<br />� teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br />Salt substitute to taste<br />1 tablespoon minced garlic<br />1 teaspoon cumin<br />1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped<br />1 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped<br />1 cup seedless golden raisins<br />1 package (14 ounces) cheese tortellini<br />4 ounces (� cup) feta cheese<br />4 cups tender baby collard leaves, chopped<br />4 cups Romaine lettuce, torn into small pieces<br /><br />Preparation<br />Place the first 6 ingredients in a big bowl.<br />Place � cup olive oil in the blender.  Add the vinegar, lemon juice, mustard and all the remaining powdered seasonings.  Blend until it is well mixed.  Stir in the parsley and basil.<br />Pour the blended dressing over the ingredients in the bowl and marinate them covered at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.<br />Saut&eacute; the crawfish in � cup olive oil and Cajun seasoning about 5-7 minutes.  Even though there will be other seasoning mixed with the tortellini, each individual crawfish needs its own spiciness.  You don't want those crawfish to get lonesome.  After you saut&eacute; them long enough to catch the seasoning, set them aside to cool.<br />Cook the tortellini according to the package directions.  Cook it al dente.  Drain it in the colander and allow it to cool.<br />Toss the crawfish, tortellini, and raisins with the vegetable mixture.<br />When you serve the salad, place it over the greens.  Garnish it with feta cheese.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Cumin is believed to help with digestion, to be a natural laxative, to relieve insominia, to help with bronchitis, and to prevent the common cold.

review/summary: An exotic delight
review/text: I recently went to dinner at a Moroccan restaurant and has the most delicious fruit salad there.  What made the dish so special was the combination of orange blossom water and mint that the fruit pieces were stewed in.  I bought this product to recreate the dish, and love it.  I also put it in a combination of espresso and hot milk, along with cardamom, to make an authentic north African-style coffee and it is far better than anything you can buy in a fancy cafe.  Granted, orange blossom water is and acquired taste, and I would not recommend tasting it by itself.  It is much better served in small portions, mixed with fruits, nuts, coffees, teas, and pastries.  A superb product!

review/summary: THEY RUINED THIS GREAT PRODUCT!!!
review/text: Altoids - Spearmint. It was a great product. Alas - it is gone - probably for good.<br /><br />For several years I've been seeking out this wonderful item - and no other mint (I'm loyal - for good reason). It had a delightful flavor - not as strong or overpowering as some of the other Altoids flavors. No - it was just right. Sweet, minty, but not too strong. Something I would always offer to visitors just because I knew they'd like it. (An analogy would be the flavor of Scope compared to regular Listerine. Scope has a much more pleasant flavor than the hit-you-over-the-head taste of Listerine, if you know what I'm talking about.)<br /><br />Over the past couple of years, the number of retail outlets that carried this flavor had diminishted down to only one in my area - CVS (after Walgreens stopped carrying it). They still carry it. But, just last week, I went to the store and picked up my monthly stash. I noticed that there is a new banner printed on the top of the tin, "NEW GREAT TASTE! SAME PUNCH!"<br /><br />Well, today I finally used up the last of my old, trusty batch and popped into my mouth the first of the new tin, and I found out - to my horror - that they have totally changed the product in a manner that is most unpleasant. I'm so disappointed.<br /><br />The new Altoids Spearmint flavor is completely altered. I really hate the new flavor. It is very strong (not unlike the peppermint), and has lost much of the delightful sweet/mild flavor the old spearmints had. Needless to say, I will be returning my unopened tins as soon as I can get over to the store.<br /><br />I sent a letter to the US distributor (Wrigley's) complaining of this awful change. Not that it will do any good.

review/summary: The Where's Waldo of Mints
review/text: Thank god for the internet, as I have only seen these mints in one store while visiting Florida. Locally (Philly) I have yet to see these in any store, and believe me I've looked everywhere.<br /><br />These are a great alternative to the overly powerful Peppermints, and the "Tastes too much like Big Red gum" cinnamon mints. These are strong, but you don't get the burning tongue sensation with the urge to spit it out. Of all the Altoid flavors, this is most enjoyable of the lot.<br /><br />If you like spearmints but never had the chance to try these, I couldn't recommend them more. These are now my mints of choice over Polo Mints and another of my favorites, Foxes Mints. Now if we could just get stores to carry these maybe more people would learn how truly excellent they taste.

review/text: Spearmint Altoid mints REALLY do a fine job of making your breath fresh with their extra strong spearmint flavor. For some people these may taste a little too strong, perhaps; but I enjoy them very much.<br /><br />Altoid mints are very low in calories, fat, sodium and more. The main effect, therefore, is simply to make your breath its very freshest. They come in that famous little tin that keeps them fresh until their expiration date.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Altoids as THE ultimate in breath mints. People who also simply love that strong spearmint taste will delight in these, too.<br /><br />Great job, Altoids!

Not quite as bad (i.e. Pepto-Bismol), but nothing like the addictive Spearmint it replaced.  I could chew the old flavor like chewing jelly beans.

review/text: This is the best flavor of the Altoids line and, of course, I can't find them anywhere in my area.  They used to be available at my local grocer and at Cost Plus but as soon as they became my favorite...gone!  Story of my life.  So glad for Amazon and the ability to buy these online.  I use Peppermint Altoids for minor tummy upset and believe it or not, they do help, but nothing can beat Spearmint for the simple enjoyment of a mint.  I plan to try it in my tea as suggested in another review.  Sounds wonderful.

review/text: This was just what I was looking for, as our local stores do not carry this flavor.  The price was good and so was the service.
