review/summary: Pleasantly surprised!
review/text: This is my first experience with any sort of healthy grain snack. I have to say, I've become a fan. I find it difficult to enjoy healthier options because I do have such a sweet tooth but with the vanilla and the blueberry mixed in with these grains I don't miss the sugar. Plus, it helps to know that this snack is very healthy, not to mention quite tasty. When I think of healthy I don't usually think it will taste good as well.<br /><br />I've actually been looking for ways to add some sort of Omega-3 into my diet but it's been difficult because I don't like fish. This snack is full of flax seed which is full of the heart healthy Omega-3.<br /><br />When I first received the bag I thought, this reminds me of cereal. While reading the back label it actually say's you can add milk and have it just that way. I've yet to do that because I brought this product into work to have as a breakfast filler. It works perfectly for that as helps control your appetite. It fills me up and I feel good knowing it's a healthier option than what I'd usually go for.<br /><br />For me I'm so happy I found this product. Its low in sugar, full of Omega-3, and is made with 100% whole grains. They suggest trying this on top of yogurt or with milk. Both seem like delicious ideas that I can't wait to try.<br /><br /> I am pleasantly surprised I like this. I'll definitely be getting it again.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: I recently reviewed another flavor of Kind Healthy Grains. The one here was a little less dry and tastier than the other. Also, it had more of what I would call clusters which made it easier to eat right out of the bag.<br /><br />As with the other, I think eating with milk or with yogurt would work out well. I only tried it out of the bag so far.<br /><br />I liked both flavors, but this one was a little better in my opinion.<br /><br />A bit pricey perhaps, but it seems to be very healthy.

review/summary: My new fav. snack
review/text: I've been looking for healthy snacks for myself and my two year old, and these fit the bill nicely. These are delicious-probably one of the best foods I have reviewed on Amazon and certainly the best as far as gluten-free goes. I enjoyed these straight out of the bag, and as a cereal. They are sweet but not too sweet, and have a surprisingly low glycemic index which is important for those who need or like to monitor their blood sugar. One caveat thought: The clusters come apart quite easily. This didn't bother me, but this may be a concern for those looking for an on-the-go snack.

review/summary: Wow! Gluten Free and Tastes Great!
review/text: I've been doing natural health and nutritional coaching for 25+ years and have lived through the agony of nasty-tasting "healthy" food. Companies are now getting better at making these products edible.<br /><br />So I was shocked at how good, really good the taste and texture was of Kind Healthy Grains Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds.<br /><br />More importantly my gluten-free 11 year old loved it.<br /><br />THIS IS EASILY A MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCT.

review/summary: Light, flavorful, healthy and satisfying
review/text: I'm a bit granola obsessed, always on the search for a great tasting and healthy blend of ingredients. With reasonable effort to avoid hyperbole, Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters might be the best granola I have tried. The diverse grains are sweet and crispy, the nutrients are plentiful, and the price is right. I generally eat the granola dry, straight from the package, but I have eaten it with almond milk, making for a delicious, nutritious breakfast.<br /><br />For those who are curious, here is a breakdown of the nutritional content, as well as ingredients:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g)<br />Servings Per Package: About 11<br /><br />Calories: 120<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3g (5%)<br />Saturated: 0g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg (1%)<br />Total Carb.: 22g (7%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%)<br />Sugars: 5g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin.<br /><br />The blueberry flavor is, perhaps, a little too subtle, getting lost in the mix of the grains, but it does make its presence known. The variety of grains included is more robust than many other brand I have tried, especially the inclusion of quinoa. So there is a little something to please everyone.<br /><br />So, for those seeking a delicious, healthy granola blend, I highly recommend Kind Vanilla Blueberry Clusters. For my money, it may be the best grain blend on the market!

review/summary: A tasty treat with omega-3s for all
review/text: Because I'm a vegetarian it's a little tricky getting those highly touted omega-3s in my diet so I'm always happy to find food source that does the job.  This tasty granola contains flax seeds (hence the omega-3s) and a veritable cornucopia of whole grains including amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, brown rice and buckwheat, but no wheat so it's gluten-free.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  It does have evaporated cane juice and molasses, but a one third cup serving only has 6 grams of sugar. That same serving size has 5 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein, 130 calories and only 3.5 grams of fat and 20 mg of sodium so unless you overdo it, and because it is delicious that's possible, it's a guilt-free food.  It's great straight out of the bag, or with milk or (my favorite) yogurt.  There are several other flavors and they all sound good so I know I'll be checking them out too.  Since there's no honey or dairy I believe this would be good for vegans.

review/summary: Tasty - A review from a health food novice
review/text: I couldn't honestly care less about flax seeds and all the other mumbo jumbo on the packaging.  I guess I can just trust that it's all good stuff.  With a brand name like "Kind" it's a leap of faith I'm willing to take.  What I do know, however, is this stuff is tasty.<br /><br />The smell from the bag is earthy, with a little cinnamon, a little oat.  It reminded me of family drives as a kid when we used to roll down the windows while passing the Quaker Oats factory in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Very inviting.<br /><br />Smell is not sufficient, so I had to eat this bag of goodies.  VERY impressed.  One thing I hate about a lot of granola (oat clusters) is that it's crumbled too much.  You end up with thousands of tiny chunks.  This is not true with the Kind brand.  There are big and small chunks, with the right texture and crunch.  Added to that is a simply delicious flavor; it's like health-food candy.  Each bite is like cheating a diet.  Delicious cinnamon flavoring without being overpowering.  I highly recommend it in milk as a healthy alternative to sugary cereals, or in handfuls while hiking through multi-colored forest landscapes that pleasantly make time disappear.

review/summary: Not what I was expecting...
review/text: I ordered this because I love oat clusters and stuff like this for breakfast with some almond milk.  When I got it the first thing I did was read the ingredients and to my dismay, one of the things in this bag is Chickory Root extract.  :(  This is an ingredient that companies put into their products to bump the fiber content.  But in doing so it causes excess gas and bloating.  This is one of the key ingredients that I avoid when looking for healthy foods to buy.  I did taste the product and it is actually very good and if I didn't know it would upset my stomach I would really enjoy it.  I hope I can find something like this without Chickory root in it.  I would recommend it for the flavor if you don't care about that one ingredient.  (the same one used in all Fiber One products to make them so high in fiber)

review/summary: Very tasty treat
review/text: I love this granola.  It is packed with health benefits (omega-3s, fiber, and more vitamins than Bear Naked Fruit and Nut, my go to granola).  There is a variety of interesting and tasty grains.  The cinnamon flavor is perfect without being too sweet.<br /><br />I sprinkled this on yogurt, pancakes with syrup (just to change the texture, it was delicious!), and ate it by the handfuls.  Every new combination I tried was a delicious treat.<br /><br />I truly enjoy this product.<br /><br />My one complaint is that it is more expensive than Bear Naked, and there is no subscribe and save buying option (yet).

This mix is also good as a snack on its own. The zip lock bag is also very convenient for keeping close by when traveling or an at-work snack. I recommend this mix for anyone seeking a healthy snack with lots of good flavor.

review/summary: Clusters? Blueberries?
review/text: I was expecting something more.<br /><br />Blueberries - Very small pieces, and not many of them.<br /><br />Clusters - Where did they go?! When you look at the pictures of this product, and other types of their granola, it would appear that you are getting a bag of large clusters. Not the case, there are almost no clusters. The biggest cluster I found in all 3 bags was the size of a dime.<br /><br />Taste - Good, when you get some of everything.<br /><br />With all the other products out there, I don't think I will be purchasing this one again.

review/summary: Fantastic Taste and Texture
review/text: I enthusiastically recommend this product, primarily for its vastly superior taste and texture. Although nothhing tastes like a blueberry as much as a blueberry, once you adjust (about 4 initial mouthfuls) the KIND version of blueberry, you'll not only love the taste, but it will seem close enough to the real thing that you'll have a Blueberry Experience!  NOt too crunchy, yet not too soft or crumbly, these have a great blueberry/flax/cinnamon flavor which I loved. (Non-cinnamon fans should stay away).<br /><br />The product is slightly pricey, but this is offset by how filling it is--especially when consumed with water.  I'd recommend this as a pick-me-up/snack almost anytime,; for example, while at the office, on a hike, taking a break from a bike ride, etc. The ingredients tasted fresh (one unlucky reviewer reported a "rancid" ingredient). Overall a very tasty and satisfying snack food.  Highly recommended!

It made my breakfast rather filling, so this meant that I was not immediately hungry afterwards, and that's important if you are always dieting like I am.<br /><br />This product makes a great snack, as well... and you don't have to feel guilty about eating it because... it's moderately healthy in and of itself.  The price is right, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.<br /><br />It cleans out your system, too... most products with flax tend to do that to me... so keep that in mind!  LOL!

review/summary: so delicious...
review/text: People, people, people! Lend me your eyes for this review. I promise it will be worth your while. I am going to attempt to describe just how delicious, wholesome and nutritious this fabulous new addition to the granola/oat cluster world is. For starters, KIND uses ingredients you can easily pronounce and recognize. These clusters are packed full of whole grains like quinoa, amaranth and oats. They are dusted with a healthy dose of cinnamon and are nutty, slightly sweet and incredibly satisfying. Yes, they are made with cane juice. But, the grains are so whole that you don't feel that "crash and burn" sensation after you've consumed them. Trust me, I consumed them in full force. My mother and I killed the bag in about two days. You can eat them as a terrific "on the go" food, or with milk/yogurt. Go forth and try them now.

review/summary: Crunchy
review/text: These Clusters remind me a lot of Cracker Jacks. Do they still make them? Obviously they do, since I have found a link to them in Amazon groceries. The Clusters do not come with a toy inside or with peanuts, but they do come in nice crunchy bite size clumps, except maybe for the unclumped bits, which appear to be sinking to the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I have been eating them out of the bag, which has a built in seal strip. They are not too sweet, having only a few grams of sugar per serving of 29 grams, i.e. around one ounce. The ingredients are nothing scary, just the usual unusual grains: amaranth, flax, millet, and quinoa. How did they miss my favorite, spelt?<br /><br />These are good tasting, and presumably good for you. What could be better?

review/text: Our one-year-old son has a wheat allergy, which means we have to avoid most products with gluten. A good deal of our options are bland and tasteless, however these things were pretty tasty.<br /><br />It's basically regular granola with flax seeds (they look like brown sesame seeds), however they've also added cinnamon which makes a tremendous difference. Within two hours, the entire bag had been eaten. My wife and I, as well as our four year old and one year old, all enjoyed it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the last 1/4 of the bag is powder- granted, that's normally a problem with Granola, but worth mentioning.

review/text: I love granola and I love Kind products but the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters were not a favorite of mine. The blueberry flavor was great. Tasted like fresh blueberries but the vanilla taste was a little off and the granola itself tasted a little stale. It didn't have a balanced flavor either. I was either hit with blueberry, vanilla or oats. The flavors competed instead of complimenting.

review/summary: Tastes good, high calories
review/text: I bought this snack mainly because my wife and daughter are big fans of the Kashi brand of cereals. Since the ingrediants and composition of this Kind snack seemed similiar, I thought they might like it too.<br /><br />Taste-wise, my wife liked it the same or better (though my pre-school daughter didn't). Unfortunately, the calorie count here is quite a bit more, enought that my wife won't eat them. There is more protein and fiber in this snack, though, so that's a plus.<br /><br />Bottom line, it depends on what you're looking for in a health snack. These blueberry clusters taste good, and have higher protein and fiber. But beware the high calories.

review/text: This granola was true to it's label - "ingredients you can see and pronounce". I was very pleased to find only real, healthy ingredients and appreciated that both the product and the oats in the ingredient list were identified as GF. This company clearly understands and accommodates the needs of its customers with dietary restrictions.<br /><br />The granola was great by itself with just milk, and the resealable top bag would make this a great travel option. I also expect this would be a fantastic subbed in as the crumb topping for apple or pear crisp. At only 130 calories and 6g of sugar per serving, this is a snack-friendly food. Definitely recommend it.<br /><br />If you're on the go, consider trying these by the same company - also a great product: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMME">KIND PLUS, Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Perfect in Yogurt or on Cereal
review/text: I try to eat healthy, and I try to buy products that are not filled with chemicals or additives, and are made in the USA. Kind Healthy Grains meets all of those requirements, plus it tastes great. Every morning, I mix two very healthy but exceptionally dull tasting cereals together. Now, I've started adding just a small handful of Kind Healthy Grains, and it's made a world of difference! We also mix the Kind Healthy Grains in yogurt, and sometimes eat it straight from the bag as a snack.<br /><br />Kind Healthy Grains reminds me of granola, but although it's crunchy, it's not hard like granola. The ingredients are a world of difference--no saturated fats or additives! Kind Healthy Grains are just that--grains without refined sugars, trans fats, or saturated fat. The taste is sweet, but not too sweet, and it doesn't seem like you're eating a health food.<br /><br />My husband and I liked this so much, we will buy more from Amazon.

It is also low in sodium and is cholesterol free.<br /><br />Whereas many products that claim these healthy attributes struggle to meet the savory flavor of the packaging they come in, Kind's Cinnamon Oat Clusters have an enjoyable taste.

They are also good with ice cream as well as straight out of the bag.<br /><br />I would recommend Kind's Cinnamon Oat Clusters to anybody who likes granola.  Kind also has other flavors to choose froml, such as Vanilla Blueberry, Oats & Honey with Toasted Coconut, Peanut Butter, and Dark Chocolate & Cranberry.

As a morning choice appears to be a healthy one. Several people have tried this product in our household and they all gave it thumbs up. Sometimes it is hard for everyone to agree on what they like best for their first meal of the day and with this one there was no dissension. Like always we are very happy that thanks to Amazon.com we got to try this food item and have to say that it is good news when companies offer healthy mixes to people in general.  A new trend of healthier foods seem to be on the rise and being that most everyone wants or needs to stay healthy it is a very good thing to be able to buy these products instead of less beneficial choices. For its merits and for the taste this choice rates a 4 Stars at the minimum. The name of the company (KIND) is an indication of good tidings in this case.

review/summary: Healthy Snack - But Watch the Calories
review/text: I received the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters in a 11 oz bag.  I'm fairly health conscious and I'm happy to report that these seem to fit the bill as part of a healthy diet.  Each serving contains a generous amount of fiber (5g) and Omega-3s (750mg).  It is also claimed to be gluten free which is becoming more important as people discover their sensitivity to gluten.  Since I'm watching blood pressure, I always look at sodium content and I was happy to see only 20mg per serving.  Sugar is a little high at 5g per serving* which I will explain later.<br /><br />Although this product could be great in yogurt or with milk, I just ate it raw from the bag. The texture was perfect for me.  It was neither too crunchy nor too soft, but just the right amount of chewiness.  The flavor was a little strong for me.  It overwhelmingly tasted of vanilla extract.  I prefer a lighter more subtle flavor, but that is subjective.<br /><br />Aside from the flavor, there are a few other cautions. The serving size is only 1/3 cup.  This is unrealistically small.  Few people will only consume that amount unless  sprinkling it on yogurt or grabbing a handful for a quick snack.  If eating it like cereal or a significant snack, 2/3 to 1 cup is more realistic.  As with all granola type snacks, the calories then become an issue.  At 120 calories per small serving, a 1 cup consumption (3 servings) would amount to 360 calories.  Sugar would rise to 15 grams.  My average snack amount was about 2/3 cup or 240 calories which is still pretty high.  At that level, I also suffered from a little gastrointestinal distress - probably from the flax seed which my body wasn't used to.<br /><br />Overall, I give this a 4 out of 5 star rating.  It is a healthy food with relatively low levels of sodium and high levels of fiber.  Those who are weight conscious need to watch the serving sizes as the calories can really add up.  But I give this product a positive recommendation as a tasty and healthy food.

review/summary: Crispy, light and incredibly flavorful
review/text: As a huge fan of KIND bars, and as a granola-crazed eater, I eagerly took the opportunity to try KIND Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters. I was not disappointed. The diverse grains are sweet and crispy, the nutrients are plentiful, and the price is right. I generally eat the granola dry, straight from the package, but I have eaten it with both almond milk and yogurt, making for a delicious, nutritious breakfast or snack.<br /><br />For those who are curious, here is a breakdown of the nutritional content, as well as ingredients:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g)<br />Servings Per Package: About 11<br /><br />Calories: 130<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3g (5%)<br />Saturated: 0g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg (1%)<br />Total Carb.: 22g (7%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%)<br />Sugars: 6g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, cinnamon, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate).<br /><br />The cinnamon flavor really shines in this, which is a big improvement over other brands of granola, where the flavor tends to get lost in the mix. The variety of grains is incredibly robust, especially the inclusion of quinoa. So there is a little something to please everyone.<br /><br />So, for those seeking a delicious, healthy granola blend, I highly recommend KIND Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters!

review/summary: Whole grains, superfoods and it tastes great!
review/text: I recently fell in love with Kind Fruit and Nut bars, so when I discovered that Kind also made granola, I couldn't wait to check it out.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of eating healthy and Kind has become a go-to brand for me as it's all natural and offers everything from whole grains to omega-3's to fiber and more. The Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds combine antioxidant rich cinnamon, flax seeds and whole grains amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet and buckwheat. These clusters are high in fiber, contain 720mg of omega-3 fatty acids and 16g of whole grains per serving and one third cup serving is only 130 calories!<br /><br />Anyone who loves cinnamon will love these. They're great for eating out of the bag, having with milk, or mixing with yogurt and they also offer just the right crunch. I can't wait to try the different flavors that Kind has to offer.

review/summary: Addictive and healthy
review/text: I was previously only familiar with the Kind brand through their yummy (though very sweet) granola bars available at Borders and various locations. This is the first time I have tried their granola. I like that it can be topped on yogurt or eaten as cereal. It is important that my food products be able to multitask that way. It is just the right amount of sweet, and fairly addictive. I think that it is basically healthy but keep in mind it is high calorie if you eat more than a handful. A good treat, though use sparingly if trying to lose weight. Cinnamony granola goodness. Yum.

review/text: If you are used to healthy eating, you'll like it. It's fragrant, not too sweet for me, (also with a hint of honey), crunchy and very filling after about a cup of it.<br /><br />By healthy eating, I mean...you are used to food that doesn't have a lot of artificial flavorings, oil, or sugar. Flax seeds have a nutty flavor in them. They are where Omega-3 fatty acids come from. I tasted them alone before. They also taste a bit like "olive oil," but very subtle in these Cinnamon Oat clusters.<br /><br />I really enjoy eating them out of the bag. It's perfect for snacking and on the go. It doesn't make me tired or sluggish after like a piece of cake would do.

review/text: If you must eat gluten-free, this is a great option. Unlike some gluten-free products, this granola is flavorful and easy to find. Most groceries now stock it in with regular granola products. I was a bit skeptical about the flax seed, but this flavor is very yummy. Tastes like cinnamon, but without being overwhelming. I have been stirring it into my yogurt each morning and also eating as a snack mixed with dried fruits. I would definitely buy this again.

Lightly sweet, full of texture and cholesterol free, these blueberry vanilla clusters are very healthy.  With a high source of fiber, 750mg of omega-3 fatty acids and 16g of whole grain, you can feel good about eating this.  It's very economical and convenient.  I look forward to trying other flavors!

review/text: Contains fiber, omega-3's and other good things, but what does it taste like?<br /><br />Actually, it tastes pretty good - sort of nutty and the cinnamon is there, but not overpowering.<br /><br />I tried it as is from the bag. Was a little dry and the pieces are a little small to handle when eaten that way. But still, not bad.<br /><br />The package suggests eating it in milk or on yogurt which I think would be a good way to eat the product. I'll have to try that and get back to you.<br /><br />From what I can see, the price works out to be about $6 for 11 ounces. Sounds a little high, but it is very healthy stuff. I'd say give it a try.

review/summary: Tasty Granola
review/text: What can you say about granola? If you like granola, and you want it to be additive free, this is for you. Kind Blueberry clusters with Flax seeds has whole grains such as amaranth, quinoa, oats, milet and buckwheat. It also has apple, blueberry and plum puree that act like raisins,you get an occasional lump of one to add to the taste. There is no refined sugar since the cereal is sweetened with apple juice. To me it tastes like granola that is not too sweet and has a flax seed kick (watch out, they can get stuck in your teeth). The serving is 1/3 a cup (kind of skimpy if you ask me). Another reviewer mentioned it was too crunchy and sweet. Considering granola is crunchy, that shouldn't be a surprise and this is about as sweet as unsweetened applesauce. To me baklava is too sweet. This granola, not even even close.<br /><br />Here is the breakdown of the nutrient values.<br /><br />Calories 120<br />Fat 3g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 20mg<br />Total Carb 22g<br />Fiber 5g<br />Sugars 5g<br />Protein 3g<br /><br />You aren't going to get more "No ____ Added" than this. No gluten, no refined sugar, no GMO (whatever that is), no trans fat, no cholesterol, no dyes, no chemicals. The clusters are tasty and its got a nice amount of fiber. Here's to your health.

I confess - I did not sprinkle - I added mass quantities.  They are also good as a cereal or oatmeal topper with soy or flax milk added.  They are not gaggy sweet like granola bars.  Perfect texture too!  I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing more.

I demand that it's not loaded with sugar.<br /><br />The Kind Healthy Grains in Cinnamon Oat are super tasty and fulfill all of our requirements. In fact, when I first opened the bag and everyone had a taste, we were nearly wrestling the package out of each other's hands to get another handful!<br /><br />The bag is packed with a variety of grains (including flax, quinoa, oat, amaranth, etc.) and just the right touch of sweetness and light cinnamon. It tastes decadent, but has a decent calorie count and is low in sodium, high in fiber.<br /><br />Definitely a new family favorite at our house!

The blueberry and vanilla are noticeable but not overpowering. It only has 5 grams of sugar but I still kept reaching into the bag for another handful.<br /><br />The consistency borders between crunchy and crispy and can be chewed by young and old alike. Best thing is the 20% fiber content per 1/3 cup serving.  This granola will not disappoint those who like to try different types.

review/text: My title is because I expected this too be as flavorful as bland oatmeal with  bits of blueberry flavoring. I am happy too say that for a healthy alternative that this tasted good as a snack out of the bag or as a cereal. I ate them both ways. The blue berries are very small and lightly add their taste too this product, but I did taste them and they seemed too be in every bite. This blend of grains with the added fruit was easily able too satisfy my hunger and my taste buds. Yes I will say it again; I was pleasantly surprised. One-third of a cup is the serving size and is 120 calories. As a snack this is quite filling so its serving size worked for me. This is a healthy product I would not only eat again but I do recommend it.

I liked them so much, I bought some of the bars today.<br /><br />If you want to eat healthier, give up a candy bar or whatever and munch on Vanilla Blueberry Clusters.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: Indeed, I had no clusters in my shipment, just a few clumps in a sea of grains.  Not deterred, I really liked the flavor of the product.  It echoes the quality and general flavor of other Kind offerings.  Its texture is a little more brittle-like than I prefer in granola, which seems to contribute to it being very sweet and candy-like.  This is the one factor that would keep me from enjoying it regularly.  The flavor of the grains is very nice, though the blueberry could come through a bit more.<br /><br />The inclusion of whole flax seeds is a bit distressing, however.  Whole flax seeds are hard to chew, which when factored into being indigestible would seem that their health benefit is somewhat lost.  Generally speaking, this granola is a tasty treat, though not something I could keep as a staple in the pantry.

I'm pretty sure they put something addictive in it because I can't stop eating it, in fact, I've almost polished off the bag without milk.  It is absolutely fantastic and (obviously) works just as well as a snack as a breakfast cereal.  The cinnamon is faint and not overpowering like some cereals.  It is good and crunchy and if you read the label while you are consuming it, you will want to pat yourself on the back for putting such good stuff in your body.  Be kind to yourself and order a bag.

review/summary: Really delicious
review/text: I love granola, and probably go through a box or two every few weeks.  One of my favorite brands has been Kashi since it's pretty healthy overall, and doesn't have a lot of added sugar.  This KIND granola, however, takes the cake: it's one of the best-tasting commercial granolas I've tried!<br /><br />Granola can often be high in fat, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that one serving of this (1/3 cup) has only 3 grams of fat (5% of your daily value).  While it still has the typical higher calorie counts that granolas usually have, coming in at 120 calories, it's really high in fiber (5g, or 20%). The ingredients are all-natural, and, overall, it's a really healthy option if you like granola.<br /><br />A granola isn't worth its weight in grain, however, if it doesn't taste good, and this one is delicious!  Even my husband, who's not a huge granola lover, really liked this one when we were sampling it, and he came back for more.<br /><br />I also like how this has nice, big clusters, so that you can actually grab some out of the bag and snack on it.  Granolas that have smaller clusters have to be mixed into cereal or eaten with milk, but not this one.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be delicious and am happy to have been able to try this out. I will definitely re-purchase it!

review/summary: Tasty and lots of good ingredients, but very SWEET
review/text: I usually eat Kashi granola and was interested to try this product.  I noticed on the label that it has much less sodium than my usual Kashi but about the same amount of sugars (6 g) and half the fat.  I'd be curious how the "low glycemic index" claim is made... my big issue with this granola is that it is VERY SWEET... like DESSERT sweet and I'm not one who shuns sugar (try saying that 5 times fast!).  Googling "calculate glycemic index" tells me that the index is very subjective and difficult for the ordinary person to calculate.  But my experience tells me that food that tastes this sweet is usually not low on that scale.<br /><br />I'd echo other reviewers' comments - this product is delicious and provides lots of whole grains.  If sugar is not much of an issue for you (e.g. if you are not carbohydrate sensitive) then you might try a bag of this... just treat it as a dessert as like all granola it is high in calories.<br /><br />If the sugars level in this product were cut in half, I'd give it TEN STARS!<br /><br />Hope this is helpful.

review/summary: Good enough, nothing to write home about
review/text: First off, I want to note that the motto printed on the package is "Ingredients you can see and pronounce." The good people at Kind have grossly over-estimated my ability to pronounce D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate. But I'm working on it.<br /><br />So I tried this both plain (on the go style) and with milk. Plain it would make a decent easy to carry snack, although I'd probably add some raisins and nuts to jazz it up. I like the cinnamon flavor.<br /><br />With milk it makes a so so cereal substitute. It's a little hard to chew once it gets wet. Again, adding at least raisins would help make it more exciting.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not really sure who this is intended for. I guess it's nice that it's gluten free for those with a gluten sensitivity, and I'm sure 720mg Omega-3 means something to someone or they wouldn't be bragging about it on the bag. But it has 22 grams of carbs and 6 grams of sugar per 1/3 cup serving. I'd rather it had less sugar. It's supposed to be health food, right?<br /><br />Overall I was stuck between 3 and 4 stars. It tasted good, but was a bit boring, and the texture in milk got annoying. I would probably not try it again.

And the package opens easily and seals back up easily, which is very unusual for a cereal for some reason.<br /><br />The downsides: It smells a little like rancid oil. And although it's nice and crunchy, there is an extra little crunch at the end of the bite that is too much, like a little seed that is a little too hard and cracks more than crunches at the end. And the little seeds got stuck in my teeth.

Obviously they do, since I have found a link to them in Amazon groceries. The Clusters do not come with a toy inside or with peanuts, but they do come in nice crunchy bite size clumps, except maybe for the unclumped bits, which appear to be sinking to the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I have been eating them out of the bag, which has a built in seal strip.  They are not too sweet, having only a few grams of sugar per serving of 29 grams, i.e. around one ounce. The ingredients are nothing scary, just the usual unusual grains: amaranth, flax, millet, and quinoa.  How did they miss my favorite, spelt?<br /><br />These are good tasting, and presumably good for you. What could be better?

review/summary: Unbelievably flavorful gourment granola
review/text: Absolutely delicious granola -- all the ingredients are toasted to perfection and the resulting texture ("Mouthfeel") is incredible. Not at all the dessicated twigs and seeds of something like Grape Nuts cereal or 1970s style crunchy granola of yore. This stuff is delicious with amazing flavors, perfectly toasted. It's not only the best cereal of its kind I've ever tasted, it's better than I ever imagined granola could be. The drawback is the price. But you get what you pay for. Absolutely 100% recommended. Good and good for you.

review/summary: Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds
review/text: It's very tasty but very high in calories. I use a little in my yogart instead of a bowl of cereal; because of the calories. The ingredients are healthy, lots of good stuff.<br />The recommended serving size is only 1/3 cup and that's 130 calories before the milk. it has 3.5g of unsaturated fat, 5g fiber but only 6g of sugar; it's loaded with carbs 22g and only 20g of sodium. It's whole grains (oats, brown rice, buckwheat,amaranth, millet, quinoa) flax seed, cane juice, canola, molasses, cinnamon, sea salt with added vitamin E, chicory root,and it's glutten free

review/text: I like that it's healthy and natural. And I like this company. I just don't think this is a great recipe.<br /><br />Other than a fun crispy texture, the taste is just really unexciting. They sent me a free bag to review, and I'm definitely not motivated to buy a refill. In fact I'm not even very motivated to finish the bag they sent.<br /><br />If you don't mind high sugar, try this same company's granola bars. For example: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMME">KIND PLUS, Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />For healthy, low-sugar, natural cereal, it's back to Bob's Red Mill Muesli for me.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDSES">Bob's Red Mill Cereal Muesli,  4 - 18-Ounce Bags</a>

review/summary: Tastes good and good for you
review/text: I've tried a number of different granola cereals over the years, and Kind Healthy Grains ranks among the best for taste.  I'd call this moderately sweet, which is just fine with me, but it might make this less of a hit with people with more of a sweet tooth, especially kids.  Of course, you can always add sugar, fruit or some other sweetener if you think it needs it.<br /><br />As the nutrition facts on the package reveal, this is a fairly healthy breakfast option.  There's little fat in a 1/3-cup serving (3g/5% total fat, none of which is saturated or trans fat) with no cholesterol.  There are 22g/7% carbs of which only 5g are from sugar.  There are also 5g/20% fiber, 20mg/1% sodium, and a serving has 120 calories.

review/summary: Every thing good for you and tasty too!
review/text: Sometimes granola can taste a little like sweetened wood chips with a few nuts and raisins thrown in. It's good for you but not particularly pleasant. I am however impressed with THIS product. Sold with the byline of a cereal with products you can pronounce! The real test is whether something that is pronouncable is also edible. The answer is yes! I have eaten it raw and with milk and each time it is both satisfying nutritionally but also in terms of taste. The organic and health food marketplace is becoming increasingly crowded. However there is still plenty of room for tasty and healthy alternatives to over sweet cereals. Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds is a worthy competitor in the healthfood marketplace. Enjoy!

review/summary: Tasty Low-Fat Granola
review/text: For some reason, the package of these "healthy grains" doesn't use the word "granola."<br /><br />Funny -- the product sure looks, smells, and tastes like granola to me.<br /><br />But I notice it's very low-fat -- maybe that's the distinction.<br /><br />And it does seem to include some unusual ingredients -- amaranth, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds.  I don't believe I've ever HEARD of some of those before!<br /><br />The package suggests that you can eat this stuff with milk -- as cereal -- or on top of yogurt, or just straight out of the pack.<br /><br />I chose the latter, and it made for a tasty snack, to be sure.  This vanilla-blueberry flavor is unusual and not too sweet, with a hint of a burnt flavor.<br /><br />The only reason I deducted one star from my score is the high price -- more than five bucks for an 11-ounce package.  That's not much more than regular granola, but then I think that most regular granola is stupidly overpriced as well.<br /><br />At any rate, if you'd like to try a tasty low-fat granola-like snack -- and you have the discretionary income -- this may be just your KIND of granola.

review/summary: Very nice snack food
review/text: This is a nice-tasting "granola" product, and it's on the crunchier end of granola products that I've tried. Though it has a strange finish in the taste, that's more obvious in this flavor than the other. I think that must be the flax seeds, which I'm not used to. But that's part of what makes this snack so healthy. It is hard to believe they packed 750mg of omega-3's into 1/3 cup serving. That's pretty impressive. I thought I would prefer this flavor, but I actually preferred the vanilla blueberry, it seemed to work better with the flax seeds.<br /><br />The product is great as a standalone snack, but it didn't do so hot in my soy milk. Think the cinnamon clashed or something. Probably do fine in regular dairy milk. The crunchy texture holds up well to liquids. The other flavor was fine in the soy milk. Both flavors went well in my coconut-milk-based yogurt.

review/text: My impression after the first bite was not what I expected. I did not get the essence of either vanilla or blueberry. It was more like a card board box. But as I soldiered on, I found myself really liking it. And that is saying something, because I am not the healthiest eater.<br /><br />After my initial reluctance, I was all willing to make this my snack of choice. But I was thwarted because, at least in my package, after the first third of the bag, the only clusters I could find were in the name on the bag. I guess I will have to use it as a yogurt topping.<br /><br />Over all, this is unexpected and improves greatly on closer acquaintance.

review/text: These oat clusters were good for snacking as well as for breakfast.  While they are touted as clusters, I found that they broke into sub-clusters too quickly (i.e. they turned into something better eaten with a spoon rather than with fingers).  Great on its own or mixed with milk or plain yogurt.  The list of ingredients places the product squarely in the "actually natural" vs. the "marketed as natural" category.  Good stuff.

review/summary: Good, but is better in something rather than by itself
review/text: I've eaten more than my fair share of granola in the past few years. It's handy, carries around well, nutritious, and tastes great. (It's also good for you!) This just didn't grab me as much as I wanted it to, unfortunately.<br /><br />This travels extremely well, which is something that's very important to me in food products. (Hey, people at work like to scavenge from the fridge so anything I can keep with me is a bonus.) The granola has a lot of good vitamins and nutrients in it, which is one of the big things I look at as far as food goes. I also liked that the company also tries to help people beyond just offering nutritious food, which is part of the reason I chose this item to review.<br /><br />The only problem is that this isn't really the end all of granola I was hoping it'd be. I was really looking forward to something great but this just kind of came up short in my opinion. It's good and has less sugar than my regular granola bars, but taste-wise it just wasn't really something I'd go out of my way to buy. I think it was the vanilla, to be honest. It seemed to really get in the way of the blueberry and granola taste, which is disappointing since I do like the taste of vanilla. This did seem to lessen when you add it to things, so if you're someone who likes their granola in yogurt or soymilk this probably won't bother you as much. (I prefer mine plain.)<br /><br />If you see this on the shelves it's worth a try and I am curious about some of the other flavors this company has to offer, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get this. It's not going to be replacing my Kashi cereal, that's for certain.

review/summary: Quite tasty and crunchy health snack
review/text: If you never have tried Kind healthy grains products the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds would be a good one to try. The Kind line is all natural with nothing artificial. This is basically an all-natural granola, that you can eat right out of the bag, with yogurt or as a cereal with milk. This particular selection includes five whole grains, so your getting lots of fiber. Just beware that a single serving size is only 1/3 cup, so this is not a low-calorie food if you eat a lot of it. For those on low-sodium diets, this is for you, as one serving only has 20 mg of sodium. The blueberry taste comes through nicely, and my only reservation is for my personal taste the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters is a tad too sweet for my taste. I wish they would use less sweeteners, for we, after all, can always add more sugar if we want to make it sweeter. That's the reason I give the product 4 rather than 5 stars.

Also, the bag has a zip-lock seal so you can keep it stored in the bag.<br /><br />I'm going to try the other flavors, but I recommend this treat for those trying to get more whole grains into their diet.

In fact this whole grain cereal by Kind Healthy Grains has half the fat. So for everyday consumption, this cereal is quite tasty. Another characteristic of this cereal worth noting--the wholesome taste of the whole grain blend really comes through.<br /><br />I like to put cereal with fruit and yogurt. The nice this about this product is that it stays crunchy in milk or yogurt. So if crunch is something you like in your cereal, this one is a real keeper.

review/summary: Great with milk or mixed into a yogurt
review/text: With only 5 grams of sugar per serving, it isn't the greatest eaten alone, but it isn't bad. The small and loose nature of the product makes it difficult to just eat plain as well. If I were going for something I could eat out of the bag as a snack, this won't be a top choice but is an OK option.<br /><br />It does make a good "cereal" when mixed with milk, albeit very expensive for that purpose. I found its best niche in our household is mixed with yogurt. We are trying to get our kids a wider variety in their diets and this stuff sprinkled in yougurt is a great way for us to do that. The bag is tough enough to allow you to break up bigger clusters with you hands so that it sprinkles in easily. My 7 year old son likes to eat them plain as well.<br /><br />The ingredients as listed are excellent and the product is labeled as being gluten free. There are 11 serving per 11 ounce package and each has only 5 grams of sugar. It has a good amount of fiber (5 grams) and some protein (3 grams). Labeled as having 750mg of Omega 3, which likely comes from the ground flax seeds.<br /><br />Pricewise it is at the higher end of the spectrum but not neccesarily way out of line with what you might find a similar product for in a grocery store. Just for comparison purposes I did pick up another like product (vanilla almond crunch with ground flax seeds labeled under the brand "Bear Naked") at the local Wal-mart. It was about 60% the cost of this product. Very similar overall specs although more reliant on oats. I did find the taste of the unmixed KIND product better and think it has a slightly more varied ingredient list with the Amaranth and Quinoa. But in yogurt the taste advantage was not noticeable. Both to me are fine for what our nutritional needs are.<br /><br />Overall this is a good tasting healthy product, that allows us to get our kids some better things into their meals then box cereals.

review/text: Vanilla Blueberry Oat Clusters is listed as a healthy food which it is, however, it is also a delicious food.  When you open the package the light aroma of vanilla and blueberries float out of the bag greeting your appetite with a hearty good morning. The flakes are mixture of whole grains from oats, amaranth, quinoa, millet and buckwheat.  This is an excellent tasting combination.  Each grain tends to bring out the best in its companion grain giving the product a well rounded flavor without any noticeable sharp, unsavory flavors.<br /><br />Because Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry clusters is composed of whole grains it is naturally high in protective antioxidants and fiber which help protect against cancer, heart disease and diabetes.<br /><br />Linus Pauling Institute at University of Oregon on whole grains:<br /><br />"Epidemiological studies have found that diets rich in whole grains are associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes compared to diets high in refined grains."<br /><br />"Numerous case-control studies have found inverse associations between various measures of whole-grain intake and cancer risk."<br /><br />Harvard School of Public Health:<br /><br />"Eating whole instead of refined grains substantially lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels. Any of these changes would be expected to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. In the Harvard-based Nurses' Health Study, women who ate 2 to 3 servings of whole-grain products (mostly bread and breakfast cereals) each day were 30 percent less likely to have a heart attack or die from heart disease over a 10-year period than women who ate less than 1 serving per week. (1) A recent meta-analysis of seven major studies showed that cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or the need for a procedure to bypass or open a clogged artery) was 21 percent less likely in people who ate 2.5 or more servings of whole-grain foods a day compared with those who ate less than 2 servings a week."<br /><br />"In a study of more than 160,000 women whose health and dietary habits were followed for up to 18 years, those who averaged 2 to 3 servings of whole grains a day were 30 percent less likely to have developed type 2 diabetes than those who rarely ate whole grains. (3) When the researchers combined these results with those of several other large studies, they found that eating an extra 2 servings of whole grains a day decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 21 percent."<br /><br />Finally, Vanilla Blueberry Oat Clusters also contains flax seeds which are a natural vegetarian source of Omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />From WebMD<br /><br />"There are many health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids. Research shows strong evidence that the omega-3s can boost heart health and lower triglycerides. And there are studies showing that omega-3 fatty acids may help with other conditions -- rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and many more."

I was so excited to try this vanilla blueberry granola and give my family something healthy and delicious for breakfast. It's healthy... unfortunately it is not very delicious. Hardly any blueberries, the vanilla flavor is so subtle that it's almost non-existent, and the the flax seed flavor is so overwhelming that it makes the granola taste stale. I will say that my mother in law really loved the flavor, so maybe it's just my kids and I that didn't like it, which is why i'm giving it three instead of two stars.

review/summary: Eat Like a Woodland Creature
review/text: This package was delivered to my house and my housemate said it sounded like I had received something crunchy. I figured that was probably the Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds. I'm assuming when Amazon ships this out they put it in a box. Mine arrived (via Amazon's Vine Program) in a padded envelope. Therefore the "clusters" were mostly declustered. The result was a bag of loose granola, a few blueberries, and a lot of healthy dust. Kind prides itself on the slogan "Ingredients you can see and pronounce" and I think they live up to that. I'm not a health food connoisseur or anything but the contents of the bag looked pretty natural, like something a squirrel might find while out foraging. I was hoping to be able to take this to work with me to use as a snack but the loose and dusty nature of it proved too overwhelming to use outside of a controlled environment. Snacking on it at home was okay. It has a good taste, a good crunch, and it doesn't come in a can. Nothing mind blowing. What probably sets this apart from other things like it is the stylish package design and the simplicity of the ingredients. Later I felt wildly adventurous (and hungry) and tried eating it like cereal (which is one of the three powerful suggestions on the back of the bag) with soy milk. This was really good. Much better than the giant bag of store brand knock off Froot Loops I'm used to eating as cereal. Tasty, filling, and hearty. No violent sugar rages. I liked this and would definitely eat more but it's not anything I'm going to keep in the house on a regular basis.

review/text: I'm not a big flax seed fan.  I know that you should eat some, but they're frankly bland.  Kind's Healthy Grains aren't too bad.  The grain is crunchy and the cinnamon gives it some flavor.  To be honest, I would have liked a bit more since the flavor tends to wash away with milk.  I normally eat it as a breakfast cereal and was also disappointed that there aren't as may 'clusters' as I would have expected.  It seems like most of the clusters in my bag fell apart and I was left with loose oats and flax seed.  I tended to eat this as a breakfast cereal and got about four average bowls out of one bag.<br /><br />Overall, I suppose its healthier for me and wasn't too bad to munch on in the morning.  I did put a bit of the mix into a bowl of oatmeal once and thought it was pretty tasty.  If I have to eat flax seeds, this is as good a way as any.

review/summary: It's Decent...
review/text: First off, let me describe my situation and usage of this product.  I'm usually stuck at work all day with nothing to eat except trail mix and nuts.  You can imagine that this gets old after awhile, so I was quite eager to try out these oat clusters (or granola, as the rest of the world calls it) to get some variety into my lunch diets.<br /><br />I'll just say right off the bat that I didn't pay much attention to how "healthy" this supposedly is because I'm primarily interested in taste, but it is indeed pretty healthy for this sort of snack.  I bet you're all wondering what this actually tastes like?  Well, for being a granola snack, it's decent.  I do wish that the cinnamon flavor was slightly stronger, and I kind of wish it was a bit sweeter.  Also, the flax flavor really comes out and it causes a sort of unpleasant aftertaste.  Overall, though, it's decent and I found it edible.  I do wish there were more clusters and less crumbly powder mess though.<br /><br />I should mention that the price is a bit on the high side.  For something that is essentially nothing but granola (and thus nothing new) you could probably buy granola much cheaper elsewhere.  I guess whether or not you want to buy this will depend mostly on your own personal preference (like the taste over other granolas, like the packaging, etc.), but I probably won't be getting any more of this item.

review/summary: Tasty low fat expensive granola
review/text: Although it is called "clusters," this product is basically granola, so it's easier to eat with yogurt or milk than alone as a snack. The cinnamon flavor is pronounced and pleasant. There is a nice combinations of grains, and it is lowfat, which is not typical for granola. I think the price is too high, particularly for a product that is not organic.

review/summary: Too good, it's dangerous
review/text: I had to throw my bag of Cinnamon Oat Clusters out after eating 3/4 of it in two days. TWO DAYS. The guilt of eating this much hasn't caught up with me yet.<br /><br />Yes, this granola is like crack. Yes, you will eat way more than one serving size. No, you should not just grab handfuls of this stuff out of the bag like I did if you care about how much you consume. Measure it people. I suggest, if you're tracking your calories like I am, to avoid entering how much you consume, because the numbers will only depress you if the carb monster in you comes out to play. My carb monster--and sweet tooth monster--both came out to play whenever I even SAW the bag lol. Today, I had about 1.5k calories from this granola--and that is not including the milk I consumed half of it with.<br /><br />Kind Snacks are awesome, and I am addicted to their Nut Delight Kind Bars. I have one every day I'm on my university's campus with a yogurt, and it is a filling snack/meal that keeps me satisfied for at least 3-5 hours.<br /><br />These grains are healthy, and what snacks should be like. Love that there's flax in here, and quinoa, millet, etc. They're great on yogurt, in some skim milk, and even better when eating them out of your hand. They're a little on the sweet side (it's 6g of sugar for 1/3 cup), so if you're trying to cut sugar out of your diet, I would suggest avoiding. Then again, they're sweet for me because I haven't really had sugary things in a while, so this was like a huge treat that I totally abused.<br /><br />The nice part is that there is plenty of fiber and omega 3's in this snack, so your blood sugar levels won't spike. The fiber in this also leaves you feeling full. But hey, being full never stopped someone from binging on a yummy carbalicious snack every now and then--especially when you haven't consumed many carbs in a while--so approach with caution... and your measuring cups!

review/summary: GOOD TASTE, TEXTURE NEEDS WORK
review/text: I like Kind bars and have been eating them for years, and was excited to try the granola.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed upon opening the bag was the texture- it ranged from fine powder to 3 chunks that were about 2x2 inches- too large to comfortably fit in my mouth.<br />Most of it was small flakes- not clusters. I prefer my granola in cluster form, as I usually  eat it by hand as a snack, not out of a bowl.<br /><br />The taste is good- a more pronounced cinnamon taste, even for a cinnamon cereal. With the first  few bites I really noticed the flax seeds, which I don't dislike, but don't love either. After the frist bites I did not notice them.<br /><br />Then, I tried this in a  bowl with milk. This cereal tastes phenomenal with almond milk!<br /><br />Good taste , crunch, and  lots of fiber make this a good granola, but I didn't like the wildly varying texture. If they got the texture more consistent, I'd buy it.

review/text: The cinnamon oat clusters are fresh, crunchy, with just enough sweetness to enjoy eating by the handful. The oat clusters do not have that typical oily taste that you get from other granola makers. Instead you get a clean tasting and healthy treat. Low in sodium and sugar, and best of all no saturated or trans fat! Highly recommend!

review/summary: Some texture issues, but delicious
review/text: The bag for these clusters recommends enjoying them in milk, on yogurt, or as snacks right out of the bag, so I decided to try them in every manner that did not involve buying yogurt that I would then be disinclined to finish.  First, I snacked on them dry out of the bag.  They definitely tasted delicious, with all the cinnamon and sweetness promised on the label.  They had a really satisfying crunch without being too hard, and I would definitely keep buying them for snacking purposes at my office.  My main problem with the dry snack method is that the clusters aren't very cohesive, so sampling them mostly involves scooping them up in your hand, pouring them into your mouth, and trying not to lick your fingers before going back for another scoop - I don't recommend this method for people with germ issues.  There were some clusters that were easy to pick up and enjoy, but most of the bag was loose or powdered.<br /><br />I next tried them in a bowl of milk, and again, the taste was delicious.  Sweet with cinnamon, exactly what I want in the morning.  Again, though, texture became an issue.  They stayed crunchy in the milk for the first minute or two, then got very soggy - still tasty, but not nearly as satisfying.<br /><br />Texture issues aside, though, I really enjoyed this product by both methods.  I love that it has so much fiber and flax, and so many simple ingredients on the list.  I also love that it is gluten-free (I eat my share of gluten, but I have close friends who can't eat it, and I am always on the lookout for more tasty products that I can share).  This is definitely something that I would eat again.

review/summary: Even my picky eater loves this!
review/text: My Husband and I love this, but what is really surprising is that my picky daughter absolutely loves it too!  She ate two serving of homemade yogurt with the Kind Vanilla Blueberry Clusters mixed in with a touch of maple syrup added to sweeten the plain yogurt.  This is the first packaged granola she has liked and it is so healthy!  It is also tasty just on it's own.  The flavor tastes "pure" (it actually tastes like fruit and whole grains), it has a good crunch, and is not overly sweet.  My bag had plenty of clusters and was not powdery at all.<br /><br />Whole grains included: gluten-free oats, brown rice, gluten-free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, and quinoa.<br /><br />This is definitely a snack I can feel good about serving to my family.

review/summary: Excellent Ingredients, Unremarkable Taste
review/text: I decided to review this product for the Vine program since I love granola, and I had never tried the KIND Healthy Grains brand before.  The combination of blueberry and vanilla was extremely appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try, in a cereal bowl with milk.  Let's start with the positive things about the granola, since there is much to like.  The product is gluten free, has 750 mg of Omega-3s, there are no refined sugars, no saturated fat (there are 3 grams of fat total in a 1/3 cup serving), no trans fat, 5 grams of fiber, and has very low sodium.  The sweeteners include evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree and apple juice.  In essence, it should be the perfect snack.  Unfortunately, it was not.  There was a very mild hint of vanilla flavoring and almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found.  In fact, the granola lacked any kind of flavor at all.  And the granola clusters themselves lacked freshness and tasted quite stale.  The overwhelming smell when you open the bag is definitely flax, and not the formerly mentioned blueberry and vanilla that was advertised.  So what I had hoped would be a new favorite granola cereal ended up being a bit disappointing.  I wish that the flavor itself could have been better, because the ingredients are just so good for you.  I will more than likely eat some more of this, perhaps in yogurt to ease the crunchiness and stale taste a bit, but I will not be buying the product again.  If you are looking for a great tasting granola, I would highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OCKIP0">Back To Nature Granola Chocolate Delight, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a> or Nature's Path Love Crunch.  Both are much better tasting, and offer a better alternative to this product.

review/summary: Review for both Cinnamon and Vanilla Blueberry flavors
review/text: NOTE: Because Amazon has all of the "Kind Healthy Grains Clusters" reviews linked together, it is necessary for me to say that this review is for only the cinnamon and vanilla blueberry flavors.<br /><br />After trying Kind's cinnamon clusters and loving them, I was really excited about trying all of the Kind Clusters!  Unfortunately, I didn't like the vanilla blueberry at all and found that they actually turned me off about wanting any more Kind Clusters.<br /><br />While the cinnamon taste popped out as soon as the cluster hits my tongue, the vanilla blueberry didn't even taste like it was supposed to!  It tasted more like sour apple juice and less like any form of blueberry!  Plus, I didn't detect any vanilla flavor at all.  I really enjoyed munching on the cinnamon clusters by themselves as a light snack whenever I felt like nibbling.  However, I needed something to drown out the vanilla blueberry clusters' nasty flavor and wouldn't eat them without milk or yogurt.  I'm sure that the cinnamon clusters would have been just as delicious with those two additions, as well.<br /><br />Both of these flavored clusters only have molasses and evaporated cane juice as sweeteners; therefore, they won't be as sugary as some people like their snacks; however, this lack of refined sugar makes the clusters healthier than most foods on the market.  Besides the already-mentioned molasses and cane juice, other ingredients include the following: whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, cinnamon, sea salt, and Vitamin E.  The vanilla blueberry ingredients are different in that there is no cinnamon but there is vanilla extract, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, citrus fiber, and citrus pectin.  I'm baffled as to why plum and apple products are added to a supposedly vanilla blueberry food.  All the ingredients are without a doubt extremely healthy.<br /><br />A serving size is about 1/3 cup which has 120-130 calories, 3-3.5 grams of fat, and 5-6 grams of sugar.  Other nice things to note are the calcium, protein, and iron that are present.<br /><br />I love the cinnamon flavor and highly recommend it, giving it a rating of 4/5.  The vanilla blueberry flavor was repulsive to me, though, and I would only give it a score of 2/5.  Overall, Kind Clusters are a highly healthy snack that's easy to grab a handful of.  I recommend trying the cinnamon, although I warn against getting the vanilla blueberry.  As for whether or not to try other flavors, that's completely up to you.  I will probably not be doing so in the near future.

review/text: Some highlights:<br />* Not too sweet, just right<br />* Not too salty either<br />* Some clusters like would be in granola, but not many<br />* Doesn't smell like vanilla or blueberry at all<br /><br />Overall, it has a bland and unremarkable taste.  I have tried much better granola in the past with a better nutritional profile.<br />Actually, it's hard to assess the nutritional profile since the "Nutrition Facts" do not show accurate data.  For example, one of the ingredients is Vitamin E, but it's not listed under the nutrition facts.  Which makes me think that anything could be there (or not be there).<br /><br />Also, the smell when I opened the package was anything but appealing.  No hints of vanilla or blueberries.

review/summary: Hits all the High Spots
review/text: Most mixtures similar to the Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters are too sweet for my taste. I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice balance in these clusters. Still, if you're avoiding sugar in your diet, this product is not for you.<br /><br />The mix is my newest all-time favorite snack since it contains no raisons. I also like the combination of healthy grains (no wheat), low sodium content, cinnamon flavor, and the fresh after-taste it leaves in my mouth.<br /><br />A full serving is 1/3 of a cup, so the portion is too small for breakfast except to top oatmeal. That's the way I will eat it this winter. I'll also pack some to snack on when I take my long Thanksgiving trip. Next summer I'll enjoy it over ice cream and yogurt. This product is a keeper.

review/summary: Not too impressed...
review/text: ...especially when it came to the flax seeds.<br /><br />I guess I'm just not a flax kind of guy... or maybe I've been brainwashed (or tastebud washed) into preferring commercial grade mass-market granola (with something like, say, Nature's Valley or the like), that this particular granola didn't feel right to me in terms of taste and texture.<br /><br />I freely admit this may be my own fault and should not reflect on the product as a whole. If this is the case, I apologize to the folks at KIND... but, in my own opinion, this granola just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />It should be said, though, I did like the packaging... I am so sick of single serving packages that waste materials or open box/cereal box that allow their product to go stale on the shelf the moment you break the plastic. KIND's method reminds me of the same style of packaging that Great Harvest puts their local-sourced granola in (another granola that I admire, even as I cannot eat it enjoyably).<br /><br />Still, 2 out of 5.

review/text: I may have gotten a bad batch, but these tasted stale to me. I'm also frustrated with poor marketing. Is this a cereal, or a snack? If it's meant to just be a snack, it falls very short. There were few actual clusters,and the rest was loose bits of grain, etc. That could have worked in milk with a spoon, but the packaging seemed to indicate it's a snack food. I have no idea what's 'kind' about it, and I don't like the push for grains to be considered 'required' in anyone's diet. The original studies that showed fiber was important for digestion were all studies on VEGETABLE fibers in real whole foods, not in processed grains. They're doing good by using only non GMO ingredients, but still not what I consider to be truly healthy food.

review/summary: What Blueberries?  And what's with the weird aftertaste?
review/text: I'm a pretty big cereal and granola fan.  You'd have to botch up pretty badly to make me not like your cereal - Kind Healthy Grains has botched up pretty badly.  On the initial bite, it wasn't too bad...it has a good crunch and tastes like a pretty decent granola.  I really didn't detect a blueberry taste to it, nor did I see any actual dried blueberries in there.  The vanilla taste was a little artificial tasting, but I kept eating anyways.  Then the weird flavor started kicking in.  The vanilla taste started tasting more and more nappy tasting, and when I stopped eating for a little bit, I got the worse aftertaste in my mouth.  I'm presuming it was from the flax seeds, but having eaten flax seeds in a lot of cereals and from the fresh flax I put in my yogurt, I'm not sure if that was the cause of the problem.  The aftertaste of this granola is pretty bad.  It just doesn't taste right - kinda like a mix between musty old nuts and artificial vanilla flavoring.<br /><br />I tried eating this granola with milk and it was still pretty bad.  My two preschoolers didn't seem to mind the cereal much, although I noticed that when I offered it to them after that initial bowl that they never wanted it again.  I'm guessing that means that they probably tasted that funky aftertaste, too.  After this experience, I'm probably not going to buy this cereal again.  Not recommended.

It has a lot of fiber and contains flax, which is a good source of omega-3, and it has no saturated fat.  It's not a bad snack, and healthy snack-lovers will probably enjoy it.

review/summary: The good and the bad
review/text: Some people will extol this product, some will dislike it, while others will see some good and some bad points in it. The good are the healthy ingredients: the 5g fiber, 750mg Omega 3, and the five 100% whole grains. Nutritionists have said that if a product states that it is whole grain, it is not 100% unless it explicitly says so. Other people may dwell on what they consider bad points. The problem with 100% whole grains is that many individuals find them tasting too grainy. This is the case here. It is one of the reasons why some manufacturers do not use 100% whole grains. Secondly, the clusters remain hard even after sitting in milk or soy for several minutes. This may be too hard for some consumers. Thirdly, the cereal is filled with flax seeds, which is good, but they do not soften, and they get caught in some people's teeth.

review/summary: low fat, high-ish sugar, mild flavor
review/text: This cereal is pleasant enough tasting, but quite honestly I would have appreciated the addition of more blueberry puree (or, better yet, some dried blueberries) for extra flavor.<br /><br />Relative to lots of other granolas, this one has some things going for it:  relatively low fat (3 grams per 29 gram serving), with no saturated or trans fats, and 5 grams of fiber.  It's also lower in sugar than many other granolas, with 5 grams per serving.<br /><br />Bear in mind that a serving of this granola is only 1/3 cup.  If you are inclined to eat more at one time (like I am), you'll likely want to double or triple the above values.<br /><br />The back of the bag suggests serving this granola three ways:  on-the-go (dry), over yogurt, or with milk.  I think they should add to that on top of baked fruit since I think this might make for a healthy alternative to a traditional cobbler topping.  I think I'll use the rest of my bag to try that out!

review/text: Considering the ingredients in this product, with the exception of sugar, it is a healthy combination.  I am a granola fan therefore was looking forward to trying something new.  The first spoonful was a surprise because I didn't expect it to be so hard and crunchy with an occasional chewy berry thrown in. I didn't like the texture and found it very difficult to eat.  As well, I found it too sweet.  After two spoonfuls I couldn't eat anymore so I gave it to my husband to try.<br /><br />He liked the crunch of the granola but said it was too sweet for him.  He did finish off the bowl but indicated it is doubtful he will eat any more of it.  My thoughts are to soak the rest of the package and add it to muffins. The added fiber will be a bonus.<br /><br />If you don't mind a sweet cereal and like the hard crunch then you may like this product.  I didn't but that's because of my personal preference.  Looking at other reviews many people do like it so you may want to take their considerations in as well.

review/summary: not the best, but still good
review/text: So, I tasted this nummy granola, and it was quite satisfactory. Granted, I probably wouldn't reach for it to just snack on plain (i.e. just the granola itself. Instead, I decided to add it to my Greek yogurt. Mmmmmm! LOVED it! It wasn't too crunchy, and by the time I was done with my yogurt and granola, it wasn't soft/mushy/soggy; the granola didn't have the same crunch and solid firmness as it did to begin with, but it wasn't a "wimpy" granola that got soft/soggy after a short period of time.<br /><br />I'd recommend it if someone were thinking of buying it. Would it be my first choice? Depends. But I do know that it tastes great, is not TOO hard right out of the bag, and won't get soft sitting in yogurt for simply a short period of time.

review/summary: Healthy AND irresistible
review/text: When my one review pack arrived, I thought I'd have a quick taste just to see how it compared with the Kashi GoLean Crunch that DH has been eating to replace the decidedly NOT heart-healthy snacks that his cardiologist says he can't eat anymore. Why not? I could just zip the bag back closed. Well, I tell you, I had to sit down right there and pour myself a bowl with milk. Wonderful. And now we have something that can be sprinkled over greek-style non-fat plain yogurt, which he IS supposed to be eating more of. The evaporated cane juice provides just the right hint of sweetness without being too much sugar, and the high level of fiber will certainly be a boon to healthy dieters. The flax seed is an added benefit for heart health.<br /><br />My 60-year-old teeth are sensitive and weaker now than they used to be, so I often have difficulty chewing some of the granolas. This Kind blend is chewy and substantial, but not so hard that it's risky for me to try to eat it out of hand. Softened with milk, it's no problem at all. I'm not on a gluten-free diet, but I have friends who are, and this product would be just fine for them. The mix of whole grains has an interesting texture and taste, and the whole blend tastes so good I'd warn you not to sit down with the whole bag in front of the TV. It WILL be gone before you know it.<br /><br />Cost is my only problem with this product, but not because it's not worth the money. Healthy food costs more than junk, as it should, and it's clear to me that Kind is very healthy indeed. We're on low fixed income, though, so this would have to be an occasional splurge item for us, used more as a condiment on aforementioned yogurt than as a complete meal. I can stretch $5 worth of beans or chicken a lot further than I could one of these 11 oz. bags. I might, though, try it mixed in with oatmeal.<br /><br />In short: It's good food.

review/summary: Not very blueberry, but otherwise OK
review/text: First off, with a name like "vanilla blueberry clusters" you'd think there'd be some dried blueberries mixed in with the granola, but you'd be wrong here.  It's simply pureed blueberries mixed in with the other flavorings.  I also have to take a little issue with the "clusters" part of the name.  Some of the product was in clusters, a bit was in great chunks, but a lot of it is broken down into little pieces or partial pieces of grain and seeds (and those flax seeds are tiny!).  Some of that breakdown may be the way Amazon sent the Vine product sample to me, in a padded mailer, where normally I imagine they'd use a box, but I doubt that was the sole reason.<br /><br />My gluten-free friend liked this product enough to seek it out on her own.  My roommate's toddler enjoyed it and kept asking for more.  I am personally kind of ambivalent about it - I wanted a stronger blueberry presence and more clusters.  I'd eat it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it (unless shopping for gluten-free snacks for a social event with that friend).  It's nicely crunchy, and the 1/3 cup serving size (120 cal) is reasonably sized for an afternoon snack, and contains 3g each of fat and protein.

review/summary: Tasty cinnamon granola. Might need fruit or something...
review/text: Overall, I found this a pretty tasty, crunchy granola cluster snack. The clusters seem to precipitate toward the bottom, but c'est la vie. The taste was good as was the texture. Good for snacking or as topping or cereal (though there'd only be enough for a couple bowls, like 2-3?). Though, I felt like it maybe needed something extra like some dried tropical fruit mixed in or something? Maybe I'll have to try making my own sometime... But, as it was, I liked it. Not really any complaints, generally...

review/summary: Tastes good! Perhaps a little high in fat, though it's mostly from seeds & nuts.
review/text: Overall, I found this granola quite appealing. Seemed like more granola than clusters, or maybe the clusters all just settled to the bottom of the pouch? ;)<br /><br />Flavor's good. Quite crunchy. I like the fact it's got largely healthy-ish stuff in it. Oats, seeds, etc. Seem to recall it has a little of your typical vegetable oil. Not entirely sure why that's necessary, plenty of fats in the seeds & such. I'd kind of rather just have dextrose-based sugar for binding w/o the added fat in the oil or whatnot. I assume there's a way. But regardless, overall I thought it was quite nice. I'd give it a good thumbs up. Good for snacking on the go, or probably as topping for yogurt or ice cream. I suppose you could eat it like cereal, though you'd only get a couple bowls out of it. Maybe 2-3?

review/summary: Not the Clusters I Expected
review/text: I enjoyed the cinnamon granola flavor of these. The granola is a nice sweet cinnamon oat flavor that doesn't taste over sugared.<br /><br />My complaint is that the clusters I expected were nuggets for eating with your fingers. While there was some of these, most of the bag was much "smaller eat with a spoon" size clusters.

review/summary: Where's the clusters?
review/text: The taste is very good (blueberry-vanilla) but the product was devoid of any clusters. Maybe my bags were filled with the chaff at the bottom of the cluster barrel.

review/text: Kind Clusters makes a great cereal but I enjoy eating it right out of the bag any time of day. Tastes great and bonus - it's good for me. I can't beat the value either. Any way you look at it, the product gets a 5-star review from me. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IW4WFO">Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds,11 ounce bag  (Pack of 3)</a>

review/text: I love this cereal as an alternative to hot oatmeal.  it is high fiber, low glycemic, great tasting, and fills me up.  The flavors are outstanding, and it's so much healthier than regular cereal, I think.  highly recommended.

review/summary: Very crunchy, but a not as tasty as I expected
review/text: Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds was better to snack on than to eat as cereal with milk.  The taste is an acquired taste, and after you've eaten a few it starts to taste better.  It never tastes bad, it just tastes a little like cardboard until you get used to it.  All in all, I'd recommend this to people that are very health conscience and like foods like this, but this isn't something I will buy.

review/summary: A good granola
review/text: I personally enjoy granola at all times of the day, so it was not a surprise that I really liked Kind Healthy Grains.  I have always found granola as a great snack, that gives loads of energy in a small dose, and this was no different.  It has just enough of a sweet taste to make it enjoyable, while still maintaining that granola taste.  The fiber content (5g per serving) is  an excellent addition as well.  It is made with whole grains for those that are looking to induce your diet with whole grains.<br /><br />Overall I really liked the granola, its made with great ingredients, and it tastes great.  Its a great snack on top of yogurt, or as a pick me up in the middle of the day.

review/summary: Tasty and nutritious...
review/text: I'm a fan of granola and blueberries, so getting a chance to try the Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters (w/Flax Seeds) was something I was very much looking forward to. I tried it with (almond) milk as a cereal and added it as a topping to yogurt and oatmeal, and all-in-all, it tasted good. With the inclusion of grains like amaranth and quinoa, this would seem to be a very healthy granola that isn't filled to the brim with sugar. It's great as a straightforward cereal and holds its crunch well in milk. If there's one complaint, it's that it seems as if there are few actual blueberries in the product, mostly just blueberry flavoring (albeit natural). That might seem like a minor thing, but you expect more blueberries in something named blueberry clusters. Otherwise, it's great granola.

review/summary: My KIND of Granola!
review/text: I have tried just about every type of granola that can be found on a store's shelf, but I must admit that I really like the Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds.  I ate it with almond milk, in yogurt and alone as a snack.  It stayed crunchy and had a really great cinnamon taste-not overpowering and delicious.  I am a fan of the Kind brand of products because of their short ingredient lists, and I felt good about eating this cereal.  The one issue (if you can call it an issue) that I have with this product is the fact that there are whole flax seeds mixed in with the oat clusters.  Flax seeds are healthiest after they are ground up, so I'm not sure that the whole flax seeds really provide a benefit to the consumer.  Other than that, I highly recommend this product.  I am looking forward to trying the other flavors!

review/summary: Delicious and Gluten Free!!!
review/text: The Kind Healthy Grains line of cereals (I've tried both the vanilla blueberry and the cinnamon ones) are by far my favorite gluten-free breakfast cereals. They have a very nice flavor and texture (though I wouldn't mind if it was a little less sweet) and provide enough substance to keep me reasonably full with no negative digestional reactions.<br /><br />It seems like a nice, balanced nutritional content that will be attractive (and tasty) even for those who aren't in need of the gluten-free aspect.<br /><br />I immediately ordered this on a subscription basis as it's not yet available in our local grocery stores.

review/summary: Healthy, Versatile, and Filling
review/text: Kind's Cinnamon Oat Clusters are some of the most versatile foods imaginable. They can be used as cereal by adding milk. They are a great snack dry--perfect for the period between breakfast and lunch at the office. My wife and I often disagree about food, but in this case we were both impressed. The taste, texture, and level of sweetness were all just right. Finally, a filling snack that no one will feel guilty about the next day. One 11 oz. bag should last about 5 days, depending on frequency of use and portion size.

review/text: I received this through the Vine program.  Definitely delicious but, in my opinion, rather expensive to purchase.  I would definitely consider buying this if the prices was a bit lower.  Good for "cereal" with milk, as a snack or mixed with yogurt :-)

review/summary: It's just granola when it comes down to it
review/text: The product here is called "cinnamon oat clusters", but in reality it's just granola in a bit of a fancy form. According to the ingrediants list, it's not only oats but also rice, buckwheat, and some other stuff, plus flax seed. It also uses cane juice and molassesm as sweeteners, with no artificial crap (though does have added vitemin e).<br /><br />So it's pretty healthy, reletively speaking. Still, it's food and taste is what matters -- and on that note it's pretty average. It's a nice mix of sweet and oaty, and I admit I wouldn't have trouble eating it as a long term minching snack. At the same time, though, nothing about it particularly stands out. Combined with the fact that it costs over 50 cents an oz, pretty high for a simple snack food, it's not something I could recommend unless you're a complete health nut.

review/summary: Acquired taste?
review/text: Normally I love granola but....<br />I tried this straight out of the bag, sprinkled on yogurt and in a bowl of milk and in every variation it just tasted stale to me. I don't know if that's the flavor from the flax seed or what but it was not appealing. I also pawned some off on my kids to try and they didn't care for it either. I would have to say it is better with something than alone (both to mask it's taste and because it is very crumbly)<br /><br />On the plus side it seems very healthy... perhaps by the time I finish the bag I will have acquired a taste for it.

review/summary: Health/junk food
review/text: This is a classic example of junk-food marketed as health food. Granted it's better than most junk-food so if your going to eat processed sugar treats this is better, but it's essentially a highly processed sugar and oat candy bar ground up - the other stuff listed in the ingredients are of such small quantities to be negligible. You can make oats+sugar at home with raw ingredients for much cheaper and more healthy. The one thing it has is crunch, which might be useful sprinkled on yoghurt or a replacement for sugar in your cereal (or oats) in small quantities. One bag contains 11 servings - if you actually make a bag last 11 days you're in the minority because most people will wharf it down and end up ingesting huge amounts of empty calories and consider it a good product, boy it sure tastes good. If Kind was serious about making a healthy oat-based cereal they would remove the 60 grams of sugar (more than a can of Coke).
