review/summary: quality product
review/text: this is very high quality rice,you may be put off by the price, but its justified by quality.<br />we all know you can buy a 10LB sack of rice for about 1.99 at supermarket,but thats just for a heavy starch filler<br />that when your cooking has the smell of nothing/starch and must be smothered in gravy to be eaten.<br />when you open this rice it has a wonderful nutty aroma(yes raw uncooked it has fragrance)that has a stand alone taste that works with the meal instead of just being a "bulker-up"<br />try this and you will never go back to supermarket bags again!<br />P.S. if the whole cooking rice thing scares you just get a rice cooker,you can get one here for less than $20 and there fool-proof LOL

review/summary: OK rice, bad Basmati
review/text: I bought this because it was the only basmati rice the supermarket had.  I've only made one cup so far but the results were disappointing.  Usually when making basmati rice my whole apartment smells amazing but this wasn't very aromatic.  The end product was mushy, the grains were broken and not very flavorful.  It didn't taste bad and I will use the rest of the package, but I won't be buying Texmati's American basmati again.

review/text: A friend gave me a container of this rice and I fell in love. It is the best rice I have ever eaten. It cooks up so easily-never sticky. And the smell is heavenly.  The grocery stores in my area sell it but it is actually cheaper from Amazon. Once I got hooked on Basmati rice I tried other brands just to see if I could find one I liked that was cheaper but they all failed. I will just stick with Texmati.

review/summary: Best Rice Hand Down
review/text: I apologize in advance for being so enthusiastic. After you try this rice you will understand and appreciate where I am coming from. This is far and away the best rice I have ever had. This rice will totally spoil you. It is unlike any other rice you have ever had. All other rice is just rice. Come to think if it, all other rice just impersonates rice, and miserably. This the supreme king of rice. No other rice is like this rice. Cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me. I have been eating it for years. Over ten at least. It is a bit pricy, but well worth it. It has a delicious, delicate and mild, but nutty like flavor that makes you just want to eat more. You'll feel like you don't even need anything else. Garnish it with something if you must. And you will want to eat it all the time. So prepare yourself. You can easily get carried away with this stuff. Even better, it has an absolutely wonderful, aromatic smell that is really a unique joy and will stimulate your desire eat it. In fact, you will probably want to cook it just to smell it in your kitchen after the first time. Then you will want to have your friends, neighbors and relatives over so they can experience it, smell it, taste it! I know I did. After your first experience you will become a Texmati Rice evangelist and want to tell everyone, and make it for everyone you know or at least get them some if they don't get their own so they won't experience life in such a state of depravation by not knowing RICE. I could not believe the wonderful smell of my kitchen when I cooked it. I said what is that. I have to do this again and often just for that effect. I have told many people about this rice and usually mention it at the check out counter, about how superb it is and that it is the best rice I have ever tasted. Cook up a cup or two and it makes the kitchen smell wonderful, just like it tastes. People will comment. I don't eat it all the time, but I would if I could. I wish I could buy it in twenty, fifty, or 100 pound bags. I would. I eat a pretty standard American diet. I like (long, brown and white) rice, but I don't eat rice all the time. This is an excellent product you can buy on faith. This is perfected rice made perfect. I see little way to improve rice over this. Easy to make in rice cooker or microwave or stove top pot. Just follow directions for perfect rice. This is THE rice to serve when entertaining. The organic variety is good too, almost as good, but I think the plain white had a slight edge over it. You might not notice, though, unless you compared. I like them both. I like these better then the other varieties. The brown is good but does not have the same described qualities of taste and smell. It beats any other Jasmine or Basmati rice on the market. Other Basmati's just don't stand up as tall. The flavor is not there. And why would you want to eat sticky rice unless you have no taste buds or are from Asia and grew up on the stuff, in which case I understand. If you favor very bland rice or have very delicate Asian taste buds then ok. You don't need soy sauce on this rice. In fact that would be a barbaric act for sure, but go ahead if you must. This is rice to taste for its own sake. This is THE RICE. Everything else is just rice substitute, ersatz rice, after this rice. I have found nothing that compares, even a close second on the market. Since this is a patented hybrid, I doubt I will. Get it! Try it! Enjoy! Don't wait. You won't regret it. P.S., in the Army we had a really great LRRP meal called 'Beef with Rice and Onions'. It was a freeze dried thing and very hard to come by. Mountain House I think was the contractor. It beat all C's by ten klicks. The freeze dried short white rice in it did not compare, but this is one of my favorite things to recreate with this rice. I have an incredible tri-tip recipe and this rice is just the ticket to go with it. BTW - my votes: best regular soy sauce - Kimlan by far. Tamari - San-J Low Sodium.

It is like, scotch is a whiskey made in Scotland, you cannot have American Scotch.  it is possible that Texmati rice may be somewhat similar in attributes as the real Basmati rice, but to call it American Basmati is an oxymoron.

review/text: This was a gift to my wife for valentine's day and she really liked it.  I was worried the lavender would be overpowering on some of the products, but it's a good balance between noticeable and pleasant.  The sponges/scrubbers are big enough to get the job done - about the size of a hand each.  The mix of items is great for enjoying a bath and lathering on some moisturizers afterward.  The potpourri is bigger than you can tell from picture - at least a liter in volume. The containers are all pretty nice and easy to use.  None of the included items seem cheap or useless.  Finding a nice bathrobe and some candles to compliment this gift basket would really make a special romantic present.

review/summary: Lovely and overpriced
review/text: I purchased this gift basket for my wife as a valentine's day gift. The fragrance after just opening the Amazon box was delightful and everything was organized well. There are two primary reasons I am displeased with this item. First, the container appeared in the photo to be a hard, durable basket made of some material at least resembling stone. With that hope, I looked forward to being able to use the container as a decorative bowl on an end table or in the kitchen. However, the container I received was no more than cardboard, easily bent and hardly more decorative than the Amazon box that it was shipped in. With this considered, we come to my second issue with this item...the price. This item is roughly $20-$25 overpriced in my opinion. With a nice stone-like container this item could pretty easily bring the $65 I've paid for it.<br /><br />Now, a few bits of information to be fair to the seller:<br />1. I am a man, not an expert in bath soaps and bathing utensils, and am not familiar with retail pricing of each individual product contained within the basket. All I know is that it costs me under $5 for a bottle of Old Spice Body Wash and a couple more dollars for a wash cloth.<br />2. I must reemphasize, once more, I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN PRICING of women's bathing products.<br />3. I won't be giving my wife the basket until Valentine's Day tomorrow, and her reaction is what really reveals the true value of the basket.

It comes in the cardboard container all mushed down and is wrapped in a cheap looking way.  Since it's not returnable I'll have to take the packaging apart to arrange the items in a nice display, will throw away the fake lilacs that are in the package (go figure, lilacs with a lavender gift set), and will add a bow that is nice looking.  I'm glad I didn't have this shipped directly to my recipient so I have the chance to make it look appealing, maybe I'll try to sell it at a yard sale.  Yuck, I'm not happy, could have picked this up at Walmart for $20.

Unfortunately, TWICE we discovered that the body lotion in the first shipment had been punctured andan 1/4 of the product ALREADY USED.<br /><br />In the second shipment, the body lotion AND the shower gel had been punctured and 1/4 used.<br /><br />This not only is a huge disappointment in quality control, but a hygienic issue. Frankly, it is disgusting to think that someone had dipped their fingers into body lotion and shower gel previously, and then nicely wrapped up the package as if nothing was wrong.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed at 'Art of Appreciation's complete lack of Quality Control. I am NEVER buying from them again.

While at Knotts Berry Farm I went in the candy shop with my kids and bought them their candy and a bag of these fudgie rolls for myself.  Wow! They taste just like Tootsie Rolls and Amazon sells them a lot cheaper then Knotts! Great tasting and highly recommended.  This has become my favorite sugar free candy hands down.  If they get soft and stick to the wrapper then just put them in the freezer and that will resolve the problem.

review/text: I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes last year.  Since I have enjoyed the world of sugar for many, many years - I know the difference between real sugar and "fake" sugar products.  The GoLightly brand is almost the real deal.  No bitter after taste and my taste buds are almost fooled into thinking this fudge candy just might be real tootsie rolls.  Only eat two at one time, once a day - this way you avoid the notorious laxative effect sugar free products can cause when you eat too many. It is better to eat fewer fudgie rolls and keep more friends.

That's the reason for the rating of the actual chips themselves.<br /><br />But my comments belong to the pricing of what appears to be 3 8oz bags of chips.  REALLY?  Is there anyone out there willing to spend $10.00 per bag of chips much less add in the shipping costs.  I've tried to understand the pricing and units to be shipped, but I just don't get it.  Who would pay this for potato chips.  Until someone makes it more understandable, in writing, then I will continue to purchase mine at $2.50 per bag at Kmart.  If anyone would like to point out what I appear to be missing with this item, your comment would be welcomed because I must be skimming over a very important part here, otherwise I would have already ordered.

Now, I really do not want to go back to just regular oatmeal. This stuff is sooo good and the texture is way better than that mushy or soft texture you get from the oatmeal everyone is used to, its hearty, thick and slightly chewy. Delicious, you need to try steel cut oats. If your not sure how to make it, I tried a recipe from cooking light that is called Maple-Hazelnut Oatmeal..look that up on the internet or on the food blog brown eyed baker. My husband asked for it two weeks in a row, this will be the 3rd week, he will probably ask for it again. I have been craving these for two weeks straight. who craves oatmeal? you will once you try steel cut oats!

review/text: A really tasty brew--comforting, floral, and deep in flavor. At first I was unsure of how this would taste as it's bagged tea, but it is definitely one of my favorites. There is no better bagged jasmine, in my opinion. This was also much more convenient for me, as I live no where near an Asian market. I would recommend it to anyone!

review/summary: Hot Leaf Juice! I disliked this brand of Jasmine Tea
review/text: I wanted to try Jasmine Tea, I ordered this one but didn't want to wait for it to come in so I bought Jasmine Tea at my local Whole Foods. That tea was wonderful so I was looking forward to making my own at home. After trying this tea I was disgusted, it was not as smooth as other Jasmine Tea I had tried before and after tasting this one. It has a wonderful scent, but I want tea, not potpourri. In short after made it isn't tea, but Hot Leaf Juice. I don't like the this tea, and will not buy any other Yamamotoyama teas. Jasmine Tea is wonderful, floral, and sweet. If you do want to drink Jasmine Tea try a different brand.

review/summary: Excellent Allergy Free Muffins!!!
review/text: I have every food allergy in the book - I can't even add the eggs necessary in the directions. This Namaste line of products are the only ones I have found to taste almost exactly like the real thing! I put a teaspoon of vanilla in the liquid mixture(along with using an egg substitute of flaxseed and water), and I added cinnamon to the dry mix and I baked them 10 minutes longer than the package said, and came up with THE BEST Gluten free, allergen free muffins I've ever tasted - they actually tasted like little cakes! I sprinkled sugar and splenda on top. I can't praise this product enough!!!

review/summary: Better than Betty Crocker
review/text: Our family was diagnosed as celiac 3 years ago - and immediately had to stop eating so many simple, familiar foods and begin carefully baking everything from scratch - a HUGE burden. When I found Namaste mixes, it was as if we got back a bit of convenience again: great tasting, easy to make muffins, brownies, cookie bars and cake mixes. We mix all sorts of different things into the muffins: berries, nuts, chocolate chips, spices or pumpkin, depending on our mood. In a very short time we have a great batch of fresh muffins that TASTE GREAT!!!<br /><br />Hey Amazon, how about stocking the brownie and blondie mixes, too?

review/text: Best allergen-free muffin mix.  In place of eggs, I use 1/2 cup bananas and a 1/2 tsp of baking powder since we are keeping my child off of eggs.  Add 1/2 cup oil, 1 tsp. of vanilla, and 2 cups of water.  For chocolate chip muffins, add 1/3 cup chocolate chips from Enjoy Life Foods.  For blueberry muffins, add 1/2 cup of blueberries.  Bake them at 375 for 28-30 minutes, or at 350 for 40 minutes.  Halfway through the baking process, make sure you cover them by laying a piece of aluminum foil on top of the muffins to keep the tops from overbrowning.

review/summary: Excellent GLUTEN FREE muffins that anyone will enjoy!
review/text: We tried Namaste Muffin Mix after the brand had been recommended to us by a fellow shopper at the grocery store. We've tried many of their other products and feel they've all performed reliably with good flavor and texture. The muffins were of particular interest to me, as I have 4-year old twins who must now be on a gluten-free diet. I am an avid baker, so prior to the change in diet, we had been making our muffins from scratch. When we had to go gluten free, I was a little overwhelmed by the many ingredients and the combinations of those ingredients needed to achieve "wheat-like" results. After trying one bag of this mix, my children were raving about the muffins and so happy that they could enjoy one of their favorite snacks again.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I would suggest trying add-ins to really create the muffin flavor/texture you're after. I basically think of the Namaste mix as a great, convenient muffin base. We regularly add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of milled flax (to add some fiber, which most GF mixes seem to be lacking), 1 or 2 ripe, mashed bananas (this sweetens it up), 1-2 tsp. of vanilla, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and a handful of mini chocolate chips. We've also made cranberry muffins using dried organic cranberries and 3 Tbs. chia seeds, and ginger muffins, adding dried, crystallized ginger and just a little ground ginger (amount is a matter of preference). A few times, when we were out of banana, we tried adding pumpkin puree in it's place, but each time had muffins that were a little "soggy" (clearly a result of adding too much puree). I would urge folks to tinker with flavors and add-ins, but do it slowly, so that you know how much of any particular ingredient the mix will tolerate. I've found that the ingredients used in GF baking have a narrower tolerance for experimentation.<br /><br />I would also add that these muffins (and it seems GF products in general) don't have the same shelf life as their wheat counterparts. I would recommend refrigerating or freezing unused portions, and then thawing/reheating (in toaster oven works fine) as you go. Another thing is that we now regularly use paper liners, which we never did before going gluten-free. I would strongly recommend using them, at least the first couple times you bake (or maybe it's just all the "tinkering" we do).<br /><br />Perhaps the best endorsement for this product is the disappearance of an entire plate of muffins at a recent school picnic. I'd given another mom a bag of this mix, as she was aware of our GF diet and wanted to make something for the picnic that my kids could eat, but just didn't know how to go about it. I gave her a bag, and literally said, "You can't go wrong!" She brought them to our gathering and by the time I went to grab a muffin for myself, they were ALL GONE (eaten and enjoyed by all).<br /><br />The last thing I want to mention is that Namaste mixes seem to have some of the lowest sodium levels of GF mixes currently offered on the market. Read your labels, because many of the GF mixes out there have ENORMOUS amounts of sodium (probably a result of the leavening used).<br /><br />These are a favorite in our home!

review/summary: nice texture
review/text: I've recently started eating gluten-free, and this was my first try with a GF muffin mix.  I added between 1-1.5 cups of fresh-frozen raspberries.  I didn't bother to thaw them, just threw them into the batter, then sprinkled a little Sugar in the Raw on the tops.  The muffins took longer to bake (probably because the frozen fruit made the batter cold), but they turned golden and came out moist.  I like a heartier muffin, so might try adding some sunflower seeds next time.  I'd buy this mix again.

review/summary: Great, but needs some modifications on your end.
review/text: I just made these muffins. I added some cinnamon, and ground nutmeg and cloves. I was hoping for spice muffins, and was nervous to add fruit the first time trying them. They took 18+ mins to cook in my oven, as I was waiting for the tops to turn golden like the package said. I was glad I waited, as it gave the tops a lovely crispiness. They rose and looked like regular gluten muffins. I was eager to try them, and grabbed one and tried peeling the paper muffin liner off. The muffin stuck to it horribly. I decided to be patient and let them cool, and the liner peeled off perfectly once they did. The texture was good for gluten free. The taste, however, was really bland. I was thankful I was generous with the spices, but they still were pretty flavorless. I'm thinking adding fruit, and exchanging the water for fruit juice like it says you can do, would greatly benefit the flavor. I will buy this again, but will definitely doctor them up for flavor. They really are a great 'blank canvas'!

review/summary: The BEST Gluten Free Mix...
review/text: I like Namaste Muffin mix because it contains a minimum of ingredients, which means there's less of a chance that it will contain something that one might be allergic to or react to, besides the gluten.<br /><br />For example, many gluten-free products contain potato flour or potato starch.  Potatoes are in the nightshade family, and contain solanine, a compound that can cause joint and muscle pain for some.  But Namaste's mix has no potato starch or flour...one of very few that do, so it's safe to eat for those with pain issues.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Nice texture but not very sweet
review/text: I just tried these for the first time and added in blueberries.  I found that the texture is tasty - somewhat like corn muffins - but the mix has very little sweetener in it, and didn't instruct to add any sweetening agent.  For that reason, I gave it 3 stars - b/c the taste isn't that great to me - but with some sugar, agave nectar or splenda, I think I would like these much better, and I'm going to try them again this weekend.  One other thing - I found that these do not form a rounded top like a "normal" muffin, for whatever that's worth.  When they bake, they do not flatten out on top or puff up, so if you wanted a more rounded top, you'll have to smooth them out in some way.  Still, I'm going to buy them again and try to modify to my taste.

review/summary: Effective Home Barrier
review/text: I just ordered a supply of Bayer Triple Action Ant Killer Granules from Amazon.com.  This is either the third of fourth year we have used this product to put a barrier around our house in North Carolina as well as our house in the Florida Keys.<br /><br />The earlier packaging was really easy to use.  First it was larger, large enough to use around the entire house.  All that was necessary was to tear off the cover on the bottom of the package and shake the granules on the ground around the house through the small holes in the packaging.  Sort of like a BIG salt shaker.<br /><br />Although the newer packaging is smaller and requires multiple packages to set up a barrier around the entire house, it still works as well as the earlier product.  It generally takes a few days to see all the ants in the house disappear and then for around three months, NO ANTs.<br /><br />The granules make it easy to set up the barrier.  It is sort of like salting your walk in the winter time (up north).<br /><br />Bobby from Buckels

review/summary: EXCELLENT ANT CONTROL because its ant BAIT. (Moisten it!)
review/text: Ant "BAIT" is a better description for this Bayer product since it is eaten by the ants and fed to their QUEEN - resulting in the extinction of THAT colony. BUT ants are constantly expanding their territory and the treated area WILL become infested again by other ants (especially where we live!). Frustrating!<br />So, controlling ants in our "Hot Dry Desert" area requires spreading ant bait every few weeks, especially in WARM weather. It needs to be MOISTENED, also, to be effective, so right Before a rain is the PERFECT time to put out this ant bait.  Be sure to sprinkle a "barrier" close to the house (around all sides) to keep ants out of the house. We do this once a month ALL YEAR because even in cooler weather ants will invade the house seeking WATER, if nothing else.

review/summary: Definitely yummy but a little tricky to prepare
review/text: I was used to having bottled Pocari as well, and this is just about perfect. However, I've found that at 1L it is too dilute and lacking sweetness and saltiness compared to the prepackaged version. For me the sweet spot is to add two packages to ~1.8L of hot or boiling water in a fresh, dedicated pitcher (I first tried an old tea-stained one, and it seemed to make it weaker, perhaps because it was encouraging precipitation or settling). I also include a tiny amount of sugar (enough to just cover the bottom) and a pinch of table salt. I have not tried sea salt or salt substitute (potassium chloride) , but I would suspect that KCl would be too salty (I loathe the taste) and that sea salt might impart extra, undesirable flavors and introduce insoluble/less soluble components, leading to inconsistent flavor (if it could be distinguished at all in solution).<br /><br />Also, this drink is very turbid because of the sugar/flavoring and high level of salts. Turbidity implies suspended solids. While I can't say for certain that settling can occur in the refrigerator over a couple of days, I can say that stirring and swirling are very useful, and stirring when first adding to water (near-boiling seems best, as it produces a more concentrated product. If you use a sports bottle or a container with a strong lid, just try inverting it a couple of times if it tastes weak to see if setting is occuring (packaged bottles may have added chemicals to prevent this, since they must sit on shelves, but I don't know if they do or not).<br /><br />Despite the trickiness and the price, this is definitely my favorite non-cola drink. It has a very smooth taste and finish--light, non-bitter grapefruit with a non-syrupy sweetness and an understated sour/salty "bite" without being noticeably acidic or tasting like saltwater), and the osmolality is such that it's a very different and pleasing experience to ingest (compare a gulp of this to plain cold water and you'll see what I mean). As an added bonus, the high salt content means that the freezing point is slightly lower than that of plain water, so you can get it nice and cold without diluting it with ice. :)

review/summary: Christmas in a cup
review/text: This coffee is HANDS DOWN THE GREATEST COFFEE I HAVE EVER HAD.<br />I like my coffee like I like my women: Blond, sweet, and hot! I make it with sugar and some French Vanilla creamer (liquid, not the powdery stuff) and let me tell you what...I am serious when I say it is the best cup of coffee I have ever had. It's too bad they only "release" it around the holidays. I would drink it year round. In fact, this is why I am visiting Amazon right now....trying to see if I can order it in bulk and freeze it.<br />I drink coffee every morning, at least 1 24oz mug, sometimes 2. If I could choose only one type of coffee to drink for the rest of my life, this one would be it.<br />As far as the pricing goes...it is a little on the expensive side here. Major retailers carry the same bag for less than 10 bucks each. (8.99 last I checked).<br />If you are in the mood for some good coffee, with the holidays right around the corner, pick yourself up some of the Holiday Peppermint. If you don't like it, send it to me!!

review/text: As a dyed in the wool, self-proclaimed coffee snob...I will tell you ALL this is the ONLY flavored, GROUND retail coffee I will buy. After scoring several bags early in the season and sending hubby in for another with the 2.00 off coupon! (YAY...alleviate the creepy sensation of paying farrrrr too much for a pre-ground vac packed retail market coffee!) while it was still on the shelves (this in OCTOBER!) *something happened* and the Holiday Mint coffee vanished.  It's been weeks now, and have seen no sign of its return to the shelves...it's not even offered on Millstone's site for sale now! Seeing it in several online venues now in 5 lbs bags of beans ONLY...and this, a RARE siting...I'm wondering what's happened to this LOVELY coffee and why it's disappearing just as we're rolling into the Holiday Season? Please bring it back! Not, however, at 20+ per lb GROUND. Jeez. I have seen the Dunkin Donuts Mint Mocha or something like that on the end caps...and sniffed thru the little vacuum seal on the front of the bag...smells stale, dry, and NOT pepperminty. More like spearmint. No fan of DD's coffee anyway, I will forever pass...and hope to see Holiday Peppermint's hasty return to our grocery shelves. Anyone able to shed light on this mysterious disappearance please advise! Bummed.

review/text: This coffee is WONDERFUL!!!  There is just enough peppermint flavoring to make your coffee flavorful without going over board.  Sometimes flavored coffees are too strong or overpowering, so I drink one or two cups and give the rest of the bag to a friend (or trash it).  But this one isn't like that at all ... I find myself enjoying it so much that I keep wanting more!  Wish it wasn't a "Seasonal" flavor though (this just means I'll have to stock up before the holidays pass!!).  :)

review/text: This is my favorite flavored coffee, and I always stock up on it every holiday season.  However, unless Amazon's description is wrong, it is being sold here for over $22.00 a pack.  Considering I just bought a few packs at a local big-chain retailer for $8.78 per pack (which is the usual pricing), the amount charged by Amazon is about three times the price for which you can find it elsewhere.<br />Pricing aside, this is the best peppermint-flavored coffee I have found.

review/text: I loved this vanilla flavoring, as I used it in my daughters goat milk to make it vanilla flavored. She loves it like that. I use to be able to get it at wal-mart for just under $5 a bottle. Now of course, because Wal-mart sucks, and constantly discontinues the sale of products after you get use to using them for so long and I can not longer find it there or in any store where I live.  But this is great for coffee or added to milk, milk shakes, or in baking cakes etc. it is rather expensive here on amazon though.

review/text: I'd read other reviews and decided I wanted the gummy eggs even if they were stale. Living in rural Alaska, lots of the food is expired, if you can get it at all. The candy was definitely stale. It does not taste bad at all, but is much less gummy and tougher to chew than fresh candy. If you want to give your jaws a workout, this is the candy for you!

I remember it was always $1.00 at Stater Brothers, but now it's about $1.50. This was actually a gift for a friend who is in love with this candy. It was supposed to come with 12 as advertised, but there was only 10 in the package. BOOO! Minus 2 stars for 2 missing.

The only reason I give them a four out of five stars is because of this issue, but I am so happy to say that Amazon was very helpful in the situation!  I recommend anyone to try these!

I just got my second batch today & they are even better than the first - they're supper chewy (as they should be) with a sour hard shell and sweet gummy inside - if you like candy as much as I do & sweet/sour gets you every time then these are a good buy!

There is no way I can return it or get a refund which is too bad. This unfortunate problem is why i rated three stars.

review/summary: Hibiscus-y and Raspberry-esque!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: These are the best jarred jalapenos I've ever found
review/text: My GF and I eat jalapenos like fricking crazy. We put them on everything. Sometimes we just eat them straight from the jar. Our grocery store recently stopped carrying this brand and we made the mistake of trying a couple others. THEY ALL SUCKED compared to Delallo's. There's just no comparison. Will be ordering cases online from now on. They store well and I don't anticipate waking up one day and not liking jalapenos anymore.<br /><br />Delallo's jalapenos are about a 7 on the hotness scale, and a perfect 10 on the crispy crunchy scale! The other brands we tried were somewhat hotter, but mostly mushy and not fun to eat.<br /><br />Delallo's is a smaller, family owned brand located in PA. I'd much rather support them than some gigantic agribusiness corporation like Vlasic which is owned by Pinnacle which is in turn owned by The Blackstone Group. I don't know about you, but I don't feel great about buying my food from an "alternative asset management and financial services company that specializes in private equity, real estate, and credit and marketable alternative investment strategies."

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/summary: It does have a funky after taste!
review/text: Was very disappointed in the product. It's not horrible, but definitely overpriced.  You're better off getting the 12 cents per packet sugar free drink mixes at Target, then adding some tequila.

review/summary: "Darjeeling Tea"
review/text: This is stuff should not be called Darjeeling. It seems more like stale alfalfa leaves sprinkled with some old tobacco. It is not good - maybe it will make mediocre compost!  Don't waste your money!!

review/summary: Darjeeling loose tea
review/text: I had intended to buy whole leaf tea, but this is tea that has been cut into small pieces.  It still works in my teapot infuser, but some of it tends to leak through into the tea.  The tea tastes fine, but next time I will make sure to get whole leaf tea for my teapot.

review/summary: Great dog treats
review/text: My dog loves these bones.  They actually take him some time to finish, unlike other treats that are gone in seconds.  I only wish I could find them at my local Petco stores instead of always having to order them.  They are a little pricey, but for a special dog it is a special treat!

review/summary: Omega Health Bone Medium
review/text: We have two Chihuahua's and both have sensitive stomachs so they are on a mostly vegetarian diet. One of the two is a terrier mix and can chew through stuff like dog three times his size.  These keep him busy for about 30 minutes and hes never gotten sick from them like he does Bully sticks or other protein based chews.  A bit pricey, but they love them.

review/summary: Medium Berry Health Bones are a big hit with our Lhasa
review/text: There are very few chew treats that are healthy AND last long enough to keep our Lhasa busy.  The Omega Paw Healthy Berry Medium Bones are our answer to providing not only a healthy and delicious treat that lasts for more than a day!  She carries it around and is not obsessive but we can tell she does enjoy the taste and chewing on it.  As with all chew treats, we supervise her time chewing the bone.  It was packaged well with another item and arrived two days after I placed the order.  Yes, I would recommend the Omega Paw Health Bones to my dog owner friends.

review/summary: Great for big dogs who chew fast!
review/text: I nearly lost my dearly loved Golden Retriever when he almost choked on a rawhide bone.  Thankfully, I was able to reach my fingers into his throat and pull out the rawhide.<br /><br />Ever since that day, I wanted to find a good bone for my dog that gave him a challenge to chew.  Common "bones" in the pet aisles at major chain stores (grocery, big box stores) come from recognizable names, but are little more than junk food snacks for dogs.  And, with my Golden, they are gone in seconds.<br /><br />These take some time for my big little boy to chew through and they help clean his teeth as well. And, MOST IMPORTANTLY, he has NEVER choked on a piece of these EVER.<br /><br />They may be a little on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for!  And for the money, you are getting GREAT ingredients that are healthy for the dog and you are also getting a quality treat that your dog will love and you will love when your vet compliments you on how great your animal's teeth look!

review/summary: Great Size and Great Price!
review/text: I love this smaller size coffee can - 3 cans equal one large container and it's cheaper than you can buy it in the grocery stores.  I go through a can a week which is perfect because the coffee is fresh until the end - unlike the bigger containers which would taste stale after not even 2 weeks of being opened.  And since I use the subscribe & save feature for this, I don't even have to put coffee on my shopping list anymore.  Love it!
