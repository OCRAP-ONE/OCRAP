review/summary: Can't live without this cat food
review/text: Have been using this cat food now for a few years after the vet recommended dental cleaning (very expensive & put them under anesthesia - no way!).  Our cat is healthy and her teeth seem to be in good condition.  She loves the taste and size.  She won't eat any small food anymore (I have tried some samples) and actually eats all the Science Diet and leaves the small ones for me to discard.  It's a bit pricey but I would recommend it.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: I bought this for my cat, who suddenly started vomiting on a daily basis. No rhyme or reason for it either, not hairballs, or some kind of illness. This didn't help the vomiting issue and considering the cost of the food and composition, I've since switched her to a product richer in proteins that costs a similar amount and actually seems to have quickly cleared up the problem.

review/summary: The only thing all my cats will eat!
review/text: I have three very different cats, with very different tastes. The Science Diet adult hairball formula is one all three will eat without a fuss. They really like the taste, and have been eating it for years. Plus, it really works to prevent hairballs! I've tried many different brands, but I always come back to this one because I know it's high quality and they will eat it. If they ever stop making this particular one I'm in trouble, they don't seem to like the other Science Diet kinds!

review/summary: Way more expensive per pound than the larger-sized bags of the same food
review/text: I posted my review for the quality of this cat food here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MWBFXY">Hill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach Dry Cat Food - 15.5-Pound Bag</a>, which is the same food as this but in a larger bag.  Here, I just wanted to point out that this smaller size bag is actually much more expensive.  As of the date I'm writing this, this 3.5-pound bag costs $3.71 per pound, whereas the 7-pound bag costs $3.50 per pound and the 15.5-pound bag costs $2.32 per pound.  So you pay over 50% more per pound for this size compared with the largest size.  Just wanted to point this out in case it could save anyone money!  I like the cat food a lot.

review/summary: Has mostly cleared up our vomiting problem
review/text: My 5-year-old kitty has always eaten Science Diet (first the kitten formula, then the Adult Indoor formula), and has always been very healthy with a gorgeous coat and lots of energy.  A couple of years ago she started vomiting after meals about once a week.  The vet said there was nothing wrong and she was probably just eating too fast.  We immediately switched over to this Sensitive Stomach version and the vomiting frequency decreased dramatically.  Now she vomits only once every two or three months.  I'm skeptical that there is anything really different about this food, and it could have just been a coincidence that she stopped vomiting after we switched.  Still, I'd rather just stick with this kind than find out.  I took away one star because it is, in my opinion, unreasonably expensive.

review/summary: The only thing that worked
review/text: I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat.

review/summary: My cat likes the taste
review/text: My cat is 13 years old.  I had been feeding her Friskies Dental Diet for most of her adult life, but it was discontinued.  While on the dental diet she never needed to have her teeth cleaned.  I decided to try the Science Diet brand.  She seems to really enjoy the taste of it.  I mix it with some smaller dry food and she picks out the large Science Diet food first.  It's too soon to see if it will work as well as the Friskies on her teeth, but hopefully it will.

review/summary: Huge difference
review/text: Like other reviewers, I have a cat who would get sick often. I had her checked for issues, but she is otherwise healthy.<br /><br />So when a my new vet suggested a sensitive stomach food, such as this, I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />The difference is amazing. She still has an occasional hairball (this doesn't fix that issue...I didn't expect it to. And my fluffball has more fur than any other living creature, so I can handle a once-a-month hairball). But her near daily throwing up has stopped.

review/summary: wish I'd started using it 5 years ago
review/text: I have two litter mates.  One can eat anything with no problem.  The other always vomits ten minutes after eating, no matter what she eats: canned or dried makes no difference and I've tried every store brand there is.  Hairball treatments had no effect.  I figured "cats throw up" and didn't worry about it.  When I moved and switched vets the new vet asked if the cats ever threw up.  When she heard about the one cat she said cats do NOT just throw up and told me to get the Science Diet sensitive stomach food.  Yes, it's 4x the price of what I'd been buying, but I noticed a difference with the first bowl.  Instead of throwing up ten minutes after literally every meal, now she throws up maybe once a month.  If only I'd switched to this brand years ago we both would have been saved a lot of misery.  Even tho it costs more I've noticed that the bag seems to last longer than the same amount of cat chow did.

review/summary: My cats like this!
review/text: Since Frisky no longer makes those great little round balls of Dental Diet cat food, I had to go looking for something else. Science Diet seemed to be the only likley alternative. My cats liked the different size and texture of the round balls but in their infinite wisdom Frisky (the nitwits) decided there wasn't a market for the product any longer. Fat lot they know. Our three cats don't love this "dental diet cat food" as much at the round balls but they do eat it along with their other food. I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats.

review/summary: Buyer Beware - Potential Choking Hazard
review/text: I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I "transitioned" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of "transitioning" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real.

review/summary: Please avoid!!
review/text: Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo.

review/summary: Excellent for good health of cat
review/text: After a year on kitten food, one of my two cats began to get rather chubby.  He had a hard time hauling himself up onto one of the cat perches in the house.  We switched to this food when they hit their one-year birthday, and my little chubby cat began to lose weight.  Now, a year later, the indoor cat formula is all they eat, and my cat can jump up to the top bunk of the cat perch with no problems at all.  He has an all-star physique.  I do have to say, they preferred the kitten food too at first, but when given no other options, they eat this food with no problems.  If you look at the nutritional content of the food, indoor cat formula has very little fat, while kitten food is quite high in it.  Oh, and I've also seen *maybe* one hairball in the last year.  Not bad.

I have a finicky cat who will only eat certain types of dry food and this seems to be one of them.  She took right to the dry without any hesitation and seems to continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />On the downside is the size of the food.  The food comes in large triangular shaped pieces that some cats may not like.  Buy a small bag and try it for your pet.<br /><br />4/5 stars for the size of the food and the price tag.

review/summary: Saved my Cat
review/text: This product was recommended by my vet, and literally saved my cat's life. I was very worried and was willing to try any diet on the market. Really, I have tried many diets etc but nothing seemed to help out my cat after the sudden onset of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  I have no idea of where that came from. I always gave him clean water; fresh food etc but this caught me off guard. I have been feeding him "Friskies" prior to Hill's and everything was fine until one weekend. After a couple of days of feeding him, I noticed an immediate difference. My cat was no longer passing soft stools (diarrhea), and was eating as he normally did. The diet also seems to have been helping him regulate his weight also. He was a very big guy (~20 lbs) but now he is down to 16, after about 4 months on Hill's. Thumbs up and 5 stars for this product!

review/text: Ok cats, you can stop wiggling and showing me your lovely bellies, and get up and play.<br /><br />Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food does what it says it does and MORE!!!<br /><br />Now, I DO feed my cats wet food, so I give them Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food as a TREAT and a SUPPLEMENT -- and it is powerful stuff!! To be graphic, let's just say that Big Bad Baby Twinkle's poops used to look like small rocks, no matter what I did for her food (and she loves her daily hairball gel too) -- but NOW after feeding her even a small amount of Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food (twice a day after she eats her wet food) one look at her litterbox and I think that a German Shepherd has visited the litterbox. To say that this makes me happy may sound wierd but now I KNOW that "stuff" is moving THROUGH her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating toxins.<br /><br />The same for Cee Cee kitty -- she, who is daaainty and small (BBBT weighs twice as much as Cee Cee and is twice as long as Cee Cee), also pops out some big ones now. I am happy -- yes I am -- this means their intestinal transit time (from eating to pooping) is shorter and they are healthier for it.

review/summary: Bought this for the Fiber
review/text: Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there... No grain, all meat, blah blah.  Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.  They chomp a piece in half, and eat both halves...

review/text: The story goes that I adopted a cat from an agency last summer. Having always grown up with dogs and not cats, I went ahead and wandered down to my Target to get a bag of Friskies. About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now.

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/text: This food is not a good food and is not worth the money.  It contains by products and lots of corn.  It will make your cats fat and lazy.  My friend's cat was vomiting and had been to every vet and had every test but when she switched the food to Innova Evo, the cat stopped vomiting.  Do not buy this food because for the same price you can buy Evo which is grain free and made with table-grade meat. SCIENCE DIET IS GARBAGE!

review/summary: Worst Junk Food Ever
review/text: I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all.

review/summary: Terrible ingredients but my cat did eat it.
review/text: Check the first 4 ingredients: Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose. Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so "light" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer.

review/summary: Please avoid!!
review/text: Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  Please try another brand like orijen or evo.  your cat will thank you.

review/summary: Excellent cat food
review/text: My cat loves the taste of this food and is very healthy after eating this for years. She has a very healthy coat because she also gets at least 1 can of wet food per day which provides protein and healthy fats.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want a healthy pet, you should do a combination of dry and wet food.<br /><br />The critics have unrealistic nutritional expectations if they are only feeding their animal dry food.

review/summary: Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!
review/text: I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!

review/summary: Close call!
review/text: I took my 10 year old cat in to the vet today for his yearly check up.  Turns out my cat is the picture of health, but needs to drop about 2 pounds.  The vet recommended I switch my cat over to this cat food. I checked it out at the store, but after reading the ingredients I thought this can't be right.  First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey.  I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat!

review/summary: Not tastey
review/text: I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.

review/summary: BAD, do NOT buy!
review/text: Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling "corn gluten meal" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google "U.S. Patent 5,030,268" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.

review/summary: Natural Balance Dry Dog  Food is the Best
review/text: My 2 dogs were on pro plan when they became adult dogs there digestive system changed and they had problems pooping they strain when they had to poop and  my other dog kept scratching and licking her paws & feet constantly. I took her to the vet and he told me to give her beneryal which really didn't work and gave me penalog which didn't work for too long, the vet said it may be the food it was a process of elimination to find what was causing allergies and the problem with their digestion and why when my dog pooped it was a strain for her to eliminate. I decided to change the food I went online to see what kind of dry food I should buy there were so many to choose from which made it more confusing what to choose. My neighbor said she gives her dogs Natural Balance for allergies and digestion. I went online and checked out the food and decided to get grain free Limited Ingrdient Diet chicken w/sweet potato for small breeds and hoped this would help my 2 dogs. It didn't take long to see the difference they no longer strained pooping the scratching and licking are still there but not like it was. My dog seemed to be relief and seemed relaxed since the scratching & licking wasn't severe as before she was able to play without stopping to scratch every second. Both dogs skin and coat look better then it ever looked. They have been eating this food 4 months and I couldn't believe by changing their food that it could make such a difference.

review/summary: Still problematic for some dogs...
review/text: I know "Sweet Potato and Chicken" sounds very appealing (I wouldn't mind having that for dinner, myself), but if you're trying to look out for your allergic pet, please remember that quite a few dogs that are sensitive to grains and gluten are also allergic to chicken. As long as you're switching to a "Limited Ingredient Diet" (L.I.D.), you should really consider buying a product that uses a different protein source - like turkey, fish, lamb, duck, or bison. And be sure to watch out for "chicken fat" in the list of ingredients (a hidden source of the problematic protein).<br />The Dog Food Advisor website is a wonderful resource if you're interested in purchasing quality pet food for your companion. It rates every dog food on the market, and tells you what's right/wrong with it.  The website has helped me make much better decisions on behalf of my 4-legged family members.

review/summary: The puppies love it
review/text: Our one dog constantly had dried out skin, and has always been such a picky eater, she'll starve before she eats something she doesn't like.  Our puppy also had stool that smelled just awful, and I get that poop always smells, but I've had dogs my entire life, and nothing compared. Thank god for this food. She's paper trained, and I don't know what I would have done without this. It was just awful...and both of the dogs love this food as much as they love their treats, it's awesome to be able to purchase one food that they can both eat(and LOVE!)

review/summary: Simple and it works
review/text: I have 3 dogs and a foster dog and have had multiple other fosters over the past year.  My second dog was a rescue and came to me with a case of Giardia and persistent diarrhea for 4 months.  I tried countless types of food and realized she was allergic to Turkey, Apples, Peas, ect.  This food is simple and cuts out all the ridiculous, useless ingredients most commercial foods now cram into their kibble.  I give this to all my dogs and fosters and everybody tolerates it very well.  It is one of the only brands of food you can find that doesn't have 15+ ingredients in it and sweet potato is tolerated much better by my sensitive pup than brown or white rice or barley.  I do not feed them anything else.  If your dog is itchy, sneezy, or has weird poops...it is probably a food allergy (assuming they are dewormed and up to date on vaccinations!).

review/summary: EXCELLENT LIMITED INGREDIENT FOODS
review/text: I have two cockers, one of which is getting older. She developed blisters and spotting on her usually beautiful coat. She was scratching her skin off and licking constantly. The vet prescribed everything under the sun, antibiotics, special shampoos, special dog food, including a certain amount of sunlight daily. After months of testing, meds and specialties, including cooking her special diet,with nothing working,I decided to try a different approach and came across this dog food. Within a few weeks her itching had completely stopped, and her coat was growing back like silk. They liked every type of the sweet potato and chicken, fish, duck. With the fish and chicken being their favorite. No nasty food smells as others have reported. Have also purchased the same in the biscuits and they love those also, which surprised me. Have used the meat rolls in the duck and beef, loved those also. So this is the new way of life for us now. And when you break down the price for the larger bag as opposed to the Pedigree, etc, it comes out pretty good price wise. The vet bill alone was killing me anyway. The smaller bags will eat away at your wallet if you go thru dog food quickly. I bought those only as a try out. Their stools are solid, although I do not notice less waste as some report. And with free ship qualification on most orders, it makes it a little easier on the pocket book.

review/text: I have an 8 month old shiba inu/chihuahua mix puppy and from the time I got him at 4 months old he has never had a solid poop. I took him to vets and after 7 rounds of medicines he still has soft poop. The vet has him on ID and I can't say that it works consistently, he still has soft poops everyday but now there are some poops that are normal. I was running out of the ID brand dog food and was going to go back to the vets to buy another bag for $40 and they were out so I went to the pet store and looked at what they had in the way of limited ingredient dog food. I saw this and bought a small bag to see if his poop improved or not. So I will let everyone know how it is once he's been on the food for a few weeks.

review/text: First of all, I love curried dishes. And I love almost all Eden Organic Beans, except I find that the brown rice in their beans & rice products is bitter. But I can usually cover that with onion flakes and garlic powder, sometimes along with diced canned tomatoes.(About 1/3rd of a can of Eden Organic Diced Tomatoes in a can of Eden Organic Cajun Rice & Beans makes a delicious meal!)<br />These Eden Organic Curried Rice & Beans, however, are almost unedible. Not only is the rice bitter and the lentils are round, brown and fat (not the flat French dark green one I like) but the curry flavor profile manages to taste "raw" even though it has been cooked. I can't even begin to decide what to fix first, or even how. In desperation, I dumped in some Eden Organic canned diced tomatoes, to kill the flavor so that I could just get these down and not waste them.<br />I will NOT buy these again!

review/summary: Excellent, if expensive, option for babies with milk allergy
review/text: I developed terrible insomnia due to complications with the delivery of my daughter. The result was I couldn't take care of her at night. I knew she was probably allergic to milk, as my son had a milk allergy until he was 5. So when she needed formula at night we got Nutramigen Lipil Hypo-Allergenic Formula to avoid any problems. It seemed to work pretty well until one day when we left her with a sitter and she had many more bottles of formula than usual--she immediately had blood in her stool.<br /><br />Our doctor said she must be allergic to my breastmilk as it was "impossible" to be allergic to Nutramigen because it was labeled as hypo-allergenic. I knew this had to be wrong. My son breastfed until he was 17 months old without any problem--I just had to avoid *all* dairy products in my diet. Thank god for the internet. I found out about Neocate on an allergy Web site. Since we ordered it she's had no more problems. It's a real relief as I have had to wean her from the breast at 9 month so that I can start medications. The formula is enormously expensive, but at least there is a safe option.<br /><br />If your child is showing signs of milk-protein allergy, make sure to educate yourself by reading material from reputable Web sites, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics ([...]), or go to an allergist. Unfortunately, family doctors' knowledge about allergies is not always current.

review/summary: Expensive but it works!
review/text: Our son has acid reflux and has it turns out protein sensitivity. We tried regular formula, RS, Soy, even Alimentum to no avail. After multiple pediatrician visits and finally a trip to the ER we were told to go on this by a GI specialist and it worked!!!<br />This is very expensive without insurance help, $135 for a case shipped from Neocate's website, their standard shipping is very fast in our case. (Do a Google search for coupon codes for another 10% - 15% off on their website, the codes randomly change but a quick Google search for Neocate coupons should give you the current code(s).) It will vary from state to state but if you can get your Dr. to write a prescription for this it SHOULD be covered by insurance. Check the reimbursement section on Neocates website for more information regarding your state.<br />Obviously this isn't a 1st choice for formula but if your child is having trouble or not wanting to eat, spitting up, has colic, etc. you may want to talk to your Pediatrician about this wonderful formula. It's worth every penny in our case. :-)

Insurance usually won't cover unless your child falls into the 3-5% growth area.  Our son has acid reflux and dairy allergies and we have been denied by oxford three times. 1st just because, 2nd for not having allergies, 3rd for not using soy even though the Dr said in his notes he had a high probability of an allergy.

review/text: My son developed allergy symptoms after he was fed with Similac regular for 3 months, we first switched to similac allimentum, then soy.....in the end, he also got diarrea, and his little tummy got so upset that he developed aversion to ALL liquids, anything coming from bottle even if you wet his lips with drops of water, or baby jar food mixed with a little bit water, he started to get dehydrated so he stayed in the hospital for 9 days, we were discharged with infant neocate, he has been on it for 10 months, those syptoms never came back again! We can't imagine how our life would be without this option. this is a great product, very expensive, but we worked with our pediatrician and specialty in GI, insurance cover it for 12 months. we will probably switch to neocate junior since his allergy hasn't gone away yet, i don't think the insurance will cover any more, but if my son need it, we get it for him.

review/text: My son suffered since birth with formula. Due to a complicated birth and delivery my milk did not come in. So we had to use formula. We tried six different formulas before we found this one! And wow is it amazing! He was said to have GERD disease and we tried everything to help him grow and eat and not be miserable. He would eat and then have severe stomach pains. It was the saddest thing to see him eat and then be in so much pain. We finally went to a pediatric GI doctor and she gave us a sample of the Neocate! WOW! What a difference it made. I mean over night it was like night and day for him. He was happy, he was smiling and no more spitting up and no more acid reflux all the time! He was four months old when we found this and what a blessing it has been. If you child has any of these symptoms I would highly recommend this product. Yes it is crazy expensive but so worth it to have a healthy happy baby! Hope it will help you like it has helped us!

review/summary: Good mix of seasonings - Just a little thin for my tastes
review/text: If you like finely ground herbs and seasonings, this would be an excellent mix for you. I use some slightly heated olive oil and pour this on. Taste is good with just the right amount of garlic and salt. My only issue is that I basically take the grinder off as I like a much coarser grind.

review/summary: Mars aint what it used to be.
review/text: I think the Mars bar of my youth was the best candy bar I ever tasted, much better than Milky Way, Snickers, Clark, Payday or any other bar.  Now what you pass off as a Mars bar is alright if you call it something else, but it is in no way the candy I used to love.  What happened?  Did Kraft or some other giant change the recipe to save money?  If there really are Mars bars like the ones I grew up with I'll be happy to make the exchange.  In the meantime warn people that only the name Mars is the same.

review/text: I prefer non-flavored, semi-strong brews that I can add flavored creamer to when desired.  This coffee has been the best I've tried yet, if you are looking for a semi-dark, yet not bitter coffee to start off your morning.  It makes our kitchen smell like a coffee house each morning.<br /><br />I have only found 1-3 types of non-flavored K-cups that I would buy again and this one is probably atop my list.

review/text: I have a pretty serious coffee habit.  I drink 3 or 4 cups in the morning and a couple more through the day.  I enjoy flavourful grinds, with nutty characteristics, but not too strong.  While I can and have drunk Italian style espresso, for my daily coffee I prefer something that doesn't have a chance of making me jumpy or give me a headache.  This Caribou Columbian is perfect.

review/summary: Love Caribou
review/text: I received a Keurig B-70 for Christmas a couple years ago and with it got the Caribou Colombian k-cups.  I used to go to Caribou at least once or twice a week to get my coffee and then just have Folgers the rest of the time.  When I made my first cup of coffee with the Caribou Colombian I told my boyfriend and son that I would never have to go to caribou coffee house/shop again.  This is the best of all caribou coffee.  It's smooth and delicious.  If you like mocha or dont like coffee black it is also delicious with sugar and cream or milk.  I make mine with a dash of chocolate milk and 2 heaping tablespoons of Swiss miss hot cocoa for a 14 to 15 oz cup.  Very good!  I have not had any other kind of coffee since.  This is the perfect coffee!

review/summary: Good cup of Columbia coffee
review/text: I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to coffee, I like my cup a little strong but usually go for medium styles as the bold and extra bold blends upset my stomach. Columbia is typically my favorite type of coffee and I was very pleased with this offering from Caribou Coffee. I've had their original "blend" on multiple occasions as its one of my favorites in k-cups. I'm not really sure how my coffee tastes stack up against other peoples but if you like a good middle of the road cup of coffee I highly recommend this.

Oh well, at least the balsamic seems to be somewhat ok. I'll find out tomorrow on that one. Otherwise I'd rather take the small calorie hit from using something like Newman's Own sesame ginger or one of the really lite Italians out there. Oh well, live and learn right?

Going in, you do have to realize that it is vinegar-based, not cream-based (and I wonder if that's the problem MJK had, below -- if you don't like vinegar, you're not going to like this dressing), but I am happy to rate this five stars.

review/summary: Nasty....
review/text: I have to give it 1 star because they wont allow for any less... this Bacon dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet, the chemical taste of the Splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself...I could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing, this is one of the five Walden's Calorie Free product I have tried and been VERY disappointed with... I was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with Splenda instead of Stevia but for God's sake why make it soo unpalatable?!  there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner?  My other reviews for these products may be around the same... but darn... I best just make my own dressing, might not be 100% calorie free but at least it will be consumable. Why make ranch sweet in the first place? That's nasty!

review/text: This stuff is amazing.  Right out of the bottle, it's slighty sweet, tangy, and not the most perfect ranch dressing.  However, once it's on your salad, lightly tossed with some sunflower seeds, savory herbs, it adds a very nice touch and no other dressing is<br />needed.  AND IT'S CALORIE FREE.  The ingredients are NOT a list of dangerous additives like other commercial types.  My husband is a doctor and looked it over for me and said it's good stuff.  Highly recommend it and Walmart doesn't stock it anymore....too high priced and too high quality for Walmart, without a doubt.

review/text: The smell and taste is like burnt something.... no way close to artificial bacon flavor.  Not sure how they get the "BACON" out of something so fowl tasting.  The regular calorie free ranch is ok, but the addition of the chemical-tasting almost charcoal smell is not for me.  I don't care how calorie free it is.... it is not going in  my mouth one more time.  One-star is too much but it is the lowest I could give it.  Walden Farms makes some very good products.... this is not one of them.
