review/summary: Good, but mostly for Earl Grey fans
review/text: I am an Earl Grey fan, and I am currently enjoying a thermos of Stash's Double Bergamot as we speak. The citrus background of the standard Earl Grey mix is definitely amped up, making it into the central focus of the tea (as opposed to the black tea base). It is obvious you are still drinking tea, mind you, but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin.<br /><br />Cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out. Making it by the traditional "full pot" method of "1 per person and 1 per pot" (and for me, often "1 extra just for the fun of it") makes the taste borderline spicy. This is how I first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because I knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength. I recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness.<br /><br />Like Lapsang Souchong, this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long day's hike. It gives me a little extra perk at work, and I like that.<br /><br />However, I cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker. I like having tea socially, and sharing it with my friends. Most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly (just like the aforementioned Lapsang Souchong).<br /><br />Earl Grey fans, however, can rest assured that it is a five star review for them.

review/summary: AWESOME!!
review/text: This tea is amazingly delicious. I have always been a fan of Early Grey tea and didn't think I'd find anything I like more BUT then I drank Stash's DOUBLE Bergamot, which just happens to be the ingredient in Earl Grey that makes it so good, and I've been hooked ever since. I drink alot of tea and this is what I drink....Try it, you'll like it!

review/summary: Best chai you can ever get from a bag.
review/text: I have just bought this tea yesterday and made a traditional "chai", as I normally do. I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it. No other varieties of Stash Chai or even their other teas can compare to this. This is simply delicious when made with milk and sugar. Save the money you spend on a Starbucks Chai latte and buy a box instead. It's MUCH better and less expensive when made right.<br /><br />I usually make chai from scratch, but this is definetely a time saver and tastes amazing. Highly recommended.

review/summary: A noble effort, but falls short
review/text: Most bagged chai blends aren't very good at all.  There, I said it.  There are a few that have authentic taste but are just too weak overall, and unfortunately, Stash Double Spiced Chai falls into that category despite hitting all the right notes with the spices.<br /><br />Upon opening a bag for the first time, I was concerned that this would be overloaded with too much cinnamon, but from the green stains on the bag it was apparent that they stuck a load of cardamom in there as well, which is a good thing.  With milk and sugar, though, the black tea just did not have the strength needed to counter-balance the spice medley.  Things improved when I added a second bag to the cup, but overall it was just too bitter and again, the BODY that you expect the black tea to provide just wasn't there.  With a different or stronger tea base Stash could have a real winner here, because they certainly have the spice blend right on.

review/text: I love Chai Tea Lattes from Starbucks and tried many kinds of Chai Tea bags at home.  Stash comes the closest.  The spices are well balanced with the tea and one bag is strong enough for an 8 ounce cup.  Just add sweetner and a little cream and voila - Chai Tea Latte with fewer calories than Starbucks!  This is my favorite drink for a cool evening or afternoon pick-me-up.

review/summary: OMG Good!
review/text: It is a damp, rainy night in Baltimore.  At 43 degrees, there is a definite chill in the air.  Great time to get into my jammies and curl up with a cup of Stash Tea, put on my favorite singer (BM) and write Amazon reviews for you fine folks out there!<br /><br />I have been a tea drinker all my life, and Stash is great tea.  This flavor is wonderful and one of my old favorites.  Now they have plenty new and creative flavors but this still remains wonderful, simple, and basic, with a nice smooth peach flavoring.  Stash is stronger than your basic tea bags (Lipton, etc.) so depending on how strong you like your tea, you might only need one bag for a 24 oz cup like I do.  I drink it black with natural unbleached sugar or agave nectar (sweetener made from cactus juice and available in many food stores in the organic section.)<br /><br />Great flavor and worth the price difference.

review/summary: Amazing Quality of Teas
review/text: I received a variety of Stash teas as a Bridal Shower souveneir over a year ago. I'm sorry i took so long to bust 'em open. Stash is an amazing quality with natural tasting, comforting flavours in both the Herbal and Black Tea lines. I am so impressed, I've become a Stash convert.<br /><br />This Double Chai is very well balanced in it's spices, but still comforting and yet refreshing at the same time. I made mine mostly according to the directions (tea is easy that way), but i did use sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk and sugar. It may not be 'Starbucks Quality' as one reviewer lamented, but I'm sure the beauty of Chai is that it can be well made in a variety if different ways. And while i've never been big into Chai, in the future, I'm definitely going to keep a stock of this Chai tea in my pantry. And unlike many other common brands of black tea, this one does not go bitter after 5-10 minutes of steeping. I'm used to having to be vigilant about removing the bag after 3 minutes, because I'm sensitive to the bitter over-steeped taste of lower quality black teas. That was not at all an issue with either of the black teas I've tried from this company. I can't wait to buy more Stash Teas.

review/text: This black tea is not very strong; it's priced reasonably though.  If you're adding a dash of milk into your black tea, this won't do.  If you're drinking it as is, without milk or sugar; it's quite decent.  Faint aroma, doesn't taste as strong or smell as good as Tazo's Awake.  Nevertheless, pretty good value for what you get.

review/text: I love this tea. I just wish it was organic because I drink so much of it! I only drink it with a little milk and honey. The milk softens the tannins and seems to develop the floral scent of the bergamot oil.<br /><br />I've tried several other brands that offer high bergamot earl grey but none of them have that wonderful scent that this tea has. This absolutely the best high bergamot earl grey I've ever tasted. I may try purchasing my own bergamot oil and making my own because I want to drink this tea at least 5 times a day, and if I'm going to be steeping that many leaves, I want them to be pesticide free. I just hope that I can reproduce a flavor that comes close to the flavor of this tea.

review/summary: Vicks Vapor Rub
review/text: I'm really curious as to what "blended black tea", means. It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil. Because of the unknown element, I wouldn't be surprised if they started marketing it, as a familiar cold remedy. Todd Wilbur?...you missed one.

review/summary: If you like cloves...
review/text: First time I tried Stash Chai Spice Black Tea, I hated it.  Something about the smell did not appeal to me.  It inspired me to go to the local Indian grocer and purchase my own spices to make chai from scratch.  That was very successful (with help from the Internet and advice from an Indian friend).  I finally came back to try Stash's Chai again today and the first thing that hit me was the strong clove scent, which doesn't bother me as much after a few minutes.  I think the chai tastes a bit better this time around than when I first tried it.  Kinda grows on you, I guess.  However, it's not GREAT chai by any means.  It's okay for chai in a teabag.  Convenient.  But I'll stick to making it from scratch when I finally finish this box (waste not).

review/summary: Black Pepper Chai Tea?
review/text: I have been a fan of chai tea for a long time and occassionally will try different brands.  In my book, a good cup of chai tea does not require sugar and cream, and has tastes of cinnamon, vanilla, and cardamon.  I picked up this box at the local store because it was relatively inexpensive in comparison to most of the other brands.  I also hoped that "double spice" meant double the tea servings. I was wrong.  Like other reviewers have observed, the tea tasted very bitter.  An extremely strong black pepper note seemed to overwhelm the rest of the spices.  I have liked other Stash brand teas, but I was very disappointed with this one.  Unfortunately, the box now sits in the cabinet collecting dust.

review/summary: You Really Need to Try This Tea
review/text: I enjoy a variety of teas from herbal to traditional to Green & White's, but generally prefer green teas.  I found the Stash brand on sale once and they had a huge selection, so I picked 5 or 6 varieties to try, including the Double Bergamot Earl Grey.  I had originally planned to pass on this variety, but thought I may as well give it a try.  As the days went on I tried each of the varieties one by one and really enjoyed them.  Then finally I got to the DB Earl Grey.  I didn't have high expectations for it, but let me tell you -- I was absolutely blown away by this tea.  It is perhaps the best tasting, most full-bodied and yet elegant tea (I know that's a strange word to describe tea with) I've ever tasted.  If you like regular Earl Greys, you will LOVE this tea.  You can tell the Bergamot oil is of very high quality.  Take your time to inhale the scent of the tea bag before you even start brewing -- it's that good.  The taste cannot be compared to any other Earl Grey I've had, and I've had some very good ones.  And you can brew quite a large cup (like a double tea-cup size) with one bag.  This tea is very full-bodied, so if you like your teas weaker, don't leave it brewing for too long.  They did not skimp on this tea and you really owe it to yourself to give it a try.

review/summary: An excellent Earl Grey for the price
review/text: As someone who really enjoys Earl Grey, I was drawn to the sensationalism of the "Double Bergamot" marketing ploy. While this tea does have a clear bergamot flavor as you would expect from an Earl Grey, I cannot say I found it particularly revolutionary. Rather, this tastes like a good Earl Grey, and for the price I believe it is probably one of the better ones out there.<br /><br />I can't say it's overcome my favorite among standard Earl Grey teabags -- that remains <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003F18GPC">Pickwick Earl Grey</a>, which I had not found in the US until very recently. But at less than half the price, this Stash product delivers much better in price performance terms.<br /><br />Of course, if you're willing to spend a lot more, there are better teas out there. Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NNB6H0">this one in silk sachets by Harney & Sons</a>. But this is an outstanding performer in its category. It also makes great iced tea. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Finally. Bergamont.
review/text: March update: Wife brings me the empty box of tea. "I only have one more box left. Get more."<br /><br /> - - - -<br /><br />At Christmas, my wife asked for Earl Gray Tea like she had ... 20 years ago. Stronger Bergamot flavor.<br /><br />Being such a nice guy, I bought her premium earl gray teas. None I tried were strong enough. I tried Twinings, Stash, Bigelow, Tazo, ... nothing had enough flavor. Than, I saw this. This, Stash Double Bergamot. She likes it.<br /><br />I'm not sure what changed over the years but the flavor of most of the earl gray tea is weak.

review/summary: Taste before you buy
review/text: A friend of mine raved about this tea and I love Bigelow Earl Grey Tea, so I decided to try it. Now I have six boxes of a tea I don't like as much as Bigelow.  It is too candy-like for my taste; I like a bit more tea flavor. So I would definitely recommend trying it before you buy 6 boxes.

review/text: I have tried so many peach teas that were either bitter, pale, or off tasting.  This is hands-down my favorite peach tea.  It makes the most amazing iced-tea in the summer.  It is robust enough to handle being served iced and is sweet enough to require minimal or no sweetners.  A very refreshing tea!

review/summary: A Must For bergamot Lovers
review/text: If, like me, you find a lot of Earl Grey teas a bit weak in that most delicious and enticing bergamot aroma, this is definitely the one for you. It is not over powerful, just right. The tea itself is not strong so if you like very strong tea by all means add a bag of regular black tea to brew along with the Stash. Absolutely delicious..It will bring you to an exotic and distant land of pure enchantment.

review/summary: Over all, fairly good
review/text: I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better.

review/text: I love hot teas, and had never tried any chai before someone suggested this one to me.<br /><br />It's perfect any time, with a bit of sugar and a little milk added. Has a wonderful flavor, not overpoweringly spicy, but just right. It's also fine without milk, but milk does 'smooth' the spices a bit.<br /><br />Buy it a couple of six pack of boxes at a time. I'm pretty sure having a couple of cups (or more) every night constitutes addiction. =)

review/summary: most flavorful chai i've found
review/text: Being a fan of the creamy, spicy chai teas one can get in the coffeeshops, I've tried to recreate them at home with disappointing results -- until now.  I've probably purchased ten or twelve different brands of Chai looking for the right one.  I finally found it with this Stash Premium Double Spice.  It is exceptionally flavorful, and really able to hold the strong flavor.  The aroma is incredible.  Although it has cinnamon, it doesn't strike me as particularly cinnamony -- I think the cardamom flavor may come through a little more strongly.  Nor is it particularly spicy -- I can't handle spicy foods and I don't have a problem with this.  This tea is a little heartier than most -- I have taken to drinking it instead of coffee in the morning.<br /><br />I haven't been quite as impressed with the other Stash teas I've tried (they're okay, but nothing special) and generally prefer Mighty Leaf or Tazo -- but this tea quickly jumped to the top of my favorites list -- I'll be ordering much more.

review/summary: So Tasty in the Winter!
review/text: I usually drink green tea, straight up.  But I wound up in a Starbucks one day and ordered a Chai Latte.  It didn't taste like tea to me at all!  It was more like hot chocolate, only with spices instead of chocolate.  I thought I'd gone to heaven.  I regretted not bringing some of the Tazo tea home later.  I just started craving the stuff.  I found Tazo Chai Spice at the supermarket, but wasn't happy with the price.<br /><br />So I thought I'd try Stash.  I already buy some of their green teas.  It's even better than Tazo!  The Spice Chai or Double Spice Chai, they're both delicious.  The Double just has more spices and works better with milk.  Or cream :)  Makes the house smell good, too.  Not knocking Tazo, either, after all, I did rave about their tea.  I just think this is even better.<br /><br />If you want to give tea as a gift, spice probably won't go to waste, no matter what the tea drinker usually drinks.  Every tea drinker I know can go for a spice every now and then.

If you're in the US and you've been looking for a substitute for Harrods, this is it.

review/text: I really like other flavors of Stash (peach, lemongrass green and breakfast blend).  But, this has two types of cloves which I knew weren't my favorite but it also had cardomon oil which is my favorite spice.  But the cloves overpower everything else.  Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea.

review/text: Since I first tasted Stash brand Earl Grey tea, I have not purchased any other brand of Earl Grey.  The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just "scented" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash "double bergamot" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both.

review/summary: Great Tea!
review/text: This Stash tea is a good full-bodied black tea.  I'm not much of a tea connoisseur, but this is the best irish breakfast tea I've ever had.  I'm a big fan of Stash teas, especially their black varieties, but this one is my absolute favorite, hands down.

review/summary: An enjoyable way to start the day
review/text: I drank the regular strength Stash Chai for more than a year, and I liked it very much, although I always found myself wishing for a spicier version. When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it.

We split the box I bought here, and it was less expensive ($2.21/box of 20) than when we get it by the single box in the grocery store ($2.59/box).  Definitely worth it, especially if you can get the free shipping!  Who needs coffee??!?

review/summary: it's got double the spice, but. . .
review/text: the tea itself doesn't seem hearty enough to stand up to the spices. What I mean is that even after waiting the right amount of time for my cup to finish steeping, I have a cup of chai that's spicy but not really strong enough for me. I don't like stuff toxic; that's not the problem. I think perhaps this tea is just not meant to be very strong.<br /><br />It's got a great level of spiciness, however, and it smells wonderful as it's brewing.<br /><br />Stash Company--how about just a titch more black tea in each bag? :-)

review/summary: Very good orange spice tea.
review/text: I just tried orange spice tea for the first time on a recent trip to Hawaii, and they had a tea chest of varoius Stash teas in the lobby for people to try. So I deceded to try a flavor I had never had before and I was pleasantly surprised. Now orange spice tea will always remind me of Hawaii. I bought a box of Bigelow Constant Comment, which is another orange spice tea, but it wasn't as good as Stash's, im my opinion. Stash has much more flavor, and isn't that the point?

review/summary: Steeping - the longer the better
review/text: This tea is delicious with milk. The description on the website says to brew for 3-5 minutes. While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

I bought another box and the second I opened the first packet I could smell that they had changed the recipe. Checking the back of the two boxes confirmed it. Cinnamon is about all I taste when I drink it, although the aftertaste has a hint of clove. Pretty expensive for something that tastes mixed by a child.

The flavor is subtle, and if you truly want a flavored coffee, you will need to add some sort of syrup, cinnamon, etc...as these really only give a hint of the flavor.  I haven't tried them all yet, but so far the Green Mountain Coffee Roaster's Hazelnut is my favorite.  I was dissappointed with a few of the varieties that tasted a little too bitter for me (like the Kahlua).

There were french vanillas, vanilla francese, vanilla from more than one brand, etc. Plus, they were all thrown into a box haphazardly, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the product or its quality. Most recently, I ordered a double-pack with only 2 flavors which defeats the point of a variety pack but at least it showed up in an orderly fashion.
