review/summary: Great Vanilla Beans
review/text: My daughter asked me to make her more vanilla extract for next Christmas.  I ordered these beans on the weekend and they arrived early the following week.  I could smell the beans through the mailer even though they were in a plastic zip bag.  These beans were very plump, fragrant and blemish free.  I am mixing these beans with Tahitian vanilla beans (a little more mellow) for a unique flavor.  My extract will sit and "work its magic" for 11 months, so by Christmas it will be wonderful.  Will definitely order from this company again.  Many more beans for my money--making my extract even stronger.

review/summary: EXTREMELY PLUMP & FRAGRANT beans ...every pastry chefs dream!!
review/text: Package arrived in a matter of 3 days after ordering them. WOW! I smelled them through the package and couldnt wait to whip up some creme brulee or pastry cream. The beans were extremely plump and moist.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, someone must have thrown my beans out not knowing how precious these little gems were. I was devastated. I am about to go re-order some more right now. I will keep a close eye on this batch!!

review/summary: Good but disappointed
review/text: First of all let me say the beans came quickly, were packed adequately and were priced right.  They looked and smelled fine, not too dry and decent amount of aroma.  They probably would have been fine for cooking, but they did not perform up to my expectations. I have been making Vanilla extract for the last 5+ years or so and that's why I bought the beans.  I make 750mL at a time using vodka as the base. I cut up 4 beans and began soaking them a week before Christmas.  After 2 weeks the extract was not strengthening correctly (too light of a color) so I added 2 more beans.  Now that it is the end of January (over a month of soaking) they still have not extracted properly. I have the last batch to compare it to (different beans -- I believe Tahitian) and the current batch is half the shade and strength of the previous with 50% more beans.  So I will go back to the more expensive Tahitian beans.

review/text: Very happy with these beans - they're very fresh, very fragrant, and arrived quickly.<br /><br />I used the whole package to make a gigantic batch of vanilla extract to give as Christmas gifts:  I split all the beans lengthwise, and added them to a 750 mL bottle of vodka, shaking about once per week for several months.  To package, I strain the extract through a goldtone coffee filter into a gift-sized bottle, and add a section of vanilla bean to the bottle.  The flavor is excellent, and much cheaper than buying vanilla extract at the store.<br /><br />Also, I put any leftover pieces of vanilla bean into my sugar canister (leave them out to dry first!) for yummy vanilla sugar.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

They had a smokey odor to them and the flavor was completely off.  Certainly not something I would add to ice cream or other desserts.<br /><br />Maybe I received a bad batch.

review/summary: Disappointed!
review/text: Hello, I want to start by saying that I don't  enjoy giving a product 2 stars!  I don't have a lot of background experience with vanilla beans.  The one experience I DO have is that I bought one vanilla bean from my local health food store ($6)and I brought it home in a little baggie, twist tied at the top.  My whole kitchen smelled wonderful when this one bean was on my counter in a bag.  When I received my 16 vanilla beans, I opened up the package waiting to be hit with that wonderful aroma I had smelled before. NOT EVEN CLOSE!  I was upset, but very busy at that time. So I put them aside for about four or five days.  Then I used them to make vanilla bean cupcakes, the same recipe I used my first vanilla bean for.  I couldn't taste vanilla at all.  When I had made it before people were amazed at the unmistakable flavor.  What a waste!<br />Sorry for the long way around the story, I'm still upset...

review/summary: Fresh vanilla-mmmmmm
review/text: I had never used fresh vanilla beans, but wanted to try my hand at making vanilla extract. Vanilla beans are EXPENSIVE in the spice aisle of my local grocery store. I did find them in the fresh veggie section, but even those were $3.99 for 2 and I needed at least 16 for the extract. I decided to see what I could find online. This store (JR Mushrooms & Specialties, Inc.) has great reviews and the price of the beans was reasonable. The beans arrived quickly and I was impressed with the quality - plump, NOT dry and the smell was heavenly.<br />I made a coconut cream pie for Thanksgiving dessert and decided  "What the heck. Let's give cooking with the fresh beans a try." In addition to the vanilla extract called for in the recipe, I split a vanilla bean and scraped the seeds into the mixture. OMG! I have never tasted coconut cream pie this good. The only difference was the addition of the fresh vanilla. My BIL called the next day to rave about the pie AGAIN.<br />I dropped the rest of the cut pod into a bottle of vodka (I'm using Tito's Handmade Vodka) and have continued to add pods as I use them in cooking. The extract isn't ready (it hasn't even been 1 month since I started it), but the smell is wonderful and the taste is well on the way to perfection. I'll definitely be buying fresh beans to use in my baking from now on.

review/summary: superior products, superior service
review/text: If I could have given this merchant more than five stars, I would have done so. I ordered three items through the Amazon.com site, which was a very unclear site that did not become clear to me until I had already entered THREE separate items.<br /><br />When I realized I was going to be charged for three separate deliveries of these three small items, I could find no way on the site at Amazon to make the change. I resigned myself to paying the extra shipping charges for the mistake I made in not being able to indicate that all three items should go into a single, small package to a single address.<br /><br />At that point I determined never to order grocery items from Amazon again until their site instructions were made clear BEFORE an order is placed rather than AFTER.<br /><br />But at 9:00 a.m. the next morning the PRESIDENT of JR Mushrooms & Specialties phoned me and asked if I did really want the three items shipped separately to my address. I told him I had tried to correct the problem on the Amazon site and was unable to do so. The president, Mr. Rusnak, immediately had the extra shipping charges deleted from my credit card.<br /><br />I had placed the order on Sunday, Feb. 10, and all three items were delivered via USPS this morning, Wed. Feb. 13, in one, single package. Without a doubt, this is a company from which I intend to order many items in the future. In addition, all three items are of superior quality. I had ordered pure cinnamon oil and pure vanilla oil along with the vanilla beans. Thank you Mr. Rusnak. Please stay in business for a long, long time with the same superior quality products and SUPERIOR service.

review/summary: Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Beans
review/text: These beans are wonderful!  When I received the box and opened it, my whole place was scented with vanilla bean (and porcini mushroom--which came in the same package and are also excellent) aroma.  As per Cook's Illustrated, the best way to keep them fresh and soft is to wrap each bean individually in plastic wrap, then store them in a ziplock plastic bag in the refrigerator or freezer--either one will keep them fresh for a long time. To make your own vanilla extract, split one bean lengthwise, scrape out the seeds and add them to a one cup jar along with the bean, then add 3/4 cup of HOT vodka (any inexpensive brand will do), let cool, cover, and shake gently every day for a week; then strain if desired and store in a cool, dark place.  It will keep indefinitely.  This extract is wonderfully fragrant.  In their taste tests it beat out their top rated commercial vanilla extract. I can't recommend these beans highly enough! And you can't beat the price compared to what you'd pay in the supermarket for an infinitely inferior, dried out product.

review/text: I ordered these vanilla beans to use for baking. They are amazing! I stored them in a ziploc bag in my pantry and when I went back to use them 2 months later, I found them to be moldy. I was disappointed because they are supposed to last much longer. I was going to just throw them away, but decided to contact the company instead. I had a written response within the hour (on a Friday afternoon) and they told me to throw them away and they would send out a new package Monday morning. I did not ask for them to do this but I am really pleased that I don't have to buy more. Good customer service is so hard to find and I am impressed with theirs. I will order from them from now on!

review/summary: Moist, Vacuum Packed and Delicious- GREAT deal
review/text: My shipment of vanilla beans arrived vacuum packed for freshness.  The beans are long, thick and large. The flavor and scent is intensely vanilla. I was worried that because these beans are sold for so much less than those in specialty/gourmet stores, that they would be of poor quality.  Not true! These are the best vanilla beans I've ever purchased.<br /><br />I have used these beans to make my own vanilla oil (split a bean or two lengthwise, then leave to soak in a couple of cups of a mild cooking oil such as canola. The resulting vanilla oil can then be used as the oil called for in desert recipes (think cupcakes!), or even body products such as lip balm.  Split vanilla beans may also be used to make your own vanilla sugar or syrup.  Just leave the split bean in a closed container with up to four or five cups of white or brown sugar for a week to make "vanilla sugar."  Add a split vanilla bean to two or three cups of simple syrup, and you now have your own vanilla syrup (note: I also add a drop or two of vanilla extract to enhance the syrup's flavor.  I've also made my own vanilla extract by placing two split beans in a closed glass jar of plain vodka (leave for at least two weeks before using, shaking container every so often). I cannot imagine the amount of money I've saved by making these items myself, plus it's fun and, in my opinion, better tasting!<br /><br />Prior to finding this vendor on Amazon, I purchased and used vanilla beans from "specialty" and gourmet stores over the years.  I find those other beans - Nielsen-Massey, for example - to be extremely expensive, dried out and relatively flavorless compared to the  beans offered by this vendor! You cannot beat the pricing and flavor offered by the folks at JR Mushroom.  Oh, and the shipping was extremely fast, and I believe I received a thank you note from the vendor with my purchase.  Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Nice beans! Here's how to store them.
review/text: These beans arrived promptly and, as others have said, were plump and have a nice aroma. The price was so reasonable that it encouraged me to try them in many different ways. So far I've made a batch of Kahlua, a batch of vanilla extract, and a batch of homemade granola using these beans. And STILL have 8 left. I'm going to chop a bean up finely and add it to the heated milk I use for homemade yogurt. I'm guessing that will be yummy. Very pleased with this purchase - the quality is superb.<br /><br />For those having storage issues, the proper way to store vanilla beans is to wrap each vanilla bean separately in plastic wrap, expelling all the air, and then put all the wrapped beans in a plastic bag (also expelling all the air) and store in your pantry or other dark cool location. Every month, take the beans out, unwrap them, let them air for 15 minutes or so, then wrap back up and store. I've never had one go bad doing this.

review/text: My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KYSLMW">Cuisinart ICE-21 Ice Cream Maker</a> had a recipe for fresh whole vanilla bean ice cream that I wanted to try--until I encountered the $15 price tag on a single bottled bean at the grocery store! So I ordered 7 fresh beans from Amazon (specifically from JR Mushrooms, shipped by OliveNation) for less than half that price.<br /><br />Seven plump, flexible, aromatic vanilla beans soon arrived. It was a treat just to open the package, because the beans smelled so good. They came in a sealed but resealable plastic bag, which I put into a glass jar in my spice cupboard for long-term storage.  The French Vanilla Bean ice cream turned out to be wonderful!<br /><br />After using up the 7 beans, I placed a second order for 16 beans.  These beans came sealed in shrink-wrapped plastic, so the package itself wasn't infused with that marvelous vanilla aroma.  However, the beans are the same big, plump, flexible vanilla beans as before, and they make terrific ice cream!

review/summary: Moist Vanilla Beans
review/text: Excellent product!  The beans are very moist and fresh, unlike most of the beans in the grocery store.  All of the beans were long and there weren't any sub par ones to make up the 16 beans, each one was excellent.

review/summary: OMG Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!
review/text: These are some yummy vanilla beans! I purchased these to make homemade vanilla ice cream, to start. OMG - this ice cream had the best vanilla flavor EVER. I have other recipes that call for a vanilla bean and can't wait to use them again. I am so glad I tried them! I started out with the 16 pack first, but if I have more successes, will get larger packs.<br />After I made the ice cream and removed the outer pod, I rinsed the pod and dried it. It still smells amazing! I saw somewhere online that you can place the dried pod in sugar and make vanilla sugar. I haven't tried that yet, but thought I'd mention it.<br />Enjoy!

review/text: These are really high quality vanilla beans, and they have a great flavor. However, after opening them & placing them in a ziploc bag in the cupboard, I noticed they started to get some mold growth on the outside. I removed that, and put them in the refrigerator. Hopefully, that will keep them from going bad, since it will take me a while to use them all. Overall, these are great!

review/summary: Homemade vanilla extract
review/text: I'm using my beans for homemade vanilla extract.  It's not going dark-colored as quickly as I seem to remember the last bottle of vanilla extract did.  But that was a few years back, so maybe I'm just not remembering very well.  The last batch lasted several years, just add more vodka when it gets low in the jar, the beans keep the vanilla flavor strong for a very long time.  Great deal compared to buying little bottle after little bottle of vanilla extract.

review/summary: These Beans Are Excellent...
review/text: They were well packaged... supple and fresh. Not like some of the hard beans I have gotten from other sellers. The price was really good.<br /><br />I like to make my own vanilla extract (I have bottle that is almost 10 years old and fights have broken out over getting a shot of it.) I usually put 12-16 beans in a bottle of vodka and let it cogitate for a few months. A teaspoon in coffee or cocoa is wonderful. If you let a bottle age for a long time (a few years) every one and their mother will beg you for it. At that point it isn't extract, it is perfectly aged vanilla vodka.<br /><br />I also put a few pods in a bag of sugar and let it sit for a few weeks. The vanilla sugar is good sprinkled on cakes and desserts.

Nine times out of ten, I only buy directly from Amazon, but the price for these beans was so inexpensive (less than $1 each) I just had to try them. I am so glad I did!

review/summary: Homemade Vanilla Extract
review/text: I have always bought my pure vanilla extract in Mexico, but got a tip from one of my clients that it was crazy not to make my own. I bought two bags of vanilla beans, slit them down the middle, scraped out the "caviar," cut the beans into fourths, crammed them down into the bottom of a dark wine bottle, followed by the "caviar" and followed it up by pouring a really nice vodka - in my case, Finlandia, which I got in the duty-free store on my last cruise on Holland America Line - and corked the bottle and shook it every day for a week. The instructions are to now shake it once a week for the next six months. I am now at the end of the second week and the fragrance of the vanilla is absolutely intoxicating. You can't help but open it up every once in a while. It is getting darler and darker by the day and supposedly, making your own big bottle of vanilla extract will last ten years. What a great tip my client gave me and I'm forever grateful to her AND to J. R. Mushrooms for providing such heavenly vanilla beans. It'll be hard not to Dan some behind my ears'

review/summary: Moist, good quality vanilla beans. Will come back for more.
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the vanilla beans. They were nice and moist and smell great. The price was the lowest I found (online as well as locally). I am using them for making vanilla extract for personal use as well as christmas gifts this year. I will be coming back next year for more. I am so pleased with the product, I am going to buy a bigger batch in my next order. I was also surprised at how fast they shipped. One happy customer here :)

Fantastic. I have put the beans in various bottles of vodka and will have excellent vanilla extract in a few months.

review/text: Quality beans. I purchase these because I cannot get a single bean for less than $20 (Chicago area). They are great quality and this is actually the second time I have purchased them. Word of caution, they are fragrant. If you aren't planning on using them all right away, buy a seal-able glass container other wise your place will smell like vanilla 24/7. Not always a bad thing, just a word of caution :)

review/summary: Fantastic Value!!
review/text: I use vanilla beans all the time and if I had to get them at the grocery store, I'd be shelling out between $3 and $7.50 per bean!  These beans are delicious and an amazing value.  Do not buy these if you only use 1 vanilla bean every year for your wonderful Christmas pudding, they won't last forever.  But if you use them often, have no qualms about these!  Be sure to keep them in air-tight packaging and if you have a vacuum-seal system, that's a great way to store them each time to preserve their freshness.

review/summary: Great quality beans, super low price!
review/text: I'm very satisfied with these beans, I've bought two packs of them now from JR Mushrooms & Specialties.<br /><br />They come nicely vacuum packed so they remain super fresh until you open it, and when you do it smells wonderful! The beans are plump and moist.<br /><br />Aside from making some nice desserts with it (panna cotta, chocolate dipping sauce, etc...) I've made vanilla extract as well using some good quality vodka. It has such an AMAZING aroma and flavor, I have to give credit to these beans. I totally recommend making your own vanilla extract using these beans, you'll never go back to store-bought again.

review/text: The vanilla beans arrived shrink wrapped and in excellent condition. I have used several of the beans, and they are wonderfully fragrant. An excellent product and seller (my beans arrived a few days earlier than expected!). I made vanilla custard and it's a huge difference in taste quality than when I used store bought vanilla extract. I also used several of the beans for making vanilla extract (3 beans -split- per cup of vodka).

review/text: I love these fresh vanilla beans. They smell like heaven. I've added them to homemade ice cream and used them to scent and flavor a simple syrup for brushing on cakes and cupcakes to keep them moist before frosting. The smell of a cupcake brushed with vanilla scented syrup is possibly the best smell ever. Very reasonably priced and I will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Just Like Mother's!
review/text: In fact, this was not like my mother's soup, this was exactly my mother's soup. And I believe, it was her only soup. She did prefer Streit's products Streits, Soup Mix Split Pea, 6-Ounce (12 Pack) but Manischewitz was certainly acceptable in a pinch.<br /><br />Now, I am the first to admit that to write a review praising my mother's cooking is more than a bit odd. If you knew her, only the greatest amount of good breeding and rigorous diplomacy would permit you to ever so slightly lift an eyebrow while biting your tongue upon hearing my mother described as a good cook. You might even avert your head and laugh quietly to yourself. No matter, my mother was the first to admit her lack of culinary expertise. Her talents lay decidedly in the making of reservations, which she did with great accuracy and enthusiasm.<br /><br />I am not saying that she didn't cook; after all she had a family to feed.  She cooked healthy and simple things that were flavorful. Things that didn't take all day and weren't extremely complicated. That's where this soup comes in.<br /><br />These cello packed soup kits have been around forever. To my grandmother these packs were considered fast food! Imagine being able to pour a single package of dry ingredients into a pot of boiling water and have decent soup in two hours. My grandmother made this soup when she needed to make something fast. My mother made this soup and considered it cooking.<br /><br />Pea soup was her favorite, although the Vegetable with Mushroom <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HP5H8S">MANISCHEWITZ Vegetable Cello Soup Mix with Mushrooms, 6-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 24)</a>was also served. Strictly speaking, this is what is called "Soup Starter", meaning that you are supplied with all the dry ingredients necessary to make a very good soup. All you have to do is add boiling water and stir in the little mysterious packet of spices at the end.<br /><br />If you want a superior soup, you need to add stuff to the base; stuff lying around in the fridge. Like the turkey carcass after Thanksgiving dinner. Or meat bones, or cubed meat or sliced franks or chicken stock or fresh vegetables like sliced carrots and onions and chopped Italian parsley. The sky's the limit, really.<br /><br />An additional benefit is that this product has the shelf life of forever. It never seems to go bad. You can have a completely empty fridge and a single cello pack of pea soup in your kitchen cabinet and voila in two hours you can feed four hungry people.

review/summary: Spectacular soup!  also base for wonderful enrichments...
review/text: This soup is extraordinarily wonderful!  I hope Amazon will soon offer it on Subscribe and Save, because very few grocery stores in our area carry it.  I've been making soup from this mix for over 30 years -- great for 1 or 2, or large families, or even soup-loving company.<br /><br /> It's delicious just as is (follow extremely simple package directions), but it also takes well to modifications.  I often boil a picnic shoulder in a huge pot of water along with cabbages, potatoes, carrots and onions, making much more than enough for two full meals.  For the third and fourth meals, I use the defatted broth from the pot to make several quarts of pea soup according to package directions, then cutting up the remaining pork and vegetables and adding them to the soup.  A meatless version is also good, just with those same vegetables added to the soup mix (plus liquid smoke, if you like), whether it's made with plain water or vegetable stock.  I imagine chicken or fish would also work well.  And obviously you can use any types of vegetables.  Add any already cooked meat (if desired) or vegetables in the last 5 minutes just to warm them up (5 minutes after you put in the flavor packet); raw meat (if desired) or vegetables can be added nearer the beginning while the peas boil.  To really make the final product pop, top each serving with a dollop of non-fat or full-fat plain Greek yogurt, with or without a few drops of Frank's Red Hot or Tabasco With Garlic.  My husband and I served the vegetarian version of this to 160 people once, to rave reviews.  The meatless or the pork version also keep well in the fridge for reheating up to a week or more later.<br /><br />The best part is not having to soak or parboil the peas in a separate step, along with having the lovely aromatic flavor packet.  An easy, light, nutritious one-pot meal with fresh vegetables during a hot summer and a hearty, insides-warming delight with storage vegetables during a cold winter, all in one!

review/text: Famous Amos Chocolate chip cookies have had several changes to the original recipe.  They taste NOTHING like they used to which at one time was absolutely delicious.  Not so much now... they are more like dog biscuits now.<br /><br />Changes like...from all butter to margarine to mixed oils.... maybe the next version will be petroleum based. They now have no brown sugar, the eggs are almost non-existent as well as any good taste.<br /><br />Avoid eating these "cookies" if they are still available.

So much better than Chips Ahoy, you'll completely forget about them. No yucky after taste like Chips Ahoy. Plenty of chocolate chips made with real chocolate. Gasp. I love the mini size. Perfect for putting a few in a condiment bowl and covering with milk. My secret midnight snack, every now and then, of course. Comes in a huge 40 oz. bag that will last my family of 6 for a month. Hence, I set this up for monthly delivery and at their subscribe rate, who can beat that?

review/text: I purchased a bag of these cookies on Amazon previously.  They were very good, and only a few were broken.  The bag had been encased in bubble wrap with an adequate amount of inflated bags added for cushioning. So I reordered them and received a bag only half filled with cookies, and the rest - crumbs.  It was badly packed with the only cushioning from three dinky inflated bags.  You don't expect to have to eat cookies with a spoon!  I won't be ordering these again.

I know a lot of people, including Wally Amos himself, have talked about the recipe changing over the years, but I can't tell. They always taste great to me. I think these are better than any other chocolate chip cookie I've had lately. If you like this type of cookie, Famous Amos is a good one to try.<br /><br />On a related note, I love Wally Amos' book. A really great success story that will make you appreciate these cookies even more.

review/text: I really like the Famous Amos cookies for bite size snacks. They taste great and the quality<br />and freshness of the cookies is consistent with the Famous Amos high standards.<br /><br /> Once I placed my order, I received it only a few days later, which was 2 full days before the estimated delivery date I was given. Very efficient and effective vendor at quickly getting the product delivered to your door step.  And, because of that, I have no reluctance at being a repeat customer and ordering from this vendor again, once my supply runs low, and Famous Amos Chocolate Chip Cookie deprivation is near to becoming a reality!
