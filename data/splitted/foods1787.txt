review/summary: Too soft right out of the pouch, missing pouch and expired
review/text: Upon receiving it from the "General Store" listed here on Amazon for about $21, I discovered it was expired two months ago but after researching a bit, I found that beef jerky lasts a lot longer than the expiration date. I contacted the online store and they refunded the full amount. I also discovered that there was only 5 packs instead of 6. Upon opening the pouch and trying some I found that they are too soft, like hot dogs. If you eat it right after opening the pouch it will seem soft, but if you leave it out for it to dry it then it actually has a bite-teary taste to it. I'd have to give it 2 stars, I docked a star for the expiration, the softness, and the missing pack.

review/summary: Who writes a review for licorice?
review/text: There are some people in this world who really don't like licorice.  Then there are others who do.  And I'm one that really likes licorice.  But I'm very particular.  These licorice balls are about the size of a large marble.  The candy is somewhat firm - you can squeeze it between your fingers if you squeeze hard.  The outer coating seems a bit sweeter than salty, but it still leaves you to salivate if yu bite into it and the wonderful flavor just swishes throughout your entire mouth.<br /><br />I'm telling you - if you love licorice, I think you'll like this.  And you won't be able to eat just one or two.<br /><br />I really love this stuff.

review/summary: Very Good but Very Sweet
review/text: I haven't had vanilla pudding in a long time.  I tried the Gehl's chocolate pudding in cans, and thought it was amazing considering that, well, it was in a can.  I decided to try the vanilla flavor since I thought it would work great in combo with fruit.  I'm also going to try adding other things, like nuts, rice, spices, etc.  It's a very versatile product.  It looks like you could thin it a bit with milk too (or heat it up) to make a sauce out of it, for crepes, ice cream, waffles, or whatever.<br /><br />Like the chocolate version, this is very good, fresh-tasting pudding.  It has a strong vanilla flavor.  I find it to be sweeter than I personally would prefer; but I believe this is probably about the standard for this type of pudding.<br /><br />You get two giant cans in the order.  The way I store them upon opening is to layer one piece of plastic wrap which I press down right onto the top surface of the pudding, all around the inside of the can, so there is no air between the plastic wrap and the pudding.  Then I put another piece of plastic wrap over the top of the can as normal.  With that method, I was able to keep a can in the frig for about a month before I thought it just started to take on a slight hint of going bad.  I still need to check whether you can freeze pudding (well, I know you can make pudding pops out of it, which this would be a great product for, especially if you needed a lot of pops for a party; just use paper cups and pretzels as handles).  I haven't tried using the pudding as a smoothie ingredient, but I intend to.  I also have a mini-pie maker and plan to try it with some fruits etc. in tarts.<br /><br />As with the chocolate version, I think keeping a can of this on hand for things like gaming parties, potlucks and office gatherings would be an awesome and easy thing, especially for people who don't like to cook, or don't want to try to transport something complicated.  With this, all you need is the can and a can opener (and maybe bowls and spoons if those aren't already provided!).  I even think a can of this would be a fun gift for certain people that might otherwise be hard to buy for.

review/text: Although Black Truffle Oil seems to be milder than the White Truffle Oil by Roland, it is very good. It also has a truffle piece in the bottle, just like the white. Can't go wrong with either one, but you still need to be careful how much you use. Would definitely buy again, but the 2-pack will last me for some time. Since this is my 1st time using truffle oil (white or black), it has been a very positive experience. For the price, it's a good deal!

review/summary: Artificial truffle flavor
review/text: I wasn't impressed with this brand of truffle oil at all. It has a weird aftertaste that I attribute to synthetic "truffle aroma." It smelled fantastic, but used in slightly larger amounts (on popcorn, for example), the off-flavoring was much more apparent. It tastes okay if you are only using it a couple drops at a time, but as a hardcore truffle lover, it just wasn't enough.

review/summary: Heavy On Truffle Infusion, Light On Truffles
review/text: This oil is certainly tasty, and the teeny tiny little bottles that it comes in are very cute.  Since this was the first truffle oil that I have ever purchased, I was surprised to see that this "truffle oil" is really just olive oil with "truffle infusion", whatever that is.  There are a couple of almost microscopic truffle flakes in the bottle, but other than that, it's pretty much just plain ol' olive oil with a little extra taste to it.<br /><br />Just having it in my pantry does make me feel fancy though!  And a little goes a long way.  I really overpowered my taste buds with the intense mushroom-y flavor by trying a drizzle of this oil on a piece of good bread--I'll use this oil more sparingly in the future!

review/summary: Amazing flavor and quality
review/text: I received 2 bottles of this oil as a Christmas gift and I absolutely love it.  Of all the truffle oils I have tried this is my favorite.  The flavor and aroma is absolutely amazing.  Though virtually all truffle oils contain truffle "essence" or "aroma" there are still levels of quality and superiority and Roland truffle oil definitely has it mastered.  Every time I drizzle an item with the oil I can't help but give it a whiff.  Earthy, savory and sensual.  I cannot praise this oil enough.<br />Try it mixed in mashed potatoes, brushed on top of a grilled cheese sandwiches, in white and cream sauces, drizzled on fresh mozzarella, over fresh fries with sea salt, mixed with the breadcrumbs on a mac-n-cheese and so many other uses.<br /><br />Thank you RolandFood for the wonderful product.

review/summary: Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor
review/text: To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words "Medium Extra Bold" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.

review/summary: My Favorite by a Landslide so Far
review/text: I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do.

review/summary: Great Coffee--competetive price!
review/text: I've had my Keurig brewer for 5 months and have tried a lot of brands and the Coffee People Donut Shop regular is among my favorites. Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy's Italian Blend are also favorites.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It's only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop "regular" but instead has "Extra Bold". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes.

review/summary: Wake Up To Caffienated Perfection!
review/text: We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as "extra bold" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand.

review/summary: Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups
review/text: I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.

review/text: My husband and I are crazy about Coffee People k-cups.  A friend gave us a box of the "Donut Shop" cups and they are spectacular.  Very rich and bold, not bitter, but packs a nice punch.  Reminds me of coffee from an old-fashioned percolator.  A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.

review/summary: A perfect "Anytime" coffee that is sure to please.
review/text: I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites.  The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood.  Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NP30XQ">Green Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend</a>  But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees.  The Dunkin Donut brand.<br /><br />This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand.  Not bold or bitter.  Not weak or under flavored.  It is smooth and very flavorful.  It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night.<br /><br />I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Amazon when you join their club.  A great value.<br /><br />I do wish that Amazon would change the name by removing "Extra Bold".  It is not.  It is, at most, a medium roast.  Even when brewed with the smallest setting of the Keurig I would not concider it bold.  It comes out great on the medium size setting.  Very remanicent of that great cup of Joe you would get in the old days at your favorite diner.

review/summary: Quality control needed ASAP!
review/text: Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side.

It also adds a nice kick to party dips.<br /><br />I recently matched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EY5T8A">Beaver Brand Cream Style Horseradish</a> with a couple tri-tip roasts. BTW: Tri-tip roasts are one of the beef industry's best kept secrets. Cooked correctly, they are juicy, flavorful and offer a great value if you're trying to cut your grocery bill.<br /><br />I like Beaver Brand (Made in Oregon!) better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FY06">Kraft Horseradish Sauce</a>, which tastes more like a flavored mayonaise than a creamy horseradish. Not surprisingly, Kraft has twice as many calories (20 calories per tsp serving) than Beaver Brand (10 calories per tsp serving)!<br /><br />In addition, the squeeze bottle is handy, making it easy to carry this condiment for a picnic lunch of smoked fish, goat cheese and a crusty baguette on the Oregon coast. Backyard barbecue? Enjoy a dab of creamy horseradish with your grilled bratwurst and add a dab to your potato salad recipe.<br /><br />According to the Beaverton Foods web site, the company has received more than 100 certificates of excellence and awards for quality--more than all the other mustard manufactures combined. Beaver Brand also produces <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EY3OLO">Inglehoffer Cream Style Horseradish</a> (I recommend this hotter version, too!) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019ZE1VO">Inglehoffer Extra Hot Horseradish Mustard</a>, which was named Grand Champion in the World Mustard Championships.<br /><br />In summary, Beaver Brand creamy horseradish is great addition to your menu, providing lots of flavor without piling on the calories.

review/summary: Toffee + Chocolate = Heaven
review/text: This matcha is phenomenal! You taste the sweet, buttery toffee and the rich chocolate, even a hint of nutty goodness. And it really is good with the green base! These flavors are like magic, how did they stuff so many aspects of a tasty treat into matcha? I mean, this isn't simply caramel + nuts + chocolate. It really does have that buttery smoothness and a toastiness that I associate with toffee. It's amazing that this has all the full, delicious aspects of a good piece of toffee. It really brings to mind Heath/Skor bars in a mug!<br /><br />Of course, the grassy sweet gentle matcha base blends perfectly with this and keeps you from feeling too full/heavy after an indulgent latte of this. But... it's not really indulgent at all! The perfect way to curb a sweet tooth without ruining your diet is with a nice dessert matcha, and this is one of my absolute favorites.

review/summary: Toffee & Chocolate & Matcha, oh my!
review/text: I tried it as a latte - and it was still delicious, but I was still searching for the English Toffee. I'm happy to say that I discovered the flavour the best in an iced tea with no milk OR sugar! That was super surprising to me! I usually add sugar to make the matcha sweet like the flavours usually are in their original forms, but this one came out the BEST unsweetened. Who would have thunk?<br /><br />I keep seeing online a "recipe" for iced matcha, or rather, instructions where all you have to do is add the powder to a bottle of water and shake like crazy! Well, I have tried that multiple times and it's gross every time haha. I uncap a bottle, sip a bit, shake some matcha in and shake away (for a loooong time) - but all I end up with is murky green water with clumps. Clumps that hit your teeth and dissolve into a bitter mess in your mouth.<br />THEN I read on a website (of course I can't remember which one) where they added just a half a teaspoon of matcha, and a tiny bit of cold water - the same way you would make hot matcha - to make a matcha paste first and then add more water! So I added my half tablespoon of English Toffee Matcha, about a teaspoon of water - and my shaking was vigorous! It created a smooth paste almost instantly with no lumps (I didn't even need to sift), I filled up my water bottle with the rest of the cold, filtered water. The liquid was emerald green, not lumpy or murky, and tasty! I didn't add sugar or anything else, just sipped away and lo and behold - English toffee flavour and natural sweetness from the matcha, with a bit of vegetal tones and no astringency.<br /><br />I'm pretty happy that I figured out the right way to make iced matcha in a bottle - I'm also happy with my English Toffee matcha. We're on good terms now ;)

review/summary: Just like Toffee!
review/text: When I opened the pouch I was excited because the smell was so amazingly good. I was preparing myself to be let down just in case because I figured this would be a difficult one to get right. I mean I really don't know when I can stop doubting Red Leaf Tea lol they have never let me down to date, so why would they now right? But still, I had to be cautious as I prepared my bowl of yumminess not to get my heart broken for the first time.<br /><br />As I am typing this I look sadly at my glass, as it is not half full or even half empty but it is totally empty and I am beginning to eat the remaining ice because there is still a little remnants of matcha hanging onto the cubes. If I could get my tongue down into the tall glass I would lick the inside of it!<br /><br />Having made my typical matcha latte, cold, with ice, creamer, milk, and the matcha mix I  think I gulped it down in a matter of minutes, and I am being generous, it was probably more like a manner of seconds! Its a wonder I even can recall what it tasted like as it blasted past my taste buds so quickly!<br /><br />It was in fact nutty, buttery, caramlish but with the toffee flavor of correctly burnt sugar flavor, and of course just the right amount of chocolate but not so much to mask the other wonderful flavors! And as always the amazing matcha powder base shines through taking away the guilt of the sweetly sinful, ummm sweetness!<br /><br />So again Red Leaf you delight me! Thank you for all your amazing matcha offerings and keep them coming!

review/text: This is a good entry level Matcha. It is not bitter or grassy. This blend is perfectly balanced. I wanted to try a Matcha because I wanted the health benefits. It tastes so good, it is hard to not just gulp it down! I added milk after I whisked the powder with hot water because I wanted something cool and creamy. This is a great product and the customer service from Red Leaf Teas is outstanding. If you are on the fence about Matcha teas, go ahead and order your body will be glad you did!

review/summary: Great value and flavor!
review/text: I love toffee so I was super excited to give this matcha a try. I have to say this was a great choice for my first matcha from Red Leaf Tea. You can find more information about this beauty and order some for yourself here: [...]<br /><br />First off, the scent when you open the pouch is of creamy, rich caramel toffee. I was concerned that the color of the matcha would have been muddied a bit with the addition of flavoring, but luckily the matcha is a beautiful, deep green. I love that there are no artificial flavorings added to this tea because the color of matcha is definitely part of my overall experience. I don't have a sifter so I was worried that the matcha might be a bit clumpy, but it was perfectly smooth! After brewing this up without additions, it gives a pretty good froth. The flavor is primarily of lightly sweet toffee, but the matcha is not lost against the flavoring. However, there isn't any edge of bitterness like you usually get with unflavored matcha. If you are new to matcha or don't really enjoy the bitterness it can have, I highly suggest this company and flavor.<br /><br />Although the matcha was good without additions, I wanted this flavor as a dessert replacement. Next up, slightly sweetened matcha latte! I added just a teensy bit of sugar and a splash of milk into my chawan of matcha. Yum! This is pretty amazing! It is just like drinking matcha while eating a big hunk of toffee. This is definitely a great dessert replacement! "Wow!" is the only word that truly describes this flavor accurately. This is my first flavored matcha and it definitely will not be my last.<br /><br />I also want to add that my order was sent out quickly and I received both an email after submitting my order and after it shipped with tracking information. I'm very happy with the service I've received from Red Leaf Tea. I will certainly be ordering from this company again.<br /><br />While this is delicious to drink, I'm already planning how I can use this English Toffee Matcha to bake with. I think that this would be amazing in a buttercream icing and equally good in cupcakes or really any type of baked good. This would also be great incorporated into some whipped cream and used to top fresh fruit or angel food cake.

review/text: I've always been a huge fan of English toffee and English toffee-flavoured drinks. I loved English toffee cappuccinos in my coffee-drinking days and now I'm hooked on Red Leaf's English Toffee Matcha!<br /><br />I opened the bag with great expectations. The actual tea blew those out of the water! The scent was enough to send me running to the kitchen to make myself a cup. It smells like caramel and chocolate. A decadent dessert. I made a cold almond breeze matcha latte and slowly savored every sip. It truly tastes like what it purports to be. English toffee! I was skeptical about the English toffee-match combination, mostly because I couldn't conceive how the bitter, grassy matcha would pair with chocolate and caramel. But I was more than impressed. It tastes like English toffee, with no bitterness or grassiness of matcha. A hit!

review/summary: Toffee!
review/text: Now, I have to say, I am wildly impressed with Red Leaf Tea. With the sheer amount of matcha I've been getting through this promotion, I was starting to feel like I was taking advantage of their goodwill and resolved to hang up my reviewing hat, saying that I had tried all the flavors I wanted to try. Imagine my pleased surprise when I mentioned this in a review and they responded to let me know they were releasing new flavors soon and encouraging me to keep trying new ones and keep reviewing! I know they read all reviews posted and I've received wonderfully kind responses to my reviews and emails to them. Their customer service is stellar and it makes it so that I want to recommend their teas to everyone I meet (and I do!). And while yes, I have gotten a ton of matcha through this promotion, I've also gained an adoration of matcha that will keep me coming to them long after I really do stop reviewing their product. But by now they know me, and they know my reviews and they're just wonderfully kind to me. When I received my package yesterday, I found a little matcha spoon included with my order! I don't know if it's a promotion I just didn't see, or if it was for me specially, but it certainly made my day!<br /><br />I don't know an awful lot about English toffee, but what I do know, I like. I got this one to try with my wife, in an effort to get her to like matcha. We'll see how it goes!<br /><br />When I opened the package, it smelled a lot like the Caramel Matcha from Red Leaf Tea, which is very promising. I love their Caramel matcha. Brewed up, it still smelled like caramel, but with a hint of chocolate. And that's exactly what it tastes like, caramel mixed together with tasty, tasty chocolate. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this is very, very good. Very sweet too, but not overwhelmingly so. But then again, I like my teas sweet. But when I see pictures of English Toffee, this is what I think it would taste like, so yay! I love that it even tastes like that crunchy caramel....mmm. This would be a very good starter matcha for those who like sweet things, English Toffee especially. I might even win my wife over with this one!

review/summary: Excellent Seaweed Not from China, Reputable company
review/text: I read the other review and had to laugh.  The white spots you see on the seaweed is normal and is from salt deposits.  It's normal to see it on seaweed, and I think it occurs when it's dried.  This link has more details on it: [...] "Note: Dashi Kombu will usually have white spots that may look like, but is not, mold. These white spots are called "mannitto" or "umami seibun" in the Japanese language and are part of the Dashi Kombu. These white spots occur as part of the natural drying process of the product and bring out the flavor; it is recommended not to wash Dashi Kombu before use in cooking."<br /><br />I've eaten a lot of seaweed, many different kinds, and the white spots are normal.  Anyhow, I love this brand Eden Foods, and regularly buy this seaweed, because this company is reputable.  They do not source from China, and this seaweed actually comes from Japan, which is more reliable, and trustworthy in my opinion. Eden foods imports a lot of their Japanese items straight from Japan, where it's made traditionally, and without chemicals, etc.  Taste their toasted sesame oil. True it's expensive, but if you've tried the organic toasted sesame oils by Spectrum, Napa Valley, etc, they do not compare in regards to flavor.  The Eden Foods toasted sesame oil tastes exactly how it should, while the ones from the American companies are very bland in flavor.  When it comes to Asian foods, I think Eden foods has the advantage.

My complaint is that the product is WAY SALTY compared to the same item pulled from the Pacific Coast. Too salty to eat without rinsing.  Way too salty.<br /><br />It is just hard to believe that all that salt is just from it being harvested, hung and dried.<br /><br />If adding to soups or rinsed before eating, it would be fine.

I have heard that the sour cream and onion are the best so I am going to give those a try next but word of warning, buy one box at a store first before purchasing online, you will be glad you did.  The big reason I love annies so much is everything they make is sutibale for vegetarians, meaning they use renetless free cheese so thats why I love them.

review/summary: Great Value; but if you've got a BJ's membership, buy it there.
review/text: Our daughter has been on this formula for about 7 months now, she will be 9 months June 30th. This is a great money saver, and contains all the same ingredients, nutritional values and everything as the major brands. The ONLY difference in the price. We buy the same sized can at our local BJ's for $19.99 a can. You can't beat that price. So my advice, do your homework and compare the store brands to the name brands; you'd be surprised to find they are actually the same. Also, "listen" to your baby. Some tolerate different formulas in different ways. I'm speaking for my daughter, but she has had no problems with this formula and she loves it.

review/summary: Better!
review/text: Our son has been on this formula pretty much since day one.  It is much more inexpensive and more in a can than its main competitor.  Even with coupons from other competitors, this stuff is still better.  Our son doesn't spit up on this much, nor does he have much of a gas problem from it.  I TOTALLY recommend it for the formula using family.

review/summary: This is something Grace Foods should be very good at.
review/text: Unfortunately, they ain't!<br /><br />Jamaica's climate makes it ideal for growing some of the hottest, sweetest, craziest peppers<br />known to man. However, Grace Foods doesn't seem to have its heart and soul in hot sauce, but rather<br />spread thin across a wide selection of typical grocery items; it seems that without a strong focus<br />on hot sauce, this "very hot" sauce falls very flat.<br /><br />This runny sauce is almost a carbon copy of Tabasco. The spice is a wimpy drop in a salty, watery<br />bucket. Very conventional, very boring, and, unfortunately, a flavor that's dramatically overexposed<br />here in the USA already. Too much vinegar and water with anything can produce a bit of an unpleasant<br />smell, and that's what you get when you open this bottle. The spice is weak, the sauce is a little thicker<br />than water, and you won't taste any sweetness of  the Scotch Bonnet. There's a chance they just used a<br />pinch of cayenne pepper like Tabasco does and subtly advertised otherwise.<br /><br />Grace makes this and one other OFFICIAL Scotch Bonnet Sauce. Get that one. This sauce isn't worth your<br />time, effort, or taste buds. 3 Pods

review/summary: The BEST Hot Sauce EVER
review/text: This is the best hot sauce I've ever had.  I enjoy spicy foods, and I would rate my tollerance around an 8 on a scale of 1-10, with 5 being your average person off the street.  This sauce is spicy, but the best part is its fantastic flavor.  It's deep and satisfying; much more complex than the average hot sauce.<br /><br />I grew up a Tobasco lover and discovered Grace only a few years ago.  Since then, it has replaced Tobasco, Texas Pete, Frank's, Cholula, and every other hot sauce I've ever tried.  It's the only thing I buy, now!

review/summary: Great tasting tea
review/text: This tea is very good. It's perfectly balanced. The lemon doesn't overpower the tea taste but compliments it nicely. The tea leaves much bigger than you'd get in tea bags which use powder but it's not whole leaves that are dried that you can get with premium tea.  This is more like chips of tea leaves but that's understandable at the price and this taste great regardless.  There's a good range you can brew the tea leaves too without it tasting bitter.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, this is a lot of tea.  I've been drinking 3 or so cups a day and this will probably last 2 months. Be sure you have a proper way to store it cause it's not a good idea to leave it in the bag it comes with for that long. Overall this is great and I'll be trying other Davidson's tea.

review/summary: Average green tea
review/text: I must preface this review with one thing: Taste is subjective. I believe reviews for edible or imbibe-able products on amazon should always be taken with a grain of salt. Having gotten that out of the way, let me also say that I believe this tea deserves more in the way of a 3.5 or 3.7. The price per pound is very good for the quality of tea. After having drank this tea for a couple of months, I must admit that I am quite tired of the taste.<br /><br /> - My typical experience with this tea has been to brew a large pot, to fill my 24 ounce vacuum thermos, and to bring it to the library for long hours of studying. It suffices well for this. Due to the large quantity, I never have any issue making too much as I can just pour it out with little harm.<br /><br /> - It is very easy to over brew this tea. For the first two weeks I did this constantly; the tea is awful when overbrewed. Take care with the quantity of tea and length of steep. Better to under steep than over steep.<br /><br /> - There is a very fine powder along with the rest of the tea. Be sure to use a decanter with a fine weave or simply shake whichever decanter you use with the tea in it to get as much of the powder out as possible.<br /><br /> - The taste, when brewed correctly, is good. The lemon comes through and adds a nice olfactory touch to the experience.<br /><br />All in all, a good product, and recommended for green tea lovers. Do not judge the tea off of the first brew, like I did, but fiddle around with the quantity of tea brewed and the time steeped until you decide whether or not you enjoy this product.

review/summary: Fantastic Tea!
review/text: This tea tastes wonderful and one bag will go a very long way! Great hot or cold, our whole family loves it and we make it by the gallon daily. I was never much of a green tea fan until trying Arizona brand green iced tea with ginseng. After enjoying that tea so much I started searching for a tea with a similar taste that I could brew at home. First we tried lipton brand Lemon Ginseng green tea bags and although it had a great taste, dealing with tons of small single serving bags to make a gallon each day was a pain. Then we found this particular brand by Davidson's and it was perfect, just what we were looking for! As some other reviews mentioned, this tea has a distinct lemon flavor. If you enjoy lemon in your tea, you will enjoy this as it compliments the green tea and subtle ginseng flavors perfectly. Quick and easy to make in a home iced tea maker with a filter. This is definitely a staple in our home.

review/summary: I wanted to like this
review/text: I've tried many different green teas as iced tea in an electric brewer, all with good results. This seemed like something worth trying, since I've always liked jasmine green tea, so I'd probably dig lemon flavor as well. And if any of ginseng's benefits for the body are real, why not? But while this one was brewing, the entire kitchen smelled less like lemons and more like Lemon Pledge furniture polish. I figured that was a fluke and the flavor would probably be subdued after it was chilled. I was wrong. The flavor was practically caustic, beyond bitter, making my lips numb afterwards. I ended up pouring out the pitcher and trying to figure out what to do with the rest of the bag. Based on an earlier review, I'll probably buy an infuser and try using this for hot tea at a lower temperature. Unfortunately, I can't control the temperature of my brewing machine, so if you're doing the same this tea may not be the best choice.

I've never thrown out anything before, but this goes into the trash.  I cannot find a decent green tea from Amazon anywhere- I'm going back to importing my own.  This is the first tea I've rated below 2.5 stars- I would rate it a zero if I could.  Does not look like tea leaves, and it looks oxidized.  Maybe it's extremely old.  Maybe they gave me barn sweepings instead. Who would have thought green tea is so difficult to produce? Please take this off the market.

I was disappointed, probably because of higher hopes, but the tea leaves I received are almost powder form like in tea bags. High quality leaves when it comes to appearance are complete leaves or almost complete. I'm not sure what quality the other reviews are talking about.

review/summary: Some of the Tastiest Green Tea
review/text: I am new to loose-leaf tea and have been really put off by the high price of Teavana. The Davidson's tea was a great purchase, and tasted a lot better. This grean tea is awesome, and you get A LOT of it. I even transferred some to small jars to let my friends try (this would not have been possible with the 2oz you get from Teavana for the same price).<br /><br />TIP: make sure to follow the brewing instructions. You only need 2-3 minutes to steep this tea. Too much steep time can stew the leaves, messing up the flavors.

review/text: My stores of Teavana and Tea Geschwender teas had run low and I needed to re-order but hated to spend the money. I wanted try a bulk tea option from Amazon to use my Prime shipping option. I bought Davidson's Earl Grey with Lavender and their Green tea with Lemon and Ginseng. Both were just as good as anything I bought from the other stores and around 4-6 times cheaper. I was a little worried about some of the reviews which implied some differences in quality batch to batch. I guess I got lucky this time. The Green tea was smooth and the lemon was a nice complement. Not a strong "grassy" green tea<br /><br />  I'm very happy so far, the main problem is going to be drinking 2 pounds of tea before they go stale (12-18 months is usually reccomended when in air tight containers). Then I will see what the next batch is like

This all done at 9AM, and then set the jug in the sun. At 5PM, I brought the jug in and set on the counter to cool. In the morning put it in the fridge, and by late afternoon, it was amazing.

review/summary: Results are up to you and how you brew!
review/text: I enjoy this tea.  Let me start off by saying that the results you get are largely determined by how you brew it.  The first batch I made I got distracted and let it over steep by a minute or two and probably used water that was more like 190 or more than the 180 degrees you should use for green tea.  This resulted in a bitter brew and was not enjoyable.  I could certainly see where people would get the "dish soap" idea.  I have other green tea that does the same thing if you over steep so I knew that this was my negligence and to give it another try.  The second batch, wow, completely different flavor and taste!  The second time I let it set for two minutes, let the water cool to 180 before I poured over it and wow, this made the flavors quite enjoyable and no bitterness.  It was completely different than the first batch.  I really enjoy this tea and do not find the flavors overwhelming at all if you brew it properly.  I drink a lot of different teas, and this has become a daily staple for me.<br /><br />I couldn't agree more with the other review that says to watch steep time and temperature with this tea.  If you do this, you will enjoy this tea, if you do not, you will get bitter, dish soap tasting tea.  I'm also looking forward to trying this as iced tea as I think it would be great as well.  This is a great value for organic tea.

I'm sure it's very healthy, but the taste and consistency makes you feel like you just swallowed a mouthful of 409. The fruity lemon aftertaste isn't enough to offset the very 'non-tea' flavor. Davidson's brand makes several flavors, and maybe some of the other flavored teas are better, I don't know. But this lemon ginseng flavor is awful stuff. Unless you're a hardcore tea aficionado I'd steer clear of this one.

review/summary: My Daily Green Tea ~ Excellent taste and value
review/text: This ends up being my daily green tea. Many times I will mix the Green Lemon Ginseng 50/50 with a Gunpowder green tea, or some other unflavored green or white tea and add a tiny bit of Agave syrup when brewing for 3-4 minutes; this makes a great cup of tea in the morning. It is pretty lemony by itself, but mixing it with a plain green or white tea makes a delicious custom blend. I usually keep out an ounce or two of the tea for daily use, then vacuum seal the rest and store in the freezer. This large bag will last me 7 or 8 months, but the vacuum sealing & freezing trick keeps it fresh. It's an incredible value, and I have no problem with the quality of this product. I switched from coffee to green tea several years ago, and this continues to be my favorite tea. I have also used this tea to brew large batches of iced tea that I store in the refrigerator in the summer, again brewing it with a little Agave nectar and it makes a great, affordable refreshing summer drink.

review/summary: Loved it.
review/text: I purchased this tea earlier in the week and it arrived today, getting quicker than another product I ordered at the same time, which is always a plus. Initially I had been afraid it would arrive in a plain paper lunch sack like the picture shows. I was incredibly relived to see that it came in a sealed and lined pouch instead. All the same I did put it in an airtight container because I didn't really trust the Ziplock like seal all that much.<br /><br />I've only had one cup of it so far (mostly because it's August and pretty hot out) but for the price the taste is wonderful. You get a nice taste of the green tea, and just a hint of lemon, that I quite like, it isn't overpowering at all. I felt that the tea was just a little on the weak side, but that might have been because of how long I brewed it. I think that this would also be very good as iced tea.<br /><br />I read one review where the buyer said that their tea was practically powdered, but mine was whole and in good condition. The leaves are big enough that very few escape through the holes in my infuser like a couple of other loose leaf teas that I have tried.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with this product, and I would recommend it. I would probably buy it again but maybe next time in a smaller package, an entire pound of tea seems to be a bit much.

I am not usually a huge fan of lemon, but I find the lemon myrtle provides the perfect touch. I don't notice the ginseng, but I don't care either way; in Chinese medicine, they say that ginseng is wasted on young people. $12 for a pound of quality loose tea is an incredible bargain, but the fact that it's organic makes it even better, and the 15% off from "Subscribe & Save" knocks this one out of the park!

review/summary: Great for dialysis patients, wish for better packaging
review/text: I have suffered from Renal Failure and been on dialysis for 11 years.  Controlling liquid intake is of the highest priority with this condition...too much water can lead to very bad consequences.  I have tried every trick nephro-dieticians have recommended; sucking ice, eating frozen grapes, avoiding all forms of sodium, but none of these have either quenched my constantly dry mouth or helped me control my liquid intake.  I came across quench gum and now swear by the product.  It has helped me control my constant thirst and dry mouth which have made my treatments much more effective.  I also find them helpful at those moments in grad class when I get a little tired -- I pop a quench and they are a great wake up call.  It has worked so well for me that I shared a tub with all the patients in my treatment center and a number of them have found the same positive effects and now we all chew quench.  All of the above complaints about the packaging are true.  Don't keep them in your pocket long or they'll meld to the paper.  Also pieces tend to get hard to chew, but a small complaint for all the positive it gives me.  I have used the sugarless, but I just think the taste is horrid.  I love this product.

review/summary: Does The Job - But Too Much Sugar
review/text: I have allergies and take meds to keep myself from constant sneezing and itchy-eyes. The antihistamines however, really dry me-up. I work-out daily and even well hydrated I still get terrible dry mouth. Quench gum has the citric acid, the tartness to keep my mouth fresher. The sugar blast along with the tart, is almost too much. I'm very health conscious and one piece is more sugar than I care to pop at the gym between 4-6 times in an hour & half time frame. I've not checked for a sugar-free version of Quench gum, or something along those lines. If sugar is not an issue, it works well to hydrate your mouth. CONS: (1) not really a good chew. The gum seems to soften and begin to disintegrate within a twenty mins. or less. This requires you to pop another piece. I like a gum I can really masticate while running on treadmill, and (2), Quench gum can't be kept very long in a pocket or anywhere it might be too warm and a tight space. It will stick like glue to the wrapper, never to peel off. I have, really, had to pop gum, wrapper and all in mouth while running. Just my spin.

review/summary: Best workout gum ever!
review/text: On long bike rides ,hikes or, sessions in the gym I always use gum to keep my mouth "Clean" and to keep pace. Tried Quench gum and im blown away. This stuff keeps its flavor a long time and keeps your salivary glands flowing. Making it great for not having to stop and get a drink as often I found for boxing its invaluable! It Means less breaks and more stayin in the groove when u workout. Best gum for sport on the market.

review/summary: AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: If you've never tried Italian Yoga Juice, you're missing out on something seriously spectacular. I tried one of these in Italy and drank nothing else for the entire trip. In the states we have nothing that even remotely compares to Yoga Juice. No juice has been able to satisfy the longing I feel for Yoga. I searched high and low trying to find an affordable way to have it shipped to me, because sadly this juice cannot be purchased in the U.S. My last resort was to have my family over there ship it, which would have been extremely expensive and unreliable. Then Ditalia made my YEAR. Offering three different flavors in two different sizes, Ditalia took great care in the packaging of these glass bottles to make sure that they arrived in tact. I ordered my Juice, and a week and a half later they were waiting for me outside of my apartment. I couldn't be happier. Bravo Ditalia!

review/summary: Great Chips
review/text: I really like these chips.  My husband tried the Nearly Naked, Plain ones at a pot luck supper. He loved them and asked what they were.  We could not find them in our local stores so we have been ordering them from Amazon by the case. I decided to try the Cinnamon Sugar Chips because we loved the plain ones.  The Cinnamon Sugar ones are a great snack when you feel you need a little something sweet.  They are sweet but not as sweet as eating candy or a cookie and better for you.  Great with coffee for breakfast.  They are a healthy choice since you do not over eat with them.  They are very crunchy and filling, a little goes a long way.  The nearly naked, or plain ones are great with hummus.  Stacy'<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY">Stacy's Pita Chips, Simply Naked, 1.5-Ounce Bag (Pack of 24)</a>  pita chips are a good alternative to potato chips and other junk food snacks.

review/summary: Needs more umph
review/text: For quite a while, I have been taking a chai tea bag and a plain yerba mate bag and brewing them together in a large mug with a little stevia to start the morning.  Since this has a chai flavor, is sweetened with stevia and is yerba mate, I thought it would save me a step or two.  Unfortunately, while tasty, the flavors are weak and it takes three bags to equal the flavor of the two I used to use.  It doesn't matter how long I let it steep either.  It's cheaper my old way and that flavor is dependable.  I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: Quality issues
review/text: I too wondered if the quality slipped a while back so I decided to hear it from the Horse's mouth.  I wrote to the Renfro company and asked about the issues that were stated by the previous posters here.  This is the reply I received:<br /><br />Hi David and thanks for contacting us.<br /><br />We did have an issue with taste for a short while, but have since changed vendors and everything should be back to normal.<br /><br />Since mid-Nov to mid-Dec, store shelves have probably been 99% with the "newer" product.<br /><br />If you've had a chance to taste the "new" peppers, please let us know what you think.<br /><br />Best,<br />Jane Cohen for Renfro Foods/Mrs. Renfro's Salsas<br /><br />I say I'm glad they recognized the problem and fixed it.  I am back in their camp now with thanks to the Renfro group all around.<br /><br />David -

review/summary: Not the same Mrs. Renfros
review/text: I agree completely with the other commentors. Mrs. Renfros jalapenos used to be the best available in a jar by far. I have stopped buying them now since the change. Can't stand them anymore. I hope I get notified when they go back to the original recipe. I will buy them by the case when they do.

review/summary: They've changed!
review/text: I got hooked on eating jalapeno peppers as a snack several years ago. Yup, just eat them right out of the jar. A regular part of my grocery shopping trips was to come home with a jar of whole jalapenos. And unless they were out of stock, I would get Mrs. Renfro's because they were hands down the best tasting, freshest and most crisp.<br /><br />Once I moved out to California, I couldn't find them anymore. I was very happy to see I could order them on Amazon, so I got a box. However, between the time I'd lost them and re-found them again, they've completely changed! The recipe is different or something because they don't taste the same as they used to. They're just not as good. They're still fairly crisp and the new flavor isn't terrible, but they just don't have that zest that they used to. They're sweeter now, and the heat is a lot milder.<br /><br />They're still a good pepper, but they're not the best anymore. I think they should go back to their old recipe.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: Aside from being hard to find, Mrs Renfro messed up a good thing. Reminds me of the Coke recipe change years ago.<br />Why change the best pickled jalapenos on the market. I loved them the way they were. About 2 years ago they became impossible for me to find even on their own website. Then when I find found some to order and had them shipped to me, the label was different and so were the peppers. They are now smaller and less mature and they have also removed natures handle (the stem) from them. Maybe they had to change suppliers, don't know.<br />I have been giving away the jars I received and now gone back to buying Trappey's, next best thing. I hope they go back to the original like Coke did. I'm guessing their sales are off but are stuck in a contract.<br /><br />I loved the flavor and texture the way they were. Now I buy others.
