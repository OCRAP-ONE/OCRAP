review/text: My dog won't eat these things. I can offer her nothing else to eat all day and she still will literally turn her back and walk away from these things. I tried gifting them to another small dog owner, only to find they are warned against as a choking hazard. Turns out they are so gummy that they sometimes get stuck in a dog's throat and choke the poor thing to death. Maybe my dog knew something I didn't... or maybe they just don't taste or smell that good to some dogs. Buyer beware. (Message me if you want an almost full 96 count box for just the cost of shipping, since if you are going to buy them, I hate to throw away something someone else can use.)

review/summary: These scare me.  Look at what I've found online:
review/text: I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:<br /><br />"At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died."<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. "Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog," the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  "These things tend to be wolfed down," said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. "They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way."  [...]<br /><br />Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  "At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,"<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm still extremely leary.

review/summary: Not too thrilled
review/text: I expected to recieve a box of Greenies, which is why I ordered this.  I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them.  Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing.

review/summary: I don't recommend this treat for your dog.
review/text: From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog.  As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them.

I have now opened the 2nd pack and both were the same:  all of the greenies were stuck together in one big lump.  I had to forcibly pull them apart.  Although I didn't try them myself, it leads me to believe these are old products and probably stale.  I will not order from this vendor again, even if it is a buck or so cheaper.

While googling greenies a couple of weeks ago, I found that several dogs have died because they were not able to digest greenies. Please do some research before buying this product again. It could save your dog's life. Since switching to another dog treat, my dog has not had any problems (although it has only been two weeks).

review/summary: I like Greenies but these are too tiny and snap in half
review/text: I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half. The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These breaking in half defeats the purpose.<br /><br />For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up.

review/summary: Greenies are not digestible -your puppy will vomit and have diarrhea and will get very sick
review/text: I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: "a Greenie got stocked in his intestine".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. "Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog.

review/summary: Be careful with wheat gluten
review/text: I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as "gluten intolerance"in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.

review/summary: Find another treat
review/text: I have an almost two year old lab mix named Ares. I willingly admit to spoiling him and didnt mind getting him these over priced treats. His vet told us that his joints were in need of attention so I took it upon myself to buy Greenies treats that support joint care for large dogs. I started with a small bag to see if he liked them which he did. He was in love with them. I noticed he had a bit more gas than usual coupled with some less solid poop, but I didnt really read to much into it. After giving him these treats he farted almost constantly! He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out. Once he got to the point that he was leaking diarrhea onto my floor it hit me. I called his vet who advised me to discontinue use of this horrid product. After which I looked up reviews and was horrified at what I read. This stuff is posion. Its killing dogs and cats. DONT LOSE YOUR BEST FRIEND OR WASTE YOUR MONEY! Find a better product. Your best friend deserves it.

review/text: Do not buy these for your dog! I made the mistake of not researching Greenies Dental Chews online before buying these. If you Google the Greenies and how sick it may make your dog you will be shocked these are still on the market. Dogs have died eating this deadly poisonous treat.<br /><br />I saw the reviews on this product and I bought the teenies for my Yorkshire Terrier and gave it to him at night after his dinner. I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time, I'll give him just half of the teenie. The next morning he didn't eat and he threw up bile and some of the food he ate from the night before. And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.<br /><br />I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets!

review/summary: The Ultimate Consumer "Fraud."
review/text: We have two St. Bernards, one of whom is close to ancient, and last year she developed a dental problem.  Someone mentioned GREENIES and off we went to find our old girl something to help her age gracefully and hopefully without pain.  Well, she just loved them - as did the younger Saint - and here we are a couple of thousand dollars later wondering how to wean at least the younger dog off these obviously addictive green hard gel bones that don't have a single expensive ingredient in them.  The packaging, however, is nicer than that of most department stores but just how many of those boxes do I really want?<br /><br />I have calculated that the most expensive dentist around here would have cost less than the dent Greenies have made in my pocketbook.  So this is a warning to first time browsers - move on to another product that might well do the job for a third of the money.  A stop at your local butcher's shop could be cost saving compared to these overpriced pieces of strange green.  Someone should tell these folks that we are inching toward a depression because to date their reaction to what must be declining sales is to just keep upping the price.

review/summary: Greenies are the Best
review/text: My dogs get more excited over Greenies than any other treat.  I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.  Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies.

review/text: The fur kid loves these & vet has commented on how clean her teeth are for a seven year old.  They're pricey, but for a once a day treat I think they're worth it for keeping her teeth in good condition, not to mention seeing her big grin when we open the container.  We should've named her "Greenie" because that one word gets her attention like nothing else will.

review/text: I thought I would write a review because I have seen some negative ones out there. In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.

review/text: Dog loves these - and he's about an 85 lb chow/german mix, so the large size is good for him.  I guess these are good and healthy for dogs - supposedly they are - but they're also pretty expensive.  These are also chewy - so it only takes him about 1-minute to devour - so you may want to take that into consideration if you're looking for something that will last a little longer . . .

review/summary: keeps breath fresh but gives diarrhea
review/text: I bought these without first doing some research. I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews.

My dogs love these so much they will do anything I ask them to do just to get one. They will come to me when I call them, no matter where they are, if they think they'll get a greenie reward. I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie. I have never seen a dog yet who did not love greenies.  Even my almost toothless fourteen year old schnauzer loves her some greenies.

They make a great snack for after school and are superb as a side-dish or as the main course. They go great with fruit, salads, vegetables, and even dinner rolls.  Try 'em!  Can't beat the price either.

review/summary: A quick side dish
review/text: This is another quick to prepare product that can be used either as a light lunch, or as a rice side dish.  Following directions, I cooked it for 4 1/2 minutes and ended up with a slightly moist rice (directions incluce letting it stand for a couple minutes after cooking).  It has a very pronounced herbal flavor.  It is a bit high on sodium with 780 mg.  It is listed as 250 calories.

review/text: The Bowl Appetit line has several great products, and this is my next favorite after the chicken flavored pasta one. Both have a lot of flavor, keep forever, cook quickly, and are reasonably non toxic. Compared to other similar products the sodium and fat levels are not terrible - ish. Price is great on subscribe and save! Either one mixed with a $1 can of chicken makes a light meal.

review/text: I have purchased this in the grocery store and found it to be a tasty and easy lunch to take to work.  I wanted a case of this for my daughter to take with her, but when the order arrived I received one bowl not a case, called amazon and they said they would send a replacement right away, but the next shipment contained only one bowl again.  Amazon refunded my money and said they would look into this.  Told me to wait at least a week to reorder, till problem is solved.  Other flavor I ordered shipped correctly.

Cats need meat, not a bunch of cheap grain fillers. [...]*Note* There's never been a recall on this food.<br />The price is lower than most of the "premium" foods, too.

review/summary: Undecided
review/text: I have been using this cat food for about 5 months now.  I have mixed feelings about it.  One of my 5 cats eating this food developed a hair loss patch on one side of her spine about the size of a tennis ball.  There were no other symptoms that I could tell.  It did take a couple of days for them to begin eating it as I did mix it at first with their previous food.  This particular cat did seem to lose what I would call her winter coat and became much less "hairy" so to speak.  Now, months later she still has that patch on her back where the hair is much shorter.  I was hoping the other cats would slim down a little using this food, but, alas, they have gained.  I am feeding them less than the recommended daily amount for their weight.  They always seem hungry.  I can only hope they're not uncomfortably hungry.  I do not want them to gain any more weight.  I also have noticed that the ingredients list on the package is NOT the same list that is shown on Amazon.com.  I feel that is false advertising. They should correct that to reflect the exact list on the package.  For these reasons, I am not sure it is the best food for the money.

review/text: This is a high quality dry cat food that I feel comfortable feeding to my cats.  I found no corn, wheat, or soy in the ingredient panel which I prefer to be absent in cat food.  There is some cranberry and blueberry listed which is interesting.  Also, there are no animal by-products (feathers, feet, etc...) listed in ingredient panel which my cats can't digest anyway.  I feel that my cats eat a healthier diet than most people in this country eat.  While it does cost a bit more than artificially colored and flavored cat foods, the lower vet bills help defray the cost.

review/text: My cat has been eating this brand for about a year with no issues. Ever since they changed the kibble shape, my cat has been vomiting after his meals. I'm guessing they must have changed more than just the kibble shape because something is not agreeing with him. I have been trying to figure out what else could be the issue. He is very healthy and I see no other changes in him. He is still his very energetic self which makes me think no health issues are to blame. I've changed his food and so for no vomiting.

review/summary: Cured my cat's "inflammatory bowel disease" overnight!!
review/text: My last cat (which I had from 1987-1999) was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease about age 5 or 6 after losing weight and throwing up a lot. When the bowels are inflamed, cats cannot absorb nutrition well, and lose weight. The intestines also gradually build up scar tissue making things even worse. He had to have a biopsy to diagnose, and was on increasing daily doses of the steroid prednisolone for the rest of his life, as more was needed to be effective. I had to put him to sleep after he eventually lost so much weight he was pretty much skin and bones, and very weak. It was extremely traumatic to go through this, and when my current cat was diagnosed with IBD as well at the same age, I was in shock. Both cats (old-fashioned Siamese) had always eaten supposedly high-quality premium dry cat food, such as Iam's and Science Diet. Was I doomed to go through this again with my new sweetie? And was he doomed to years of pill-taking, discomfort and weakness?<br /><br />Thankfully, the difference this time around was the Internet. For the last three years, I've been researching IBD and reading the many sites dedicated to cat nutrition (such as the great catinfo-dot-org), which tend to advocate a grain-free canned food diet (or even raw food, although that's a little too much for me...) as the closest thing to a cat's natural diet. The moisture in canned food makes it both easier to digest (reducing throw-ups), and provides water that most cats get too little of (a drinking fountain helps encourage water consumption, but be sure to keep it CLEAN). The theory is that the grains in modern pet foods, along with the lack of moisture, are what is causing the epidemic of digestive problems in cats. (In contrast, dogs are omnivorous by nature, so grains are fine for them.)<br /><br />I tried many different foods recommended on these sites (notably grain-free Wellness varieties), as well as various prescription foods from the vet, but my cat still had constant, stinky loose stools and vomiting, and the prednisolone seemed not to help much either, unlike with my previous cat.<br /><br />I finally came across Chicken Soup, and VOILA, overnight NO MORE DIARRHEA!! It took 2-3 weeks to completely stabilize, but he now has formed, normal-smelling stool every time, and even better, he needs NO MORE STEROIDS! It is simply a miracle. Chicken Soup lacks corn and soy as well as wheat/gluten, and sticks to mainly chicken for the protein source (no lamb, rabbit, venison, beef, and just a small amount of salmon, turkey, and duck). It does contain some grains: barley, rice, oatmeal and millet, but these are the least likely to trigger allergic reactions. Whatever he was allergic to, I'm ecstatic that my precious baby is now getting the nutrition he needs and no longer suffering from diarrhea.<br /><br />He is getting both canned and dry Chicken Soup, because he still won't eat the canned as his only food source, although I've been trying to wean him off the dry. Some canned is better than none...but he is addicted to dry after all these years. My next cat will only get canned from the the beginning!<br /><br />The one odd thing I have noticed since switching to Chicken Soup exclusively is that his fur is not as smooth and silky as it used to be. Not sure why. I intend to add some cat vitamins to his food to see if that helps. I'm not taking off a star for this since I will never feed him another cat food, but just wanted to mention it and see if anyone else had this experience and what they did about it.<br /><br />Excuse me for the semi-graphic nature of this review, but I think many cat are diagnosed with IBD and put on steroids when a diet change may be all that is needed. I sure wish I had known all this in time to save my other kitty. Keep trying and don't give up until you find what is right for your cat. Some cats may not tolerate chicken, but for mine, at least, Chicken Soup is the cat's pajamas!<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm still searching for the perfect kitty litter...not sure there's an answer for that one!

review/summary: Best I could find
review/text: I have alot of experience with various dry foods.  Started out with Deli-cats from Costco which gave my cat struvites and almost killed him when he couldnt pee any more.  Scared the hell out of me and after a $2000 vet bill for the animal hospital decided it was not prudent to skimp on food quality.  So went to the highest end food Evo which costs about twice as much as Chicken Soup.  While it is really a high-quality food I started noticing that my cats just gulp down the kibble without chewing.  The kibble is too small for adult cats.  This causes 2 problems: bad for tooth and gum health if they dont chew, and eating too fast which can cause vomiting.  So I went thru small batches of about 8 premium brands looking for a good sized kibble.  None of them qualified until I found Chicken Soup.  The kibble is X shape - not round like the rest - which kind of forces them to chew.  Ingredients look fine.  Price is actually reasonable compared to the others.  So I have been feeding it about a year now.  The only thing I can say negative is, like some others have noted, that it causes loose stools in my 11 year old cat.  However my 2 younger cats seem to have normal bowel movements.  Maybe she needs a senior cat formula - if it keeps up I will have to look to feed her something else.

review/text: I started using Chicken Soup for Cats at the encouragement of a friend that runs a kitten rescue. One of my cats had extremely greasy hair and problem ears. According to her research, other brands are too rich. Once the cat started eating it, the problems were solved, and all my cats' coats became much shinier. I turned other friends on to Chicken Soup with the same glossy coat results for their cats.<br />PS The Chicken Soup for Dogs is great too! My older dog has more energy and the shiniest coat ever!

review/summary: I Say Yes, My Cats Say No
review/text: I was hoping to find a premium cat food that could meet the individual needs of my 3 cats.  Chicken Soup Formula is free from fillers and came highly recommended.  One comment came from a "Cat House" owner who had done extensive research before choosing this product.  I needed a formula that could help my 3-year old Tabby gain weight.  He is a finicky eater who was Feral before we were able to domesticate and take him in.  He seems to be drawn to the "junk" food we used to feed him when we were trying to win him over.  Our little guy, is a 1 year old Tuxedo, who is a burst of energy, and has a delicate stomach.  He'll eat anything if we let him!<br /><br />Another recommendation came from the owner of Maine Coones. These gentle giants have a tendency to swallow their food without chewing and have nutritional needs for joints and long coats.  I was optimistic that Chicken Soup Formula would help my 16 year old Maine Coone.  Her coat has become dull and matted (I brush her daily).  She lacked that gleem in her eyes, was moving slower and was reluctant to jump.  Her weight has also been a challenge.<br /><br />From my point of view, Chicken Soup Formula has met my objectives.  The large morsals force my cats to chew their food which in part results in them becoming fuller faster and has improved digestion.  I am no longer having to monitor 3 different types of foods at meal times.  My Tabby has gained a little weight but could stand a few pounds more.  The litter box indicates that my 1-year old's digestion has improved.  My Maine Coone has that sparkle back in her eyes, she is more energetic, she has lossed some weight,and her coat has regained its shine, and is free of matts.<br /><br />I phased in the Chicken Soup at the beginning of April and switched completely over after 4 days. None my guys wanted to eat it; including my "will eat anything" Tuxedo.  They picked around it and only ate it when they realized there were no alternatives.  I have since  had to re-introduce another inferior formula to make meal times a little more pleasurable for them.  At present I am searching for a formula that can match the nutritional value of Chicken Soup as well as satisfy my cat's taste buds.  The moral of this story is to purchase a small bag to test the waters before jumping in.  If your cat(s) like Chicken Soup Formula, I am in envy.

review/summary: My cat HATED this
review/text: I bought this last April (2011) thinking it'd be wonderful for my cat to eat food without the fillers found in cat food sold in supermarkets.  Up until the point I bought this, she'd eaten Whiskas, Friskies, Meow Mix, & all the rest.<br /><br />At first, she ate the food.  But as time went on, she began eating less & less of it & subsequently was not using her litter box as much.  Very worrying.  So I mixed in some new cat food from the supermarket.  She gorged herself, got sick, & after making her wait until her stomach had settled a little before I put her dish back down, all she would eat was the supermarket food.  If she got a mouthful of this cat food, she'd spit it out & eat ONLY the supermarket food.  This went on until recently, when I gave up & dumped out the remainder of this bag & switched back to her favorites.<br /><br />Now she's happy, & that's all that counts, right?

review/summary: Cat now can't stop licking, biting, scratching his own body?
review/text: I thought this food was good because my cat's picky digestive system seemed to tolerate it pretty well. This was until the puking started and the obsessive grooming. Now he has open sores all over his body from biting his own skin. After some research, there seems to be a bunch of cats who have had skin allergies erupt after being on this food for a while.<br /><br />Edit: It was probably not fair to have given this food a 2 star review initially. Why? Because the ingredient list seems to be good and it was probably my cat who was just allergic to this food. I do find it odd however, that many cats seem to get sick from this food after some time on it. It makes me wonder if there is some ingredient that is being used in excess.

review/summary: My Cats Liked it For a While
review/text: I have two older cats (10+ years) and one had been throwing up every day which was very worrisome.  I was really afraid one of them was dying, but many comments said the vet had no idea what it was.  While trying to figure out what the problem was I stumbled upon all of the info on how bad most of the big brand dry cats food are and all of the nasty stuff that's in them - including euthanized animals (ew!).  Apparently, the best thing for cats is real meat but I have my cats on a timed feeder which is awesome and they don't hunt me down for every meal.  So, I compromised and switched to one feeding of wet (Friskies) and went looking for a good dry because I just can't commit to being stalked all the time when they want to be fed.  Chicken Soup was pretty highly rated and not as expensive as the very top brands - although I think it's still pretty expensive at $28+ a bag (and it started out as a prime item - that helped).  Anyway, the food is pretty big and "X" shaped which did concern me because my cats were used to much smaller bits.  They did transition to it well and the throwing up stopped immediately - and they rarely throw up at all now.  I would say after a few months they started to lose interest and were leaving a lot in the feeder every day.  I would usually cover the wet with it at dinner and then they would finish it.  Not sure if they are just getting old and it was too tough on their teeth or not, but I switched to the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon and they gobbled that right down.  It's much smaller little bits so hopefully that's going to help.  It's only been a day so I'll update after a few weeks.

review/summary: Frankie loves Chicken Soup
review/text: Our short hair 5 year old male cat, Frankie, loves this food. We give him the dry form. When we moved to a small town and I couldn't find Chicken Soup in any of the stores or even the one Feed Store in town, I bought 1 bag of a brand availible in the grocery store. Boy, if looks could kill! Frankie gave it one sniff, walked off a ways, sat down with his back to me, ears back he turned his head to me --- and his point was very clear... I got right on Amazon and ordered the largest bag of 'Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul'. I chose Chicken Soup initially because it had the highest fiber content of all the cat foods including the more expensive ones. All I knew then about required cat nutrition was the importance of fiber in the diet. The wild "big cats" will eat almost everything of what they kill - bone,nails,hoof,fur,tendons,cartlidge along with the soft muscle tissue and some of the internal organs. When I began to look at what most cat foods contained I couldn't beleive I was finding so many grain products in them. I've never seen a cat eat a bowl of corn meal or barley...What!<br /><br />We are all very happy. Frankie has been eating Chicken Soup for 4 of his 5 years and has never been sick, Goes to the vet only for regular checkups and immunizations. The Vet will always remark about how alert,and interested Frankie is in his surroundings. How strong and well muscled; heavy without being fat he is. Frankie is the love or our life (my husband's and mine) and we are thankful to the makers of Chicken Soup for Frankie's vigor,his delight and interest in the world surrounding him. He is playful,kind, making friends with all the neighbors, and is always eager to take part in what ever is going on around the house and yard. Our lives are inriched by Frankie and we beleive his abilities to beneficially influence us, comes from his good health, and his good health comes from Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul.  Many thanks.

But if you're reading about this product, you probably are already aware of the low quality of grocery store cat foods.) My cat is a dry food addict and though I've tried every (healthy) suggestion out there, I cannot convince him that wet food is anything other than a snack. So I decided to at least feed him the healthiest dry food that I can afford rather than Meow Mix.<br /><br />There are some better dry cat foods, but they are only a little bit better and they're a lot more expensive. Some of them cost $10 a pound. At that price, I'd be better off feeding my cat from the meat department at the grocery store. Free range, organic chicken doesn't even cost $10 a pound. (Amusingly I just spotted where Amazon.com claims a list price for the 6 pound bag of the Chicken Soup Cat Senior as $149.49. That's $24.92 a pound!! You could feed your cat steak for less than that.)<br /><br />This is a high quality cat food with an ingredient list to put a smile on your face. For what you're getting, the price is reasonable though it's still more than the Meow Mix. The product is not carried locally. So I was happy when I found it on Amazon.com, as since this item qualifies for free shipping, that is what makes it affordable to me. (If I had to pay the over $14 shipping on it, I'd be better off going to the pet store and buying Blue Buffalo at $2.29 a pound. With the free shipping the Chicken Soup is $1.57 a pound. Without the free shipping it's $2.36 a pound.)<br /><br />Those were my reasons for choosing Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Now how did my Meow Mix loving cat feel about it? When I opened the door and carried in the first box, my cat immediately started rubbing up against it and acting all excited. I had had this plan to slowly transition the cat by mixing it with the Meow Mix. But he was so enthusiastic just at the smell that I immediately opened the box, cut open the bag and offered him a handful. He dove right in. He absolutely loved it! (Now I was bit taken aback. I was so used to multi-shape, multi-color cat food. This food has no dyes. All the kibbles are the same X-shape and they're all brown.)<br /><br />I never did finish that last bag of Meow Mix. I just started putting 100% Chicken Soup in the bowl. I just ordered his third bag and he still loves it every single day.<br /><br />The cat used to throw-up the Meow Mix every so often. But I haven't seen him vomit up the Chicken Soup at all. So apparently it agrees with him better. I haven't noticed any kind of stool problem. (But to be fair, the cat didn't have diarrhea on the Meow Mix either.)<br /><br />I feed him the same amount as I did the Meow Mix: half a cup a day. I'd read that you could cut down serving size on premium foods, so I tried feeding less (also hoping it would cause him to eat more wet food) and all I ended up with was a skinny, underweight cat. So I went back to the half cup a day and the cat's back up to a healthy weight.<br /><br />The one caution I would tell you is this food is not made with artificial preservatives. I buy the big bag because it's more economical (and qualifies for the free shipping), but I only have the one cat. It takes him about 4 - 5 months to finish an 18 pound bag. (Let's see. I ordered my first bag in February. It's the end of October and he's finishing up his second bag. So, yeah, that's 4.5 months a bag.) It means the food is going to sit around for a while. So I take precautions to keep it fresh. I have a small container that I used to feed him daily; it holds about 3 weeks of food. The bulk of the food I store in a large air-tight container with a paper towel over the top of the food. Then when the small container is empty, I refill it from the large container. This keeps the food fresh for the 4 to 5 months no problem.<br /><br />Overall, the cat and I both very pleased with Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Dry Cat Food for Adult Cat, Chicken Flavor from Amazon.com.<br /><br />EDIT: Typical cat. As if making a mockery of what I wrote, two days after I posted this, I walked into the kitchen to find where the cat threw-up this food. But it's the first time. And, bizarre as it sounds, it gave me a chance to find out something. When the cat used to throw-up the Meow Mix it always looked exactly like when it came out of the bag --- hadn't been digested at all. This food must be easier to digest because it was already broken down. It took me a minute to figure out what it was as the cat had puked directly under the trash bag and, at first, I thought the cat had torn another hole in the trash bag and something in it had fallen out.<br /><br />EDIT 2-18-12: KIBBLE SHAPE HAS CHANGED! Just opened the latest bag I ordered. It no longer has "X" shaped kibble. It's now a teeny-tiny circle, much smaller diameter than the "X" had. I admit I'm concerned as it looks small enough that the cat really won't need to chew much, if at all, before swallowing it. And if the cat doesn't chew it, how is it supposed to help keep his teeth clean? However, the cat still loves it. I checked the ingredient list with a previous bag. Found some changes in the smaller ingredients. Methionine is now listed as DL-methionine and the three Lactobacillus ingredients are now listed as dried Lactobacillus fermentation products. All the protein sources, fruits, veggies, etc are still the same and listed in the same order.

review/text: I've been researching cat food options and was very excited to find this product.  The ingredient list was amazing and the price was reasonable.  However, not one of my five cats will touch it -- and none of them have ever been finicky eaters.  I see that other reviewers have cats that love it, but I wish I had tried it with my cats before I invested in a large bag.  Live and learn!

review/summary: Great idea, but does not work for me
review/text: This is a great idea, and I support it as far as I can. Unfortunately, 4 of my cats would not touch it after a few initial bites, and the fifth got all of the food and gained a lot of weight. I quickly switched back to science diet-pricy but they all love it and it gives me a fighting chance at keeping their weight down. I do hope most other cats like this.

review/summary: Great Food at Great Price
review/text: After doing tons of research I settled on this food to feed my 1 year old cat I recently adopted at the shelter. The shelter had her on a corn filled grocery store food--can't fault them for saving resources though. I have been feeding  Chicken Soup to her for six months and I have nothing but good things to say! She loves the food. She begs for it at meal times. Her coat has improved so much. It is glossy and she sheds so little it's incredible. She has no dandruff or skin issues. Also, our vet said she was "ear wax prone" at her first appointment--this quality food has reduced the overproduction of earwax in her ears to zero--clean ears for Penny!! :)  When it comes out the other end, it is firm and not too smelly.<br /><br />I must caution--don't make the same mistake I did and give your cat too much of this food. It's premium food and they don't need a lot of it!! My cat gets 1/2 cup per day which still is too much. She is being weaned down to less at the advice of the vet.

review/summary: My cats hate it!
review/text: I have three persians who all love to eat, so after reading all the good reviews here and elsewhere I bought a 18lb bag. All my cats hated it! They would sniff it a bit and walk away! I'm going back to feeding them Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food, cost a little more but at least my cats like it.

review/summary: RECALLED, March 2012, FOOD MADE by DIAMOND!!!
review/text: UPDATE>July 28th, 2012>This food was RECALLED due to salmonella earlier this year. I googled the recall & Diamond foods and was shocked at what I learned! This food is manufactured by DIAMOND, which has been know to manufacture many brand names and who are know for RECALLS for bad pet foods!!!!  Because of the recipe change and then the recall, I WILL NO LONGER FEED ANY FOODs MANUFACTURED by Diamond!  I would not feed a human child any foods made by a company known for repeated recalled foods and I will not feed my furbabies it either!<br /><br />I have been feeding Chicken Soup to my dogs(fur babies)for years, great food! I didn't realise they're was a Chicken Soup cat food..I was tired of coming home or waking up to find puk on my carpets from one or all of my 3 cats (other fur babies). I tried to find a food they would not throw up, but....Meow Mix=PUK, Purina Cat chow=PUK, Purina one chicken and rice=PUK...I finally found this on amazon and for the HIGH quality and reasonable price I bought it...My 3 cats love it, and NO MORE PUK!!!! Yeah!!! Been 8 mnths now and not a single throw up...I will always feed this to my cats, and recommended it to others..

review/summary: bad for cats
review/text: I tried this food for about 6 days.  The first day our elderly cat began to throw-up.  At first I thought it was just a coincidence since he is so fragile.  I stopped giving him this food and with tummy meds he got better.  By the 4th day, more cats were sick.  By the 6th day, all 4 young healthy cats were sick.  I stopped feeding this and went back to Iams.  All were better overnight.  This has happened to my cats before with "generic" brand foods.  I thought this food would be good because of the supposed quality of ingredients.  No so.

review/summary: Food Allergy
review/text: Did a lot of research online to find a reasonably priced quality cat food.  Most supermarket brands and pet shops carry food with lots of grains, which is not good for pets.  Peek at the ingredients and you will probable see corn or corn by-product high on the list.  This food got several high ratings.  I unfortunately bought the large bag without first testing it on my 2 cats. One cat did fine, but the other cat developed watery stools and rash around perineum 3-4 weeks after switching over.  Loose stools and rash continued another week before I switched to a different food and they both cleared up shortly.  Too bad, this is a good quality food at a reasonable price. I'm feeding them California Natural dry food  with good results.

review/summary: Great product but not exactly like described
review/text: This is a great product and while my cats don't eat much of it they eat enough to maintain a healthy weight. The product I received did not have the X kibbles in the description. My cats would like it better if they were X kibbles since they find that easier to grab with their teeth and chew on. I would buy this again.

review/summary: Mixed results
review/text: The ingredients appear to be pretty solid and our cat seems to eat it with no problem, but she regurgitates about once every week or two, and her bowel movements also do not always look ideal. She has also put on a small amount of weight since the switch, but that may or may not be related. This food is all she eats (aside from a daily Nu Cat multivitamin). These results combined with the other recent reviews claiming the formula for this food has changed in the recent past concerns me a bit, so we may be switching to Natural Balance Ultra Premium for our next bag. In other words, we can't condemn it, but there may be better options on the market. Petfoodratings[dot]net is a great resource for information.

review/text: I've had cats all my life and let me tell you this is one of (if not the best) the best cat foods out there.  The ingredients are superb and all three of our cats love it.  It's hard to find cat food that isn't made with by-product these days and I'm glad I finally found one I like.

review/summary: Great product.
review/text: Really for the price you can't beat the quality ingredients. I got lucky and my cats actually like the taste. Its quite a bit more expensive than what I was feeding them, but also much better for them. Just make sure you transition it slowly, I added a bit too much into the mix one of the days and my cat felt a bit sick for a day, but has been fine since.<br /><br />Edit: I have been feeding this to my cats for over a month now and have noticed they seem much more energetic.<br /><br />Edit 2: This review was written during the old formula. My cats actually prefer the new shape but I don't like the new ingredient list.. they really reduced that salmon. Hopefully they compensated with more chicken but no way of knowing. My cats have seemed a bit less energetic since the switch to their new formula so doubting it is as healthy. I'm guessing the formula was to reduce production cost yet the price has gone up.. so I'm taking off a star.

review/summary: A good cat food choice
review/text: I purchased this food because it's a larger bag at a cheaper price compared to the California Naturals I usually buy. The only real drawback to this cat food is it contains more grains, I believe. And it would be preferable for it to just have whole grain brown rice over white. But it does have a variety of meat sources, which makes it unique.<br /><br />The bag I got had a bit of an unpleasant smell when I opened it. It smelled more like grocery store cat food than other high-end kibbles I've bought. The cats seem to like it fine, though not all of them were crazy about it. I think part of that is because this food is crunchier than what they had before. They are all used to it now, but I think they may prefer their other food. This is a pretty good deal, though, so I will probably alternate this with other brands.<br /><br />If you're looking for a higher-end, nutritious cat kibble at a pretty good price this definitely isn't a bad choice. How many cat foods have chicken, salmon, turkey, duck, flax, kelp, and herbs with no byproducts or low grade ingredients?

review/summary: Highly recommend this cat food!!!
review/text: Our part Russian Blue, Max, has been on Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul cat food for about 3 weeks now.  His fur is glossier, shinier and even softer than before. He is more playful than he has been in a long time.  He was a couple of pounds overweight but has slimmed down.  He was troubled with gooey eyes - vet generically diagnosed as allergies.  No more gooey eyes!  We are very pleased with this cat food. It came highly rated, has no corn or cornmeal, and we feel it is the best we can afford - and that's the best part - it is NOT expensive.  We paid fifty cents per pound LESS than the garbage cat food we were buying at the grocery store.  We got free shipping from Amazon so actually saved on gas by having it delivered! Max LOVES his new food and we feel good about feeding it to him.

review/summary: Very good, with one problem
review/text: I've been using Chicken Soup for the Cat/Dog Lovers Soul for quite a while and my 4 cats and one dog like and do very well on it.  The one problem I've had with the 18 lb. bag of Cat Lovers Light has been an inordinate number of crumbs in the bag, so much so, that I called the manufacturer, which acknowledged the problem and sent me a full refund for the bag.  The rep. explained that the company has narrowed the packers which were responsible for my particular lot and taken it up with them.  I<br /><br />I've not had this problem with the 18 lb. Dog Lovers Senior Diet; hopefully, the problem with the Cat Light will be corrected as I probably threw out 1/4 of the bag's content.<br /><br />Would like to know if anyone else has had this problem?<br /><br />P.S.(2/26/12) This is an addendum to the original review.  Since I spoke with the company and it promised to look into the "crumb" problem, I received a gift card to purchase the same food with a different sell-by date.  There was no problem with it and there have been no further problems with large amounts of crumbs in the bag.  My four cats and one dog continue to do beautifully on it...glossy coats, firm stools and generally good condition.  I supplement the dry food with small treats of turkey ends that I get from the supermarket and my 10.5 year old German Shepherd gets a tablespoon of Authority canned food added to her Senior dry food. All in all, I have had no medical problems whatsoever (knock wood) and my visits to the vet are confined to "wellness" checks.
