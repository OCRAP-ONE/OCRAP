review/summary: good value, taste, and texture
review/text: This dutch coin licorice has good firmness and chewiness (could be a little harder for my liking).  I love all salty licorice and this is slightly salty and a hint of sweet, a good start for a newbie.  First impression is that the flavor is a little off for this type of coin licorice (that's why 4 stars).  But the good news is that it grows on you and now I'm a multiple repeat buyer.  I like my licorice rock hard, so I leave my bags open to harden the licorice in our southwest climate till I can't resist them anymore :-)<br /><br />If you like this, you will also be very pleased with  K&H salt licorice with gum arabic.  That licorice has a little more flavor and a slightly firmer texture than these coins.

review/text: If you are real true lover of licorice, the Kraepelien & Holm Coin Licorice is one of a kind.<br />The taste is a medium taste and you get the real taste of licorice, not waxy or sugary, so it's not real sweet.<br />Also the left overs keep well, although I don't usually have allot of left overs, as once I receive my order, eat some and share some with friends and family who also love the taste, there's not always allot leftovers, but they do last a long time if you decide to store them until later.<br />To me, there's nothing like it, the good, real taste of licorice and I'm hooked.<br />Thank You Kraeplin & Holm for making such a good tasting treat !!<br />Thank You candy companies for carrying it and making it available to the customers.<br />Sincerely ~ A very pleased customer.

review/summary: well packed, fresh, and DELICIOUS!
review/text: my order came in a nicely packed heavy yellow cardboard box with licorice made and packed in the Netherlands; three bags contain nearly 7 pounds of fresh, delicious, sweet and *slightly* salty licorice coins!<br /><br />this licorice may not appeal to heavy ammonium chloride licorice eaters (double-salted), but for my tastes, this licorice combines the best of sweet and salty; the coins dissolve nicely in the mouth, delaying the urge to chew and gobble (and i can gobble some licorice, let me tell you, boy howdy!)<br /><br />:-)<br /><br />truly great stuff at a great price - i'd have to pay 2- to 3X as much from my local candy store (and really, where can you find good Dutch licorice at a local brick-and-mortar store? very few 'round my parts - you may be luckier if you live in a tourist area)<br /><br />i'm tempted to order more, but i'd have to hide them in house in the bottom of my closet - i'd be sure to catch you-know-what if i got caught with another whole box!<br /><br />you will *not* be disappointed with this licorice if your tastes run to slightly salty and not double-salt, nor chewy sweet!<br /><br />keep in mind that you need to keep your intake below 50 grams a day if you're watching your blood pressure!

review/summary: Great Coin Licorice
review/text: Every time I visit The Netherlands I stop by one of their many candy shops and always pick up a supply of Dutch Coin Licorice. Some types of licorice that you find in the states just don't have that special authentic taste.<br /><br />The K&H money coin licorice has the real taste and consistency that I prefer. Each coin has a delicious taste and melts slowly in your mouth coating the tongue and mouth cavity with a long lasting enjoyable taste. To go through one bag will take quite some time -- let alone the 3 bags you get.<br /><br />The candy is not too hard nor is it too soft like the black or red 'Twizzler' style and is not bland, but has great real Dutch licorice taste that you will enjoy.<br /><br />Put one in your mouth and let your tongue do the work of reducing the size till it becomes paper thin and suddenly disappears -- then continue to savor the flavor that remains for a while -- before going for your next coin.<br /><br />If you know real licorice prices, you'll know that this purchase is quite a bargain.

While I didnt get what I wanted I did find something new that I've come to enjoy.

review/text: If you have  acquired a taste for Dutch licorice, your next try-out should be this brand. The coin licorice has a good bite to it, is not too sweet (as is for instance the Klene brand) and is chewy. When I lived in Dutchland (the Netherlands) I didn't see much by this "old" traditional licorice maker on the shelves of the supermarkets. Yet here in the US it's my find and it's a good one. Now you try it. Recommended

review/summary: Quickly becoming my favorite candy !
review/text: As another reviewer said, this licorice has a good combination of zout (saltiness) and sweet.  The saltiness is due to the perfect amount of Ammonium Chloride (see this website for more info: [...].  This is what distinguishes good European licorice from the flavored corn-syrup concoction usually sold in the US.<br /><br />Anyway, enough of the science. :-)  This is really good REAL licorice, and I'm on my second order of this.  I occasionally mix in the really salty K&H Salt Diamonds, just to work on building up my tastebuds for even saltier licorice.<br /><br />If you want something more American-flavored, don't order this.  You'll perhaps be more used to the flavor of the licorice medallions from See's candy (very good, just not salty) also available here on Amazon.  And if you want something still sweeter and chewier (because of the Gum Arabic) try "Gustaf's Platinum Select Sweeet Licorice".

That way you don't get that icky sweetness that stays in your mouth when you use gum or hard candy all day long.  Now that I don't smoke I still enjoy it everyday.  I love it!

review/text: Ordered this last month, and now regret it. The texture is right, saltiness about right, and sweetness about right, but there's an off-flavor here. Chew on one for awhile, then blow some air back through your nose: to me, it smells like ammonia. Not strong, but very off. Last time I bought Gimbal's. Too soft, but the flavor is much better; wish I had gone with Gimbal's again.

review/summary: Good Saffron, Great Price - BAD Packing!
review/text: I have a love/hate relationship with this Saffron. First of all, if you have been using cheapo seasonings, there is nothing to compare the "real deal" with....saffron wins hands down. Likewise, if the only saffron in the local store is the tiny pinch contained in the latino isle of somewhat dubious quality/age this will certainly be a delight at price that makes it worth a try.<br /><br />The quality of this saffron is decent and the price is right. Very aromatic, extremely flavor just the way saffron should be. So, what's the problem? Plain and simple, the packing. The saffron is inside a small plastic pouch inside the glass jar/bottle. while the pouch does help reduce air and humidity...it smells like a pool liner and impacts the saffron. My spouse didn't notice whatsoever...I personally found it very notable. Then again, he's one of those people that can drink coffee from a styrofoam cup and not notice the flavor.<br /><br />For those searching for a better alternatives than what's at the local grocery store...or an affordable entry to try saffron for the first time this might do the job. The plastic does seem to keep it "fresher" but at a price.<br /><br />Update - Recently purchased the Spanish Saffron in the acrylic box by spicy world...not as fresh as this version by frontier despite the preferred package. See my other reviews. Still searching for superior saffron...will update when find one.

review/summary: Misleading amount of spices
review/text: I find it hard to believe that I have received the amount of spice advertised.  The saffron comes in a black plastic bag that is inside the spice jar.  When I put the saffron inside the spice jar, there was barely enough to reach the label at the bottom.  Ridiculous.  I am so annoyed.  Guess I learned my lesson and will never order from this seller or this product again.

review/text: This tea is great!  I didn't like green tea until I tried this flavor.  It has just enough caffeine to get me through my afternoon slump.  I became addicted very quickly, but that's okay because green tea is so good for me.<br /><br />A few notes:<br />- I usually steep it a little longer than suggested--about 4 minutes total.<br />- I can buy this at the grocery store for $9.49 or $9.99, so it's cheaper than Amazon.<br />- No big deal, but I usually end up with bits of tea leaves at the bottom of my mug.  Does anyone know how to prevent this?

review/text: I drink green tea (unsweetened) all day at work so I am always on the lookout for new varieties.  Saw this recommended by Dr. Oz in a magazine and decided to try.  Taste and smell is fruity and good but no better or worse than any other fruit-type green tea.  I shared with a co-worker and they liked it more than me. The one thing that takes it down another star in my rating is that halfway through the 50-count tin, about 6 of the tea bags were torn in processing and were empty, losing all their contents down in the bottom of the tin. Probably will not buy again.

review/text: This low glycemic cinnamon flavored agave nectar is perfect for sweetening a sweet potato or yam. It adds just enough sweetness to enhance the potato, which are awesome when baked and good for you. It can also be used for pancakes and french toast to replace sugary syrups. Being gluten intolerant, I use the flavored agave nectars to perk up my meals and drinks. I order from Amazon.com because they always have whatever I'm looking for and the price is right. I often opt for the subscribe and save option out here in rural New Mexico.

review/summary: Sinfully Good!
review/text: I got this item for free at a grocery trade show.  When I finally tried it back at home, I found it to be delicious!  It is sweet and cinnamon-y, just as promised.  I'm not much of a baker, so I can't comment on that use of the product.  I have used it in tea, in cocktails and on waffles.  I have tried all of the flavors, except strawberry.  They are equally amazing.  I'm sure I'll get around to the strawberry soon; I think it would make a great soda if mixed with plain club soda or mineral water.<br /><br />While agave is better for you than sugar, it is not a miracle food.  You should still use this with moderation.  It shouldn't be hard, as fructose is 25% sweeter than sugar.  It is also lower on the glycemic index, meaning it won't spike your blood sugar.

My family loves it!<br /><br />Stove Top also has a "Savory" stuffing, but I think it tastes exactly like the "Sage".

review/text: I discovered this in a local international foods market and it was a HIT with the whole family. They are fluffy and flavorful yet with the lightest bit of crispiness on the outside, leading me to think of them as a lite doughnut cookies. None of us could get enough, so good thing there is a satisfying amount to each bag (about 15 servings of 5 cookies). Only the most basic natural ingredients are used: flour, sugar, sunflower oil, cocoa, baking powder. Plus it's only about 90 calories for 4-5 cookies with only 9 calories coming from fat. Great news for dieters wanting a perfect treat...Try it with ice cream. We already have and it was delicious. Mom is thrilled.

review/text: Delicious<br />This is the best syrup I have ever eaten! It is thick and rich, has a superb flavor, and is not watered down like all the other junk that is sold in stores now. Best of all, it is 100% pure cane syrup. Also, it does not contain high fructose corn syrup or other artificial flavors. Since I only each natural healthy foods, this product fits perfectly in my diet. My mom is from South Carolina and loves only pure cane syrup. She was thrilled when I shipped some of this to her in Seattle by mail. We used to buy Rodenbury's until they started watering their syrup down to only 35% cane syrup.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is getting hard to find this product in my local area stores here in Texas where it usually runs only about $3-4 dollars a bottle. Why the extremely high price Amazon?<br /><br />Pricing on Amazon rated 1 star, as Amazon needs to come down on the price some. However, I rated this product strictly on its quality which is 5 stars+.

review/summary: It's Molasses
review/text: This syrup is just fine, but if you're expecting something other than molasses, you'll be disappointed.  It's not as strongly flavored or as thick as some brands of molasses, but as far as I can tell it's essentially the same thing.  (Wikipedia says it's sweeter than molasses, because no sugar has been removed from it; but Wikipedia also says it's a kind of golden syrup, which it ain't.)<br /><br />I bought it because I was hoping to find a syrup that tasted like the Karo syrup I remember from my childhood, before government-subsidized, high-fructose corn syrup took over the world.  Steen's is a very different product, which I wish had been made clear in Amazon's product description.  I assume it's good for anything light molasses is good for; but it's not Karo. (Of course, Karo isn't Karo anymore, either.)<br /><br />I've since discovered that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001590BY">Lyle's Golden Syrup</a>, from England, tastes just like the Karo syrup I remember.  It's also cane syrup, but it's made by a different process.  It's available on Amazon in a variety of packages.

If you really want it really hot, you could marinade it in the sauce and then add the rub afterwards I guess.

review/summary: Pricey, but worth the cost
review/text: I was very happy to see that Amazon sells this brand of dog food.  After taking my dog to the vet for allergies, it was suggested that I put him on a Limited Ingredient Diet.  Bison is a very lean protein, and the food is completely grain free.  After being on the diet for a few months, I've noticed the difference.  My dog has less allergy flare ups, and we're making less trips to the vet!<br /><br />Update 12/31/2011:<br />I have taken my dog off this diet, but I do still recommend the brand.  The allergies flared up over the summer and I decided to start him on a BARF diet.  For a small dog, the cost is about $20.00 - $30.00 a month.  I feel better about what he's eating because I can see the ingredients going in, but for those who aren't ready to make the jump  Natural Balance is a great alternative.

While they do hold their shape well and cook fairly quickly, they do not have much flavor at all. Way too similar to regular supermarket frozen patties. They are a let down for the price. You'd get more texture, flavor, and value from standard ground beef. Definitely not worth $45. I'd give them 2 and a half stars if possible.

If you make a purchase from this company, though, be prepared for a BARRAGE of followup solicitation calls.  Once you've had a transaction with a company, they are "allowed" to contact you via phone (incessantly) for a period of 2 years after the last transaction, even if you are on the National No Call Registry.  Any apparent "deal" comes at the cost of providing them a foot in the door to hound you.

review/summary: NOT GOOD even @ half price!
review/text: Ordered for my elderly parents in another state on a special Christmas promotion,  then visited and was able to see and taste the products.  Disappointing and embarrassing!  The steaks were small, thin, and tasteless.  The filling of the stuffed sole, while being made with crab supposedly, was pasty and bland.  The twice baked stuffed potatoes were tasty and appealing (though only the top half was filled, the rest just baked potato) but what you really want when you buy a steak package, is good steak!  The advertised "gifts" were not even kept by my recipients,  so poor were the quality of the knives.  In all, a waste of money.  Even at half price, not worth it!

review/summary: How can Omaha defend bone and cartilege in the hamburgers.
review/text: Stuffed sole ok - good taste and texture.  Fllet Mignon (a misnomer or a deception) tasteless and bears little resemblance of the photograph- not nearly as thick.  Hamburger tasteless, fat and containing bone and cartilege fragments! My mouth still feels greasy an hour after eating it.

review/summary: Mmmm Best Burgers
review/text: These burgers are fantastic! Anyone who is stating they are dry and not tastey or tough and chewey is not cooking them right. Sounds like you are over cooking them or not following the cooking directions. I have made them a number of different ways, pan fried, bbq grill, george foreman grilled and broiled... everytime they come out awesome! Grill or stir fry some onions with them, add a little cheddar, monteray jack or spice it up with peper jack cheese, whatever kind you like, and you got an amazing burger! Top with a little Ketchup or russian dressing if you like condiments or for some added zing lightly brush a little italian dressing on the bun before toasting. So much better than those super market slop burgers! If your not sure how best to make them, read the little book that comes with it. 15 minute flash defrost trick works great for pan frying or broiling. I have grilled them frozen fresh from the freezer on both the bbq and the g foreman grill and they come out great.In fact... I think Ill make some for dinner... AGAIN!

review/summary: Decent food, but overpriced
review/text: We ordered The Amazing Celebration through Amazon, for $80, supposedly a deep discount.  The food arrived about when we expected it, and while the dry ice was gone, the food was all still frozen.  So far, we've had the sirloin steak, stuffed potatoes, pork chops, chocolate cake, and stuffed sole.  The sirloin and pork were decent, but no better than typical grocery store quality.  The meat at Costco is better and much cheaper.  The potatoes were good, and quite convenient.  The chocolate cake was pretty good, and with a short time in the microwave was like an expensive "molten chocolate" sort of cake from a restaurant.  The stuffed sole was disappointing.  It was OK, but no better than what I'd expect at a cheap restaurant.  In short, Omaha Steak food is less expensive than good restaurant food, but also less convenient and not nearly as good.  It's more convenient than getting everything from a grocery store, but much more expensive and not as good.  If convenience is your main goal, and you aren't too picky about price or quality, then Omaha Steaks is a good choice.

review/summary: Decent, but nothing special
review/text: I received 4 of these Omaha steaks burgers free with my recent order, which was my first time ordering from Omaha steaks. Everything was frozen solid upon arrival. Through my own error I guess, for some reason I thought these were actual steaks, in the form of a burger for some odd reason. Ridiculous, I know. Turns out, they're just standard burgers. Nothing special about them really and they look nothing like they do in the picture, size/plump wise. No surprise there. Anyway, I put 1 in the fridge for a few hours to let it thaw out before throwing it on my George Foreman grill. The burger, which was small to begin with, became even smaller when I was finished cooking it even though it held its shape of being a perfect circle. The tray that catches the fat/juices filled up a little bit as it cooked. I guess it's possible I "overcooked" it, but I cooked it the same way I would a Bubba burger, or any other burger for that matter. I like my burgers a little crispy but like I said, these were pretty small to begin with. I have 3 left, so next time, I'll cook one on low instead of medium to see if it makes any difference but I don't see how a burger that small to begin with won't shrink after its fully cooked, seems inevitable. I mean, they are 4 oz burgers. Anyway, the burger itself was decent and somewhat tasty, nothing special though. Threw a piece of American cheese on-top and ate it, without a bun. Tasted like a standard beef patty. I got 19 grams of protein out of it, so I was happy. My girlfriend laughed hysterically though when she saw me sit down in-front of a plate with nothing but this tiny little patty on it...lol I wouldn't go out of my way to order a box of JUST THESE off the Omaha site obviously as there's no point in doing that whatsoever, but I would have no problem eating them again just as long as they were included in a nicely priced packaged deal or sent free with a future order. I'll just make 2 at a time. In this case, I received 4 free, so it's hard to really complain all that much.

review/text: I have these in the freezer always for impromptu cookouts. When the grand kids come over unexpectedly, or when friends drop in and we have nothing fresh to offer, these always do the trick. Take the burgers out of the freezer and set them on the counter top for an hour while taking a quick drive to the market for avocados, tomatoes, purple onion, buns, and lettuce, and when you get home sprinkle a little seasoning on the burgers and put them on the grill on high heat for about 5 minutes then flip them over and put a good dose of shredded cheese on them, and close the grill for a few minutes until the cheese is nice and melted.<br /><br />Put them on a platter and bring out the sliced veggies and condiments and there ya go!! Easy Nice Meal!!<br /><br />The burgers are fine, not the gourmet best, but not bad either---I say go for it, and keep a dozen in the freezer for ad lib meals!!

review/summary: Not that great
review/text: I expected these burgers to be better from the reviews. In the package they look great - fresh frozen with great deep red color. One good thing is that the do retain their size/shape after cooking. But the reason is because they are very lean so the fat doesn't cook out. The huge downside to that is fat = flavor. These were very dry because of the lack of fat to keep them moist and juicy. Unforunately I bought 20 burgers so I have a lot to eat. I will not buy them again.

While they do hold their shape well and cook fairly quickly, they do not have much flavor at all. Way too similar to regular supermarket frozen patties. They are a let down for the price. You'd get more texture, flavor, and value from standard ground beef. Definitely not worth $45. I'd give them 2 and a half stars if possible.
