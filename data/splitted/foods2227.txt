review/summary: I Throw Away Other Cheese Straws
review/text: First of all, I would like to comment regarding previous reviews. I do not think the first review in 2005 was done by an employee, and that's not really a fair statement but rather an assumption lacking any real fact or evidence. It seems like a very small company that just enjoys making cheese straws and wants to share them with others. I sincerely doubt that, at the great price they are, the company even makes a ton of profit - which is a shame.<br /><br />Secondly, after tasting Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws for the first time this Fall, I will not eat anyone else's. I literally threw away a package of a VERY POPULAR cheese straw company that I received yesterday as a gift because when I tasted them, they just tasted bland and floury. I could not even bring myself to finish them. I crave Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws so much. (I recommend trying them with some Shiraz or other wine!)<br /><br />Our company gave out Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws as a corporate customer gift this year, and I bet that Aunt Lizzie will have a slew of new customers after that. Thanks, Aunt Lizzie!! :)

review/text: These cheese straws are very yummy. Unfortunately, I felt that they were making me gain weight as part of my low carb diet. I gained three pounds in the week that I bought them eating maybe a couple of handfuls a day. So, while very delicious, they may not work well for my diet.<br /><br />Update: I see that the product Amazon took me to write this review was not exactly the product I ordered. I ordered the low carb tin.

review/summary: 1st Review Written By Employee
review/text: If you read the first review and then read the company literature it will become obvious that the 1st review was either written by an employee or was copied from the literature. I will say the cheese straws are the best I have ever tasted. From the flavor to the crunchy feel in my mouth, I am addicted to Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. The negative? Customer service is non existent. An order that was placed on the internet was subsequently lost, even though I received a confirmation via email. I was offered no discount or upgraded shipping, no additional product with my order, no discount on my next order, not even an apology for the 7 day delay. Just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her IT guy would be on the problem tomorrow. Personally, I can count the number of times an email has been lost over the last 10 years on one hand. This is not the first problem I have had with an order. They do not give a tracking number with each order and when asked for one after the order is placed the odds of getting one are 50-50. I have had so many problems with my orders I will go without my Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. I will miss them greatly however I need the hassle associated with ordering them less than I need the cheese straws. ANN, I wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future. FOLLOW UP: I just received an email notifying me that my order shipped on the Aug 9th. I have not placed an order! What more can they do?

To be blunt, to me it's kinda like half a pound. The reason I gave it four stars was because of the price, and because the shipping was pretty fast. It's a 16 oz package of tiny beans, nothing more, nothing less.

review/summary: Exemplar chocolate biscuit
review/text: Plain chocolate digestives are the exemplar of the British chocolate biscuit; McVitie were the inventors (in 1839 if you care about such historical facts) of this lovely Scottish (not English, please note!) confection, so these offered here can be regarded as definitive of their class. Whilst available in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZUAEW">milk chocolate</a> variety, the plain (dark) chocolate version is by far to be preferred. It is a solid, satisfying mix of wholewheat cookie and bitter chocolate coating of the finest quality. Purists will, naturally, wish to stick to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZYB4W">plain wholemeal digestive</a>, both those biscuit- or chocolate-lovers wishing to spoil themselves (and their waistline) will opt for these every time.<br /><br />American buyers may wish to remember that Digestive biscuits are officially classed in biscuit grading circles as the second most boring biscuit in the world (after <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HY21K6">Rich Tea</a> and ahead of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJD5LQ">Hobnobs</a>) so may take a little bit of getting used to, if you're not familiar with British biscuits. But I guarantee that after your second, you'll be addicted.  And then you'll wonder where the rest of the pack went.

review/summary: Best Cookie Ever Made
review/text: My family discovered this amazing cookie while in England 40 years ago.  It is hands down the BEST COOKIE EVER MADE.  Harder to find in the US but whenever I have shared these cookies with a neophyte, just one bite and their eyes light up and they rave about it.  The texture is sublime and that layer of chocolate is perfectly proportioned with the with the quantity of biscuit (the English word for cookie).  The milk chocolate variety is sweeter but my favorite has always been the plain chocolate variety.  Also, this is not a junk food cookie.  In a pinch a few McVities make a decent meal replacement.  But when eating as a snack, be careful because they are filling.  And they go down well with a satisfying quantity of very cold milk.<br /><br />No joke - this isn't just a cookie, it is the BEST COOKIE EVER MADE!

I did not observe the expected delivery date as my usual orders through Amazon have been good. It was to be one between 4-6 weeks by the order and it took about 4 weeks. The chocolate was melted and biscuits stuck together. Yes, I should have seen the expected delivery but why does a company expect to take that long for a perishable item or not protect it?

review/text: These cookies arrived quickly and are in great shape.  They are very fresh and are all Shortbread.  The brand sent is Murray and looks just like the picture.  Ignore the 'Kebbler' title.  The Shortbread is made with Splenda and has a pleasant vanilla-like aftertaste.  Eight little cookies come in a packet.  Each is 1-1/2" in diameter.  The packet is 130 calories and has 140 mg of sodium. The packet says it's equivalent to one diabetic exchange each of fat and carbohydrate.  I feel that one packet is just the right size for a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Good cereal with a few potential health concerns
review/text: Kellogg's Apple Jacks provide a delicious, sweet cereal to start someone's day! Amazon correctly notes that this cereal is made from wheat and corn. It seems like Apple Jacks have been around forever; and it's not hard to see why. With their tasty, sweet flavor you can get your kids to chow down on something half-way nutritious before they go to school; and you can even treat yourself to a bowl of these in milk now and then. They can even be eaten dry as a snack.<br /><br />Apple Jacks does indeed contain no cholesterol and the fat content is almost zero--hooray! There aren't even trans-fats in this cereal. What a relief! Apple Jacks are kosher as well if that matters to you. They contain 25% of the recommended daily allowance of Iron, Niacin, B12, B6 and more.<br /><br />Unfortunately, every cereal has its drawbacks; and Apple Jacks cereal is no exception. Apple Jacks contains sugar which can turn into fat inside your body if you don't get enough exercise. Moreover, Apple Jacks contains carbohydrates. If any of this is a concern for you, ask your doctor if you should be eating this cereal.<br /><br />I would also recommend that you eat Apple Jacks cereal before the expiration date stamped on the box. You wouldn't want to eat stale cereal, now would you? SMILE<br /><br />Overall, Apple Jacks is a great way to get kids to eat something for breakfast before school without completely sacrificing nutrition. You can eat them as a snack and you can even carry a few in a plastic bag to eat as a sugar boost snack during the day if you are on the go and can't stop for something more substantial.<br /><br />I recommend this cereal for kids--and us grown-ups, too, who are able to eat Apple Jacks without going against any dietary restrictions your doctor may have given you.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: LOVE THESE DOUBLE CHOCOLATE ORGANIC SNACK BARS!
review/text: We have been switching to organic foods (I have since become pregnant unexpectedly and I DO think eating organic has a BIG part in that!) and I have been looking for a snack bar to replace our FiberPlus bars - a household staple for us. I am super picky, so trying new foods is NOT fun for me, but to my complete surprise I LOVE THESE! I didn't think that I would like the fact that these are CHOCOLATE with chocolate chips and chocolate drizzle, but the bar itself is not too sweet and is not bitter at all either (some organic chocolate is more bitter than standard chocolate) - it has just a medium chocolate flavor which I LOVE. I haven't converted my daughter to these yet because we still have a bunch of boxes of FiberPlus bars, but when they are gone my daughter will be taking these in her lunch and I have no doubt that she will love them as much as I do! FINALLY an organic snack bar that tastes great and does NOT have fruit it in! THANK YOU HEALTHY VALLEY!<br /><br />NOTICE: The product PICTURE shows a different flavor - the "Chocolate Chip" variety, but the product title says DOUBLE Chocolate Chip. I bought mine a the store, but I believe the picture is wrong and this product is the DOUBLE Chocolate Chip variety that has chocolate on the bar ingredients in addition to the chocolate chips and chocolate drizzle.

Not so good for keeping a cat from using the soil under my palm for a cat box--at least it's occasional rather than every day. I highly recommend it for dogs.

review/summary: Critter Ridder did NOT get rid any critters
review/text: I have a problem with small animals eating my vegetable garden. I try to use different products so they don't get used to a particular kind.<br /><br />The information & ingredients for Critter Ridder sounded good.<br /><br />After I got it, I put a fair amount around my garden using the shaker and the next day, things were eaten again. The strange thing was that the ingredients were strong enough that they irritated my skin, but not strong enough to deter nibblers.<br /><br />A couple of days later, I put the rest of the container around the garden along with another product.<br /><br />I had seen a comment under someone else's review indicating that it is necessary to keep applying it. From my perspective, the product is too expensive to put enough around the garden to find out if it really works. So I'm back to looking for something else.<br /><br />July 19, 2012, Update: changing my rating from 2 stars to 1 star. I just checked my veggies and everything (!!) was eaten. Put down 2/3 of the container yesterday, and my garden is not very big. There is no way this product is going to keep backyard grazers from eating anything. I am upset and definitely do not recommend.

I have field fencing that it/they chewed through to get in (or out?), but then couldn't find his/their way out as my dog was barking at it, so she got sprayed -- but just a little bit in the face. I put down Critter Ridder and haven't seen or smelled a skunk in the 10 days since I put down the whole 2 pounds of granules. I will do this once a month even though it's expensive, because it keeps my dog from waking me at 4 in the morning and getting sprayed.

review/summary: May work for squirrels, but absolutely not chipmunks!
review/text: Maybe Havahart wised up & stops listing chipmunks as one of the targeted rodents, but the 2-lb bottle I got from my local Home Depot still lists chipmunks (text & photo) as a targeted rodent and I was duped into getting this.  I used it according to directions & there was no rain/wind for a good 2 days after application. I haven't seen a squirrel since but my chipmunks are ATTRACTED, not repelled by it. So this product (or its earlier ver. still sold by Home Depot) is useless towards chipmunks. It may work well for squirrels from what I observe. I returned my bottle to H.D. today albeit I used 95% of it already.

review/text: Oh man, this stuff is so good! One of the lesser known secrets of life is that<br />anchovies make everything taste better, its true. Caesar Salads haven't been the<br />same since finicky eaters demanded removal of anchovies from the dressing, but<br />its easy to make your own with this wonderful paste.<br /><br />Still not convinced...do you like Chinese food, Thai, Vietnamese? Well Fish Sauce<br />is entirely made of anchovies, and its present in many of their cornerstone dishes,<br />and is a main ingredient in dishes you woulndt even expect like Green Papaya Salad.<br /><br />OK, why am I so obsessed with anchovies? Because they have what foodies call "Unami,"<br />an almost indescribable fifth taste that takes your eating experience beyond salty,<br />sweet, sour and bitter. Umami can best be characterized as a "savory" taste, but a<br />savory so satisfying that it lingers on your taste buds like the final chords of your<br />favorite song. This magic umami also can be found naturally in foods such as Parmesan<br />cheese, truffles, meats, mushrooms and certain fish.<br /><br />I'm guessing anchovies get such a bad rap because of the low quality extra salty versions<br />used by pizza joints and because of those oily tins you buy in the store with a 20 year<br />shelf life. LOL<br /><br />You have products on your shelf with anchovies, mainly Lea & Perrin Worcestershire. Also<br />my favorite BBQ sauce, John Boy & Billy's, was my favorite for years before I looked at<br />the ingredients...yep, anchovies. haha<br /><br />Many great uses for this paste, and my absolute favorite is in BBQ Shrimp with lobster<br />stock, garlic, and lots of butter. Cant be beaten. Give this stuff a try, it really is<br />true that they make everything taste better, even homemade pizza.

The flavor is so rich and if you like Orange like I do, then you'll love this tea.  It also comes in many other flavors that are probably very good also.  This tea is not found in any grocery store near me (ex: Giant, King's/Weiss, Wegman's, Pathmark).<br />This is the cheapest I've been able to get it.  I previously ordered it from Superiorcoffeeshop.com and from coffeewholesale.com at a higher cost (about 17 cents and 19 cents a bag respectively).<br />I'm glad I can get it on Amazon.com even cheaper (14 cents a bag with no shipping if over $25).

There was no hassle dealing with them, they cancelled my order promptly and when my financial situation improves, I will buy from these folks.<br /><br />Not all sellers are honest.............these folks appear to be.<br /><br />And my girlfriend gave me an ounce of their Vanilla Extract and it is excellent!

review/summary: cat loves this
review/text: My cat will lick the bowl clean in one sitting. She only does that with this and the chicken & lamb flavor (I think that's what its called). I recommend however going to your local pet supply store & picking up several different flavors. You can get it by the can for around .60 cents, that way you can figure out what they like. Your cat will get a finky palete tho, so I recommend mixing half a can in with cheaper cat food, if that is what you plan on feeding your cat. After a while of the good stuff they refuse to go back to "grocery store" brands.

review/summary: My (Picky) Cat Devours This
review/text: A quick review because I have not tasted this myself. But I CAN tell you that my cat who is now 16 1/2 and very picky DEVOURS this flavor. When she eats it she has great energy, her coat is nicer. I server her and her 9 month old boy cat companion (who eats almost anything) a variety of dry and wet food. But she will finish this down to the very last piece and wipe the bowl clean. I don't give it to her every night but give it to her often. When her 14 1/2 year old companion boy cat died last year she lost a lot of weight due to grief. I kept putting this out and a few other nutro brands and she gained her weight back. This has been the single most reliable flavor (and brand) of catfood on the fussy eater. And I have half jokingly said she has lived as long as she had due to Seafood & Tomato Bisque.

review/text: Being overseas for the last 3 years for the military you miss little things like deer jerky.  I was born in California and lived in Ohio where I was able to partake of things like deer jerky, sausage, steaks and what not.  A lean and tender meat when cooked properly, this jerky was just great.  I shared it with my buddies in my office and they just loved it also.  Great combination of spices and meat this meat was just great.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a hankering for some Bambi.

However, in my humble oppinion they could have just a little more boldness to them - they just do not have much of a punch and I am not one that likes harsh seasoning.  Both of my kids agree - they are ok but could have some more to them.  Well, I will buy them again - but I can always wish.

I like that they are 100% venison too, no nasty fillers in these sticks. They are also good for my efforts in trying to eat healthy snacks. Each stick is only 90 calories and big enough to satisfy. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a satisfying healthy snack that tastes good.

I don't know how to describe the taste, but there is something very sweet about it.  Tangy, sweet, sour....whatever it is, it's not just venison.  It's almost like they barbecued the jerky.  Again, whatever it is, I won't be ordering it again.

review/summary: Just ok
review/text: My little one (started her with these when she was around 7 months old) kinda liked these. If she was super hungry, she would snarf it down, no problem. If she had somethine to eat before? Not so easy to try and feed her these. Problems: 1) the consistency was just.... off. Runny but congealed, greasy- it seemed like there were a lot of celery-strands type material in it. The smell was strong, but not bad- very much like holiday stuffing/dressing. 2) the package was a chore to open. Super convenient to carry around (it is practically flat!) but ripping it open? It was nearly impossible to do it without flicking food everywhere.<br /><br />I must confess that I did order two boxes of this- but it was the convenience that sold me!

review/text: The price was low, so it was an acceptable risk to try it out.  I like Jalepeno, Cheese, and Popcorn.  I like many kinds of flavored popcorn.  I like Yaya's other cheese popcorn.  This Jalapeno Cheddar popcorn arrived a few days past the expiration date.  Bummer!  Okay, so maybe it will be stale, but who cares I'll eat it.  I put a small handful of this popcorn in my mouth and it tasted terrible!  I kept chewing, I had to give it a chance.  Swallowed a little.  Put a little more in my mouth and couldn't stand it any longer.  Get it out of my mouth!  Spit everything out!  It is the worst popcorn I ever tried.  The after taste kept coming back hours later and grossing me out.  My friend tried some too and said it was horrible.  The whole case went into the trash.  I was afraid to feed it to animals.

review/text: Yaya's White Cheddar Jalapeno popcorn is very good. I have been eating it for some time and have never come across a stale bag. It is air opoed then misted with oil to hold the flavor powder. That light misting of oil means the popcorn is not totally crisp in the way a dry kernel might. It is good quality corn and makes a great snack. This White Cheddar Jalapeno is great. The chili flavor is light and there is no heat to speak of.
