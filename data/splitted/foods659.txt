review/text: I had bought a Black and Decker one-cup coffee maker that used these pods.  It didn't work properly, but I have managed to use the pods with my old, stand-by coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience.  Someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging.  I have not encountered that problem.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.

review/summary: just ok
review/text: Some issues with the product -- some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out (either before use or after use into your coffee); it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed -- would rather they be packaged like the Senseo pods; the pods don't really fit my Senseo coffee maker -- too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when I brew a cup.  On the plus side -- price.

review/text: My mom has the Hamilton Beach single cup coffee maker and was using Senseo pods in it. They were too strong / bitter for her and I was searching for something else.  Found these and Wolfgang Puck's and decided to get both for her.  These Melitta Breakfast Blend pods are her favorite! She says they have a smooth taste and great flavor. Granted, neither of us would ever be mistaken for a coffee judge by anyone (I don't even drink coffee so my opinion means nothing), but she really likes these and is happy to have them.

review/text: This coffee .<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0508Y">Melitta One:One Java Pods,Breakfast Blend Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)</a> is terrible. Cheap beans, bad roast, whatever, my lot actually tastes like it is moldy. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I have tried the Buzzworthy dark roast Melitta Pods and they are drinkable, even though I prefer medium roast coffees. Suggest you try one box of these, not the 4 box lot I'm stuck with. Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees. I don't like Folgers, Maxwell House, pedestrian type blends, but even those are way better than this coffee.

review/text: I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee.

review/summary: Miraculous!
review/text: I just had to let you know what a miracle this food has been for me and my dogs!  I have four Chihuahuas of my own and a fifth as a foster, and I spent a long time researching foods to make a switch after P&G took over Natura (we were on Innova).  My female can be picky and does horribly with food pieces that are too big, so I was thrilled when I saw the thin triangles in the bag.  She happily crunches right through them, which is great, since she and one of my boys have horrible teeth and having to chew the food helps.<br /><br />My alpha male has been on Hills C/D almost all his life because he was diagnosed with struvite crystals as a young dog (he is almost 11 now).  He was the only one of my pack who looked old.  Dull coat, dandruff, and a gaunt look to his face and body.  I knew it had to be the food, so looked at all the levels and decided on the Whitefish formula as a food trial, hoping he wouldn't develop crystals again on a hollistic food.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  He looks fantastic, he and the female (same age) are more active, and I'm happy to report that after 2.5 months, his urinalysis was clean!<br /><br />Our third dog and our foster dog both have very course hair, and since starting this food, they have both become much softer.  Everyone is shiny and (before the weather got so dry) dandruff-free!  Best of all, each and every one of the dogs is absolutely CRAZY about the taste of the food, and even my girl who we used to have to push to finish her dinner now eats with everyone else in under two minutes and then licks the crumbs up off her eating blanket.  It's truly miraculous.  I couldn't be any happier with this food.  It may cost more than the lower quality foods, but if you added all the supplements it would take to get this level of nutrition, you'd be spending more anyway.  Love it, love it, LOVE IT!

review/text: If you've never tried Kona coffee, Aloha Island is definitely the one to start with.  <p>Kona coffee is grown in the Kona district of the Big Island and regarded by some to be the best coffee in the world.  I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but you can taste the difference with Kona coffee - it's full and rich and almost mocha-ish.  I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare.

Opening the bag and taking a whiff right away is a must if you want to try this.<br /><br />But I'm the type of coffee drinker who loves it black, so I need a coffee with a rich flavour on its own. I don't wanter bitterness, but I love coffee with kick to it.<br /><br />I'd call it too mild but that's kind of oversimplifying it. It's worth a try to make up your own mind though.

review/summary: Inferior Coffee
review/text: Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again.

review/summary: Wonderful tea!!
review/text: We drink a lot of tea in our house.  It is the drink of choice for lunch and dinner with both myself and my husband and our oldest son.  This blackberry jasmine tea is wonderful.  It tastes very much like the Jasmine blackberry tea we get at PF Chang's restaurant.  I don't know if it is the same but it tastes very simliar.  I add just a touch of sugar which seems to bring out the flavors so much.  If you are a tea drinker who appreciates flavors other than the typical, this is a wonderful product.  Also, the service was fast and accurate.  We will definitely be purchasing this again when we run out.

review/text: China Mist just makes REALLY good teas anyways, my first introduction to the brand was the Passion Fruit flavor, which is to die for, but this Blackberry Jasmine is really awesome too! Sooo refreshing even from the fridge a couple days later. The blackberry flavor and smell is amazing but not overpowering the green tea. Only wish the Jasmine flavor would come through a little more clearly, but all in all, very well done!

review/summary: Favorite tea!
review/text: A friend of mine got me started drinking unsweetened green tea at Starbucks, and I fell in love with it.  It was delicious.  Because I enjoyed it so much, I ordered green tea when some coworkers took me to lunch at Kona in Baltimore Inner Harbor.  It was SO good, it blew the Starbucks stuff out of the water.  We eat at Kona a lot, and I always drink so much of the tea that I feel like I'm sloshing when I leave.  It's so rare that I find a drink that I enjoy sipping ... not just guzzling it down because I'm thirsty.<br /><br />Today, I finally asked the server which brand they serve, though I didn't have hopes of finding it in consumer size containers (I assumed they'd be buying from direct-to-restaurant suppliers).  I am SO thrilled to find that it's accessible.  And cheaply at that!  I'm about to order several of these to keep myself pleasantly stocked in the house.  this stuff is delightful.

review/summary: It's OK, but...
review/text: I bought a special deal that combined 2 or 3 flavors of the Lean Body  On the Go! but the Banana flavor was too fake so I mixed the Strawberry and Banana and it was better.<br /><br />The bad thing is that when I went to recycle the bottles, I looked on the bottom and the little recycling triangle says "other" which I proceeded to look up and it's NOT good for drinks or food packaging because of the information I found, as follows:  "'Not safe for foods/beverages: this is the plastic with BPA risk. BPAs are hormone disruptors linked to everything from reproductive issues, immune disorders, obesity, and cancer - even at low doses.<br /><br />BPA leaches from #7 plastic, especially if heated or if exposed to acidic substances (hello coffee cup/baby bottle/orange juice container?)"<br /><br />So, from now on, I will buy the Lean Body in the square wax/paper containers.  Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Ice Cream are fab.

review/summary: Cure for the Low-Carb Blues!
review/text: After being on a low-carb diet for the past few months, I was desperate for something sweet.  These almonds were like HEAVEN!  They were just what the doctor ordered and just a handful satisfied my craving for sweets.  I now eat a few after dinner every night and don't feel like I'm missing anything.  They are sweetened with Sucralose so they fit into the low-carb diet.  I liked them so well that I'm going to try the chocolate ones.  I'm also going to crush some up and put it in my "lite" vanilla yogurt for a granola like breakfast.  I highly recommend them!

review/text: Almost all low carb breads I've eaten taste like cardboard. Not this one! It has a coarse, nutty texture that is great. It soaks up egg for a great french toast and just toasted, it comes out crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside. The other breads from Health Express that I've bought were the Flax-yummy! And the sesame seed and the oat of which makes the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had!!

review/summary: So Yummy!
review/text: This is delicious! If you cook the sauce down for about 6 minutes with the pasta (I use penne normally) and add some shredded cheese on top (I like mozzarella more than parmesan for this dish) you have a real treat. I used to add robust to it by browning a half pound of ground beef and making a meat sauce but I have found that sometimes it's nice to let a flavor sit on its own and not add much. With a dash of olive oil, a pinch of extra oregano and pop it in the oven for about 10 minutes you have a meal that rivals some restaurants in my area.<br /><br />I am not sure about the price here on amazon. When I go to Walmart I can score a jar of this for $1.68. So 12 jars would be $20.68. For this reason I recommend you hit up your local Walmart. It may be higher if you go to other grocery stores but Walmart is cheap. Other than the price I totally recommend!

review/text: I'd label this as flavored water, but bottled water has more flavor. I noticed when I poured it into a sauce pan for heating it up, almost half, maybe more, was just water. Upon actually eating it, I couldn't help but notice what little bit of flavor there was tasted like regular olive oil (as opposed to the "Extra Virgin olive oil listed in the ingredients). I'd like to think it was a bad batch, but even then you'd think quality control was better than that. Either way, I'd recommend buying a single container locally and trying that before buying a bulk quantity.

review/summary: Definitely different! - 3.5 stars
review/text: I picked up a bottle of this unique soda at JIM'S APPLE FARM - an awesome seasonal store located in southern MN.  Seeing as today is "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008M7HGAA">Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>," and the bottle's artwork has a nice skull and crossbones motif, it only seemed fitting to share this crazy beverage with co-workers.  I pried open the bottle and took a sniff, wherein I noticed a slightly herbal scent; considering the long list of herbal ingredients on the label, this wasn't particularly suprising.  I then poured the nearly blood red elixir into a cup and took an initial swallow.  I was rather suprised by the initial bitterness of the soda; it definitely wasn't what I was expecting!  Continuing with a couple more swallows, I then started to notice a slight burning sensation in my esophagus -- this, no doubt, came from the jalape&ntilde;o oil that was infused into the beverage.  I wasn't sure if I liked this soda at first.  However, the more that I drank it, the more that I came to enjoy this bizarre concoction.  It also seemed to cure my morning craving for caffeine, so that was pretty cool too.  My co-workers weren't so thrilled with this beverage, but I thought that it was pretty good. At the very least, it makes for good discussion as a novelty item.

review/summary: Candy is old
review/text: I can not find these Cella Milk Chocolate Covered Cherries in local retail stores.  So I ordered these online.  I was surprised to receive them so quickly.  I had them 2 days after I ordered and I ordered on a Sunday.  However, once I opened them and ate a few I am disappointed.  The liquid center in these candies is gone and the cherries inside are all dried up.  Somehow the liquid filling either evaporated are just dried up as there is no sticky evidence of leaking in the box.  Also, the milk chocolate has a chalky look as if it has oxidized.  We can still eat them as they are okay, but they are not as advertized on the outside of the box as containing a clear liquid center.  I think it's obvious that these Chocolates are just very old and probably have exceeded their optimum shelf life.  I will not order from this reseller again.

There is no indication any of them were damaged and leaked that might have caused the stickiness. There are three levels separated by a sheet of cardboard but no stickiness on the cardboard. Because of all that they were sticky before they were put into the box.<br />Never again.

It is large and you do need to figure out a home set up, it's easy enough to use and washable/reusable.  Our syrup was the best it's ever been this year!  Filtering throughout the process is key and for $14, it's well worth the investment.  We set it over a coffee pot with spout, work in small batches so the syrup doesn't cool and you have a spout to fill jars.  You could use a cone colander/sieve/strainer as well, probably could pick up in an antique store cheap.

review/summary: Nice Filter
review/text: This past season was my first sugaring experience.  I was happy with this filter, it took out a lot of sediment and crystals for a pretty nice syrup. I would wet the filter with warm water before running the warm syrup through it and it worked effectively. This is tall and skinny and I didn't have anything to really hold it up, so actually filtering took a bit of coordination.  I somewhat wish I had a shorter fatter filter, but haven't seen any out there. I cleaned it quickly each time I used it, but by the end of the season with the darker syrup it did get some staining. I will consider getting the filter liners for next season and maybe something that will hold it in place for me (if that exists).

review/summary: Homesteading your own, a must have.
review/text: I ordered this filter after using cheese cloth and other methods of making my syrup clear and free of debris. I didn't want to spend any money on a product that won't help me be self sufficient. So I bought it, and I was amazed by it with my first small 2 quart batch. So I washed it in the washer, bad idea, it held onto some soap and my next batch tasted soapy. So I suggest always wash this by hand, and don't use soap every time. Be sure to clean it out very good as it will hold old debris if not cleaned well. It does hold onto a cup or more of syrup, I dip it back into the next batch of syrup gently to transfer some of the old syrup sugar back into the new batch. DO NOT REVERSE it or turn it inside out to do this. Gently dip it in... Glad I made this purchase, it has helped me make a great end product. Modern Pioneer

review/text: I bought these in bulk hoping to be able to enjoy for a while. However, they are so good I went right through the box. Laffy Taffy is always hard to pass up on when I see in the store (espically Banana being my favorite flavor). Again being prime shipping, makes this an easy buy.

review/summary: The flavor is very similar to other Frontera sauces
review/text: I have tried several of Frontera's sauces. I've liked them all and that may be because they each have overlapping flavor profiles. This particular sauce has similar essences to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFVCM">Frontera Pouch, Enchilada Skillet Red Chile, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>.  Even the green sauces have similar profiles.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IH9M2">Frontera Pouch, Taco Garlic Steak Skillet, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> overlaps a little with this. While the product's packaging makes suggestions for use for a particular protein, I feel that many of the manufacturer's other sauces could be used in a pinch. They seem to favor chipotle pepper and garlic. This sauce doesn't have much heat and it isn't too heavy on the chipotle.  It is good sauteed with vegetables for fajitas.  I liked to pair the marinated, cooked vegetables with avocado slices. Again, this is a fine sauce, but once you have tried some of the other Frontera sauces, the flavor profile becomes familiar.  This particular sauce didn't have much honey flavoring at all.<br /><br />Ingredients: Tomato puree (water, tomato paste), chipotle pepper, tomato, honey, distilled white vinegar, canola and vegetable oil, salt, roasted garlic, xanthan gum, paprika, spices.<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Tbsp<br />Servings Per Container: 11<br />Calories Total 15<br />Total Fat  1 g<br />Sodium  290 mg<br />Total Carbohydrates 2 g<br />Dietary fiber  &lt;1 g<br />Sugars  2 g<br />Protein 0 g

I love that they are fun and different but sugar free - it can be hard to be a kid and can't have all the fun candy like your friends. My other (not diabetic) son loves them as well - I don't buy soda, so they are like a special treat.<br />Make sure you use the 6 oz. water as directed, the first time we made a drink we were so disappointed with how watered down it was - ooops! we used about 3x the amount of water.

review/text: I drank Bailey's Irish Creme for years and thoroughly enjoyed it. I saw this brand at my local liquor store and asked another person picking up a bottle of this brand what they thought of the two in comparison. They liked Carolans better. I bought a bottle to try and I find it smoother and cheaper than Bailey's. It has the same rich flavor. I have tried competitive brands of other liquors before and been disappointed that they tasted "watered down" or were harsh and went back to the standard. I won't on this one.

review/summary: A Weak, Sweet and  Heavy on the Vinegar hot sauce. Far below average. You can do MUCH better!
review/text: A diluted hot sauce derived from the jalape&ntilde;o pepper. A 5 oz bottle is far too small given its diluted nature. You might use close to a bottle for a single family sized meal.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed, in this order, from the product label): Water, acetic acid, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, carrots, sugar, ...etc<br /><br />Tasting notes - diluted heat along with a heavy vinegar taste and, at best, a vague jalape&ntilde;o flavor.  The vinegar flavor dominates (acetic acid is a component of vinegar).<br /><br />As noted in the title of my review - a below average hot sauce. I'd pass on this one. The vinegar taste is over powering. Note that the second ingredient (after water) is acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar)!<br /><br />I'd recommend the El Yucateco Hot Jalape&ntilde;o Hot sauce which uses the same Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but it has a much purer and fresher taste. I love the Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but this sauce does not feature its fine qualities very well.<br /><br />PS - As should be evident -- I enjoy taste testing hot sauces and writing up my results. I've tried about 50 different ones to date. I try very hard to describe flavor notes and list the actual ingredients.

review/summary: This is a wonderful wing sauce
review/text: I saw a bottle of this at my local grocer. I love jalapenos and seeing a red jalapeno sauce made it a must buy.<br /><br />The sauce was not what I expected, I was expecting a thin vinegary kind of Mexican hot sauce. This sauce is much thicker than that, but not as thick as ketchup. It is a bit tangy with a balance of sweet and heat. The label says "Very Hot", but it will only seem this way to those who are more sensitive to heat than the average spicy food fan.<br /><br />After my first taste the first thing that came to mind was hot wings. They have the perfect tangy/sweet/hot sort of flavor profile, along with a consistency that lends itself very well to sticking to wings (both cooked and raw). It is also thick enough to be brushed on wings while they are being cooked on a grill. I began to wonder if the brand name was called "Bufalo" because it was intended to be used for wings, but after some research I found out that the company name precedes Buffalo Wings by quite a long time, the name is pure coincidence.<br /><br />As a wing sauce this stuff is a welcome addition. It is a very slight change from your standard hot wing flavor, being made with Jalapenos, while still very true to the flavor you expect from hot wings. As a hot sauce on its own it is good but each time I try it on something else I keep coming back to how much this tastes like a wing sauce.<br /><br />I recommend giving this stuff a try to see what you think. Definitely try it on your next set of wings. My next bottle will be the larger sized bottle because I plan to make some more wings with this stuff.

I read the other review for this product and chose to ignore their negative review because I have never found a sugar-free product that tastes exactly like the product it is to replace. The Honeytree Honey has the consistency of honey, the sweetness of honey, and a very plesent taste. No, it doesn't taste exactly like honey, but it is a very acceptable alternative. Thanks Honeytree, I am about to place my second order for this product.

review/summary: Strong on flavor AND gas
review/text: I have used this product for years. It has lots of flavor and resembles and feels like real honey. The down-side of this product is the gas "problem" when you eat excess (???) amounts of it. I use it in place of Karo syrup to make almond-crusted pecan pies. It produces an "okay" pie. However, I eat large slices of this pecan pie and that causes the gas "problem". I bought bottles of Nature's Hollow and Natrazyle Kosher substitutes for side-by-side comparison with Honey Tree. Although neither caused a gas "problem", I believe both are lacking in flavor and the Natrazyle appeared to have a slimy "mouth-feel". I will try each of these in a pecan pie and if I believe either of the pies is better than the Honey Tree pie, I will report back.

review/text: Having been diagnosed diabetic I really miss all the heavy duty sweets to which I was accustomed.  My father and my husband were both beekeepers so I know what real honey should taste like.  This product definitely does not live up to anything resembling that taste.  True, it is sweet, and I must admit serves a purpose of sorts, but as for tasting anything like honey - no, it definitely does NOT.  I once made a 9x12 pan of baklava and ate all of it (except one small piece eaten by my husband) in 3-4 days - so, I know whereof I speak.

review/summary: Best Matcha in this price range!
review/text: This is a good matcha for the price. The best matcha can be much more expensive but well worth it, espcially if you happen to study the Japanese tea ceremony or you are a tea connoseur. If you do get this type of tea, it is wise to buy a proper bamboo wisk and sift it first, otherwise it can get lumpy. Making matcha the traditional way is well worth the effort and there is a LOT to learn about it. Some say to master the tea ceremony can take years.<br /><br />As far as the health benefits go, there is a lot of talk about green tea being good for you and I must say, I feel really good now that I am drinking it 1-3 days per week and I have even lost a few pounds. Matcha does have caffine and if I have more than two or three bowls I will definately feel it. It's probably a wise idea to not drink too much matcha before bed! Green and black tea both have caffine for the most part. Different teas have different amounts of caffine. It's a good idea to read labels carefully and do your research if you are sensitive to caffine or must avoid it. The type of caffine in a beverage also has a lot to do with how people respond to it. Caffine also has a different effect on everyone depending on your body. Some people get jittery, others don't and the more caffine you consume the less you will tend to feel the effects of it. I tend to feel jittery with coffee or soda but not with tea.<br /><br />Matcha is also great for smoothies, baking, ice cream and much, much more. Another note; Fresh matcha is a very bright green color, old matcha gets a darker pine-gray color to it and can taste bitter or ashy with a clumpy consistancy. Always note the date on the can. To avoid stale green tea, I reccommend storing it in an airtight bag and keeping it in the fridge. Stale tea isn't noticable when you put it in a smoothie or cake but if you make a hot beverage you will notice a big difference in the quality.<br /><br />Matcha is generally served with sweets and is good paired with fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends to clash with chocolate. Of course mochi (sweet rice cakes) go very well with matcha and are the traditional choice but unless you live near an Asian market, or you're a good cook, they can be hard to come by and have a short shelf life. The frozen Mochi ice cream nuggets are a good option too and sold in a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />I reccommend this tea if you are new to drinking matcha. If you love it, it's the tastiest matcha in it's price range and if you hate it, at least you didn't waste too much cash. If you are taking tea lessons it's a good 'practice' tea and won't break your pocketbook, especially when you find out the price of tea bowls, fukusa, natsume, furo and the other utensils used in a tea ceremony!<br /><br />Regardless if you study Chado or if you are a casual tea drinker, I encourage all tea lovers to try matcha. The methods of making and preparing matcha are over 800 years old and when you taste it, you certainly understand why it's never gone out of style!

review/summary: The REAL skinny on Caffeine in Green Tea
review/text: Two other reviewers have already spoken. The most recent one attempting to undermine what the first reviewer had said. Actually, the first reviewer DOES know what he is talking about. Green tea DOES contain caffeine. This from an expert source:<br /><br />Caffeine<br /><br />Although black tea is thought to have the highest caffeine content of all tea, this is actually untrue. Green tea has more caffeine. However it must be understood that because of other compounds, the caffeine in green tea functions in a special and balancing way. The caffeine in green tea is surrounding by tannic acid compounds, which inhibit it from surging all at once into our bloodstream. In a sense, the caffeine in green tea is time-released into our bloodstream. This time-release effect makes the stimulation gentle and quite pleasant. It also allows us to feel the effects of green tea for an extended period of time, and outlasts the effects experienced by our friends, who are drinking coffee or cola. The effect of green tea makes us free of agitation and nervousness, and its blissful stimulation feels good to the senses.<br /><br />Enough said.........enjoy your tea.............

review/summary: Good Matcha, But There Is Better Out There
review/text: I noticed a difference between the quality of this matcha and a much more expensive variety.  I am currently a matcha neophyte but I noticed that the expensive matcha tasted significantly better, seemed more fresh, and had a better brighter color.  I use one heaping teaspoon per pint of hot water, and unfortunately with the more expensive variety it costs over five dollars per pint of matcha tea when you use this much.  Even so, if you can afford it, seek out the finer grades of matcha straight from Uji Japan.  The Uji region is famous for their fine Gyokuro tea and superior grades of matcha.  If you don't have that kind of money, this matcha could suffice, but try to get the Uji-based premium matchas, especially for special occasions.  This matcha is listed as being from Uji, but it isn't as good as the more expensive varieties from the same area.

review/summary: Inferior quality matcha.
review/text: Ujinotsuyu Matcha Hagoromo is not nearly as good as some of the other brands of matcha I tried. Instead of being a pure green, it had a faint yellow-brownish tinge. It was also quite harsh and bitter-flavored. If you're willing to spend more money but don't want expensive tea ceremony grade matcha, try Do Matcha 2nd Harvest (the red label variety). It has a much lighter and fresher flavor. My local store also carries Maeda-en, which is better than Ujinotsuyu but not as good as Do Matcha.

review/summary: four cups of tea a day!
review/text: This tea is premium.  Don't accept green tea in bags; it is less tasty and probably less healthy.<br /><br />Here are just a few medical conditions in which drinking green tea is reputed to be helpful:<br /><br />* cancer<br />* rheumatoid arthritis<br />* high cholesterol levels<br />* cariovascular disease<br />* infection<br />* impaired immune function<br /> * acne, omg.<br /><br />And drink four cups a day for the ultimate tea benefits!
