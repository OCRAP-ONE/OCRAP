So sad I can't get them in the southern states. I was excited to see I could purchase them on amazon and have them delivered for a reasonable price

This is a longtime family favorite spanning several generations.  It's too easy to eat the whole box.  It's made in Canada and not found in the USA except through the internet.

review/summary: Best Chocolate in the World
review/text: I discovered Marabou chocolate bars about 20 years ago in a litle shop on a big ferry that runs between Denmark and Southern Sweden. I love chocolate but find that the sugar overwhelms the chocolate in most bars. Marabou is the exception. A Swede told me that Swedish law prevented their chocolate manufacturers from putting wax in the bars, which accounts in part for their high quality. IKEA used to carry Marabou but dropped it for what I consider to be a far inferior sugary German chocloate which they sell under the IKEA brand. So, the only reliable source for these bars that I have been able to identify is this web site.<br /><br />The 200g Marabou bar for $8.00 is a fair deal, but I can only find it in dark chocolate. I prefer the 250g milk chocolate bar but it seems to have mysteriously disappeared from the chocolate landscape. A few sites list it but when you try to buy the bar, they are always out of stock and do not know if it will ever be available again.<br /><br />Tip: Try melting a Marabou bar in a double boiler with cream and a little butter. Then pour the sauce over ice cream and cake. Wow!<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you love chocolate you must try Marabou before the year is out.

Even when I mix a small amount of Evolve in with other kibble that he eats, my cat is able to separate the Evolve from the other kibble and leave it in the bowl when most of the other cat food has been eaten. Evolve does come in a nice bag featuring a resealable strip, that many kibble cat food bags lack.

To this day THEY LOVE THIS STUFF.  It's still so adorable how their eyes widen, they automatically sit down and they behave as if it was the second time they ever had it.  I irreverently, perhaps insensitively, say to them, "ok time for your puppy crack cocaine" lol because it's remains their clear favorite treat - and I totally spoil my Frenchies and so they have a smorgasbord of treats avail to them. I've read the ingredients and I've always been comfortable with giving it to them all these years.  So try it.

review/summary: Great low-carb bars!
review/text: These bars are very tasty and not too sweet, which I like.  They are also fairly filling so they could be a good meal substitute if I find myself stuck somewhere and unable to find acceptable food.<br /><br />They are similar to Almond Joy in that they are sweetened coconut covered by chocolate but the similarity ends there.  The ingredient list is short, healthy and organic, and these have no artificial additives.<br />Here's the ingredient list:<br />Coconut, chocolate coating (cocoa mass, cocoa butter, coconut crystals), coconut oil, coconut nectar, vanilla extract, and sunflower lecithin.<br />That's it!  No gluten, no soy, no sugar alcohols nor artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I have Type I diabetes so I am always a good test for low-carb foods and whether they really are low-carb.  While these bars are not no-carb they are legitimately low-carb.  I ate one bar without taking any insulin to cover and found that my blood sugar rose very slowly, over an hour and a half, by about 30 points.  By comparison, a real Almond Joy would likely raise me 300 points within about 15-30 minutes.<br /><br />For those with Type I diabetes this means that minimal insulin coverage would be needed or, even better, this would make a nice, handy snack before exercise.  For people with Type II or people who follow a low-carb diet, these bars make an acceptable snack.  Just be sure you can only eat one!  ;-)

review/text: As a suffering celiac of who knows how long before I was aware of my demise, there were no quick snack bars I could have.  I simply have to avoid all grains, thus I've done really well on the Paleo diet.  This bar not only meets my stringent demand for my needs, it is actually so delicious I have to limit myself to one a day.  I am now going on auto-ship for these.  The almond version is also excellent, though because I get plenty almonds already (I use almond flour recipes), this one bar is perfect for a quick pick-me-up when I don't have time for any other lift.  I can't say enough good things about it.  It's simply the best out there.

review/summary: Does not dry overnight; thick gel hard to apply evenly
review/text: Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make "ladybug spots and antennae," which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug "heads") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.

review/summary: Best chili made, best I ever tasted
review/text: I practically lived at Pink's hot dogs in Los Angeles, we went there at least 2-3 times a week and scarfed down those glorious chili dogs. I was so enamored of these dogs I asked a server behind the counter what the chili was and he told me Hormel No Beans. Been buying it ever since and making my own Pink's at home. I no longer live in CA so when I want a Pink's fix, I have to make them myself and I take a Nathan's Bigger than the Bun dog, steam it, put it in a bun with Gulden's mustard chopped onions and Hormel No Beans Chili and I'm right back at Pink's. It is a heavenly dish. The texture and flavor are beyond description and without it, Pink's would not have nearly the love and popularity they have enjoyed for decades.

review/summary: Decent training treat, as long as your dog isn't super picky!
review/text: Cloud Star's Tricky Trainers are bite-sized, palatable, chewable treats that are approximately 0.5 inches big. They come in three main flavors: cheddar, liver, and salmon. I sampled (well, JP, my dog, sampled) two flavors: cheddar and liver. These treats were perfect sized for putting into a Kong treat dispenser, and were generally palatable (JP finds them much more palatable then dry treats). I found the Tricky Trainers surprisingly more "dry" than most pocket-sized treats, however. In other words, they don't seem to be oily to touch, aren't excessively moist, and have a high anti-squish (i.e., firm) factor. This is beneficial if you're using them as true training treats to reward your dog (i.e., storing them in your pocket). Their con: I found the cheddar smell to be repulsive - it has a really strong smell, so if you're cheese shy, avoid. Cheddar is the 5th ingredient (remember, ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance (from most to least). For the other two flavors, chicken liver and salmon are listed first. The other con: the number of calories per treat isn't listed, so we don't know exactly how "low fat" or "low calorie" they truly are. The final con: if you have a super picky puppy that you are trying to train (and are using these as food motivation rewards), these may not work as well as small pieces of hot dog or pieces of freeze-dried liver treats. When it comes to puppy training, finding a treat that your dog can't resist is imperative to get them to train correctly!<br /><br />These products are listed as wheat and corn free, which is good if your dog has these specific food allergies. That said, if your dog doesn't have these specific allergies, not a big deal. The good news: all ingredients are natural, made in the USA, and the products contain no artificial favors or colors. Overall, a pretty good training treat!

Knorr changed the recipe a few years back to make it a little more heart-friendly (it used to call for a whole stick of butter and 1/4c less milk.  If you want to be really decadent- go ahead!)  For added flavor, I recommend squeezing the juice of 1/4 of a lemon into the sauce right before serving.

review/text: I use to love this Knorr sauce.  In fact, many years ago I worked in a restaurant where we exclusively used the Knorr Hollandaise sauce for Eggs Benedict.  Regular customers would occasionally ask for "the recipe".  If they only knew!<br /><br />A few years ago, my wife and I both noticed that Knorr must have changed something with this packaged sauce.  The flavor is now fairly bland as compared the way this product use to be.  Thinking it was a batch that had been incorrectly mixed, we purchased it a handful of times over the last fews years.  We've come to the conclusion that this is the way it's now being made.  As such, I'm looking for a better packaged Hollandaise mix.  What a shame.

review/summary: The best I've found
review/text: Way back when, I discovered Eggs Bennedict, and fell in love with the dish, so I had to learn how to make it.<br /><br />Besides learning how to poach the eggs properly, the hollandaise sauce was a critical ingredient, and I ended up trying making it from scratch, and using every instant mix I could find.  For my taste, the Knorr product was the best.  A significant difference between the Knorr sauce and others is Knorr doesn't include lemon juice - if you want lemon flavor, add your own.  Personally, I don't add lemon.<br /><br />The easiest way to make this sauce is to put 1/2 stick of butter in a measuring cup and microwave it until it's melted.  Mix in the powder, add 1 cup of milk, and microwave it for about 90 seconds.  Stir it, and microwave it until the sauce starts to boil.  Let it rest for a minute, then microwave it again until it starts to boil.  It's done.<br /><br />The Amazon price for this is less than half the price you'll pay in the grocery store - but you end up buying a lot at once.

review/summary: Easy and Tasty!
review/text: A nice addition and I am glad I bought it. It does not require butter, something I was worried about, for we all know that a lot of butter takes away the health factor on a regular basis. I used olive oil and skim milk and the final results, over vegetables, fish, eggs benedict, etc, did not disappoint. As a matter of fact I did not announce I had purchased Knorr Classic Sauces, Hollandaise Sauce Mix, 0.9-Ounce (Pack of 24) an no one in my tribe knew about it so I kind of acted the part of the humble chef and presented the sauce with veggies and salmon the first time, and it was a hit. I added pepper, light very light salt, some herbs and the veggies came to life. The first time it ended very thick and with dots of unsolved powder but that was totally my fault but they still ate it with no problems and that must be one of the reasons I love my tribe so much. The trick is to follow the instructions and do not deviate from procedure. The second time it came too thin and that did it. The third which I presented with poached eggs, canadian bacon and english muffins was the crown achievement so far, and earned my respect for these convenient packages. I have yet to reveal the true source of this sauce for I am basking in the wrong perceptions of my tribe that I have upped my game, figuring that I am not lying so far for no one has asked me directly about how this sauce came to be. Another time I used it on a wild salmon and after cooking the salmon partially I covered it with this sauce and added a high quality parmesan on top and let it all brown lightly in the oven. For this creation I received a minor ovation or expressions of it and I was quite satisfied once again. I give it 4 Stars but probably 4.5 would also fit the bill. The WannaBee Chef has a secret weapon on his arsenal of delightful products and the audience can not get enough! Bon Apetit, Mon Cheri!

review/text: Ordered these after seeing a taste test on a local news station and these were declared the winner so I just had to try them.  The texture and crunch of these after warmed 20 seconds in the microwave are equivalent to any you've had in a mexican restaurant.  Excellent!  They are very thin and crisp.  It would have achieved a perfect score of 5 stars if they had a little more salt and not so many small broken chips.

The only thing that makes this salad better is toasted garlic bread rounds with PROVEL cheese!!!!!<br />I miss you for your food St. Louis, but not your weather.  Long live the Sonoran Desert!

I'm always looking for something to give me a little bit of an edge or pick-up, especially when I'm getting a game in after work.  Golazo is perfect! I drink it after work and before I play my sport of choice for the day and everyone always asks me why I have so much energy and am always, sliding, diving or jumping for shots or hits that everyone else would just let go.  I love it! AAAANNNNDDD....Golazo ACTUALLY tastes good! I've had all of the flavors, but Mango-Limon is my favorite.  Cheers!

review/summary: The energy drink for people who don't drink energy drinks
review/text: I love coffee in the morning, but in the afternoon I like something cold and thirst-quenching. I basically have thrown away any energy drink I ever purchased because of the taste and/or the sketchy ingredients.<br /><br />Enter Golazo. The first time I tried it at a Sounders Game I was skeptical until I cracked open the can. It was delicious-- not like any other energy drink I have ever tasted. Clean, refreshing mango lime flavor, no funky aftertaste, and most important: not too sweet.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredient panel, they use all natural ingredients, real cane sugar, and stevia to help off-set the amount of sugar the put in. At 21 grams sugar per can this amount is very reasonable to me (about half of similar drinks and way less than a soda). Basically they have created the energy drink for people that don't like energy drinks.

I believe since Golazo is All Natural that it just doesn't get old. The Mango Lime flavor was my favorite but I am hooked on the Sugar Free one too! Its only 10 calories so I never feel guilty about drinking maybe one or two a day!

review/text: I have always been a conscious consumer, especially when it comes to drinking energy drink beverages. I've tried the top three brands before (Bull-Monster-Rockstar) and frankly they all taste like medicine and give me the jitters after I've come down from my sugar-high. Nothing comes close to the goodness that is in a Golazo bottle! These guys found the perfect mix of all natural taste and refreshing flavor. The best part for me is that it doesn't  give me the jittery crash that the other top brands do. I'm a huge fan of their quality product.  They truly live up to their name: Golazo!!

Golazo is not like other sports or energy drinks that taste like chemicals and leave that weird residue on your tongue.  There's nothing worse then leaving the pitch and then drinking something way to sweet to quench your thirst.  Golazo hits the spot every time!

review/text: I used to subscribe to, and feed my two babies Fancy Feast -- and they loved it, however I realized recently that they weren't eating the food I had put out for them. After I saw the Iams commercials (which I think are great) I decided to try the Iams canned cat food.  I was surprised at the Lamb option, and I quickly tried it.  My girls LOVE it!  They just gobble it up every time I put it out for them. (I alternate among several kinds -- turkey, chicken, ocean fish, etc. -- ones that my girls like.)<br /><br />Being able to have the food delivered directly to my door is wonderful.  I just wish that the Lamb could be a subscribed item (along with the ocean fish one). That would just be icing on the proverbial "fish cake".

review/summary: Wonderful But Not Quick
review/text: Doong Ji Noodles in Chilled Broth are very tasty, especially if supplemented with some protein ( leftover meat or eggs ) and vegetables - sliced radishes, cabbage, onion, etc an absolute treat. However unlike many other oriental noodle products this is NOT something simple and quick with little mess to prepare. Firstly as others have mentioned the flimsy bowl that accompanies the soup is all but useless - get rid of it. You must strain & rinse the cooked noodles for quite sometime unless you want a gelatinous mess. So after straining and rinsing the noodles, using your own bowl and prepping your protein and vegetables you find that you have a bit of a mess and a good deal of time has passed. But it's worth it.

review/text: I love Korean Cold Noodles.  I always have a least a few pouches of it in my freezer.  When I saw the instant version on Amazon I just wanted to try it.  It would be great to save freezer space if this worked out well.  Also, I was hoping I could take this to work and have cold noodles for lunch.  I followed the directions to the T.  The noodles were tough and stuck together.  I tried to use more water and heated it up longer the second time, and  that didn't help.  I wish they can improve the texture of the noodles so that it's more tender and doesn't stick together so much like mochi.  Anyways, now I have a whole case of this stuff, and don't know what to do with it.

review/text: I bought one package locally for the Price of $1.99!<br /><br />Included in the package:<br /><br />1. Buckwheat Noodle Nest<br />2. Seasoning Flakes<br />3. Broth Concentrate<br />4. Mustard Sauce<br /><br />Microwave directions:<br /><br />1. Put noodles and seasoning flakes in microwavable bowl with 3 cups of water for 6 minutes.<br /><br />2. In a strainer, thoroughly rinse the cooked noodles under cold water and drain.<br /><br />3. Place the noodles in a bowl and pour the prepared broth over it.<br /><br />4. Add the mustard sauce and enjoy.<br /><br />Note this dish has NO MSG (unlike MOST noodle dishes) and NO shrimp and NO pork(unlike some noodle dishes).<br /><br />It is the best tasting instant noodle dish I have ever found. I like the cold noodles and found the overall taste complex yet enjoyable in it's simplicity.<br /><br />I greatly look forward to trying the "chili sauce" version.<br /><br />This noodle dish does meet some basic things I always look for:<br /><br />1. NO MSG<br />2. NO Shrimp<br />3. NO Pork<br /><br />Also, this noodle dish far exceeds my expectations of an instant noodle type pre-packaged food product. Once prepared properly it is amazing and does not taste like it came from an inexpensive pre-packaged product.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />1. Yummy! The most Delicious Instant Noodle dish I have ever found!<br />2. Quick and Easy to make - Microwavable!<br />3. NO MSG! NO SHRIMP! NO PORK!<br />4. Very Inexpensive!<br />5. Noodles do NOT stick together (if made properly - RTFM!) ;-)<br /><br />Seeing as how everybody has different taste, I highly suggest you try buying one package first to try it first before buying a package of 20 but this is a "No Brainer" and I trust most people have more then a basic average intelligence to know this without being said.

I like wasabi with sushi, but I don't like the flavor in soup as much.  The noodles are also very sticky and have a slimy texture which I did not expect.  The bowl the product comes with is very cheap, so this is not something want to make without a bowl (wasn't a deal breaker for me, but just saying).  Overall the flavor and texture was a big surprise for me.  Try before you buy.

review/summary: Tastes bad, bothersome to make
review/text: This is one of the worst instant noodle I have ever tasted. Not only that it's bothersome to make, it tasted so bad I'd rather have those 10/$1 instant ramen.<br />Stick with NeoGuri, Chajang Myun or the classic Shim Ramyun. Stay away from this. I bought I box of 20 and I end up giving 18 of them away to my co-workers. No one liked it.<br /><br />edit:

review/summary: Nice tasty tea!
review/text: This coca leaf tea has a robust flavor, far more so than I anticipated.  Not bitter, just richer and fuller than most teas I have had.  It has a very mild stimulating effect, somewhere in between coffee and regular tea.  However, it is far more soothing than coffee; no jitters or shakiness.  I began having it in the mornings at work, and found it gave me the energy that I rely on coffee for, without feeling wired or sped up.  I can see why coca is so sacred to the Peruvians; there is a definite medicinal quality to it.  Not in flavor, just in how it effects the body.  Overall, I would say that tea drinkers (or coffee addicts looking to get off the Bean) should give this a try.  Tastes great, and does wake you up a bit.  I recommend!

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I have been buying this tea for over 8 months now and I absolutely prefer it over any other beverage in the morning.  I started by making tea with it and now I simply put two teaspoons in my espresso machine and that's it!  The energy from this drink is nothing like caffeine, no sour stomach, no jitters, no anxiety, no racing heart, none of the bad stuff.  To top it off the nutritional value of coca tea is amazing as it contains many vitamins and minerals.  After drinking it for so long I appreciate the flavor and I add nothing to it.  Of course the BEST part of it all is how amazing it is at elevating mood.  All around this is one of the best products I've found this year and I hope Mr Avila is in business for as long as I'm around. :)  TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT!

review/summary: Safety Instructions for coca tea
review/text: High quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />Organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All coca tea Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods. An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store coca tea products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea.

review/summary: Coca Tea Yungas Premium Organic
review/text: Natural, sophisticated and eco-friendly coca tea. Specifically, we have obtained the finest selection of organic coca leaves ( three different varieties of coca leaf ) which are free of pesticides and chemicals and arranged for them to be tested in US laboratories. Thus we have pioneered a top-notch process encompassing all steps in the processing of raw coca leaf to the final tea bag. The coca leaves go through a slow dehydration process similar to that of slow roasting coffee beans to get a humidity free product to prevent bacteria or fungus from developing and then we crush them into large flakes instead of the powdery-like content used for most brands. Our filter paper is bleach free and recognizable by its beige-like color instead of the traditional bright white. We opted for the golden and green Air Tight bag (Double Saran Coated Polyester) and Biodegradable Plastic Jugs to guarantee the absolute freshness of the product and discarded all paper wraps that can interfere with the coca tea flavor or over dry the delicate tea bags. Our Air Tight bags do not "breathe". The technology used is similar to that used to pack electronic components. They have a zip lock system and can be recycled or reused. Presentations: Coca Tea Bags Air-Tight Resealable double Saran Coated Pouches 25ct , 50ct, 100ct, 500 ct Jug Coca Tea Candy Yungas Gold 12ct , 18ct and 50ct. Also Available as Powdered Coca Tea - Coca Flour in 5 0z & 10 oz Air Tight Bag, 6.5 Sealed Tin Can and 1 pound Large Air  Tight Bags

review/summary: The best Hemp protein so far
review/text: I will start by saying that I feel all hemp protein is gritty, and a bit hard to swallow. I was really happy with the Vanilla spice. It has been the best hemp powder I have tried to date. It has a wonderful sweet vanilla flavor, and is finely ground, so it's not as chalky as others. I usually buy Nutiva(which is also good) but to me this is much better. I mix it in a glass of soy or almond milk with breakfast. I would not recommend mixing this product with plain water. I love the benefits of hemp protein. I have already placed an order for my second container!

BTW the label was damaged and not even the same as in the illustration.<br /><br />In common with most organic consumers, I choose organic as a healthy as well as a more ecological option.  So why do so many organic food producers use so much sugar.  It may be organic sugar but it is still sugar and it is not healthy. Please food producers, use something low-glycemic if you need to add a sweetener, there is no excuse now with the availability of Agave flakes, xylitol or even stevia.

review/summary: I really wanted to like it...
review/text: Intellectually, I totally support this hemp mix.<br /><br />Unfortunately my mouth is in total disagreement.<br /><br />Great ingredients, but man is this stuff tough to choke down.  To be fair, I feel like I was spoiled by some of the all-natural whey protein isolates out there in terms of taste, protein content, quick absorption rate, and ease of mixing... but as I started dabbling in vegetarian diets periodically I sought out alternatives to animal products (especially dairy) just to see how my body would react.<br /><br />I heard a lot of good reasons why I should give hemp a try (most notably the complete BCAA profile), but I just can't convince myself to buy this again.<br /><br />The name of the 'flavor' is almost meaningless to me, as it tasted and smelled like sandy fish-food.  I had trouble getting it to mix well by hand or with a batter-powered drink mixer, but even in a blender (where I added some berries/bananas sometimes to mask the hemp mix), it still had a rough sandy texture and awful taste.  To make matters worse, comparing the protein content of whey or even pea protein to this hemp doesn't help.... it's just not as concentrated.  And that fact combined with the small canister size and awful taste/texture kind of killed this for me.<br /><br />I feel bad bashing this stuff because my only reason for not liking it is just personal preference (though that's the same reason I don't eat dog food either).<br /><br />The ingredients themselves seem to be cared-for and thoughtfully combined, but I just can't recommend it unless you're someone that has been using other hemp/soy products in the past and have become acclimated to them.<br /><br />My advice for any omnivores like myself who are vegan-curious is to start with a high quality pea protein (Olympia Labs has a nice one), and go from there.

review/summary: Hemp, huh?
review/text: So, I've been trying my hand at some amatuer bodybuilding. And when you're tying to eat 1g of protein for each pound that you weigh everyday, protein powder is pretty useful. And everybody's all about the whey protein. But I'm lactose intolerant. (I know whey protein isolate usually doesn't have any lactose, but I just want to avoid dairy altogether) I'm trying all the non-dairy protein powders to see which one I think works for me. First off, the Vanilla Spice Hemp powder is pretty tastey. It tastes just like vanilla and spice and innofensive plant material. The texture is a little grainy and chunky as far as protein powders go. And you can put in anything, it would taste fine. But here's the thing, it doesn't have much protein in it. You have to eat 2 scoops just to get 10g of protein. Usually whey powder has about 20g protein per 1 scoop. Also, unlike other proteins it has sugar. There's 7g of sugar in a 2 scoop serving. It also has fiber, which is good, but I can get that from other sources. So, I'd say this powder is pretty good for general nutrition and getting extra calories but not great for putting on lean muscle. And a little expensive to use it for that.

review/summary: Unexpectedly good from a first-timer!
review/text: 1st, 4 Tbs of this hemp protein has 7g of fiber, 10g of protein, all 10 essential amino acids, is rich in omega-3 & 6's, and is soy-free, dairy-free & gluten-free.  Cals are 120, carbs 13g including 7g of sugar, and fat is at 3g.  I have never used hemp before & was very skeptical that I was going to be able to choke this down, esp when I saw the color!  However, I mixed 4 T with 1 C orange juice, 1 large strawberry & 1/2 banana & it was quite delicious!  A real treat for breakfast.  Calorie count on that smoothie came to 270 with 10g of fiber.  I can't taste much of the vanilla spice flavor in my mixture so I think I will buy the original flavor next time since it is less expensive.  You could easily put this in a veggie casserole w/o any one (i.e. my kids) noticing.  The flavor is very mild, & not at all grainy or chalky.

review/summary: Great taste but like drinking sand
review/text: I really want to like this product. It has a great flavor and a wonderful balance of nutrients. It is really hard to get past the texture though. I first tried this with plain water and it was terrible. I had to nearly choke down the entire mixture. I hoped it would be a little better with soy milk or something similar, but no such luck. It just doesn't blend with any liquid well.<br /><br />I have not tried it with a blender yet, and that may do the trick. I anticipate that this will be a lot better in a thicker medium. I will keep looking for another alternative to make this work, because the flavor is actually quite awesome. But in any regular liquid, this is like drinking sand.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've been determined to find a good use for this product, because it does taste good and is so nutritional. I started putting this in my oatmeal and if finally did the trick! The flavor is great and there is no grittiness. In fact I am so enthusiastic about this that I am buying another.<br /><br />I won't use this with a liquid anymore, because is doesn't mix -at all- but does very well in something with a thicker consistency. Love it on oatmeal!

review/text: I've been using this product twice a day for four months and find it very helpful for blood sugar regulation. It gives me almost instant energy and I seldom "run out of fuel" as I used to. I blend it with half a banana in milk and add my daily vitamins and calcium.<br />I think the banana is the key to making a thick, non-gritty smoothie. Also, adding a couple of ice cubes makes it even better. I use one of those little hamilton beach 16oz blenders.<br /><br />May 2011 UPDATE: still using this product every day and think it's great. The only problem I had was losing too much weight - about 10 pounds because it replaces more caloric meals, so that's good if you want to lose weight, but not so great if you have a hard time keeping your weight up.

review/summary: The best I've found so far
review/text: I use a lot of bay leaves in cooking and have tried all the major brands as well as lesser known  organic labeled ones.  I always come back to Spice Island even though the price is a bit daunting.  The flavor is strong and rich.  A little (one or two leaves) goes a long way.  You've only to look at, smell and handle the leaves to see their quality. There is consistency of quality from leaf to leaf in a bottle;  all chunky, bright green, without mottling or brown dry looking spots.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: I have been buying this brand of vanilla for several years at Costco and I love it.  It's very affordable and I've always been happy with the quality.  When baking for profit I tend to lean more towards Nielsen Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, however, this is great to keep on hand in a pinch.  Most people can't tell the difference.

review/summary: Excellent, and Wonderful Aroma.
review/text: We've had this Kirkland Signature 16-ounce bottle of  Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla around the kitchen for several years now. We don't use it very much, but it's just one of those ingredients one has to have around a kitchen. My wife uses it in cookies, cakes, puddings and deserts of various kinds. Good vanilla is expensive and we got this KS Vanilla at our local warehouse store at what we regarded a bargain price. It's been excellent. We've been very satisfied. And it has a wonderful aroma!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Quality vanilla, better price from the warehouse
review/text: I've tried more expensive vanillas, and I've found this brand to be just as good as any others I've tried.  I bought once from Amazon, then realized my local Costco sells this for half the price, around $6 rather than the $12 I paid here.

review/summary: Pure Vanilla Extract
review/text: I'm incredibly pleased with the flavor and quality of this pure vanilla extract oil from Kirland Signature Brand.  The price is great, comparable or better than any pure vanilla extract I can find in local grocery stores.  We used it in cupcakes and banana bread with a little pure almond oil and the flavor was warm and delicious.  We tried some imitation the time before it and we knew we had to make an investment in some quality extract.  It turns out, this is actually more affordable than the imitation brand we were buying!  We plan on always keeping an extra bottle of this in stock before it gets halfway used!
