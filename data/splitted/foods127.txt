review/summary: The best cup of coffee that I've brewed at home.
review/text: I typically prefer espresso when I drink coffee beverages. However, when my in-laws bought me the Keurig I decided to start drinking regular coffee. I enjoy Breakfast Blend because it is a rich, smooth coffee without being too acidic. I can make iced coffee out of it and it doesn't get too watered down or lose it's flavor (assuming I wait about 15 minutes after brewing for the coffee to cool before pouring it over ice).

review/summary: Almost makes my wife happy
review/text: My wife likes her coffee really weak and finding that in a K-cup has been a tough job. I like stronger coffees than the Breakfast Blend but I also enjoy this. It's still too strong for my wife but it's as close as I've been able to find to satisfy her taste (she adds water to every cup no matter which setting it's brewed on). I've been unable to find a "lighter" K-cup so we've been drinking this blend for years now. If anyone knows of a "weaker" K-cup coffee, let me know!

review/text: I bought this for my husband because he wanted a breakfast blend and isn't too fond of the Newmans. He likes the Dunkin Donuts but it's pricey. he said this blend is up to par with the dunkin brand. You only get 12 in the dunkin package and it's over $12. he likes this better than the donut house also.

review/text: I have tried all the k-cups that came with my Keurig at Christmas and by far the best of all for me was the breakfast blend.  Not too strong or weak, JUST RIGHT.  I use the 12oz size for my mug and a little half and half and enjoy!  I was not enjoying the coffees I kept trying so bought some medium roasts at the store but still not satisfied with the taste. By far the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is it for me.

review/text: I love it! I received a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas and have been trying all the different flavors. While I enjoy a flavored coffee, I like my first cup of the day to be just "coffee". I've found the perfect one with Nantcket Blend. It's not too strong, not too weak. And the twin pack is a great value. Haven't found it at the grocery store so I'm very pleased to see it offered at Amazon. While I have a supply of various flavors, Nantucket Blend is my "go to" first thing in the morning. Best way to describe it? Smoooooooth.

review/text: My days of enjoying bold, dark coffee times have long past. Maybe it's age, or maybe it was my time in the navy when midwatch coffee was always black and bitter, and the only thing that changed when the daywatch came around was a freshening of the grounds.<br /><br />This coffee is mild without being weak, and is a nice way to start the day (or finish up a meal and settle with a good book).<br /><br />Good choice for your K-cup pantry.

That helps me save lots of money and works perfectly when I want more than one cup in the morning.  Second cup is lighter, but it still has good flavor.

review/summary: Not What Expected....
review/text: I ordered this coffee under the impression that it was a medium roast,that was according to the brief description & by zooming in the box on my laptop. On the the side of the box it stated medium. When the coffee arrived today it is not medium it is light. No medium on the box at all, just light. I am very disapointed with this purchase as I wanted at least a medium roast flavor. To be able to get a full flavor at all you will need to use a very small amount of water & make a very small cup of coffee. I'm sure I could send it back but the hassle is not worth it, but will not buy again. If you like extremely light coffee this is for you, if you like to taste your coffee this is No good. I will order bold from now on. As far as taste there is none unless you make about a 4 oz. cup even then it's not very good.<br />Amazon did ship very fast,I received the order sooner than expected & it was packaged very well.<br />Too bad the coffee was not what I ordered/ expected.

review/text: Green Mountain Breakfast Blend, is by far my favorite k-cup coffee!!! I was a die-hard Starbucks girl for years, and now that I live in a town without one-I use my Keurig daily. I don't like strong or dark coffees, so this one is nice and mild for me. I also use fat-free, flavored creamers and they taste great with this coffee blend. I also love getting this shipped to me fast on Amazon. The boxes that I found at Walmart, Kohl's, etc... had less kcups in them. I find that ordering them online via Amazon is a great value!

review/summary: Not too weak, not too strong, it's juuuuuust right
review/text: I found these first at my local supermarket.  I've been looking for a blend that I could use as my standard every-day cup of coffee and, finally, this was it.  I've tried so many of the other blends and brands and they were either harsh and bitter (I know, some people think coffee *should* taste that way!) or too bland and weak. This is smooth but with a nice "coffee" presence you can actually taste.  *Coffee* taste, not burned grounds!<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you're *not* into the "make your hair stand on end" type of coffee. This review is based on using the "medium" size on the coffee machine.  You may get different results if you use the small or large dispenser sizes.

(Sorry, dark-roast lovers - I tend to be overly sensitive to bitterness.)

review/text: You can't make a better cup of regular coffee flavored coffee than Green Mountain Nantucket Blend at home. I had been trying in every way imaginable for nearly forty years to accomplish this. However sometimes I feel like something a tad bit lighter for that first cup in the morning. Enter Green Mountain Breakfast Blend. It's exactly what that first cup calls fall. A slightly lighter version of Nantucket Blend, yet it still has the subtle punch you're looking for.

While I myself prefer the Coffee People's Organic, which is darker and more robust - similar to some of the blends found at Starbucks (not their regular blend). The Organic is strong enough for them to re-use once, after I've had the first brew.<br /><br />I also love that we can get the double pack of the Breakfast Blend 24 K-Cups inexpensively from Amazon. We purchase the Coffee People Organic in the 50-K-cup boxes.

review/text: The price of this has been fluctuating forever on amazon. This listing is the same one that different sellers will use. Some are better than others but the reviews stay with the product regardless of who is selling it at the moment. Until it becomes available as a frustration free 50 count box from amazon this is what we will have to deal with. There is another seller that offers free shipping on the 108 count box every once and a while and its free shipping for everyone not only amazon prime members. when you see it available do not hesitate on getting it. It goes fast because of the free shipping. It is still a little high at about 57 cents per cup but 43 is the lowest I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is our favorite everyday coffee. It is what we call "normal" coffee. It's not mild or bold or flavored its just a great medium body cup of joe.<br /><br />When you register your brewer with Keurig. You will be offered some free coffee. I would suggest you get this as your free coffee. You will also be offered free shipping with that order. So buy a lot of the 5 pack samplers and get the most out of the free shipping.

The K cups were not damaged in any way and is at least a little better for the environment given the use of them, by me, is not good for my carbon foot print. So every little bit helps.

review/summary: Way too weak and watery!
review/text: I don't like strong coffee but this is so weak and watery, it's like drinking...something other than coffee. I tried brewing a small size, using a different size cup, adjusting my cream and sugar, nothing works! It's really disappointing because I've had other good blends from Green Mountain in the past. I'll stick with Wolfgang Puck's Rodeo Drive or Breakfast In Bed.

review/text: For anyone liking a weaker coffee,this brand would be fine, but I prefer a stronger coffee so I wouldn't choose this brand again for that reason.

review/summary: Good flavor - a little too weak for me
review/text: Seems like the Keurig systems lend themselves to dark roasts - however, the near burnt flavor element never worked for me. I was excited to try out this light roast (enough for 48 packs of 'trial') - and indeed I loved the flavor if you stick to the small 6 oz cup size. The coffee gets too weak and watery at any of my regular sizes (middle or right-but-one button on the B70) - this is a coffee that could do with an 'extra bold' rating to up the quantity of coffee in the cup.<br />My current alternative for this is Green Mountain's 'Our Blend' - which does seem to have got it right!

review/summary: Beware
review/text: Beware of this vendor.  All other K-Cups are sold 2 packs of 24 for this price.  I ordered several brands in one order assuming that these are the same 2 pack of 24 quantity and was surprised when I only received one box of 24.  Went back and looked at my and sure enough the description did not state 2 boxes as other brands / suppliers.  Beware when ordering and just pick a different vendor.

review/summary: Thin and lacking flavor
review/text: I got the Keurig as a present recently and have been trying all the samples that came with the unit. I like a smooth tasting coffee with lots of flavor, especially for breakfast. Unfortunately, the Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend left me flat.<br />All of the Keurig K-Cups lack the wonderful aroma that makes coffee drinking so enjoyable, but this breakfast blend is even less aromatic than others.<br />Flavors are, of course, a personal preference, and I can see the appeal of this coffee for some. It doesn't bite you, like many coffees, so if you're looking for a mellow flavor in the morning, this may be for you. Otherwise, steer clear of this one.

review/summary: Green Mountain Breakfast Blend
review/text: I did not like this coffee. It is on the light side. It has too much acid or something, I felt almost ill after drinking it.  I shared it with a co-worker and he felt the same way.  I am a big coffee drinker and usually can drink very strong coffee And never have stomach upsets but do with this blend.

review/text: Since I've had my Keurig K-cup coffee brewer I have never had such horrible coffee!  Tastes like cardboard!  I usually get either donut shop k cups or Paul Neuman's Own.  Also Midnight Express, ALL good.  But this Morning Blend junk isn't ANY good at all.  Never again!

review/summary: Poor Labeling makes for a rip-off!
review/text: I have used this before, and like the coffee. But was not aware of the different strengths. Saw a statement about them as I reviewed today (in "product features" it says, "Please note: 'regular', 'bold' and 'extra bold' refer to the amount of coffee in the K-Cup"). There is no way to make any choice during Amazon Prime buying (one click), or any other way i can find. So I am consuming this expensive stuff twice as fast to get the strength I want. Are you listening, Amazon? This proves to me that the arguments some make that buying in the store is better may have merit. if this were not a food item, already opened, I would return.<br /><br />So: WARNING: don't buy unless you are satisfied with any strength (Ironic a product this expensive would not pay more attention).<br /><br />Very, very disappointed!<br /><br />PS, the box labeling did not match the warning anyway, what I got was "Light Roast". The other choice was "Regular". Leads one to wonder if they are clearing off old, outdated product.

review/summary: aftertaste
review/text: I've fgound the cure for drinking too much coffee inthe morning. Get this one. I thought, when I first had this, that I had accidently wiped the sugar spoon with a Mr Clean cloth, but the next day, I had one cup of Tully's and made the second cup, the Green Mountain Breakfast blend. The disinfectant taste was back. I would not buy this one again.

review/summary: Why use a brewer for instant coffee?
review/text: This stuff is NASTY.  I don't even think it's particularly good instant.  Why would anyone spend all that money on a keurig coffee maker in order to make instant coffee at home?  You just need a kettle or a microwave.  And what a waste of space in your kitchen and landfill.  The worst part is that you don't know it's instant until you taste it, look carefully at the package, and see that it's "water soluble"-- code words for instant.  Open one up, and you'll see!
