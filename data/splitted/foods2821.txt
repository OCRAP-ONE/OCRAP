review/summary: Maxwell House French Vanilla T-Disc's
review/text: All in all it's a good product, but had kind of an odd taste and smell at first, I added extra vanilla syrup to it to get more of a vanilla taste and it seemed a little too strong for my liking so I added extra water. If your preference is strong coffee you'll probably like it, but every individual is different with how they like their coffee's strength. Love the ability to make a single cup for just me when I want it without having to make a whole pot. The cup size is larger than a regular coffee cup, more of a mug size.

review/text: I love french vanilla coffee but the one by Tassimo-Nabob taste absolutely horrible! I know it is made with artificial and natural flavors but it taste extremely artificial. No matter what I did to alter the taste (using honey, brown sugar, white sugar, more milk, etc..) I couldn't even attempt to drink it. I have had better tasting instant coffee that was vanilla flavored.

review/summary: THE BEST GUACAMOLE EVER!
review/text: You'll have a hard time convincing anyone that you didn't  make this delicious, can't-stop-eating-it Guacamole all from scratch.  The taste is fresher than fresh.<br /><br />  The mix is lightly flavored with  tomatillo, garlic and cilantro - just enough for a bit of spice but not so hot that you have to follow each  bite with a drink of something.<br /><br />  So easy  to prepare - simply  mash ripe avocado and add  mix.  We  like  to have a bit of the avocado in the Guacamole so we use a ricer for mashing.<br /><br />  We  prepared enough for 12 the other night and four of us made quick work of it.  Highly recommend!

We have tried many different brands over the past two years, and the children choose those from The Bunnery in Jackson Hole as the best, far better than Bear Naked and Kashi, etc.<br />They are the perfect balance of sweet and sour, with the delicate taste of the different grains.  They also stay fresh and crunchy for a good 6 months.<br /><br />I also like the pancake and waffle mix with oats, sunlowers seeds and millet.

So when we saw the sampler we had to try the rest.  The granolas are so tasty that we enjoyed each one...each of us having our favorites.  I, personally, loved the oatmeal with sunflower seeds and would eat it uncooked with milk and honey or organic maple sugar.  I grew up eating oats uncooked like that and found this brand's version absolutely exceptional.  It's pricey but delicious and our new favorite brand...highly recommend!

review/summary: Too sweet!
review/text: I was really excited to try this mix after the great reviews and having had really good hot chocolate in France. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed about how much sugar is in it. The sweetness just overpowers the chocolate and vanilla flavors. In my opinion, the overall flavor is just slightly better than the Carnation instant hot cocoa you can buy at your neighborhood supermarket. If there was less sugar, it would probably be pretty good. This is Americanized hot chocolate, not the type of rich hot cocoa goodness I had in France.

review/text: My office is known for its hot chocolate. Students from elementary through graduate school love it. Part of the credit goes to the base we use - Crescent Ridge Low Fat Chocolate Milk - the best chocolate milk I've ever had - certainly the best one can get in eastern Massachusetts. But what makes it really special is this French powdered chocolate mixed in. There really is no better - I have tried other "gourmet" chocolates - none match up. Very highly recommended.

review/summary: Best powdered drinking chocolate
review/text: I am a hot chocolate nut.<br />I never use the stuff from the supermarket - just awful stuff.  I adamantly disagree with the post comparing this to Carnation or other supermarket brands.  The flavor of the chocolate is much more superior.<br />I typically buy a bar of quality dark chocolate and slowly melt it in milk on the stove top with a whisk.  This stuff though, makes it much easier to enjoy a great cup of hot chocolate.  I sometimes add a tablespoon (or so) of coffee liqueur or other or nothing depending on my mood.  I don't drink it daily, so the amount of sugar does not bother me.  If it does  bother you then simple cut back on how much powder you use and drop in some quality bittersweet chocolate

Kramer is in great health and people are always amazed at how fit and strong he is.  That he still has all his teeth is surely attributable to the Active Care hard kibble diet and the near absolute lack of any signs of arthritis must be one of the benefits of the "healthy joint formula."  Both Kramer and I cannot recommend Active Care highly enough.

I would have hoped that buying in bulk would be cheaper; it appears I am mistaken. Check your local [generic] grocery stores and specialty grocers FIRST. The markup by amazon has managed to exceed that of a large store known to raise the price on "specialty" foods, and they STILL manage to beat this price. So I dropped a star because of the high price. Cost is part of the product experience, after all. Come on, Amazon, please at least make your price competitive!

review/text: I first tried this powder at the Dole plantation in Hawaii. They sprinkled it on pineapple bits and passed out samples. It was amazingly good, and totally changed the taste of the pineapple. Of course, I bought some and took it back home with me, where I passed it around to family members. Although I experimented using it on other fruit, my favorite is still the pineapple. My mother really likes it on oranges. But it's good on apples and other fruit, too. I've bought some every time I've returned to Hawaii, and I've had friends pick some up for me on their trips. I was glad to find out that I can now order it online, because I haven't been able to find it on the mainland. It gets a high rating from me and from my family.

The salty kind is mostly plum and salt. Guess which kind I got? What I got was so salty the salt drowned out all the other flavors and I didn't like it. In there defence I'm sure a Hawaiian citizen would have known all this and not made this mistake. So this may be partly my fault.

review/text: I find the best way to rate hot sauces on heat is to compare them to other sauces. This is just slightly hotter than Dave's Insanity Sauce, but slightly less heat than Mad Dog Inferno. It is way hotter than any tobaso product. If tobaso is the only hot sauce you have eaten, I would suggest eating something more mild than Blair's. Sudden Death will give a good burn to just about anyone but the most serious chili heads. <p>What I like about this sauce the most is the flavor. It is very good. Unlike some of the extract sauces which lack flavor, I found this one to taste very good. And it has the heat kick that many of the better tasting sauces do not have.

review/summary: It's hot, and it's good with the right meal
review/text: The first time I tried this sauce, I thought it was Blair's After Death, but only hotter.  For those not familiar with Blair's After Death, it's basically Blair's Original Death with a small amount of extra for extra heat but does not taste like an extract sauce.  It still maintains the Original Death flavor.<br /><br />However, after using this sauce on more items, I learned it really wasn't a hotter version of After Death.  The ginseng flavor comes through strongly when enough is used.  It's still very good on a burger mixed with ketchup, good mixed with BBQ sauce on chicken or anything that uses soy sauce really, and passable on rice, but if you use enough, the chemically Ginseng flavor can wreck some dishes too.<br /><br />I would recommend this for those who would only use a drop or two at a time.  In that case, this is still a very good sauce.  But for those who use a good amount, I would suggest Blair's After Death or even the hotter Mega Death instead.

I tended to substitute some of the portions called for with actual dried fruits like dates and mangoes. I tend not to love the garish colors & corn syrupy sweetness of this product. But it was fine for my purposes.

review/summary: Hot and fun
review/text: I order this sauce from Amazon because I can't find it locally. It's totally awesome.<br /><br />It's great - adds good heat to whatever you want without adding a significant vinegar or salty flavour. The taste is mild and the prickly pear cactus gives the sauce a slushy consistency, which I happen to like. It seems more homemade with the added texture.

review/summary: Marie Sharp's is the best
review/text: My husband and I first tried Marie Sharp's sauces when we traveled to Belize.  We quickly used up what we bought and brought back with us, so I am happy that we can find it online.  The sauces add kick to dishes (some flavors are VERY HOT-beware!), but I like that you don't get that vinegary taste that you get with so many hot sauces (like Tabasco).

review/summary: Delicious on seemingly everything
review/text: I am an admitted hot sauce/salsa fan and enjoy heat..but it HAS to be flavorful.  I see no reason for hot without the reward of flavor.<br /><br />I purchased my first bottle of this at a flea market where I first tried it on a torilla chip..I was hooked at first bite and this has quickly grown to be my overall favorite for most all of my main dishes..and found a particular liking to this added to a tuna casserole...and it goes with virtually all seafood.<br /><br />It has enough heat to get your attention, but not enough where you have to be timid.<br /><br />I am on my fourth bottle and reorder each time it's down to half full..it is right up there with the most used condiments in my home.

review/text: I bought this stuff after  Tasters Choice hazelnut coffee was taken off the market in the canister.  This stuff is a can mostly of sugar ,three kinds, and coconut oils and a bunch of other unhappy things.  At the end of a long list of ingredients coffee was last, just before natural and artifical flavor.  But to add insult to insult the flavor is neither of hazelnut or coffee.  I'd return it if the postage was not so high.  I tried to contact the company from the phone number on the can and never recieved the promised call back so politely offered.  It would have been helpfull to have had the ingredients posted with the offering.

review/text: I have to agree with the other reviewers.  These walnuts, besides being organic, are fresh, largely whole, and contained no shell chips in any of our first three bags (although I know this happens), suggesting to me that care has gone into the preparation and packaging of this product, beyond the grower's skill in the field.  Why not support an American grower who cares and at the same time do something good for yourself?  We are now regular customers.

review/summary: Wonderful taste, great source & price for organic, shipped as promised BUT :(
review/text: I just found out through talking with a specialist moments ago that walnuts have a high number of bacteria/micro-organisms on them, the highest of all nuts.<br /><br />Your body system might be able to handle them.  Mine can't because of current health conditions.<br /><br />If you are interested, here's how to do a comparison check on the degree of little critter infestation on the surface of different nuts...<br /><br />Put the type of nut you want to test in its own cup and add maybe 6  oz of water.  Add some  cheap hydrogen peroxide purchasable at any large scale grocery store in the USA that is used for cleaner and let sit for a 5 minutes. (I used 2 tablespoons)  Bubbling occurs in the water as the micro-organisms are killed off. (Eating the nuts afterwards is not recommended because this hydrogen peroxide is not food grade so has additives to stabilize the hydrogen peroxide.)<br /><br />The test I'm doing as I type this review is compromised of organic walnuts and almonds, each in their respective cup.  The almond cup had a few sparse clouds of bubbles at the top.  The walnut cup has a 1/4" thick white carpet of bubbly foam at the top.<br /><br />Even cleaning the walnuts with food-grade HP isn't workable for me :(.  The good news is that Good Sense may start selling their organic almonds on Amazon.com.  YAY!  :)

review/summary: What A Disappointment!
review/text: My wife and I each eat one ounce of walnuts daily and have for years.  We love them and appreciate their health benefits.  And for years, we've been buying Diamond brand walnuts from Sam's Club (currently about $12 for a 2 lb package, which use to be about $17.50 for a 3 lb package).  We thought that surely there were better walnuts available, so we ordered the Good Sense Organic Walnuts from Amazon.  Diamond brand has a lot of broken, shriveled and black colored walnuts.  The Good Sense Organic Walnuts are WORSE!  I would rate the Diamond walnuts 3 stars, just good, not great.  The Good Sense Organic Walnuts that we received are barely edible (small broken pieces, shriveled pieces, and dark colored pieces) which is why they've earned two stars.  By reading the reviews, we must be the only unlucky people that have ordered these walnuts.  My advice:  If you want big fresh delicious walnut halves, avoid these!  (Neither of us work for or are associated with Sam's Club or the Diamond nut company)

So I thought I'd try a couple of bags to see how I liked them. The first bag was wonderful - plump, sweet, juicy pieces of ginger. Nicely sweetened with a good, hot ginger hit. The second bag was awful - mushy ginger and some pieces with strange unnatural textures. And the ginger was way too hot in that second bag.<br /><br />Not sure what's going on. But I also tried a couple of bags of the Reed's and liked their ginger much, much better. And the quality was consistent.

review/summary: Delicious. Amazing. Try it now!
review/text: Randomly tried this one day when picking up lunch at Pastoral in Chicago. I love root beer, but had never tried anything outside of the generic, artificial stuff you can buy for a buck (sad, I know...). But, this root beer... this root beer was glorious. In just the first sip, you can taste the cinnamon, vanilla, and ginger. It was actually an interesting experience! I like that it's made with cane sugar instead of HFCS like generic/popular brands. It's not cheap, but DEFINITELY worth a try!!

review/summary: An organically grown coffee of exceptional quality and value
review/text: I have become a bit of a French Roast snob, tasting as many as I can in search of THE one which pleases my palate best.

The fresh flavor has great depth and is rich and smooth. The beans are beautiful ~ dark and glistening! The aroma is heavenly. The beans are low acid and antioxidant rich.

review/summary: Good Coffee But Too Strong For Me
review/text: These are very good quality coffee beans.  They are nice and dark and oily.  Just what you want when you buy beans to grind. The price is also on par with the stale beans they sell at my grocer. They are just a little stronger than I like.  I am going to try a lighter roast from the same company.  If you like a dark, very rich coffee don't be afraid to try these beans.

review/summary: GREAT Grain-Free Cat Food Our Problem Cat Loves!
review/text: We have a beloved cat who was on chemo for lymphoma for 6 months. He wouldn't eat anything and is allergic to grains, so we had to force feed him. We chose a premium food and mixed it with water, and he hated it.<br />After treatment, he was still very fussy, until we discovered the Soulistic brand. Unlike the other review, our cat didn't like the gelee, but goes nuts for the gravy version. It has big chunks of fish/meat, and is packed with nutrition, so who cares if it looks like a substantial meal or not?<br />Especially for a cat that loves gravy and is finicky, Soulistic is the answer. His favorites are Nautical Nirvana and Pure Bliss. He eats at least two 3 ounce cans a day, plus regular tuna and/or organic ground beef for snacks later in the day. Gorgeous coat, perfect weight once again. We're thrilled.

review/summary: Not as good as the Soulistic in Gelee
review/text: Having purchased the Soulistic "Gelee" and BFF (made by the same company) I wanted to try the "Gravy" flavors to add some more variety.  Although the food looks appetizing and all the cats seem to like the food, I was dismayed to see that there seemed to be as much gravy as food in the cans.  I do not want to be paying the same price for cans that contain this much liquid and less food.  I will purchase the Soulistic "Gelee" foods and BFF again, but it isn't likely that I will purchase the "Gravy" flavors.

review/summary: Not what the picture describes
review/text: I bought this steak for my father in law for Christmas because he had always wanted to try Omaha Steaks, and I heard good things about it. I purchased the private reserve because it is a higher quality of meat than the regular cuts and wanted to get him something extra special, but was I in for a surprise. I should have stuck with the cheaper meat.<br /><br />The meat came with extremely large amounts of fat all around. We had cut off a significant amount of fat prior to cooking,and the steak was still fatty once it was cooked. I was very dissapointed and so was he. We were going to call Omaha Steaks to complain, will never buy this brand again. Very unhappy with it. The taste wasn't even something that was worth raving about either. I could have went to the supermarket and bought a prime rib on sale that tasted better than this was, which i have in the past, and didn't spend nearly as much as they charged.

I would recommend this to any dog owner that has a pet with flaky skin or dull dry coat problems.  Works like a charm, still using it, we are on our third bottle.

review/summary: My Secret Weapon in the Battle against Toddler Meltdowns!
review/text: Order teething biscuits from England? Sounds crazy, right? If you're wondering why I  pay almost 69� per cracker, it's simple: no mess!<br /><br />I am not mess-adverse, but it was becoming ridiculous to see how much sticky-chewed-bits of brown mush my daughter could rub into her dresses, stroller, furniture, my clothing, you name it.<br /><br />After a trip abroad, a friend shared a package of these teething biscuits with my then six month old daughter. My daughter loved them and I was hooked!<br /><br />Yes they are yummy and offer organic options (from Heinz no less, go figure,) but they don't make a mess.<br /><br />Let me say this one more time: They don't make a mess!<br /><br />All of my friends use mummums or other domestic brands and their darlings either choke at first or wear telltale brown mushy spots all over their clothes.  My daughter is the only one who is both happily munching and clean. The cracker barely even leaves crumbs. I don't know how the recipe differs, but I am so grateful to have found these!<br /><br />Yes, the shipping is pricey, but so is having to change your child every time they teethe on something. We reserve the biscotti for when we're out to dinner and need to distract her until the food arrives.<br /><br />My daughter is now fifteen months and is teething badly. These biscotti save the day any time she starts to throw a fit.<br /><br />While the ingredients do include sugar, they are much less sweet than the other biscuits out there.<br /><br />I include a package of these in baby shower gift basket I give. They're always a hit. I would feel guilty for getting my friends hooked on such an expensive product, but they're worth their weight in the wipes you save!

Sadly it appears that they diluted what might be a very nice product with massive quantities of alcohol in order to make it look like you are getting much more then you really are.<br />Once the large amount of alcohol liquid evaporates it has a nice Rose smell but does not last long.

review/summary: Smells Nothing Like Rose
review/text: I ordered this along with 5 other Bakto extracts. The others were okay (not great), but the rose was - well, I don't know what it was, but it definitely wasn't rose.  It smelled funny in a bad way.  It wasn't a floral scent at all.  Honestly, I didn't  use it because I didn't want to end up wasting more expensive ingredients test-driving the product. The lime extract smelled like lime and tasted like lime (barely), and the orange smelled orangy and tasted like orange (somewhat), and since this extract smelled unpleasant, I extrapolated that the resulting icing would taste unpleasant as well.  I did some reading on rose oils and rose extract, and rose oil is recommended for flavoring, and rose oil, the truly good stuff, will be expensive.  (All this was for my annual Christmas cookie making fiesta, so I'll pop for and try to rose oil this coming holiday season.)

review/summary: Mild Daily Energy Tonic
review/text: ****<br /><br />This Goji Berry Green Tea from Yogi Tea is a daily energy tonic. It's an all natural tea made from organic green tea leaf, natural and organic flavors, organic green matcha tea leaf, and goji berries (lyceum barbarum). The taste is mild, only very slightly berry-like, tasting mostly of green tea, with a very pleasant aroma; in fact, it's so mild, that I would definitely use two tea bags and brew it for the full six minutes. It does not get bitter. Unless you enjoy very mild tea, you should plan on getting fewer cups of tea from the box. For this reason I gave this tea only four stars.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Goji Berry Green Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Green Tea Goji Berry is an uplifting daily tonic that promotes energy and revitalization with a fragrant blend of Organic Green Tea, Organic Japanese Green Matcha Tea and Goji Berry. For centuries, the peoples of the Far East have treasured Green Tea as a delicious and energizing tonic. A recent study in the American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology (2005) suggests that long-term consumption of Green Tea might provide increased endurance while exercising. Green Tea is also celebrated for its antioxidant properties, which may help promote longevity. This formula also contains Organic Japanese Green Matcha Tea, a powdered form of green tea that provides a burst of energy and delicate flavor. The bright red Goji Berry has been consumed for centuries in the East, and is considered one of the most healing fruits in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This treasured fruit helps convert food into energy, protect the liver from damaging toxins and provides a boost to both the immune and circulation systems. Find yourself on the path to a revitalized life with the invigorating qualities of Green Tea Goji Berry."<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Goji Berry Green Tea contains approximately 52 mg of caffeine per tea bag, which is a bit over half of what is normally found in an 8 oz cup of coffee. It's a pretty strong green tea, with a good portion of the energizing effect coming from caffeine.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting. Recommended.<br /><br />****

However, I made a recent trip to walmart and the price of one box was $4.00. So it would have been cheaper just to buy six boxes at walmart than order off of amazon! I recommend you cross check the prices at your local stores and make sure you're actually saving your money by subscribing.
