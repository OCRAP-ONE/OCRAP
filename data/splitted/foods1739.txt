review/summary: Delicious, but prices are way off.
review/text: This is a tasty product, but not quite sweet enough for me as it comes. A spoonful of sugar makes it right, but the prices for this stuff are ridiculous.<br />The tea supply was not (to my knowledge) affected by the recent coffee shortage which raised prices across the board. This price comes out to almost 60 cents a cup and I pay less than that for Kona blend k-cups, even with the shortage. I will not be buying this product just because of that. Profit is ok, obscene profit is not. Shame on you Green Mountain!

review/summary: Define Southern
review/text: This is not what I would call Southern sweet tea. I was raised on sweet tea and this is simply iced tea. If you are looking for something that is as sweet and sugar laden as your grandmother's tea, this is not it. It is great iced tea, put some sugar in the bottom of the cup before you brew it and it can make delicious sweet tea as well. It is a great alternative to making an entire pitcher when no one else will drink it.

review/summary: MY CATS LOVE
review/text: I have four inside cats and one feral (outside) kitty. All LOVE this. It is really HIGH on their List as they will eat the entire can every night if offered, which is very rare for any cat food I have offered.<br />My kitties always have Kibble out.<br />At about 6:00M, dinner is served in the form of 6 or 7 cans of cat food. This is served on a rotational basis so their  little palates do not have too much of one thing. Usually, if they are offered the same thing night after night, it eventually gets left uneaten. But this food has the rare quality of one of the few that is eaten in its entirety every night. (Depending upon how I have Subscribe and Save schedules set up, I may end up with more of this on hand than I expected. Currently I have ended up offering it EVERY NIGHT for up to two weeks!  But they have eaten it!!!)Feral Kitty gets it as a treat.<br /><br />So, It is ONE OF THE FAVS!!! Every Kitty votes 5 stars for this and says "thank you!" Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty!

review/text: The new label says DARK SWEET CHERRIES, and they dropped the BING, and OREGON said they are the same, but they seemed to be less sweet.<br /><br />Could just be the batch, but they were still very good.

Then I cool it, add arrowroot to some cold water, pour it into the thickened juice, and mix through with the rest of the cherries. Then bake as usually remembering to cover the outer crust, and DELICIOUS PIE!!

review/text: Recently, I purchased a can of Oregon Dark Bing Cherries. While making my jello recipe, I noticed strange elongated pieces in the jello after adding the bing cherries, which originally looked fine.  After fishing these pieces out, to my horror, they were worms. My advise to anyone using these canned cherries is, to cut them in half and examine them first before using them in a recipe.

review/summary: Fruity Cherry Flavor and Not too Sweet
review/text: I haven't purchased any canned fruit in syrup in years.  My recollection was that canned fruits in syrup were so goopy and overly sweet that you lost both the texture and flavor of the fruit.  However, I really love cherries and I thought it was worth trying these as an option I could keep in my pantry.<br /><br />These are much fresher, and less goopy-sweet, than I remember from the past.  The cherries are definitely distinct in shape and taste.  Of course they are soft, but they aren't mushy and falling apart.  The cherry flavor comes across very well.  The syrup seems more like "light syrup" to me.  It is also quite tasty with a good cherry flavor.  I believe that this syrup could be used to good effect in a variety of beverages, such as spritzers, sangria, smoothies, teas, and the like.  If you are having a party, this is a great thing you can keep handy and just dump the entire contents into your sangria mix, since the whole cherries floating therein are both traditional and festive looking.  Of course most people probably make pie glaze from the syrup.  But even if you aren't interested in making pie, you can still get full use and value from this product, without having to throw out the liquid.<br /><br />I like these as a quick topping to various other things.  Cherries are an amazingly adaptable fruit.  You aren't restricted to using them in sweet dishes.  You can add them to things like poultry (duck with cherries is a classic) or pork, and I intend to try them with lamb.<br /><br />The fact that these are packed in syrup instead of water doesn't mean that they don't still offer great nutritional value, fiber, flavor, and usefulness to a home cook.  I plan to keep these on hand regularly from now on.

review/summary: All it takes is one death, and these will be pulled from market
review/text: We're pretty avid Whole Foods shoppers now, and have felt pretty good about purchasing organic baby food for our now 9.5 month old son.  Earth's Best brand has been popular with him, so we bought these teething biscuits recently.  Today, he could have died eating one.<br /><br />Although I'm an anesthesiologist, and half of my job is to "protect people's airways", one needn't be a medical professional to realize why these biscuits are dangerous.  Most babies get their front teeth (upper and lower incisors) first, long before molars arrive.  So, they're limited to biting with their front teeth, and only mashing with their gums (where their molars will someday erupt).  These biscuits are great for the first 5 minutes, baby happily chomping away on the hard surface.  Then, they soften.  Pretty soon, baby bites clean through the biscuit with their front teeth (size of chunk depending on how far they had inserted it into their mouth at the time), and the chunk that remains in their mouth is WAY too hard to mash with gums.  Baby has nothing to do but try to spit it out (difficult at this age), or swallow it whole (if lucky enough for it to be a small piece), or have it completely occlude their airway.  We were able to quickly fish one large chunk out with our fingers, but our poor soon started gagging, tearing, and wretched once before something resolved (still don't know if he swallowed a large piece or if it ended up on ground), but not before we scooped him up and tried to knock it loose with some back blows.<br /><br />In any case, although the kids may love these, all it would take would be one infant death from choking to prompt a recall or something.  Why risk your own kid?

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:52 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was going to write about how much my son LOVES Earth's Best Teething Biscuits, but I thought he could just show you how much he LOVES them in this video.  The biscuits do get soft after some time, but we just break of the soft piece and give him back the rest of the biscuit.  I would advise not to give these biscuits to a child until they've learned to chew puffs with their gums, so even if they were able to break of a piece themselves, they know to chew on it before swallowing.  My son is 7 months old in this video by the way.

review/summary: These don't have to be a choking hazard....
review/text: My son liked these after us both getting used to them.<br /><br />I would say these are for infants who are teething and beginning to eat with their hands. The biscuits are really met to be sucked on and not really chewed well. So if your baby is at the stage where he is proficient at chewing and swallowing solids, he is beyond these.<br /><br />Also, I found that if I broke one biscuit stick in half, it fit perfectly into my little guy's hand and he could take it to his mouth to suck on and bite. By the time he had bit it enough times to break a piece off, it was dissolved enough and small enough to not be a choking problem.<br /><br />The box says not to give these biscuits to babies younger than 9 months, but my son started these at 6 or 7 months because he was getting teeth. I don't think he will be able to eat them much longer because he is getting more skilled at chewing and swallowing, and like I said before, these really aren't meant to be chewed all at once, but slowly sucked on and bitten.

review/summary: Major choking hazard.
review/text: The ped suggested I get my 6mo old teething biscuits. I got a package of these and the barley ones yesterday. I gave him one of these. He was gumming it pretty well, with both my husband and I present. Yes, it was messy, but he liked it and seemed happy. I was keeping a pretty close eye on him. He dropped it in his lap and it got stuck, so I went to pick it up and noticed much of it was missing. I immediately looked into his mouth and saw a piece. As I started reaching for him, he had a coughing fit and inhaled it. I immediately picked him up, tipped him over, and gave a few good pats on his back which dislodged the nearly quarter sized chunk. I don't trust giving these to him any more.<br /><br />On the ad for the barley ones, a reviewer raving about the product wished to start out by telling us all how we need to supervise our children while they're trying out new foods because food is "dangerous". This may not be helpful, but.... duh, ya think? So because one person thinks these type of biscuits are the bees knees, that makes the rest of us incompetent parents? Hardly. Not only am I a parent, I have also been a healthcare professional for nearly a decade now.<br /><br />I love the company, but I don't trust these biscuits. Period. I gave it 2 stars, because my son went crazy for them and I am impressed with that. Perhaps I'll grind them up and turn it into cereal instead.

review/summary: Messy and dangerous...
review/text: My 9 month old is sprouting 6 teeth and I thought this would be great for him to hold and chew on (like a chew toy). The first time we gave him one was to keep him occupied while we were out having dinner, but to my horror, the mess he made while it dissolved in his hands and mouth didnt help us enjoy a meal. The table cloth, high chair and his clothes were all smeared with mush within a few short minutes. I had to take it away from him. The second time was at home (where I could bear the mess alittle more) I gave him a piece to entertain himself while I prepared dinner. He was entertained with it in his highchair for awhile - just enough time for me to wash the rice twice before putting them in the rice cooker, then I heard him coughing and gagging. Thankfully, he was only an arm reach away from me. When I stuck my finger into his mouth, I found the cause to be the 1/3 of the biscuit broken in there! Unless you are prepared to keep both eyes without blinking on your kid and use up a box of wipes cleaning up the mess; look for something else.

review/text: My little one has been eating these since she was about 10 months old. She didn't like the wheat ones and frankly, I like these barley ones better too. Good thing they come in twos. We like to share them. It is a choking hazard but like most foods, you have to be vigilant and supervise. For some reason, I thought these that I received via Amazon were not as hard as the ones I got at the store. I was worried about the expiration dates since I ordered a pack of 12 boxes but then, I am eating them too so I'm sure they'll be gone by 2/09. What I find amusing is the "evaporated cane juice" that is listed in the ingredients of health foods these days (not just these biscuits). Isn't that simply sugar? Aside from that, I thought these were healthier alternative to a lot of toddler snacks out there anyway, so I gave it 4 stars.

review/summary: Choking hazard
review/text: We use a lot of Earth's Best products and are quite happy with most of them. Not so these teething biscuits. My daughter fulfilled all the "requirements" listed on the box, e.g. she can crawl, gums food, etc., but she still got a big piece of these stuck in her throat and started chocking. There is nothing more scary than finding your nanny hold your child upside down trying to get a piece of food out.<br />I don't recommend these. They should be recalled, or at least not called "teething" biscuits, more like "toddler" biscuits.

review/summary: DANGEROUS!
review/text: My son almost choked to death on one of these. Instead of slowly dissolving they break apart in large chunks. I would pull them out of his mouth whenever one broke off but today he managed to swallow it before I could get it out and it was nearly lethal. The biscuits are wide and flat. The pieces that break off have sharp corners. The piece that he swallowed was completely blocking his windpipe and because of the sharp corners it was nearly impossible to get out. Baby heimlich did not work. I had to stick two fingers all the way down his throat, carefully dislodge it and pinch it between my fingers to get it out. He is 13 months and eats all kinds of crackers and other solids. These should be taken off the market.

review/summary: Definite choking hazard for teething babies
review/text: My 1 year old has choked on these biscuits - he is old enough to feed himself cereal pieces, baby mum-mums, etc. but choked within 1 minute of eating these biscuits.  They are hard enough that when they break off in a baby's mouth, the pieces still stay big and hard rather than dissolving like baby puffs or mum-mum biscuits, and the big pieces immediately get caught in the back of the throat.  I might keep the box around and give them to him when he's much bigger, but then it should be marketed towards toddlers who can eat them safely, definitely not to teething babies.  DANGEROUS!

review/summary: Turns into a sticky mess; may be a choking hazard
review/text: Let me first say that my daughter loves these from when she was 6 months old.  They are tasty and fun for her to eat; that's not the problem.<br /><br />After having been gummed for only a short time, these biscuits turn into a gluey, sticky mess.  It's amazing how tenaciously the goop sticks to mom, baby, clothes and anything else in the vicinity.  Be ready with several wet naps or a clothing change if you give these as a snack.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, they are HARD.  When my daughter is 3/4 finished with hers, she stuffs the whole thing in her mouth.  It will not dissolve, and instead becomes a rather large (in my opinion) choking hazard.  I will note that I have never had a choking incident with the product.  However, when I give her these biscuits I monitor her closely and take it away from her when about a quarter of it is left.

review/text: My daughter is 10 months old and she almost choked yesterday when trying these cookies. She had been chewing for less than five minutes when a big piece broke and got stuck in her palate. We were able to retrieve it but it was scary and VERY dangerous. The first box I got at Whole Foods contained several cookies that had broken into pieces, I should have known better. Do not use this product if you have a young baby as it is extremely dangerous.

review/summary: A real review by someone with a real baby...
review/text: These barley teething biscuits are very similar to the wheat ones by the same brand. My baby seems to really like them. They're hard enough that they don't break apart or dissolve too fast. I can say that, to me, the wheat are sweeter than the barley. I personally think barley anything tastes absolutely disgusting, but like I said, my baby likes both flavors. At first, I didn't understand why they were wrapped in packs of two, but then I realized that the first one is undoubtedly going straight to the floor, so a replacement is necessary or tears will ensue. Great product, good price, organic! So no worries.

review/summary: Great for Old Husky's Too!
review/text: OK THIS might sound even more lame...we got these for our 12 year old Siberian.  She lost a few teeth this year and has always loved a crunchy bone after every meal...we just couldn't give her those colored, fake bacon, clay looking dog treats that seem to be the only soft dog treats out there.  We were giving her no salt soda crackers but she decided she didn't like those.  So, we decided if babies with no teeth could eat these, our Husky with some teeth might be able to crunch her way through them and...she loves them!  She can crunch to her hearts content without hurting her gums.  And, the sodium content is so much lower than even the salt free soda crackers!

review/summary: Choking Hazard!!!!
review/text: I gave one of these to my 9 month old (with 9 teeth albeit!) last night, and he choked!!  Of course I assumed they'd dissolve like other teething biscuits and didn't try it for myself first.  Thankfully I was right there and by the time I had flipped him over and got him in position to try and get it out, he started coughing and crying, but I hate to think what could have happened if I couldn't get it out!  If your baby already has teeth and can break pieces off - buyer beware.  I tried it for myself afterwards and these do not dissolve very well.  It took a while for me to dissolve it. I agree with a previous reviewer, all it's going to take is one death, and these will be pulled off the shelf.  Thankfully my baby wasn't that statistic last night, but very well could have been.

review/summary: Choking hazard, better for toddlers with molars
review/text: I agree with all of the previous reviewers - these biscuits are dangerous for babies and even young toddlers who are unable to chew well.  My son broke one of these biscuits in his mouth when he was very close to one year old and had quite a few teeth.  Fortunately, I was able to remove the broken piece from his mouth.  I was still pretty frightened by the incident.  He is now 15 months old and has 15 teeth, including all of his molars, and I finally feel better about giving him these.  I still supervise him, though.  These are convenient when out and my son, a very picky eater, likes them.

She sucks on them and they spread goo everywhere, but that's the tale of all teething cookies.  Their texture reminds me of dog biscuits.  Very dense.  They taste a lot like graham crackers.  I bought them because barley sounded healthier than rice and we've enjoyed the jars of Earth's Best baby food.  They last a long time.  The box is still more than half full.  She likes the Mum Mum rice rusks better and those are what I'll be buying in the future.

review/summary: Tasty snack that sooths baby's gums
review/text: Our 9 1/2-month old daughter LOVES these teething biscuits! We initially tried them upon recommendation from another Mom in our Mommy & Me group.  The biscuits can be rather messy as they disintegrate but part of this may be due to the fact that our daughter only had one tooth at the time we introduced these teething biscuits; she does not seem to get quite as messy now that she has a couple of teeth. My husband and I try out everything that the baby eats and we found these to be pretty tasty - not quite as sweet as a graham cracker (she loves these, too) but not too "wheaty." We keep packs of the biscuits in the cars, diaper bags, stroller caddys, my purse, etc.  They are often a lifesaver when we are out and about, running errands or out to dinner! They make the baby's gums feel better, keep her preoccupied and are tasty snacks.

review/text: My baby has been eating these since he was about 7-8 months old. Being a first time mom I was very paranoid about him choking on them at first but I have never had a problem. He is a year old now and they've been a daily snack for him. He will sometimes cough a little but he does that when he is drinking formula or juice. I admit, even I inhale my food/drinks once in a while. =P They are messy and will leave an icky film all over baby's face/hands but he loves them and it keeps him occupied for quite a while. The only problem is, I have to watch my dog very carefully to make sure she doesn't steal them from him. I highly recommend them.

I knew something wasn't quite right when the plastic packaging that houses the biscuits has "use only with adult supervision" all over it.  Well, yes, of course we would only use them with supervision, but I shouldn't have to expect to scoop them out of my son's mouth to prevent him from choking.  My husband will eat the rest as a snack and we will never purchase them again.

They dissolve and get a layer of goop on everything, but it's not the end of the world.  They take a long time to eat because they are dissolving not being chewed so that's a plus.  We normally give him one cracker instead of the 2 in the pack.

review/text: I tried this for the first time today with my 8.5 month old grandson and within one minute a piece about the size of a half dollar broke off in his mouth and became lodged in his throat.  He started turning off color and couldn't breath.  I lifted him out of his high chair hoping that might dislodge the piece but it did not.  I then tried the modified heimlich for babies twice and it didn't work.  Finally, I put my finger in his mouth and had to go all the way to his throat to reach and grab the piece he was choking on.  Thankfully that worked, but I still am freaked out - more than 8 hours later.  My grandson means the world to me and I can't imagine anything bad happening to him.  Don't buy these biscuits, don't use these biscuits.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Product
review/text: Let me first address the low reviews found here: Please disregard any low review on here that points to the fact that their kid wasn't ready for it. Each child is unique and just because the package states that a certain age is appropriate, it is just an aggregate suggestion and still leaves the determination up to the responsible parent to supervise and make an informed decision as to if their child is ready to consume the product. Just because their are parents who threw these at their kids and had a bad experience, doesn't mean this product is lacking, just the parenting skills.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT: Earth's Best is a brand I love, they use all organic, non-genetically modified foods without any fillers, or artificial nonsense. This teething biscuit is awesome. It is a 3 inch long by 1 inch wide biscuit. This is not a cracker like Ritz or Graham because it is firmer and doesn't crumble all over the place leaving a mess when the kid crushes it in their hands. This biscuit encourages the child to 'teeth' it until it is soft. We began giving these to our daughter at round 7-8 months with proper, responsible supervision and they worked great for her early teething requirements. So much so that we used Amazon's subscribe and save feature.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and hope you consider the reviews for what they are saying; are they critiquing the mistake they made or reviewing the actual product? Because the product is not the problem, it's the user.

review/summary: Takes forever to eat & super messy
review/text: I laughed my head off because when my twin babies were finished eating these biscuits, they were literally covered from head to toe. My babies take about 30 minutes just to eat one biscuit. Afterward, they would need a bath! I like the fact that it keeps them busy, but boy do I have to pay for it in clean up time. Also, biter biscuits are not for younger babies. Most biter biscuits are for twelve months and older. Before ten months of age, my babies had some trouble with pieces getting broken off into their mouths and choking. Now, they eat these like pros. It takes some experience, time and close supervision. Gerber biter biscuits are less messy because they crumble easier instead of getting sloppy. But, my 10 month olds can eat Gerber BB's in less than five minutes. It keeps them busy while I'm making their food, which is a big plus.

review/summary: Choking Hazard - Beware
review/text: My 10 month old has two teeth coming in on top and three on the bottom. He eats cheerios, gerber puffs, soft cooked vegetables and ripe fruit with very little problem. I tried the Earth's Best barley biscuits because he is prone to food allergies and I wanted to avoid wheat. Every time I gave him one of these biscuits (3 times) he was able to bite off too big a piece and gagged, not to the point of actually choking, but enough to send me into a panic watching him struggle and turn red. They don't seem to dissolve in his mouth fast enough. On the upside they taste good without being overly sweet. I think they are better suited for a little older babies who have more teeth and have really mastered chewing. I will try the Mum Mum rusks as a previous review suggested.

review/summary: Excited to finally have teething biscuits!
review/text: I am a new mom of my 7 month old son with a new one on the way.  My little guy has been teething for 2 months now and needing something to chew on that will teach me to eat "big people food" and also subside the pain the teething is causing.  My mom used these teething biscuits with my brothers and highly recommended them, I was very excited to get them.  At first my little guy wasn't quite sure what to do, but after a few minutes he learned not to bite off pieces but rather to gum it and enjoyed it for a good 20 to 30 minutes!  However, since they say "9 months and older" I kept a good eye on him to make sure nothing bad happened.

review/summary: these are great, all food should be supervised when &lt; 1 yr
review/text: These worked great for us.  When your kid is just learning to eat, you should always be supervising!  Food is kinda dangerous :  That said, babies are very good at choking stuff back up.  My doctor mentioned not to confuse "can't breathe" choking with "too much food at once" choking.  The 2nd 99.9% is fine they'll choke it back up.  The 1st you worry most about wind-pipe sized things like whole peanuts, marbles, grapes, tomatoes, etc.<br /><br />If he's fussy, we give out baby one of these and it makes him happy long enough so we can change him & cheer him up other ways.

review/summary: Best for older babies
review/text: We gave this to our 9 month old and it broke off in her mouth as other reviewers had mentioned.  Now that she is a year old she is able to eat them without a problem.  I would suggest waiting until your child has been eating finger foods long enough that they can comfortably handle these biscuits.  Once they have reached that stage, the biscuits are great.  My 4 year old loves them too!

review/summary: Crumbly, but Good
review/text: I bought these for my baby after standing in the snack aisle for 20 minutes reading labels. They seemed to have the most real ingredients despite the addition of "evaporated cane juice". When I first got them, she was about 7 months old and had just started solids. I broke them into small bite sized pieces (which was very messy) and she didn't seem to go for them much. Now, she's 10 months and we have started introducing a couple snacks after naps and desperate for a little variety, I broke these out again. I still break the pieces up because we like to "donate" to the dog and I really don't want to waste them. So, I break them into about 6 pieces and she has enough to hold and can bite off little pieces or suck on the end until it's small enough to pop into her mouth. In regards to the other parents talking about choking hazards, I'm not sure how that would happen unless the crumbs got caught in their throat. Or, if the baby took a huge bite and tried to swallow it whole. I would recommend introducing these in small bites until the child is used to the texture.

review/summary: Beware
review/text: Please be very careful of this buscuit, it is too thin, a baby biscuit is supposed to be hard and melt upon contact and not be breaking off in chunks enough to choke the baby. Just the thin look was scary to me and was later confirmed.<br /><br />Looks more suitable to a toddler.

review/summary: Great Ingredients, Super Messy, and Easy to Choke On
review/text: I really, really wanted these to work. They have fantastic ingredients, they taste great, and they're hard... to start off with. Once my 9 month old baby starts chewing on these, they get soft, squishy, and on every single thing they get near. They're perfect if your kid is in a high chair with a bib and can have a bath afterward. The other downside is that they do break off in big chunks and it's easy for the baby to bite off more than he can handle. I'll keep using these when my son is a little older because I think they're probably better suited for an older baby who is teething, rather than someone under a year.

review/summary: messy and a choking hazard
review/text: The first time I gave one of these to my 10 month old, she was already eating cheerios, graham crackers and rice rusks.  The crumbs got everywhere. She was able to bite off such a large chunk of the biscuit that I had to sweep it out of her mouth because she had difficulty chewing it and it did not seem to be breaking up or dissolving like the rice rusks.  I continued to let her have the rest of the biscuit and the same thing happened again.  I finally had to throw out the biscuit.  I should have thrown out the whole box.  A few weeks later our nanny gave her one of these under supervision while she was in her high chair.  It broke off into a couple pieces, one of which got lodged in her throat.  She went from coughing to gagging and not breathing as her panicked face turned from scarlet to purple.  Fortunately, the piece dislodged itself before our nanny had to do any back blows or CPR. We stopped buying the rice rusks because of all the bad stuff that's been doing on with food products from China, but we'll be going back to the baby mum mums.

review/summary: This product is a choking hazard!
review/text: I chose these as a substitute for zwieback toast, which has apparently been discontinued.  Gerber makes a very similar teething biscuit, but after comparing both, I found Earth's Best to be much healthier.  My son LOVES these biscuits, but I will be throwing the rest of them away.  For the second time today, he broke off a piece larger than a quarter after sucking on the biscuit for only about a minute.  My son is eleven months old and does great with chunky food, but there is no way he would be able to chew these hard biscuits with his gums.  I am thankful that I do watch him like a hawk when he eats anything, because this product is dangerous!  I will not let my son have these again.

review/summary: Yes, choking hazard indeed!!!!
review/text: This is more useful as a dog biscuit. It is very hard, which ok, if it stays in one piece it's good for teething. But as many other reviews say, when they suck and gnaw on it, it becomes soft enough that VERY large pieces break off and remain in their mouth. And these big pieces, once in their mouth is still hard enough that there's no way they can chew with their gums only. Just eat one yourself. This is just downright dangerous. Why would you anyone create a product like this for kids??? If you bought this, please just eat these yourself and not give it to your kids.

review/text: When I opened the cookie tin, the sweet smell sent my senses into overdrive.<br /><br />I ate one on the spot.<br /><br />And then I ate another.<br /><br />David's Cookies sent my taste buds on an adventure. The delicious flavors included in the cookie tin were Chocolate Chunk, Peanut Butter, Oatmeal Raisin, Macadamia White Chip, and Double Chocolate Chunk. I was taken back to the days of eating my grandmother's homemade cookies. My favorites have to be Macadamia White Chip and Peanut Butter, although all of the cookies are wonderfully yummy.<br /><br />The only downside to David's Cookies is that they are somewhat expensive.

review/summary: Dissatisfied with current pizza crust
review/text: For years we have used Boboli pizza crust and enjoyed it very much.  But...after it was taken off the market for a period of time a few months ago, it has been put back on the shelves and since then it has been totally tasteless.........nothing like it used to be.  Don't know what the previous problem was, but we have probably purchased our last Boboli pizza crust.  We were asked to rate the product and do not feel it even qualifies as a "1".  Please bring back the previous recipe or explain the reason for changing it.

review/text: My wife and I started a tradition years ago where we would make Boboli pizza's and rent a movie every weekend.  The boboli crusts that used to be so good have progressively become worse and worse the last couple of years.  What used to be a thick but light crust with lots of cheese on it has become a blob of almost uncooked dough with only a couple specks of cheese.  They seem to keep changing the recipe and each time it gets worse.  It's definitely time for a new tradition!!!

review/summary: Just Bad -  Not One Redeeming Quality
review/text: I was a kid when Boboli was first introduced (at least to the local market). Yet somehow decades passed and I never tried them. So this weekend when I had some leftover cheese and sauce from a pasta dinner, and saw these in the market, I thought, "perfect".<br /><br />The experience was anything but.<br /><br />I don't know what these are supposed to taste like, but I found them to be just awful. Once cooked, they're thick and doughy. Nothing at all like actual pizza crust. Not NY Style, Chicago style or California. Worse still, they have this god awful rancid oil taste. Like used, dirty oil from a cheap take out place.<br /><br />Needless to say, I will not be using the 2nd one that came in the package. Nor will I be purchasing these again.

review/summary: Outstanding product
review/text: I hadn't cooked with hominy before but wanted to give it a try. Considering that this is just lime-treated corn, it's hard to believe the nutrition label on the back. Per serving (1/2 cup, 245g) there is:<br /><br />Calories: 60<br />Fat: 0.5g<br />Carb: 10g<br />Fiber: 6g<br />Sugar: 4g<br />Protein: 2g<br /><br />This product is incredibly low in carbohydrates and very high in fiber. But even more promising than the nutrition facts is the taste. I recently used this in a "Peanut Butter Chili" along with 15 other ingredients and the hominy was my favorite part. Once cooked, the hominy has a wonderful texture and consistency, better than any bean or corn I've had. I highly recommend this product.

review/text: This company has a proprietary way of making pastas with a high whole wheat content. Their products don't have a mealy consistency, go mushy, or fall apart with extended cooking, like when used in soups or stews. Their 100% whole wheat products are the only true whole wheat pasta worth buying. Ask the PBS TV show "America's Test Kitchen" who tested these pastas and ranked them numero uno. No, I don't work for PBS or Bionaturae.

review/summary: Distinctive, great-flavored Japanese tea
review/text: *****<br />Ashby's Japanese Green Tea is a distinctive, strong, great-flavored Japanese tea. Nothing wimpy or mild about it, and I'm glad, because it's so enjoyable. I made a large thermos with one tea bag, left the tea bag in, and drank it for several hours, and it never got bitter. I then made more tea with the same tea bag. The flavor is definitely Asian and I could drink cup after cup. It smells great, too.<br /><br />Ashby's of London writes this about Japanese Green Tea: "From Japan, this pan-fired tea is lightly rolled and dried over a fire in a large flat bottom pan. This tea contains the desirable "Polyphenols" that have been reported to be a cancer fighting substance. It has a very light, fresh taste and produces a transparent greenish colored brew." I agree, but please note that the tea is distinctively flavored, not mild (which I really like) and delivers a wonderful tea experience.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, and if you enjoy Asian teas, or want a true green tea, you'll not go wrong here.<br />*****

review/text: You can buy Barista k-cups for $.75/cup (other brands for $.50/cup) so $1/cup is a little steep.  But if you've never tried it, I recommend that you go ahead and splurge on this deal.<br /><br />I like my coffee strong so I even enjoy the really stout Barista French Roast.  I save the smoother House Blend and Colombia for my husband.  But, without a doubt, Barista's Italian Roast is my new absolute favorite.<br /><br />Normally I would only drink it on weekends, preferring the formerly less expensive Timothy's Rainforest Espresso for work.  But now that Amazon has discontinued their subscribe and save deal on the Rainforest option, I'll switch to the Barista Italian Roast.

review/summary: Miniature Lemon Meringue Pie
review/text: The Balance Bar Gold Lemon Meringue Crunch bar is a good energy bar. At 28 percent sugar, 14 grams for a 50 gram bar, it is in the lower range of sugar content for energy bars. It is not too sweet.<br /><br />The bar has a nice lemon flavor. To me, it tastes a lot like lemon meringue pie. I suggest that key lime would also make a nice flavor for this kind of bar. As the product description says, "No pie we've ever tried came with the satisfying crunch and nutritional punch delivered by this energy bar." That may be somewhat of an exaggeration, but the bar does taste good and does have a balanced set of natural ingredients.<br /><br />One observation is that each bar weighs in at 200 calories. This makes it good for vigorous exercise, but perhaps too much to take a whole bar for a snack. On the other hand, we have been having snow storms every few days this year. I think that shoveling qualifies as vigorous exercise, so I can eat as many of these bars as I want to without worrying about calories.

review/summary: Yummy, tart lemon bar
review/text: This is the first protein bar I have EVER loved, and I've tried many. It's 200 calories with 14 grams of protein, 7 fat grams (4 of them saturated) and 23 grams of carbohydrates.<br /><br />It measures 3-3/4" long by almost 1-1/2" wide by �" thick. The thin outer coating is a yogurt lemon blend, then there is a layer about �" thick which is soft and creamy, on top of a crunchy layer about �" thick.<br /><br />The crunchy layer has the most tart lemon taste and this is great since I love a tart lemon flavor - it's tart but not like eating a fresh lemon. Not too sweet, just right, and I haven't noticed an aftertaste as with other meal bars.<br /><br />Since I'm usually a breakfast skipper, I've been eating this for my first meal and this is an easy grab-and-go item. Before trying this bar, I'd cave into getting a candy bar around 10 AM so I could make it to lunchtime. Eating this bar for breakfast is certainly more healthy than grabbing a Snickers bar later on, and this keeps me satisfied until lunch.<br /><br />NOTE: I received this through Amazon Vine as a free item, but I will continue to purchase these.

review/text: I received a pound of Buffalo Bill's hickory pieces as a gift, and enjoyed the size of the pieces and the consistency of the beef's tenderness and flavor. The box happened to come with a couple of samples courtesy of Choo Choo snacks, one of which were a few pieces of the maple pepper beef jerky. After finishing the hickory I went ahead and opened up the maple, and ate it all in maybe 30 seconds. This jerky is so unique and borderline mouthwatering, I actually broke down and bought a pound of it. It's just ever so slightly spicy, and the smell and taste of the maple syrup hits you at the start then lingers after you've finished it. I don't profess to be some sort of food critic, but I figured something this tasty deserved a review with a few big words. So if you like eating healthy and are looking for a nice treat, I really recommend this!

The Buffalo Bills Premium Maple Pepper Beef Jerky gives me that great maple syrup taste with a twist.  The classic smokey Buffalo Bills Premium jerky paired with the delicious warm sweetness of maple sugar and the robust taste of cracked black pepper all come together to create a wonderful treat. There is a good balance between the maple sugar and black pepper; both are strong flavors but neither overpowers the taste of this jerky. The size of the Maple Pepper Beef Jerky pieces make it easy to enjoy this treat any time. I'm glad the people at Choo Choo R Snacks are quick with the shipping; they make it so easy to enjoy my favorite jerky.

review/summary: Great Product -- Bad Customer Service
review/text: Purchased this product; received it, but it was in a large ziploc bag, taped on sides, and the black pour spout was missing.  I contacted customer service via email and was told (after several emails back and forth) that a replacement product would be sent (even though I just wanted the cap as this is not a standard size bottle) and yet still have not received anything from them.  Am just disappointed that my request has been ignored and that they do not take my request seriously.

review/text: I saw this at my grocery store and thought...hmm...bbq, szechuan???<br />How bad can it possibly be?<br />I got home, opened it up and was immediately hit by the pleasant smell.<br />I put a little on a spoon and oh boy was I hooked.<br />Hot, sweet, spicy.<br />This has to be one of the best sauces ever invented bar none.<br />Simply awesome on chicken, burgers or as a dipping sauce for chips.<br />Incredible.<br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: beware if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant
review/text: I like the flavor of this African Nectar tea, which is why I was drinking to relax during the "two week wait" of my IVF cycle. I did not know at the time that hibiscus and marigold should both be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy because they can cause implantation problems and miscarriage.<br /><br />If you are pregnant, or trying to become pregnant, you may want to avoid this tea due to the hibiscus and the marigold.

review/summary: TRIPLE THUMBS UP!
review/text: Reviewed by a true-blue Singaporean living in the US, this is a must have treat for those who miss the authentic flavors of south east asia! Tried the other more "inexpensive" version by Asian Home Gourmet but it was no comparison. The Prima Taste laksa broth is definitely alot more authentic and taste just like the morning/lunch hawker fare in Singapore...."Sedap!"(YUM) AMAZING and pretty simple to prepare - won't go wrong with this! THANKS PRIMA & AMAZON for offering this!

review/summary: Lip-smacking good...
review/text: Awesome quick fix for curry craving.  Instant laksa curry is hard to find, let alone this is more of a restaurant brand, not a typical store-brand that you can find in Asian market for curry mixes. I've searched high & low in Northern-Cal to no avail, jumping with joy that Amazon carries it now,<br /><br />Follow the instructions, and add some seafood of your choice, fried tofu, sprouts, rice noodle, and whatnot, then you will have a satisfying treat.  Give it a try, a good chance you would like it if you dig creamy broth, and South Asian food.<br /><br />Oh, don't forget to add finely minced Vietnamese mint if you can get some, or even Thai basil. For fresh herbs enhance the flavor; eat like the locals.  5 big, enthusiastic stars!

review/summary: Authentic and so easy to make
review/text: Easiest to make laksa. Combine provided 2 packets of mixes with water in the pot, boil, and the laksa gravy is ready. Definitely has the distinct laksa flavor - not like Katong laksa, nor is it like a real heavy hawker style kind of laksa but to me, it is authentic enough, and it does not have msg. I would say one box is enough for maybe 3 servings. The one sold here shows "two chillies" - spicy level, to me, is not mild, not too spicy, like a medium high. I used organic spaghetti, mung bean sprouts and hard boiled egg with it - yes, I am subscribing to it now. My friend introduced me to it. I would like to taste other Prima products now. This Prima laksa satisfies all laksa cravings until hubby and I get back to Singapore!

review/summary: Smells like fish food...
review/text: I loved the Prima Taste Rendang and set about ordering everything they make, that's available on Amazon. I LOVE curry, love coconut, and the other reviews of this product sold me on ordering it. Even though I had to order four boxes, I thought it was worth the gamble.<br /><br />I hate to even say this, but I didn't like it at all. When I opened the paste, it smelled like the fish food I used to give my fish. (Suppose it's shrimp paste making that smell) Normally I am ok with shrimp paste. But as I cooked the food, the smell .. reminiscent of bait buckets...started to make me gag. I even tried a tiny bite of the finished product but couldn't go any further with it.<br /><br />I don't know if this is authentic or not, I normally love thai food, curry, anything of that nature! But this, I couldn't stomach it. My husband said it was ok, a little spicy for him. I couldn't even sit at the table with him because the smell was repulsing me.<br /><br />If you like a strong shrimp paste flavor, you'll probably love this! I think anyone who loves seafood and soup would like this. (It's very soupy) I've liked almost all other Prima products, but I just couldn't stomach this one.

review/text: I first tasted this at a food show and wanted to try it home with my friends. The process was pretty simple. Boil water and add the packets provided. All I really had to do was add the vegetables, and VOILA! Dinner for 5! I'm glad I was able to find this product on Amazon.

review/summary: Fast, satisfying, tasty.
review/text: My Southeast Asian colleague tells me this is the most authentic laksa she's ever had outside the region. The mix is flavorful without being chemical and artificial like many soup powders. Oh, and I had the opportunity to attend a Prima Taste cooking class in Singapore!! They are the real thing.

review/summary: This is a SOUP
review/text: This SOUP is quite thin, but flavorful. It's meant for seafood: shrimp, fish, or if you want to get exotic, squid, clams, calamari, scallops, abalone or a combination. I suppose you could add bland Asian veggies e.g. soy skin, wood eaves (a type of tree mushroom), other kinds of mushrooms, heart of palm, water chestnuts, maybe even scallions?<br /><br />I serve it over Basmati rice just to make it more substantial. The egg noodles that are recommended, or maybe are traditional, aren't as good (my opinion) as just rice.<br /><br />I would not buy this again only because it's so soupy. I prefer curries that are more substantial.
