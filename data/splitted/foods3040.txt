review/summary: I liked it at first...
review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: Mild taste. Just add some honey and it's just like any other mild tea you would buy. Supposed to be great for allergies and Stomach bloat after drinking/eating poorly, noticed it does calm my stomach down and aid in flattening the post drinking bloat. Worth it! Try to drink a cup before bed each night! Caffeine free!

review/summary: Great flavored tea
review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/text: This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

review/text: i ordered this tea to produce more breastmilk after reading on forums how good it is. thinking that it is a very good item I ordered 4 box at one shot! What a mistake! I thought I could drink anything but this is the worst thing ever i ever tasted! Like few others say, it also stinks up your place. I dont know what to do with the whole 4 box, i wasnt even able to drink up the one single cup!

I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.

I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.

review/text: I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.

review/text: this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks

Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.

It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck

review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.

From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.

review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

review/summary: I use this tea for menstral cramps
review/text: I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

review/summary: Birthing Miracle Tea
review/text: I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

review/summary: UMMMM!!!!!!
review/text: I usually dont like black herbal tea, but this one i was able to sip on the whole cup without making a face. It is full of aroma and tastes much better than the usual herbal teas that i have tasted in the past. The Rose flavour is the best. How much it really calms u, god only knows, but the pleasure is unbeatable.

review/summary: Good Inexpensive Cleanser.
review/text: This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.

review/summary: delicious
review/text: This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it "worked" because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus.

review/summary: nice flavor
review/text: I have a friend who is a dandelion warrior.  Everytime she see's one, she pounces and that plant is history.  As a little joke, I ordered and sent her the tea.  To my surprise, she reported that she actually liked it, mentioning it had a rather nice smooth flavor.  Although that has not stopped her from still being a dandelion ninja, I give it 5 start just knowing that if she liked it - it HAS to be good!

review/summary: Good night sleep
review/text: I purchased these tea bags in hope for a good night sleep. The first night I drank it, I slept great.  I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well.

review/text: Maybe this is a placebo effect however, since I have been drinking this tea, sometimes in the morning and some times at night, I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted. The taste is fine- I sometimes add a little honey but it is fine as is. I will continue to use this tea. I do think it helps with your mood.

review/text: I love this tea and drink it all the time. The taste is very nice and I do not even have to sweeten it or use lemon, as it has an almost sweet taste all it's own. I take alot of medicine and have much trouble with my bowels. When I drink 2 cups of your Senna tea I am opened up within 2 hours.<br />Thank you very much, I would not use that much laxative.<br /><br />Pat Kamadulski

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

review/summary: Light flavored tea
review/text: I got this tea because it is supposed to help with PMS and supposedly helps "prepare" the uterus for conception. I figured it can't hurt, so why not? I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br /><br />As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.

review/summary: A great product, you must try!
review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

review/summary: Great herbal tea for cramps
review/text: My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.

review/text: Recommend it to all.  Lovely natural sweet delicate flavor and add some raw honey is a great cold kicker.  I loved it during a URI, upper respiratory infection and it was fabulous.  Soothed my sore throat and helped ease the coughing.  I now brew it for cold tea as well.  Very refresshing.
