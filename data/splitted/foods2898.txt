review/summary: Good, but could be better
review/text: I purchased a bottle of this rose extract from Kalustyan's, a specialty store in NYC. It is good, but not the best rose extract on the market. I suspect it is best for adding a mild, secondary flavor to delicate dishes, like another reviewer's rose ice cream.<br /><br />I used it to add to simple syrup for cocktails, and to add to seltzer. I find it has a soapy flavor when used in anything but the most minute amounts. This is common for many floral extracts, but it was more potent here than in others I've worked with. This should be fine if you're making lemon-rose or vanilla-rose or cardamom-rose cream dishes, but you may be disappointed with stand-alone flavor.<br /><br />I prefer the rose extract made by Silver Cloud Estates. It's about 3x more expensive, but worth it.

review/summary: Awesome Flavoring & So Glad I Finally Found It!
review/text: I had looked for this extract for years and was unable to find it anywhere because its so rare. One day I got the idea to check Amazon.com and was elated to see that they had it. My mother used to use this in cakes when I was a little girl and they were absolutely delicious- like nothing I'd ever tasted then or since. I had tried to replicate her cakes for many years but could never do it until she finally told me her secret ingredient: rose extract. I bought 2 bottles to ensure that I have it for awhile (you only need to use a little bit at a time). This is now my family's favorite type of cake. Another plus is that the seller had it to me in 2 days!

It also smells great! The Rose flavoring is very unique and adds a twist to anything that you add it to. We have customers who LOVE any of our products with this flavoring added.

review/summary: I had no idea what to expect but wanted to try it
review/text: I read how to make rose water and have plenty of rose petals in the spring but it sounded like too much hassle although I would like to make some candied rose petals because they are very expensive online.  Like others said, just a few drops or it tastes soapy.  I think you have to get accustomed to the new (for me) flavor.  The amount is generous and is not the same as rose water, more concentrated.  I made a Middle Eastern cake that was marbled pink and yellow, rose and almond flavors that complement each other if you don't get too much of one or the other.  I will try to find my photo.  After I got used to it, I liked the taste.  Some time later I used it I think I improvised a corn starch pudding and it was too strong.  I want to try a few drops in my Kittencal's Bakery frosting next time I get inspired.  Anyway, there's a generous amount in the bottle so it will last a long time unless you use it commercially.  Seller and delivery, no problem; I'm usually not in too much of a hurry.  Rose ice cream, divinity, all kinds of things I could try with it.  There is another Middle Eastern recipe I found for Raspberry and Turkish Delight Semifreddo that looks so yummy, will be hard to assemble all the ingredients and get it right.

review/summary: For green rooibos, a most excellent buy
review/text: My wife and I love red rooibos, and without a doubt, Davidson's Tea provides the single best purchase in red rooibos one can find.<br /><br />We read some information that made green rooibos something we wanted to try.  It has somewhat different health benefits than does red rooibos, in ways that white or green tea have other benefits than does black tea.  Since we expect to go through a lot, we decided to give this a try.<br /><br />For those without experience with green rooibos, the taste is rather like a cross between chamomile, green tea, and a hint of red rooibos, but with a slight scent of recently-cut hay.  You will generally find green rooibos combined with other flavors in the store--one popular one is green rooibos with honeybush.  This will likely be our preferred blend, too.  Davidson's Tea also has a very nicely-priced honeybush, so do consider this.  Also, Davidson's Tea has bulk hibiscus, which helps make a nice blend of theirs called "Spring."<br /><br />We will be buying more of this in the future.

review/summary: My "go-to" remedy for a cold etc.
review/text: I have a stressful job where I work around sick people and their often unprotected coughs and sneezes.  Davidson's green rooibos tea is what I reach for at the first sign I'm coming down with something, or those times when my own immune system just feels fragile and run-down.  I make the tea strong (2 heaping teaspoons to a cup), bring it to a boil then steep at least 6 cups on the stove (lowest setting on the burner so it's just gently steaming) for a half hour to an hour.  Sometimes that's enough to knock out the oncoming cold, sometimes I stay on the tea for a few days.  Bottom line:  my coworkers have been sick this winter, most several times; I haven't been sick once.<br /><br />I sometimes drink green rooibos straight but generally mix it with either Davidson's Spring Fruit and Flowers or Davidson's Spiced Rooibos Chai.  Good luck!

review/text: Residing in Canada, finding green rooibos is quite difficult except in pricey upscale tea shops. My local tea shop has it but the price is approximately 25$/oz.<br /><br />Here comes Amazon and Davidson's Tea where I could finally buy it in bulk for a reasonable price. The rooibos is great and it has that grassy aroma to it. Being rooibos, it is not the tastiest drink but it is good served hot during a cold winter or iced cold during a hot sunny summer day.<br /><br />Healthy, caffeine-free and cheap, what could I ask more ?

review/text: I'm a big fan of good, strong British tea like PG Tips but have been told that I can't have caffeine anymore. I tried this tea and am so happy to find a reasonable substitute ~ I don't really care for herb teas with lots of flavors added. The best way I can describe it is to say it has a sort of "earthy", full, yet mild (I know that sounds like a contradiction) flavor.  I like to brew it a bit strong but that doesn't turn it bitter. Some have said it's milder than red rooibos but I think it's more flavorful. It has a nice aroma too.

review/summary: fresh and mild pumkiny flavor
review/text: I usually order the normal organic South African Rooibos Tea and have jugs of this prepared in the fridge for iced tea, use it in my fruit smoothies and even prepare half and half lemon rooibos tea. My brother wanted to try something different and we order a bag of this green Rooibos.  It is a very mild tea leaning towards a pumpkin flavor, the tea in the bag is less aromatic than the normal Rooibos.  It  is a great tea hot or cold if you are looking for very mild color, taste and aroma.  Kind of like green tea with a smear of Rooibos.  If you tried the spiced Chai Rooibos and found it too strong cinnamon flavor, maybe this tea is for your because of this milder taste.  I love strong flavors, my favorite tea is still the original Rooibos, but having of a bag of this one around just to change it up once in a while will be great.

review/summary: Red is Tastier
review/text: Because I really love red rooibos, I decided to try the green variant as well (after all, I do prefer green teas to black teas).  But I was disappointed with this infusion, which was somewhat pale and tasteless compared to the Davidson's red rooibos that I bought from Amazon in the same order as a test.  Even so, the green rooibos does make a nice base to try adding other, more pungent herbal teas, and the price was so reasonable that experimentation is easy to justify.  I suspect that the processing, not the underlying botanical product, is why this variant seemed bland to me, but everyone has his or her own tastes, of course, and you might conclude otherwise.  What's clear, though, is that if you know and like green rooibos, you just can't beat the Davidson's price on Amazon.

The picture doesn't do the bag Justice as it has a zip-lock feature. It will take some time to drink all of this one bag and I purchased 4 different varieties. The zip-lock bag would do well if I were were drinking from only one. I vacuum packed 3/4 of each and stored them in the freezer. The partial bags are in the fridge ready to use. I'm looking forward to drinking these fine organic teas for some time to come and save big $s as well.

review/text: OK, so please do not consider this a negative review of Davidson's Tea in general.  I guess tea is like anything else, there are some who will like a particular tea and some who won't.  As you can see, there are other reviewers who like this tea a lot.  Another reviewer hit it right on the head, "smells like grass".  It does in fact smell like grass.  I don't want that.  I am ignorant of what a green tea should taste like and I am sure this is the proper smell and taste for this tea and that as green rooibos goes it will be better than other because Davidson's teas usually are, but like my dad told me about Gin-and-Tonics when I was a we one who snuck a sip while he pretended not to be looking, "it is an aquired taste son".<br /><br />I give it 1 star because I personnaly don't like it, not because it is wrong in how it tastes or smells.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!

I have never once gotten poop on myself, which I am quite grateful for.

I just buy the bags and bring the roll with me on walks.  They are fairly inexpensive as well, which is great when you have at least 4 poops a day, 7 days a week.<br /><br />The last thing I would comment on is that a tightened bag does not hold the smell in completely.  I didn't expect that it would when I bought them, but I wanted to make sure that anyone buying them knows this.

review/summary: Picking up poop made easy
review/text: Before I got my puppy, I was collecting plastic bags (instead of using my reusable cloth bags) from grocery stores to pick up my puppy's poop.  I refuse to be one of those people who think that dog poop will melt into the sidewalk after a certain period of time.  I also do not want to be blamed for starting the next Black Plague if dog poop could start a plague like that.<br /><br />In comes this `bags on board' bone thing stocked with bags for like $4.  I'm thinking, "Well, $4 is less than the price of a Bacardi and Diet...why not?!"  Man.  I am not looking back.  For some reason, my puppy pooped her way through all 30 bags in a little over a week.  Good for her... I guess?  So I had to re-up.  I almost went with stuffing plastic grocery bags in the bone and then decided that $7 was worth 120 convenient poop bags.  They fit perfectly into the bone.  The bone is not bothersome on the leash.  And, most important, I never forget a bag!  I don't really care about the colors and I don't see a quality difference between these and the `regular' blue bags.  The bags are not super thick, but my fingers have not broken through the plastic and poop has not come through the plastic.<br /><br />I am conscious of the destruction waste causes.  I do recycle.  I do wish that these were biodegradable.  But, instead of collecting the big grocery bag plastic bags, I am going to use these smaller bags for poop and my cloth bags for groceries.  Right now, the bags are a little big for my puppy, but I am sure she will grow into them...gross.

review/summary: Not as sturdy as original
review/text: I've been using the original blue Bags on Board refills off for over 10 years and have never had a problem. I ordered these for a change of pace; they are more transparent than the originals, which wouldn't bother me except they are also not as sturdy. I was using a bag from the 3rd roll in the package, and a hole tore while I was picking up. Ick! I will order the traditional blue rolls in the future!

review/summary: Bags split open
review/text: Several of the rolls of bags were defective, so that individual bags split along the seams. This would obviously lead to some very messy clean ups, that were more like using a piece of ripped saran wrap (no surefire hand protection) than a bag. Sticking with the trusted blue ones, which I haven't had an issue with.<br /><br />Also, these are definitely normal, plastic bags. They are not biodegradable.

review/summary: Never had a doggie waste bag fall apart before
review/text: I used most of the rolls in this pack without a problem, but recently I started a new purple roll and two bags I pulled off the roll tonight immediately tore open.  I took out a third and it started to tear from the top, but I managed to be delicate enough with it that I could use it to pick up after my dog without having a mess on my hands (literally). I've never had this happen before, but I won't buy these bags again!  I can't be caught outside without a way to pick up after my dog and I certainly don't want to risk using bags that will tear just trying to open them.

review/summary: Not just for doggie poo anymore!
review/text: I am currently a contractor in Afghanistan, and we use porta-potties and toilet units that absolutely cannot handle anything but toilet paper.  These bags are a GREAT solution for what to do with one's feminine products.  Large enough to handle each change, but small enough to not be wasteful, inexpensive, and fun, friendly colors make these an excellent solution to one of life's little problems.<br /><br />I'd imagine they are also good for doggie poo ...

review/summary: Not quite as nice as the ones that came with the leash
review/text: I have one of those retractable leashes that has a slot for the bags built into it. It came with a pack of bags similar to this that was light blue. (both were bags on board brand)<br /><br />These bags are very similar to those ones, but harder to open.<br /><br />It's not that big of a deal, when I need more bags I would buy these again, but if it is the same price as the light blue ones I would buy those instead (which I why I gave 4 stars instead of 5). But if these were cheaper I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again.

Gross!  I'm not real enthused about finding out if the rest of the rolls are defective or not ... I think I'll just cut my losses and pitch them into my recycle bin.

review/summary: visible at night so neighbors don't panic or glare
review/text: I like these bags for night use (especially the<br />coveted yellow and bright green ones.  Orange is<br />third best and purple doesn't help.  When I have<br />yellow or green, they are easier to see at night<br />as I walk my dog and neighbors are more likely to<br />relax and get in their house, rather than stick around<br />to watch me pass by.<br /><br />I always pick up after my dog.  However, in my neighborhood<br />there are people who open their door and let the dogs out to<br />go where they please unsupervised.  Or there are stealth walkers<br />that let their dog go, then walk off, without picking up.<br />I don't like finding others' surprises on my lawn either,<br />so using bags is a must to be a good neighbor.<br /><br />PROS: Bags on Board are well made, I don't feel like the<br />moisture is going through the bag onto my hand like I did<br />with another brand. As mentioned before, the bright yellow<br />and green are great for night use.<br /><br />CONS:  Unlike the blue bags on board, these are a thinner material<br />and seem to stick closed.  The bags are all attached on a roll, so<br />after tearing free one bag, I usually rub the top bag edge  between<br />my hands very fast and try to get the bag to separate, then when it<br />gives a little and I see that milimeter of separation at the top of<br />the bag, I carefully pry it apart and open the bag fully.  This is<br />BEFORE I go out with the dog at night, because in the dark, I'd never<br />be able to see the milimeter separation and pry the bag open it timely.<br />It takes awhile to rub the bag material and get it finally opened.<br />Blue bags by contrast are easy to open without having to rub.<br /><br />I will continue to buy these bags and the blue ones, but because of the<br />difficulty getting the bags open, I have to rate this at 3 stars<br /><br />UPDATE - dampen one finger before you rub the edge of the bag and it<br />sticks a little, making it easier to open the bag

review/text: These refills for the Bags on Board container take the boredom out of your walking routine!  Colorful, convenient, and cheaper in quantities; how can you go wrong?  At 5 am it is especially nice that these bags tear evenly, neatly, and easily along the perforations, and that the opening has dark bars making it easily distinquished.  With this kind of cheap convenience there is no excuse for not picking-up after your dog.

review/summary: Cheery bags for a dirty deed
review/text: As the title says, these are cheery bags for a dirty deed.<br /><br />One bag usually suffices to take care of the business done by two 25 kilo dogs. I'd estimate the bag rupture/burst/break/tear rate at a little under 0.5%, which is acceptable considering the cost and how thin they are - usually it's just a small tear.<br /><br />Sometimes it's a little tough to open the bag, I suggest pinching the end with your fingers and rubbing back and forth to make it easier. Usually a bit of moisture helps that as well. We usually just use the pinch method before knotting the bag to the handle of the leash, then when it's business time it's simple to address things quickly without fumbling to open the bag.<br /><br />Good deal, worth the money. Love the colors.

review/text: I like using these bright bags because I walk my dog at a popular park and I want people to know I pick up after him. I don't want someone stepping in a mess, much less glaring at me thinking it was my dog!<br /><br />I've never had a bag break and they are easy to open. They've got the Bags on Board logo printed on them. They're pretty sheer, so if you don't want to be obvious about what you're carrying, go with a black bag. I usually put an extra one under the roll, so that I don't unexpectedly run out.

review/text: Overall, this was a decent price for the volume of biodegradable poop bags...the only problem was that each bag in 1 entire roll (orange)did not have an opening on 1 side (i.e. both ends were closed). Defective. Also, these bags are hard to open in the cold as we can't figure out where the opening is each time & it doesn't initially open easily when rubbed together to find the opening. Overall, ok for the cost (although, I think I found similar cost at Home Goods with cute colors too). One note for "big" dog owners; these bags are small. It's ok for us as we have mini dogs.

Compared to other bags I have used in the past the perforated edges make them easy to tear off and even more importantly they are easy to open. Also the side that opens is clearly marked. These points are important when walking two energetic dogs who can get excited so I like to be able to get the bags out and open and the poop scooped up as quickly as possible.

review/summary: Good bags, great price on Amazon!
review/text: These bags are pretty handy to have.  They beat trying to use recycled grocery bags (which often have holes in them that you only notice once you're out on your walk).  The bags are thin but pretty sturdy.  Some reviews complain that they are too big, but I have a small dog and don't find that to be the case.  They are long enough that you can tie them in a knot, any shorter and this would be tough.  Overall a good buy and a much better price than you would find in the pet store!

review/text: Sure you can use those plastic bags you get from the grocery store..but I continue to buy these bags because I can store them in my glove compartment, my purse, my puppy training bag, and anything else small I might have. They also tear off well and open well. I've had some before that drove me nuts because when I tore one it tore the bag and it took me forever to open it. These work well for me.  As for the colors, the dogs could care less, but I like them!

review/text: This is the best deal I can find over the web. The bags are pretty long compared with other brands I bought before. So they are good for big dogs, too. On the other hand, you get only 15 per roll, not 20 per roll. Try to get bags of darker colors. The yellow ones are too transparent.

review/text: I used these for party favor bags because I like the colors and they matched by ballons and ribbons.  They are bigger than regular favor bags and will rip if you put something really heavy or pointy in them, but easy enough for the kids to rip open and get to the prizes.  They are great for the diaper bag or holding wet clothes...  and cheaper than the versions sold for dirty diapers.

review/text: This product is claimed to be biodegradeable, but it is not.  When the bags arrived, they were clearly different from the originals that we received as a gift, so my wife called the company and learned they had changed the chemistry of the plastic, and they are no longer biodegradeable.  They said that the EPA requires that anything in a biodegradeable package must be compostable, and they do not recommend that animal waste be composted.

review/text: I bought four of the "Best Sellers Collection" Gift Boxes as Christmas gifts for clients.  What a joke.  Subtract out the box, the "plentiful" cheese curds (probably a 1/3 of the product weight in the box) and you would have enough chesse to hold in one hand and at a ridiculous price per pound.  Go to a supermarket and spend the same money and get an amazingly better gift.  A total ripoff and I would never buy anything from these people again.  Wayne  -  Utah

review/summary: Good jerky, too much pepper!!
review/text: The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!

review/summary: Never again
review/text: I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

review/summary: Edible..
review/text: The price was very good, but I guess I know why.  I gave it 1 star because it's low in carbs and another because it's edible.  There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

review/summary: Horrible at WSOP
review/text: So I have been hanging with a top player at the world series of poker and I purchased 2 packages of Jacks Links beef jerky.  These 2 purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money.  The meat was so dry I was not sure if I was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey.  The "meat" caused sickness and lock jaw.  Jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes.  It was pretty incredible of them to sponser the WSOP but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price.
