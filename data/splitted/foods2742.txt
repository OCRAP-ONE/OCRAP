review/text: I love this treat!  It's a flavor explosion--a little sweet, a little sour from the cranberries and orange, and then there's the unexpected black pepper that was such a surprise additional flavor.

review/text: I didn't think I would like these, because I don't like pepper... But the combination of sweet and peppery is just perfect... Just enough for flavor, but not hot.  I could eat a whole bag in one sitting.  The nuts are just perfectly coated, the cranberries add the perfect zing.  I'm craving them just at this moment now!

review/text: This is one of my faves of the Sahale mixes. The pecans are always perfectly toasted, the cranberries appropriately tart and in the right proportion to the pecans, and the black pepper adds the right amount of spice and heat. The only thing I might wish for is a little more of the orange zest...it's usually so subtle I forget it's supposed to be there!

review/text: I love these Cashews.  However, they are evil!  I can not open a bag when I am alone because then I end up eating the whole bag by myself in one sitting.  They have just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness.  I gave two bags of these to my paw-in-law and he couldn't stop raving about how good these were. (I earned some points with him) I would recommend these to anyone who likes cashews, pomegrantes, and/or vanilla.  All the flavors are represented and compliment each other very well.

review/text: I found this on the spice shelf of my local grocer and decided to give it a try. What a find! Our house smells like a gourmet kitchen every time I use it. It's excellent in the oven and on the grill. Recently, smaller stores stopped carrying the product, so it's a lot harder to find. But it's well worth the trouble. I've tried many other brands of chicken rubs/seasonings (McCormick, etc.) but this one is by far the best.

review/summary: A staple in our home
review/text: I have used this seasoning for years and will continue to use it for as long as they make it.  I first started using this years ago when it was available in the supermarkets.  It was a much smaller size and similar seasonings were available for steaks, salad and seafood.  When the local stores stop selling it, I continued to look and luckily found it on Amazon around 4 years ago.<br /><br />This seasoning is very versatile.  It is not salty and and brings a nice flavor to many items.  For some dishes it is the only seasoning used.  I have used it on seafood like shrimp or catfish. We season our pork roast with it (forms a nice crust) and of course poultry. It does not go well with everything because it is a course seasoning.  But there are several dishes that you will enjoy using it for.<br /><br />For our home, we use a bottle of this every 9 months or so.  So be sure to check the expiration date on the bottle when you get it.  Once we did receive a bottle that had an expiration date within a month of receiving it.<br /><br />You'll get creative with this and it will help to add new flavor to some dishes your already make.

review/text: I've purchased this product before and use it as a ritual when roasting or BBQ'ing chicken. I tend to disagree that it way to salty. The chicken only needs a sprinkle of this seasoning, not coated to the hilt.I've had guests over for a BBQ chicken dinner and everyone wants to know what is this seasoning and where can they buy it. Also, it tastes great if you add about 1/2 teaspoon full to the water when making rice for say 2 servings.<br />An absolute must for the chicken bbq fanatic who wants a great tasting chicken.

Big size or small size, my spice cabinet is incomplete without this.  Just add it to the chicken before grilling, baking, or frying--it's that easy. It's great--order it--you won't be sorry!

review/text: I see this product got a lot of excellent reviews but I disagree 100% with the other reviewers.  My wife and I are food critics, so we know when something is good or not.  My wife and I immediately thought this seasoning was way too salty.  It was so salty that it almost was not edible.  It also tasted like Lawry used seasoning salt in the "Perfect Blend".  This made it way too salt.  If Lawry reduces the amount of salt by 60%, then I think this product can live up to its name.  I found that McCormick Montreal Chicken Seasoning is the "Perfect Blend" for chicken.  I am sorry I am venting a little bit, but Now I have to throw a 24.5 oz bottle of Lawry's seasoning in the trash.

review/summary: The Marriage of Sweden and India
review/text: Cardamom is the essential spice in Swedish sweet breads and pastries; without cardamom, a Danish pastry is just a Missouri sticky-bun filled with jam. Adventurous Swedish cooks - both of us - also use cardamom in fruit glazes for roast chicken.<br /><br />But cardamom is quintessentially an Indian spice, one of those that Vasco da Gamba and Cristoforo Colon sailed over the edge of the world for. It's included in most "garam masala" spice blends. It's also one of the prominent flavors in 'tom ka gai', the Thai chicken-coconut soup. Indian shoppers in San Francisco buy it in one-pound sacks or larger. Some Indian people, especially older men, chew cardamom like candy or gum, to improve their breath and their amative fervor. Cardamom ice cream is rapidly becoming popular in Cambridge, Masssachusetts, as well as in the SF Bay Area. Coffee drinkers from Austria to Afghanistan, and especially in Turkey and Lebanon, often flavor their beloved drink with cardamom. Chocolate and cardamom also blend well; adventurous Mexican cooks - me - sometimes add cardamom to 'mole poblano', the chocolate-chili gravy used with turkey and chicken.<br /><br />Once ground, cardamom loses its flavor very quickly; a small bottle of cardamom powder is convenient but should be used within two weeks at most. Serious cardamom-lovers buy it whole, in the pod, and grind the small black seeds as needed, in a 'dedicated' coffee mill or with a mortar-and-pestle. The green outer pods shouldn't be wasted; they can be used to flavor stocks that will be strained, or added to the grounds in a filter cone to make coffee. More intense cardamom flavor in coffee requires adding the well-ground seeds.<br /><br />Cardamom and most other 'aromatic' Indian spices lose their flavor with prolonged heat. They should be added very near the end of any cooking process, especially in curries. Anglo-American curry powder is a debasement of culinary art; it's mostly turmeric, which should be stirred into the frying oil early in the process while the aromatics are reserved for finishing.<br /><br />There are two sorts of cardamom available in American stores and here on the amazon: the small green pods and the larger black pods. They have somewhat different flavors, the black ones being stronger and earthier, but in most dishes they are interchangeable. Both kinds of cardamom are more intense when fresh, so a 4 to 7 ounce package is appropriate, assuming that it will be used up in two months or less.<br /><br />Here's a puzzle for bold chefs: what large bird should always be served with a glaze of lingonberries, chipotle chilis, cardamom, and shallots?

review/text: My family loves these chips! We can't stop eating them once we start! I did have a bad case once though. The chips were stuck in cluster balls. I called the company and they sent me coupons for free bags and % off of more bags. We haven't had any problems since.<br />Great product!

review/summary: Thin & crispy but too salty
review/text: I love blue corn tortillas and their products. I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do. I like eating dipping them into my homemade, low-salt guacamole- YUM!!

review/summary: Too salty and nearly expired.
review/text: I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried.  I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year.  But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips!  And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have "best by" dates of February 3, 2010.  How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month?  Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank.  I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first.  And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month.  Learn from my experience!

review/text: These 1.5" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale.

review/summary: Good, as long as they are still fresh
review/text: I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....

review/summary: I love the sesame in these chips, you will too!
review/text: I love sesame in general. It makes foods more satisfying. There are two brands of blue corn sesame chips I know of; this one and one by Kettle. I think I might prefer the Kettle brand a little over this one since they use sprouted corn. Somehow that improves the flavor a little. These are still a 5 star product though. Sadly, I just searched for the Kettle chips and found they have been discontinued, so not only are these a great choice for sesame blue goodness they are your only choice!<br /><br />Of course chips like these are pretty high in fat, so it is not a good idea to eat them too often. They are quite addictive as well. For a little addition to a lunchtime meal you will not be disappointed. I hope you like them as much as I do.<br /><br />-Dan

review/text: I've been eating these chips with my lunch every day for over two years now. I love the taste first of all. Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of "flavor enhancer".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free.

review/summary: The best corn chips out there
review/text: Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable.

review/summary: The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization
review/text: Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole "organic" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this "red hot" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.

review/text: I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!

review/summary: Rancid/Stale Chips, DO NOT BUY!!!
review/text: I purchased these chips on October 18, 2010.  They were rancid/stale so you can certainly believe the other reviewers.  I had not noticed the reviews about the horrible taste and staleness of these chips.  I wish I had.  I contacted customer service for a refund which they approved but I think Amazon should either stop selling these chips due to such poor reviews or check their stock to make sure they are FRESH. If you order, you should order with caution.  I am trying another brand instead of reordering these.

review/summary: Stale Stale Stale!!
review/text: If you regularly buy these chips, you would be like me and say, "that's a great deal!"  These chips are not cheap at the stores, but they are fresh.  The expiration date is not past when you receive your big box... but for some reason they are not fresh, and the salt on the chips is all at the bottom.  I kept thinking that it was "just that one bag..." but it was all of them.  I had eaten too many of them to send them back.  Do not buy this product from Amazon- but... my shipment may be the unlucky one that was stale- although i read several other reviews sharing my opinion... and i did not believe!

review/text: I've order the Seasame Blues before and thought they were great. The 7.5 ounce bags are round compared to the triangles. When you open the bag you get a strong odor of bad oil. The taste also has the bad oil to it. Unfortunately I sent a box to my sister after bragging about them. I called company but no word yet.

review/summary: Wonderful Amazon experience
review/text: My first shipment of corn chips was rancid and absolutely inedible. That was very unfortunate because Garden of Eatin'chips can be very tasty. The Amazon vendor was no longer shipping so they were not replaced. I thought I was out the cost of a case of corn chips and still hungry.<br />  But...........<br />Upon hearing my concern, Amazon found a vendor and sent a new shipment at their cost next day. Those chips are absolutely perfect! Amazon's responsiveness, service and customer care is exceptional! Thanks Amazon for a superb customer experience and for renewing my faith in Garden of Eaten' Blue Corn Chips!

review/summary: 25% chance of rancid chips - No Thanks
review/text: I have eaten the varieties of these for years and appreciate the concept- organic, not over salted, good varieities, etc.<br /><br />But more and more often, whether purchased here or in the store, in all varieties, the chips come with a sharp odor and flavor that to more suggests that rancid oil was used.  Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.  I had to throw out a whole case of sesame blues from Amazon, which is a bad deal at any price. I am done with your rancid products.

review/summary: Regular tortilla chips.  Not flavorful.
review/text: I have noooo idea what the "blech" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad. They were not too crunchy either.  In fact they are almost plain regular chips.  No big pizzaz here.  I was sad about that.<br /><br />I was actually really hoping for something limey! And Spicy! But don't expect that here.  I've almost gone through a whole bag, and maybe 1% of the bites have a hint of lime?  Zero bites have had a hint of chili.  99% taste like regular unflavored tortilla chips.  Well...a suuupppper small hint of flavor.  I'm almost wishing I had bought the pico de gallo instead.<br /><br />Basically, if you've been eating any chili-lemon flavored cheetos, completely wipe your memory and expectations- nothing that bold and tangy here.  (Which can be good and bad, my hubby hated the cheetos chili-lemon unspicy flavor and was worried we'd get that here, so he's happy we didn't.  I was looking forward to getting that popping taste, and am sad that wasn't there.)<br /><br />** WARNING: If you've never ordered full size bag of chips from amazon, be warned, 12 bags is A LOT!!! I opened the box and my jaw almost dropped, cause I don't know what I'm going to do with all the bags.  I'm sure they'll disappear at parties though.  (I had ordered mini 2oz bags from Amazon, and with those, the bulk amount is more manageable.)<br /><br />** Also, to make you feel good...I was at Ralphs shopping and one bag of 'Garden of Eaten' chips cost $5.39.  I think it was jalapeno cheese, and that's all they had, but regardless, I felt so good that I got the same thing for about $1.25 a bag (yea Amazon had it on sale). Yippy :-)<br /><br />** Chips were not stale, chipped or smashed on arrival, in case you're wondering.  And expiration date (on my on sale ones) is in about 4 months.

review/summary: Good taste, but not perfect
review/text: Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work.

They are absolutely delicious, spiced up just right, perfect in taco salad, with salsa or just fine all alone (and it helps if your alone too because when sharing these chips are addictive!)<br />But I HAVE TO SAY that these chips purchased through amazon were the best NO EXAGGERATION, that I have had. I thought it was just me but then my husband was like "i dunno what it is but those chips are GOOODDD!!"

review/summary: My Favorite Torilla Chips
review/text: I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone.

review/summary: Yuck-a-moldy
review/text: If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of "guac-a-mole" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) "new look, same great taste" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the "Mad-Men" era I grew up in.

review/summary: Great chips, but...
review/text: I really like these chips. We go through a lot of corn chips in this house and it is important to me that our corn chips are organic as I refuse to eat GMO corn. They have a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. My only complaint is that this last case we recieved, the chips are so fragile! They are breaking really easily, they are not holding up to any amount of dipping, which is a bummer. I'll still buy these chips, I'm just not as pleased with them as I have been in the past. Perhaps it was just an odd batch, as they haven't always been this way.<br /><br />We have bought several flavors of Garden of Eatin chips and this brand is a winner, overall. Definitely our favorite corn chip brand!

The only problem I see is that garden of eatin has a line of about 15 different tortilla chips. The only one's baked are these two. Those that make the decisions what to shelve need to start giving these chips their due. Something so delicious and actually good for you needs the proper availability to succeed.

review/text: I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day. There was so much salt between the salsa and hummus, that I really didn't need it on the chips. When I first started with the salted chips, my mouth would be on fire after a few chips. The salt free was an awesome find, and I love that amazon sold them in bulk so that I could afford them.<br /><br />Only con is because I'm single/live alone, and going through 12 bags of tortilla chips before they expire is a challenge (natural products tend to expire quicker). I ate them after the "best by" date, they just ended up being a little stale. No fault of the product, just my own issue to deal with. Still 5 star product!
