review/summary: Fancy tea!
review/text: The teas are very tasty. The tins appear to be air-tight, so the teas stay fresh for a long time. The gift box is cardboard, but sturdy. And really everything you need but a mug and some hot water are included in this gift set.<br /><br />Two minor complaints:<br />The tea pot strainer is a bit tedious to clean. I can't figure a way to clean it without rinsing tea bits down the garbage disposal. So I don't use it at work where there isn't a garbage disposal.<br />I think the recommended amount of tea per cup is a bit high. I've cut back to about half their amounts and still get a very flavorful cup of tea.

review/text: I love teavana products, when I ordered this sampler set I was excited. It arrived with NONE of the tea, I contacted customer service, They took their time sending me the teas I had already paid for, and four completely different flavors of teas arrived, the flavors look gross "strawberry lemonade" and other fruity flavors, but NONE of the teas they claim are included are here.This Not what I ordered, customer service leaves something to be desired, in my opinion they should have put a rush order on the teas they forgot to send me. Now I have tea I paid for and don't want. Very disappointed.

review/text: My hubby is so thoughtful. I am a tea drinker, and can't have caffeine. I was pleased with the nice mix in this set. We already have other teavana teas as well. Unlike another reviewer I like the fruity herbal teas  - as they are usually caffeine free.<br />Love the tea pot/ its very easy to clean! I used to go to this old herbal shop in my old town..  :( where  I live now there isn't a store except Teavana that has loose tea.

review/summary: Hooked!
review/text: I never heard of Teavana until I went to my local shopping mall the other day. The saleslady lured me in for some samples and then into the store, where she talked about the different teas. I wound up leaving with this kit, as well as some other teas.<br /><br />The Teavana Tea Sampler Gift Set comes with a 16-ounce Perfect Tea Maker, a 12-ounce bag of German Rock Sugar, and four teas. My favorite is the My Morning Mate, which is almost like drinking coffee, due to its mocha and cream undertones. Before I discovered this tea, I drank Pepsi to get my morning caffeine kick. Now, I have found a replacement in the Mate. The Strawberry Lemonade and the Fruta Bomba taste okay hot, but good served cold. I will order more of these in the summertime. The only tea I didn't like was the Rooibos Chai, which tasted like meat spices to me. Each of these teas come in a pouch with a detachable label that you can put on one of the four copper tins.<br /><br />Also included is the Perfect Tea scooper and the Perfect Tea Maker. I love my Perfect Tea Maker because it is easy to brew tea, makes two cups if I want more than one cup and cleans pretty well. To clean the maker, dump the used tea leaves into the garbage can, and then run the maker beneath the tap to get the rest out. You can wash the maker in the dishwasher, but it is recommended that you handwash it instead.<br /><br />Thanks to Teavana, I am totally hooked on loose tea now. It tastes so much better than the tea that you find in the grocery store, and it will last longer because of the air-tight tins that you can use. I would recommend this tea set to anyone who enjoys drinking a variety of teas. I'm glad that Amazon sells this set, but if you want to see Teavana's full set of teas and accessories, you will need to go to their website.

review/text: The box this comes in is quite substantial, and it does a good job of showcasing the different teas. The included jars also allow for a fancy way to display teas while simultaneously protecting them from light/air; lids fit snugly over the body of the canister. You are sort of pigeonholed into buying the 4 specific teas in the set, but they offer good variety and decent value.

review/text: I didn't mind the price of this set because it contained everything I needed to get started making tea and came in a handsome hard gift box. However, I was looking forward to trying the teas listed in the description here on Amazon, and received only 2 of the 4 listed, plus 2 others. I contacted Teavana and they just told me that they're updating the gift set and the teas I received instead were "better". I guess I'll never know. All of the teas included are great though.

review/summary: Wonderful indulgence for the tea lover
review/text: I received this kit as a Yule gift from my husband, and I have absolutely loved it.  The perfect tea maker is very clever - lets you steep loose leaf teas and then decant directly into your mug with no debris winding up in your drink.  I have found it easy to clean, and I use it three or four times per day.  The teaspoon, which I initially thought was pretty silly, works quite well to scoop up teas with chunks of fruits or herbs in it. I like lightly sweetened tea, so the German Rock sugar is a nice addition. I'd never tried a mate tea before, but I don't drink coffee and find that the 'my morning mate' is a lovely 'wake up' in the morning.  The biggest surprise for me was the 'fruta bomba' green tea.  I have not liked most green teas; this one has a very pleasant aroma and flavor with no bitterness. Finally, the tea tins are airtight and pefect for storing small amounts of tea or for travel.  I love this so much, I might buy another in order to have a second set for my office.

review/summary: Great herbal tea
review/text: I grew up on lipton black tea, brewed for hours, no sugar, no lemon... as Dad would say, "it'll put hair on your chest".  This (and the other Teavana products that I've tried) are certainly no Lipton.  The strawberry lemonade is great as an iced tea, although the fruit expands quite a bit, so you may want to split the dried product into two tea balls (I have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RIZ7">Stainless Steel Mesh Tea Ball</a>x2), for a 2qt pitcher.  It also pairs well with oolong, roobios or green tea... friends have tried it with black and white teas, but I'm not a fan. You can definitely taste the different fruit flavors, and the rosehips give a nice scent but it doesn't taste like you're chewing on flowers.  Happy drinking!

review/summary: Great Taste and Great Buy!
review/text: The first thing I want to point out is the quantity of what you get each bottle is a 42 oz, and their are six bottles! -- To give an example the bottles are roughly 10 inches high and around 3 inches diameter.  They have a pretty good shelf life, so the large quantity is not a problem (plus if you like hoisin sauce you will go through it pretty quick) -- for example I ordered in July of 2011 and they have a BEST BY date of March of 2014.  The sauce is delicious and has a great taste!  It is thick sauce (not watery like some other brands) -- I like the thicker sauce, since it has a stronger flavor and seems to go further than water downed sauces.  For those who do not know hoisin sauce is like a barbecue sauce, but sweet and tangy.  It tastes great in Oriental dishes, or on any food (I like it on grilled chicken, in stir fry, and anything else that you may like a little extra taste to!).  It is hard to describe the flavor, but it is good!  -- Although, I have heard most people either love it or hate it -- I love it!<br /><br />Also, in case you are wandering for a serving size of 2 tbsp the sauce contains 100 calories and less than 1g of fat.  -- Just FYI, I had a hard time finding this out before purchase...<br /><br />In the end this is a delicious sauce for a great buy!  If you look at the small bottles you get a grocery stores and compare the price to this, you will see what I mean.  I highly recommend this sauce to anyone who loves good hoisin sauce!

review/summary: Delicious but an Aquired taste for sure
review/text: I have been eating this salt since I was a child, not this brand but Kala Namak. It is commonly served with fruit and added to lemonades and other North Indian drinks. It is ground volcanic mineral salt and has a STRONG pungent smell and taste. I will not recommend it to anyone because it is such an acquired taste but I LOVE it. I have never used it in cooking, so don't know how that works. And to the reviewer Gordino, the smell is not a result of humanity's influence but because of presence of Hydrogen Sulfide, which is naturally present in the volcanic lava.

review/text: This just might be my favorite soup mix! I usually make the soup in my crock pot. We use ground turkey/chicken instead of beef, usually add some chopped celery to the onion as it's saut&eacute;ing, and sometimes even add some sliced kielbasa. The seasoning packet adds a really good flavor with just enough spice to zest it up, but not too much for those who would rather not have their tongues on fire while they eat (namely, me!). The barely/lentil combination creates a rather filling meal. With a side of cornbread, this is a perfect easy fix for dinner!

review/summary: One of the Best!
review/text: I won't say this is the best coffee in the world; because I have yet to try them all and everyone's tastes differ.  However, from my 20+ years of coffee drinking and of all the Kona coffee's I've tasted, THIS one reigns supreme.  And it better for that price!  But if you appreciate a well rounded, flavorful coffee, then this is the one to try.<br /><br />I lived in Hawaii for 3 years and was introduced to Kona coffee at the source.  Of all the coffees I've had in my life, Kona is my favorite.  It is the richest and smoothest you could imagine.  Others are good, but not in this class.  Also, watch out for Kona coffee blends.  They can be tasty, but are usually only 10% Kona beans and not the top crops at that.  This is the primo stuff here!  There really is something in that Volcanic soil on the Big Island.<br /><br />A word of caution though.  Drink this at your own risk.  It is very hard to go back to "normal" coffee after tasting this nectar of the gods.  Enjoy!

review/text: I am a medical school student and you might imagine how much coffee goes through my system in any given year.  I had Aloha Island first when I was an undergraduate and have since given up all other coffee.  Kona is by far the best there is out there, and Aloha Island is amazing.  I have tried 100% Kona from other retailers since my first dalliance with Kona, but not even the best of the premium coffees compare to the rich taste of Aloha Island's gold collection (which is their lowest grade).  The rich, dark grounds are perfect every time and make the perfect study break.  Now they say that the diamond collection is a special treat, but once you have a really good coffee it is so hard to go back to something that is below it.  I highly reccommend the diamond collection.  Word to the wise: don't stock up on this coffee; while it does last quite some time even with the most careless keeping, the coffee is best when kept in an airtight container and ground fresh for every cup.  The longer you keep coffee around, the more flavor it loses.

review/text: I am not a raving optimist and am a highly ciritical comsumer. I have never before publicly rated any product 5 stars. This is a 5-star product.<br /><br />Why?

It's as versatile as a swiss-army-knife and as refined as the highest grade Damast linen.<br /><br />I have had 7 other distinct Kona coffees purchased on my behalf on the Kona island and brought home for me to try. All others Konas were compared to this one and found lacking (in some cases seriously lacking). No "Kona blend" will ever again be found acceptable once you drink this coffee.<br /><br />So, not only is it a 5-star coffee among general coffees (including the "Charbucks" of the world...yech!), but it is a 5-star coffee among other high-achiever coffees.

review/text: I bought this Kona brand of beans based on reviews and think the responses are somewhat exaggerated. I would imagine that some of these reviews are employees or friends of Aloha Island Coffee?  After shipping I paid $27.45 for a bag of beans that are okay, but nowhere near phenomenal as the review rave. Milestone brand found in most supermarkets retails $10 a pound and easily rivals the flavor of this brand. I will accept the fact that my disapproval may be due to my specific low acidic taste requirements. I do not like strong coffee with a bitter overtone, albeit this medium roast is on the strong side.<br /><br />In favor of Aloha Island Coffee, they did not hesitate to refund my money, keeping true to their claim of 100% satisfaction guaranteed.

review/summary: An excellent Kona blend.
review/text: The Diamond II is great. Rich but very smooth, not bitter at all. This is one that people will try and comment on without knowing anything about the coffee beforehand. I ordered it as a present for my dad, who loves coffee, but as soon as he brewed a pot it disappeared because of the amazing aroma. Everyone would suddenly decide to have coffee once they could smell it. The only people who didn't seem to really enjoy it both drink coffee that I find revolting. My stepbrother, who regularly drinks coffee that's been heated all day, and his girlfriend, who loves instant coffee, thought it was too weak. My advice: if you really love good coffee, then keep the Kona for yourself.<br /><br />Caveats: other reviewers imply that this is 100% Kona. It is not. It is a blend, although a very good one. Also, it is a medium roast.

review/text: The coffee is exquisite, there's no doubt, and if you are looking for something impressive to give as a gift, this is a great choice.  The packaging is unique & very rich looking.  You'll know that you're holding something special before you even open it.  The best part, however, is that once you do open it, you'll find something wonderful on the inside too.

review/summary: Not much flavor - very disapppointed
review/text: My wife and I like strong coffee. Even brewing this at twice the recommended amount it tasted weak. There may be subtle tastes and flavors involved but there just was not much coffee taste. The experience is more like drinking tea.<br /><br />The only plus is that there is not any bitterness.

review/text: I have used the tropical flavor for the last 11 years. Yes I realize that the formula has changed. Does it taste the same? Close enough for me. Does it taste awful? No it is not awful whatsoever. Is the same performance in this jug? Yes it is. It still delivers a great performance boost. Now I must say, that I have literally never tried any other flavor at all ever. The tropical tastes just as good to me now as it always has. The choice is yours, but I recommend this product with no reservations.<br />BG

review/summary: It Delivers...
review/text: I'm an avid road cyclist and have been using Cytomax for about the past three years. It does appear to make good on its claims of reduction of perceived exertion and longer sustaining of energy levels. I've sufficiently experimented with other products to be able to determine, for me at least, that the benefits obtained from Cytomax are not a placebo effect.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers who've stated that the salutary effects of Cytomax tend to be especially noticeable during hot weather.<br /><br />The consensus among several of my fellow local riders is that the Tropical Fruit flavor is by far the most palatable, and I have to agree; I personally noted very little difference in taste when the manufacturer began using Stevia as a sweetener. It's light, and never cloying, even when I increase the concentration a bit for very hot days. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Definitely notice a difference when cycling
review/text: I have only used the tropical fruit, but I absolutely love this flavor! I just started using it in the last couple of weeks, so I cannot attest to the old recipe.  However, performance wise, I start drinking a 1/2 scoop per 12 oz of water (according to the company 1 scoop = approx. 3 TBL) a few hours before I'm going to exercise, and keep up the 1/2 scoop regiment probably every hour before I actually exercise. Usually I don't like to drink any fluids while I'm exercising as it upsets my stomach, but I do take a few sips of this drink during the ride, (for the ride, I do 1 1/2 scoops per 16 oz of water) and I feel it definitely helps my performance.  There were times prior to using Cytomax where I felt completely fatigued at the 13th mile of a 15 mile challenging bike ride. But after I started using this stuff, I felt fine at the 13th mile and even felt like I could another 7 miles.  I've had no stomach issues either.  I do 15 mile moderate and challenging bike rides approximately 5 times a week.

review/summary: Works for a competive cyclist
review/text: I typically ride about 5000 miles a year (would do more but live in New England).  I usually do a handful of pro/am races a summer (I fall into the am category!).  I use Cytomax exclusively.  I've tried others - Hammer, Gatorade, Accelerade, etc, but find Cytomax best for me.  It's easy on my stomach and not and provides the needed energy/electrolytes for long rides.  My personal preference is to do 1 1/2 scoops per water bottle rather than the 2 that they reccomend because 2 scoops makes it too sweet for me.  The deal on Amazon is great for the 4.5 lb container too!

review/text: I have used Cytomax for years and it is a great product.  Re-energizes you quickly and helps sustain you for those long runs.  Pomegranate Berry is a little on the sweet side, but all in all it is a great product.  Purchased as a subscribe and save and it is very well priced.<br /><br />The only negative to Cytomax is it doesn't dissolve well in cold water.  So, mix your drink with tap temperature water and refrigerate ahead of time.  I usually prepare mine immediately after my run so it is always ready.

review/summary: Fresh Apple it Isn't
review/text: The CytoSport energy drink is a helpful sports supplement. It does give a noticeable boost to help power through intense hour long cardio classes such as Spinning, Cardio Kickboxing and Zumba. There has been overall improvement in fitness, performance and an ability to increase workout frequency & time from using this supplement. It definitely helps in post workout recovery, little to no muscle soreness. Beats the muscle burn from Spinning and Kickboxing.<br /><br />I have previously used the Pomegranate flavored powder and it tastes more like 1980's Red Kool Aid punch than Pomegranate.<br /><br />The Fresh Apple flavored Cytomax is supposed to be a green apple flavor. Unfortunately, it tastes strongly of plastic with a hint of green apple. I would return it if I could.<br /><br />Also, if you use a sports bottle that holds 24 oz. count on using two scoops of the powder per bottle fill.<br /><br />The Cytomax works better if you drink a small amount 15 minutes before your workout, as directed.

review/summary: Live off of this stuff
review/text: First off, Tangy Orange tastes like sh imho. Tropical Fruit hands down. Lived off this stuff for a little over a year now. Tropical Fruit got me through crazy work. Canvassed door-to-door seven to eight hours a day rain or shine, excessantly drank almost every day for a while, worked out and exercised like a monster or beast, and most recently been working as a server for nonstop four to six hour shifts continually active.<br /><br />This is my recover-all cure-all push-on-all. Co-workers always ask me what the hell I'm drinking, sarcastically joke I'm drinking/taking drugs, but most directly, always tell me to slow down. Without this stuff, I wouldn't be able to be the me I really am, high-energy, high-energy spending, high energy to be calm, and high energy to be active. Friend used to tell me about this stuff way back at least 10 years ago, and now I know what he means. If you have any questions leave me a comment below. -Alvin

review/text: I used to drink this stuff when I had triple days (3 practice a day for 11 days straight) in college water polo.  I didn't drink this the first year and despite eating enough and drinking lots of water, I was exhausted.  The following year I drank the Cytomax just as directed I noticed my recovery was much improved as way my overall performance.  I don't compete at the same level anymore, but I still notice the benefits in my daily workouts. The taste is great as well when mixed correctly.  Even if it's a little watered down, it still tastes better than water alone.

review/text: I used Cytomax for about a month and didn't like it.  It gets great reviews from the majority of people that use it & I beleive most of them are cyclists & long-distance runners.  I play hockey, do interval sprinting, & weight training so I thought it would be good for me. I guess it was okay, but I find for my type of training that Gatorade G-2 PRO Series works better.  I do NOT use the pre-workout or the post-workout G-2 PRO Series, I use just the "Perform" which is for during the workouts. I have other supplements that I use for pre & post workout. The Seller, Shipping & Price Get 5 STARS *****.  The product, for me particularly & my experience gets 2 Stars.

review/text: I have been a loyal user of the Cool Citrus flavor for years, but recently tried the Fruit Punch in the new formula. The old formula Cool Citrus always had a bit of a soapy taste, but the flavoring was good, much better than gross Accelerade. I don't notice any soapiness with the new formula Fruit Punch, nor do I find it to have any kind of off-taste, which I normally notice with artificial sweeteners. I have always been a fan of Cytomax due to its lack of sugar in favor or more complex carbohydrates, plus the easy mixing. Many people swear by Accelerade, but the foul taste, pour mixing, and crazy amount of foaming have always turned me off. Looks like I will stay a Cytomax user with the new formula.

review/summary: Absolutely THE best athletic performance drink on the market
review/text: As a family, we started using Cytomax while training for a backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon, back in the Winter/Spring of 2006.  It was recommended to us by the owner of the local high-end bicycle store.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and the drink doesn't leave you with that cotton-mouth feeling that even water can produce, especially when it's hot.  I'll warn you up front, this stuff is addicting.  Once your body gets a taste of it, you WILL NOT exersise again without it. In fact, just the smell of the powder while you're mixing it will trigger a pavlovian response that you suddenly have the urge to go do something strenouos, and, you just want a huge drink of Cytomax.  Weird, I know, but true.<br /><br />About the flavors.  We've found the Cool Citrus to be the smoothest, truest, taste.  Sort of a nice lemonade flavor.  To us, all of the other flavors have some sort of a weird before, or after taste.  For example, the Tangy Orange has sort of a powdery thing going on.  The fruit flavors like the punch and the grape have a perfume thing going on.  We haven't tried the apple or the chocolate, and won't.<br /><br />I'll be honest and say that I'm not loving the "Natural" and now I see it's coming with "Stevia" as the sweetner.  Haven't tried the stevia version yet, and really, I'm not interested.  Personally, I don't think the "natural" is as good as the original, definately doesn't taste as good.<br /><br />Now for my "Cytomax Story."<br /><br />In August of 2006 we did our first backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon.  We didn't drink anything but Cytomax.  It was brutally hot down in the gorge, and being first timers, we not only brought a ton of stuff, but we brought a ton of heavy stuff.  We just about got laughed off the shuttle bus because our packs (especially mine) were so stupid huge.  Seriously, picture a Low Alpine 75L pack filled to the brim, to the point that it has to be bear hugged, lifted up onto a rock, and then backed into, in order to put it on! What can I say, we were rookies.<br /><br />The cytomax kept us alive and well, but the real story is that during the hike out, we came across a young couple on the Bright Angel Trail, somewhere below 3mi House.  As is typical for the Bright Angel, they were in tank tops, tennis shoes, no hats, and had come down with a 16oz bottle of water, each.  It was 100*F+, and the girlfriend was broke down on the side of the trail with heat stroke.  The boyfriend was talking about how he was going to run to the top to get her a soda.  She was angrily complaining about what she would and wouldn't drink (one of the signs of heat stroke is lack of good judgement).  I filled her 16 water bottle with Cytomax, and told her she could drink it, or wait for a helicopter.  She decided to drink, and in about 10 minutes her lights came back on.  We gave them both some snacks that we had, saw them one more time at one of the other rest houses, and I think they beat us out to the top!  Seriously, that's how great Cytomax is.<br /><br />We use it year round now, for whatever exersise or sport we are doing, whether individually, or as a family.  It's gone with us to the Grand Canyon, 5 years in a row, including just last week where my 70 year old mom went with us, rim-to-rim in 3 days, fueled by Cool Citrus Cytomax!

review/summary: Energy!
review/text: I read a lot of positive reviews about Cytomax being the better version of Gatorade so I decided to try.<br /><br />Boy boy boy, it was GOOD. I use it during workout to keep my stamina up. I feel the difference on the days I do not use it. I could not sustain myself as long as I wanted. By the way, I do Insanity Workout. So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.<br /><br />The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.<br /><br />The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it. The electrolytes help me to not get cramping because high intensity cardio movements usually wear me down quickly and without replenishing all the sodium, my muscle will get really tired and tense. Cytomax helps with that.

review/summary: Swear by it!
review/text: I started using this product in 1994. Wasn't really sure if it worked until I smoked my friends that I rode with 5 days a week at a MTB time trail. Miss the heydays of MTB races. I use it on long rides by mixing 2 bottles. first one to drink from and second one that is 4X concentrated. beats carrying around a a bag of powder. =When Bottle 1 use empty I fill bottle 1/4 full with x strong mix. Again, I swear by it. Don't train or race wit out it. plus these prices rock! Happy trails and safe roads><br />Justin

review/summary: Good Hydrations
review/text: I've used Cytomax for the past couple of years now and have found it to be the best rehydration product I've used. Everyone is different but this product has by far worked the best for me at keeping myself going on those long or difficult rides, hikes, cross country ski and snowshoe outings. This also helps to prevent cramping and bonking on those hot humid days when your tend to lose more fluids. I've only had the cool citrus flavor as that is the flavor I've used for years with other hydration products as well, and the flavor though a bit sweet for me is more than acceptable. While cycling I always alternate between a bottle of Cytomax and one of water. For other activities where I carry only one bottle I use a little less the recommended amount of powder per X ounces of water. This product like others like it, require a bit more time to mix than the original hydration powders, but it's more than worth the few extra seconds it takes to get it to properly mix.

review/summary: Cytomax is Great when the Heat Hits
review/text: Here in Louisiana, we get hot during the summer. I started taking Cytomax about 10 years ago when I was preparing for a 100 mile ride. I trained for months riding longer and longer distances but would deplete my bodies energy. I would just run out of gas and cramp. With Cytomax, I was able to extend my miles without cramping. Because of the expense, I tried many other brands but for my body, Cytomax was the best.

Normally when I just drink water or Gatorade during a hard workout I would be sore the next day.  Now that I am using Cytomax I am no longer sore and it seems I can work out longer and harder.  I know this sounds like a commercial but this stuff really works and it taste pretty good.  Plus you can't be the price.

I had never tried the Pomegranate Berry flavor before and NOW I am very glad that I did.  Not just for the electrolyte balance and replacement of necessary nutrients but for the taste also. My wife and daughter, that don't usually even like any of the products, LOVE this one.

review/text: This product is the same great product it has always been. These people who are slamming the product have no idea what they are talking about. Most of the poor reviews are posted by people who work for other companies who wish they had created Cytomax. There is not a better product on the market that literally and completely defeats any and all lactic acid buildup in your muscles. I would have paid twice this much too have had this product when I was still bodybuilding and powerlifting. Now my workouts consist of bike riding, Muay Thai, boxing and some light to medium circuit weight training. Cytomax never fails to alleviate the lactic acid build up from any and all of my workouts. I think it tastes great. These whiners are lucky they do not have to drink the swill that us older athletes had to drink back in the 70's & 80's when your only choice was Weider products or making your own shakes at home (which was the best option)

review/summary: New formula fails
review/text: I started using Cytomax back around 2001, and it was the most amazing sports drink I had ever had. Taste, performance, ease of use; it had it all. I read the reviews here discussing a formula change, and went ahead and gave it a shot. I'm halfway through my newest container, and it's just not working. The taste is subtly off, and viscosity/texture of it is subtly off as well. Finally, and I have no way of explaining this at all, I think it actually gives me a light headache when I'm drinking it. Performance-wise, I think it generally still works, in that it provides some calories and hydration for longer workouts. But I don't like drinking it. All said, I will never buy it again. I will test out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054S4HMK">Accelerade Lemon Lime 60 servings</a> and hammer products, etc, and see which one is the best, and go with that. New formula fails.

So instead of feeling just sore, I feel more loose.  I drink one shake about 15 minutes before my workout and this stuff just gives me the fuel to keep me going.  I highly recommend this product.  I bought the 4.5 lb container and it lasts a long time.  Just one scoop (scooper provided) is all you need.  The orange flavor is great too, my kids (5 and 3) always want a sip before I drink it down.

review/text: This product did not work for me. I live in New Orleans and purchased this product with the intent of increasing my electrolyte intake during/following my Crossfit workouts. We workout in a renovated warehouse w/o AC, so it's hot and I lose TONS of liquid/electrolytes daily.<br /><br />I think that there are a few reasons that this product did not work for me.<br />1) I was using it for Crossfit, not bike riding. The advertisement of this product mainly states that it's for riders.<br />2) I eat about 90% paleo. There is simply way too much sugar in this product for my body. It literally made me exhausted because my body was spending so much energy digesting the sugar.<br /><br />So, I am not sure whether or not this is a good product. I have friends who love it who ride for triathlons and Iron Man events. A few of them use a more natural product called Nun (noon: not sure of the correct spelling), which they say is amazing. All I can tell you is that if you're like me and don't take in a lot of processed sugar...ever... this will send your body out of whack.

review/summary: Tastes great?  Really?
review/text: OK, let's start with the most important aspect of a performance drink - does it do what it advertises to do.  For me, the answer is a resounding YES.  Cytomax does everything the marketing department says it does for beating the burn and fast recovery.  I've been using this stuff off and on since the product came out, first discovering it in a local bike shop.  Once in a while, I tried another brand because of their marketing or the advice of a cyclist/athlete.  Every time, I came back to Cytomax; it's the only one that seems to do the job (for me).  The one disagreement I have with the other reviewers, and this is a matter of personal preferences, is that it does not "taste great".  Not even close to great.  Orange?  Really?  Whatever.  Tangy?  Pffft.  To me, it tastes like a flat diet soda. If that sounds appealing to you, dive in.  I mix it with green tea instead of water, my version of an Arnold Palmer, and it is reasonably presentable to the palate.  Use Luzianne Green Tea and you get the added benefit of antioxidants.  Yep, Amazon has it.  The 1.5lb Cytomax container provides 27 servings, or about 9 rides, so you may need to buy more than one.  Additionally, if you live in a humid locale, like I do, it has a short shelf-life once opened, turning quickly into a big rock.  Buy a size that will get you through a month.  You might pay a little more for three 1.5lb containers, but that's better than throwing away half of a 4.5lb because it soaked up all that moisture and is now useless.  Yep, I've been there.  Grrr.  Get the big bottle if you are an animal, share with others, or live in Colorado.  Where it's dry.  Now go ride!

review/summary: Tastes nasty
review/text: I am a 37 year old male who exercises avidly (6 days a week, both cardio and weight lifting).<br /><br />My review is based on the Tropical Fruit flavor. It tastes nothing like fruit or fruit punch. The only way I could describe this horrible flavor is if you took pink hand soap, diluted it tremendously and then dumped in a bunch of sweetener. That and it has an equally nasty mediciney aftertaste.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I have not tried any of the other flavors (and I have heard that the Tangy Orange is better). But I do not plan to try them for a few reasons. One, the workers at my local vitamin store said they don't sell much Cyto Max. Two, my experience with the product (flavor aside) was that it didn't hydrate me any better than water, nor did I notice any significant improvement in energy, power, endurance, or recovery. Three, the label makes the dubious claim that it reduces soreness by reducing lactic acid (when science has known for quite some time that lactic acid has nothing whatsoever to do with muscle fatigue). And four, this stuff is 90 calories per serving, and you will likely drink more than one serving per workout. For those trying to burn fat, this means you will be getting your energy from the drink, rather than stored fat.<br /><br />I am still searching for a better tasting and lower calorie sports drink.  Ultima and Accelerade both look promising. But I'm done with Cyto Max.

review/summary: Colored with insect soup! Carmine!
review/text: GREAT just dandy Frickin' Cytomax uses carmine as a color additive. Here's how carmine is made:<br /><br />To prepare carmine, the powdered scale INSECT BODIES are boiled in ammonia or a sodium carbonate solution, the insoluble matter is removed by filtering, and alum is added to the clear salt solution of carminic acid to precipitate the red aluminium salt, called "carmine lake" or "crimson lake."<br /><br />Carmine is insect soup. Yummy!<br /><br />For crying out loud Cytomax. take the danged bugs out of your mix!<br /><br />And AMAZON posts what appears to be a list of ingredients that does not list carmine.<br /><br />Cytomax, most of us are adults and aren't overly concerned with color of our drink. We are not children squawking about the color of our kool-aid being off and refusing to drink it.<br /><br />If I had one complaint about Cytomax, besides the bug soup, it would be the color is ridiculous! Who needs such a fluorescent orange color to drink it! It goes is an opaque bottle anyway...who really looks at it.<br /><br />Cytomax is another company that has over thought the entire deal and basically ruined an other wise great product.<br /><br />Sending mine back.<br /><br />W

review/summary: Engineered for Runners, Cyclists and Athletes of all types...
review/text: As a distance runner, I have been a dedicated user of Cytomax since 1994. It's smooth, tastes great and delivers an even dose of the right blend of carbohydrates to help sustain energy levels. More importantly, it doesn't leave me with a "sugar crash" the way that some other popular name brands do.<br /><br />The effect of Cytomax and reduction of perceived exertion/lactic acid buildup is evident anytime; however, it is most pronounced during summertime, when the body is working harder during longer training sessions. I would recommend following the product's directions to consume this before, during and after the training periods to obtain maximum effect.<br /><br />Before the advent of the Internet and E-Commerce, I had tried others that were popular and commercially available, when I could not obtain Cytomax. Even recently, I obtained a sample of the EAS equivalent, which was highly touted. The bottom line is that all else pales in comparison to this product.

review/summary: Bring Back the Old Formula
review/text: New Coke?...seems the Cytosport folks are going to have to learn this lesson the hard way.  I'll not purchase Cytomax again until they return to the old formula or at least improve the "new" one as it currently tastes terrible.

review/summary: Cytomax, a runners best friend.
review/text: I have been using Cytomax regularly for about six years now.  I cannot preach the benefits of this product enough.  It really does beat the burn.  The percieved exertion levels, the lowering of lactic acid levels in muscle and the subsequent enhanced recovery are all truly part of the package.  I frequently use it before bed when I know I will only have a limited time to sleep (i.e. 3-5 hrs) and have found that I will have deep restful sleep and awake feeling invigorated.  It is also a handy hangover drink according to some of my past roomates.  I have been encouraging other fellow runners, triathletes, cyclist, backpackers, mountaineers, etc to try the product and have recieved similiar feedback.  Many nice climbing/outdoor gear shops have the individual packets available if you wanted to demo the product.

review/summary: Bring back Cytomax Classic!!!
review/text: Remember when Coke came out with their new formula. It was a disaster for them. The company finally relented and brought back the original formula after losing significant market share. This is the same situation. I have been using this drink for years (Cool Citrus and Tropical Fruit) and I have been very happy with it. I am even subscribed to these mixes through Amazon's subscription program. I am ending those subscriptions and I'm not getting this stuff anymore. I recently received 4.5 pounds of Cool Citrus through the subscription program and didn't know that they changed the formula until I went on my ride and took my first few sips -- YUK!!! An excellent description another reviewer used to describe this stuff. The graphics on the packaging has changed with a small caption "Now with Stevia". I mixed 2 scoops with 24 ounces of water just like I used to except now this stuff with Stevia tastes like a rotten grapefruit. Maybe I'm mixing it too strong, but this is the amount stated on the label. I don't know the reason the old formula was abandoned. Did it contain potentially banned substances or dangerous ingredients? I hope not, but I know I can't stand the new formula. I would give the old formula 5 stars, but this stuff isn't worthy.

review/text: I have been drinking the former formula for years and I loved it.  Now the new stuff tastes like crap.  I ordered 4 large containers and will return all of them, it is the worst tasting stuff ever.  Bring back the old formula.

review/summary: Not an improvement
review/text: I'm not sure when Cytomax changed their formula, but in regards to taste it was a huge step backwards. The old Tangy Orange was smooth and satisfying with no aftertaste. The newer version leaves a sharp aftertaste in the back of the throat long after is is consumed. Not sure if the addition of Stevia is the cause. I just can't drink it like I used to and now choke it down like all the other nasty sports drinks that are so common. Also the addition of caffeine to Tangy Orange was a surprise. I don't like to consume added stimulants as they just don't work for me and lead to GI distress on the trail. Also what's up with all the foam after shaking it up in the water bottle? Cytomax has been so good to me over the years and I'm disappointed that this version has become more unpalatable. I used to give Cytomax 5 stars, now just 2 stars.
