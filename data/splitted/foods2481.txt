review/summary: Great dry dog food!
review/text: Our dogs are fussy about the food they eat.  We finally have found a dry dog food<br />that they will go back to their bowls for.  They especially love the chicken chunks,<br />but they go back for the other pieces also.  I like not having to go to a special<br />store to get this food - great to order it online and have it delivered to my front<br />door.  Thank you Amazon for an amazing selection of products of all kinds!

review/summary: Great food for my Shih Tzus!
review/text: My dogs absolutely love this food. They are a toy, and Tea Cup Shih Tzu, and it's a good idea to mix a tiny drop of gravy into the food, for added moisture. It's very dry if you don't, but the food is something they actually EAT which is GREAT! They snack on it here and there, but gobble it down when I add some gravy to it. Don't add water or it'll get really soggy, really fast - where the gravy is harder to pentrate the food and goes down easier as they gobble away at it together.

review/summary: I have the pickiest Yorkie....
review/text: I have been through literally tons of different dog foods trying to find a dog food that my Yorkie likes.  I have never owned such a picky dog.  He does like this Dog Food.  He will eat the chicken pieces, but rarely eats the other pieces.  I am sure eventually he will get tired of this and I will be in the market for another brand. If I can get him to at least eat some or bits and pieces of this food, it's better than him not eating anything.  This dog food is kinda expensive in my opinion but worth it if my puppy will eat it.  :o)

review/summary: Cat food a dog wouldn't eat
review/text: I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called "cat" food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers. My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk. It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their "flavors" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is "good" food, I can't imagine the crud you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you! Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.

review/summary: Pretty good, but not the best
review/text: I consider myself a "coffee snob" (in a good way). I have a few gripes about this coffee, but overall, it is pretty good. When I opened the package, the espresso didn't have the good oily bean quality I wanted it to. The beans seemed a little old. Also, the quality of the crema wasn't as good as Starbucks espresso or Peet's. Again, the taste was good and these were both minor details.

review/text: Amazon sent expired item ( about 2 months)to me once. The coffee itself is good, have a dark, rich yet sour taste. Every package is good for one brew, made 64 oz of regular coffee ( BUNN). I bought this product mainly because the coffee is divided by pack, easy to use for restaurants/ office for each fresh batch. It also comes in vacuumed package, hence the box is small for easy storage. Beware, no filter included.

review/text: ...it is so good!  Whoa! was my first response when I first had some of this granola.  I already eat other Kashi cereals, so I knew when I saw this it was going to be good.  But I had no idea it would be this good.  It is now a daily requirement for me.  I had stopped eating granola cereal for a long time, but then Kashi put out this one and I figured I would take a shot and try it.  Well, I have already made my opinion clear.  I would almost guarantee you that if you buy a box, you are going to like it too.

review/summary: Kashi - Mountain Medley
review/text: I don't normally write reviews.  Infact, this is the first review I have written in the years that I have been shopping on this site, but I have to comment that this cereal just might be the best cereal I have ever had.  It also just might be one of my favorite foods.  It's that good!  At the time of this writing, Kashi is offering a free sample.  That's what convinced me.  I can't say enough about this stuff.  Just be on the cautious side, it does have 220 calories per 1/2 cup serving, so you might want to watch that you don't eat too much as hard as it might be.

Between my wife, myself and my 14 year old son, the 4 boxes were gone in a week. Delicious.  My wife was the biggest culprit using it for a midday snack.  I enjoyed it for breakfast and to answer the occasional 'sweet craving'.  Ready to re-order.

review/text: I LITERALLY just finished my first bowl of this cereal and was so satisfied that I came here to see how much it is in bulk. Now i'm writing a review; have to spread the word!<br /><br />It has a HINT... JUST A HINT of saltiness, but there's plenty of sweet to go around; perfectly balanced.<br />The raisins and cranberries are a bit chewy, they stick to your teeth a bit, but they come off as FRESH, and not garbage. (Just letting those with a fear of, or a dislike of "sticky" fruits...)<br /><br />I've had 2 other "flavors" of Kashi, and this is definitely the best without a doubt.<br />In my bowl, I cut up about 3/4 of a nicely ripened banana, mixed it up so that it all stuck and combined nice, and it was BEYOND amazing.<br /><br />These are smaller boxes (14 oz.) but the box has a weight to it. I can't complain, save for "WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WHEN IT RUNS OUT!?!"<br />--->Better believe i'll be back here buying in bulk.<br /><br />BUY THIS CEREAL IF YOU LIKE KASHI!

However, my brother got this sample in the mail and I'll admit, I stole it and ate it before he could see it.  It was soooo good!  Very sweet and awesome blend of flavors.<br /><br />The box is much smaller than a regular cereal box, which is kind of what I was expecting.  That's good though, because the serving size is small.  I was worried I'd have "too much" granola but this is an eatable amount for a household of 2... it won't go bad before we scarf it all up.  =)

All Natural, it starts with the Kashi seven whole grains & sesame blend and it's filled with cranberries, raisins, almonds, pecans and sunflower seeds and a little coconut.  Not just a few here and there but a LOT of fruit and nuts!!!!  All this goodness is mixed with a touch of golden honey and maple and then baked into crunchy whole grain clusters.  YES,  100% whole grain... 33g or more per serving.  PLUS 300mg of ALA Omega-3.<br /><br />I love 1/2 cup of this over yogurt, it is so good that way, but seriously you can eat it right out of your hand.  I take a little snack bag of this stuff for my kids everywhere we go.  I have turned on several people we know to this and they love it too!!!  Rock on Kashi!!!!  Good eats  ;) Kashi-Mountain Medley Granola Cereal, 2lb Box

review/text: The products are ok, but my experience with the people who work at Flying Noodle is what truly turned me off. I would rather deal with local people who are honest and who can't hide behind their online anonymity. It's too bad, because there are so many Good internet companies out there. If you want more details, just ask me personally.

review/text: I've been buying Flying Noodle gift packs to send to my US family members for years and they consistently get high marks from my family. They are particularly good for busy, working parents who welcome an easy meal option via the Pasta Clubs. I have had consistently good service from the company -- although I wish I could use my overseas credit card directly off their store! But you can buy them via Amazon, so that's OK.

review/summary: Tasty peppercorns for your tastebuds
review/text: This is the second time I have now ordered from this company (JR Mushrooms) and I am very pleased with their items. All the different peppercorns I have ordered have been nothing but outstanding. For Christmas this year I ordered 6 packages of peppercorns for my husband and mom. The taste of these peppercorns are great for salads and just about anything you want to add great flavor to. I highly recommend these to everyone who wants to spice up their foods. You will definitely not be disappointed. This company has excellent customer service to deal with and the items always arrive ahead of schedule. I will definitely be ordering from you for my future purchases. I am a very satisfied customer.

review/text: I really like the fact that the peppercorns arrived in a airtight bag. When I opened the bag the arroma was wonderful. This is the same type of black pepper you can buy at any grocery store but if you compare price per ounce; this definately is the better choice! Great product. I will be a return customer for these peppercorns in the future.

review/summary: It was worth the wait at this price...
review/text: If you've shopped around for the premium Tellicherry Peppercorns at all you'lll notice one thing about all of the vendors...this ain't no cheap McCormick peppercorns to buy...they all are real expensive, even the ones that look like deals are not when adding in the shipping cost they rip you for on most sites. I have to say that this company is far better priced than any I looked at for the quantity and price...at least this size was. Yes, You will wait longer than you think you should because this comes directly out of India via their slow-ass parcel post. I had forgotten about it when it came, and was pleasantly surprised when I opened it. Packaging kind of sucked, but held together with no leaks of any peppercorns.  And the product is what it says it is...the Premium Tellicherry Peppercorns that is desired by most pepper lovers...so go for it...then forget about it. If you really forget..then you'll eventually be surprised to get the package when it comes.<br />If you don't forget about it you're setting yourself up for a frustrating wait...so just order, have faith, and eventually it'll be on your dinner table when you least expect it. And you'll notice the flavor difference the first time you use it if you've never had this premium pepper before...

review/summary: Where's the chicken ?
review/text: I bought this stew a few days ago because I remebered how good it was when I was a kid, i.e, big chunks of chicken, big carrots and potatoes, and delicious flavor. Sadly this product has changed. There's barely any chicken, the potatoes are very small and sometimes black, and there's not many carrots. Is there a chicken and potato shortage that I don't know about or is Dinty Moore really cheap ?. Also some of the cans were dented, so I contacted Amazon and they sent me replacements, overnight express shipping(Amazon's customer service is the best!); this is before I tried the stew or I would have asked for a refund. Anyway, I am very disspointed and I will not buy this product again.

review/summary: My Cat's Favorite but Not Mine
review/text: One of my cats is a picky eater and this is the only wet food that she will willingly eat. One thing I do not like about this food is that if there are any bits left on the dish when it goes into the dishwasher, they turn into tiny, pale, stringy pieces that clog up the holes in the dishwasher's sprayer arm.<br /><br />I am also disappointed that Fancy Feast uses general meat by-products (it's not specifically chicken or turkey or beef...it could be a mixture of anything!) and they add cheap, synthetic vitamin K3 (menadione sodium bisulfite complex) to their food. They should be able to use higher quality ingredients with the way the Elegant Medleys line is priced. Because of this I am trying to find a new favorite for my cat.

I was pleased when I looked inside and saw my Matcha kit kats, but sadly they were melty. ;( I cannot blame this on Noriko,  since it IS the summer. A few hours in the freezer and they will be totally fine! These are absolutely delicious! Such a smooth texture, the right kind of sweet and the classic crunch of the wafer you enjoy from any kit-kat. These have to be my favorite guilty pleasure. I was also surprised that this seller included a couple of samples of her candy. What a nice gesture! I am pleased with my product, and I thank the seller for having these available so that I may enjoy a treat that is hard to come by!<br />'''''E'''''''''''

My 11yr. old Chocolate Lab's chew time on one of these bones is truly long enough...so much so that I can sit and watch her enjoy the chewing and see she is content afterwards. With "Prime Shipping" and "Subscribe and Save"...each shipment costs $1.65 per bone or $3.30 a package...from Amazon to our home.  That includes the tax.  There are 5 packages like you see in the picture, each containing 2 large bones for a total of 10 bones at $16.55.

review/summary: Excellent product!!! Bad source to purchase from!
review/text: I love the Zaaschila Guacamole Sauce! But I buy it from the local Wal-Mart for just less than two dollars per bottle! This merchant is WAY over priced! Outrageously overpriced, in fact!<br /><br />But make no mistake about it, this is a great Mexican style Guacamole sauce!

review/summary: Delicious cookies
review/text: These cookies are delicious and a healthier choice for older babies/toddlers. I must admit I eat them myself when I'm craving something sweet, I bought these years before my daughter was born :) The shape of them is ideal for small children as they can only bite off small pieces at a time, much less of a choking hazard than teething biscuits where half the cookie can go down their throat (almost had this happen with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ER6ZRG">Earth's Best Organic Teething Biscuits, Wheat, 4.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. )<br /><br />They are a little too hard for my 9 month old (though she likes to suck on them and bang them on the table), but broken into pieces and soaked in a little hemp milk she loves them.

review/text: My daughter loves these cookies (and so do I)!  They're organic and don't have all that sugar and hydrogenated oil, etc.  I can't find them in the grocery store anymore, so I thought I'd try Amazon.  Sure enough, they had them.  And they're cheaper, so I bought a whole case.

review/text: The product description says you will receive one each of the following flavors and then proceeds to list 18 flavors.

review/text: While this product states that you get guaranteed 16 flavors, I ordered 2 and there must have been some sort of mix up because I got essentially 16 hazelnuts and then a smattering of french vanilla and a few other flavors. There are many other better flavor sampler options.

review/summary: Exactly what you Expect
review/text: With this product there are no surprises.  These are the exact "sparkles" (they look almost like tiny, tiny squares of pink plastic that you might wrap an Easter basket in, only about 1/4 of the thickness) you see in Michael's or other craft stores.  They're cute, eatable and I think worth the price.

review/summary: Great for Diabetic Dogs
review/text: My dog has diabetes and this is about the only treat out there we can give her.  She loves them.  She is an American Eskimo, and they love to chew.  This gives her lots of things to chew on.  The bag has a resealable closure, but we put ours in a little plastic container anyway.  These are a little expensive but better on Amazon than anywhere.  Also, Amazon delivers stuff when it says, and my dog doesn't like waiting.  Or more to the point, I don't like my dog having to wait.

review/text: My dog actually liked these treats. I usually try and give away when she rejects new treats. I love the made in use. they smelled good and she eats them when I soak them in water a bit so they soften up. this is my second purchase and I bought 2 bags but was charged $28 for shipping! Outrageous. this is the second time Amazon has murdered me on shippping costs when I reordered an item. Although I like the USA treats be careful they dont soak you for the ship.  I am looking elsewhere now.

review/summary: dissapointed!
review/text: I was introduced to Giant Sunflower Seeds while on a fishing trip in Oregon. I liked how large they were, (and not too much salt). When I returned home they were hard to find. I went on line. I think I have ordered 3 times, may be 4. Each time the seeds get smaller, and smaller. The last I got in Jan. were no different than any number of others sell. I had written the Co. about this last year, got no response. What set off this writing is. Today I was going to reorder. The price for 6.5 oz. bags was $48.00. As I dug out my invoice from my Jan. order, I found they were $41.00 then. I am old but not stupid. I am sure I can settle for this product from many companies that advertise for some 25% less.

review/text: Excellent product for treating shrubs.<br />My Dwarf Alberta Spruce Trees are looking excellent.<br /><br />Just a couple of tips.<br />If you have someone that can help you then have them stand at your outdoor<br /> water supply to turn it on and off for you.<br />This way you can have the valve open on the Bug-B Gon Max before you turn your water supply on.<br />Im my humble opinion this method will keep unsafe pressure levels from building up in the dispenser.<br />When you are done spraying your section have your partner turn off the water supply before closing the valve on the dispenser.<br /><br />The second tip is make sure you turn your water supply up high when spraying.<br />If your water pressure is too weak the product will not leave the dispenser.<br /><br />These are just my opinions from my own experience using this product.
