review/text: This powdered cocoa peanut butter is really good and easy to mix with water. Wala you have creamy peanut butter. I add the water slowly so i can get it to the thickness i like. Very nice substitute for the fat loaded type. I get mine at Amazon. I have prime shipping so no tax and free shipping make this right up my alley.

review/text: Perfect for smoothies, and snacks. Low in calories and taste REALLY good. A must have in my opinion especially if you like to eat as healthy as possible. You cut out about 150 calories from a typical 2Tbsp serving of nut butter. And it has chocolate! Can't beat that!

review/summary: Hot Cereal that EVERYONE likes.
review/text: This is a really  nutritious hot cereal that everyone in my family will eat.  It's simple to prepare.  I make it in the slow cooker overnight.  I measure in the cereal, pinch of salt, and pour in boiling water, stir, and put the crock pot on the WARM setting, put on the lid, and go to bed!<br /><br />Next morning, hot cereal.  We serve it with milk and real maple syrup.  Not even the picky eaters turn up their noses for this breakfast.<br /><br />Amazon's prices for Bob's Red Mill products are the best I've found.  I store my extra bags in the freezer.  This cereal is also great added to homemade bread.

review/summary: Why is this dressing so hard to find?
review/text: Good Seasons Mild Italian dressing mix has always been my favorite salad dressing, but it is not available in some parts of the country, and that has always puzzled me. I live in Virginia, and I always check to see if a store carries the product, and I've never found it. Prior to purchasing a case through Amazon, I had to import it from New England stores, where they still offer the product. Mild Italian dressing does not overpower salads, but rather adds a delicious combination of sweet, sour, salt, and spicy to almost any salad type. It is a very versatile product that works well with typical green salads, garden salads, fruity salads, and salads with grilled meats or cheeses. You can also create an excellent dijon-style dressing by combining it with a teaspoon or two of dijon mustard, and the result is excellent on salads with spinach, eggs, or fruits such as mangoes and citrus.

Here's what happened; we ordered this 24 pack and paid the full price plus shipping. When the package arrived it contained only one packet not twenty-four. When we called about this the customer seviceperson stated that there was only one packet in stock. He ageed to credit us the cost of the product but refused to reverse the shipping charge. Apparently that amount is credited to my account against future puchases. Well you can more than likely keep this as we probably will make no further puchases from your company.

review/summary: Great product, but arrived in horrible condition...
review/text: I love Rice Dream and have been using it for a long time, but I DON'T recommend buying it this way.  Several cartons had a slow leak from the bottom and trying to figure out exactly which cartons were making the wet mess was difficult.  It turned out to be 4 of the 12 cartons, and since you have to refrigerate after the seal has been broken, I had to pour a third of my order down the drain.  Also, the little plastic pour spout/cap on the top of the carton had come off half of the cartons; I was able to hot-glue them back on, but that was very inconvenient.  I've NEVER gotten a leaking carton or faulty pour spout from the Rice Dream I buy at the grocery store, so in the future, I'll just have to make the long drive to the nearest store that carries this product.

review/summary: Very Happy With My Purchase
review/text: Started purchasing this as an alternative to organic milk due to the radiation from Fukushima showing up in US milk. It's very tasty, and to me it taste just like milk.<br /><br />With Amazon's "subscribe and save" I end-up saving a penny over buying the 64oz organic Rice dream container from my local grocer.  However with Amazon, I get better customer service and don't have to deal with the grumpy and at times unfriendly folks at the grocer. Being priced at $2.14 a quart, organic rice dream is also cheaper than organic milk which is about $3.59 a quart (32 oz) at Walmart.<br /><br />This particular rice dream is organic and for those who are concerned, it is also gluten free.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon sells this for exactly 8.45 cents per ounce. Walmart sells the 64oz for $3.24 = 5.06 cents per ounce.  I think it will be tough for Amazon to compete with traditional grocers on food.

review/summary: There are better tasting, healthier alternatives
review/text: I used Imagine Rice beverages for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. Enriched has extra nutrition and is organic.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products, including their Heart-Wise line of products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a known toxic long-chain fatty acid. The USA FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and does not allow it in infant formula. In addition, medical studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic to humans and animals in high enough amounts (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications at the end of this review. This is a highly controversial subject, but concerns can be based on genuine medical research and not simply superstition, gullibility or hysteria. The FDA still approves at this time PABA food containers for people and infants, but they are not allowed in Canada due to documented toxic effects; this (and a hundred other examples) shows that FDA approval is not always the last word in food safety!<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor. The least expensive canola free rice milk I have found is Whole Foods "365" brand, which is more watery than other brands but tastes fine. (Some of the Good Karma products on Amazon have canola listed as an ingredient, but I believe that is outdated information. The Good Karma website and the products themselves do not list canola as an ingredient at this time.) I use "365" for cooking because it is inexpensive, and Good Karma for drinking straight because of its rich milk flavor and texture. The Good Karma chocolate flavor is super delicious and is very sweet, but unfortunately contains cane sugar rather than rice-based sweeteners.<br /><br />Some Imagine products and all the Good Karma products are also organic and made from whole grain (that is, brown) rice. Some Imagine products and some Good Karma products (the chocolate drink) contain cane sugar, which is a high glycemic sweetener, rather than a rice-based sweetener. There may be some Imagine rice milk products that are canola free, you have to check the labels, and it changes with time.<br /><br />The same canola issues (and cane sugar considerations) also apply to the Imagine frozen desert products. Good Karma makes rice-based frozen deserts that are probably canola free.<br /><br />[Health effects in humans shown to result from, or statistically linked to (different than caused by), erucic acid (_not_ Canola oil) in various medical research papers, review articles, and toxicology textbooks, include decreasing red blood cell count and autism. In animal studies there are many more documented effects of erucic acid including heart lesions and distortions of mitochondria. These studies can easily be found in the medical literature. They do not prove that the amounts of canola oil consumed by people will cause health problems, and the FDA has ruled that oil containing not more than 2% erucic acid is safe for human consumption except for infants.]<br /><br />Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants by US FDA regulation. Check out this small sample of government and peer-reviewed medical journal articles documenting my statements, available online if you search for the titles.<br /><br />United States Legislation on Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil, Federal Department of Agriculture, 1985, article 184.1555, sections 3 and 4.<br />Growth Rate, Lipid Composition, Metabolism and Myocardial Lesions of Rats Fed Rapeseed Oils J.

review/summary: A taste of the Islands
review/text: Fabulous product! It is just like the Hurricane popcorn we while we lived in Hawaii. It has just the right amount of butter, mochi crunch, and nori. It is good that it does not come with the popcorn; I prefer making my own popcorn on the stove because I do not like microwave popcorn. I would have given 5 stars if it cost a little less. I will definitely order again.

review/text: These are perfect for anyone on sodium free or a low sodium diet. Quality with a rare attribute. They still taste good! The down side is and has nothing to do with the product is they are approximately $22.00 higher here then other websites selling them on the net. Google and see for yourself. To add insult to injury the Vendor is going to make you wait for a three four day processing before they ship them to you. DUH! I have Amazon Prime and love it and buy most items here but this is one I took a pass on as the seller is selling at an awful hefty price in comparison to other vendors. I found them elsewhere for $27.00 a case! Shame on you Liquid Nation you will never get any of my business. I RATED THIS PRODUCT A TWO STAR ONLY BECAUSE OF THE HORRIBLE VALUE AND DISGUSTINGLY OBSCENE COST! As far as the product itself goes it's a five star.

review/summary: Cereal's awesome but Amazon's stock is old
review/text: After Costco stopped carrying it & I couldnt find it in any stores nearby, I started looking online to order it. I found it on Amazon & ordered the 6-pack as part of the subscription deal. Delivery was prompt and the cereal tastes awesome as expected. However, it looks to me that Amazon's inventory is quite old. The expiration of the 6 boxes was only 3 months away. And, I cant return this to Amazon either. Only option is to try to finish this in 3 months - have it for breakfast,lunch & dinner I guess.<br /><br />Thats why I'm giving this 4 stars as opposed to the 5 stars the product deserves.

review/text: Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Multibran Cereal is absolutely the best there is.  It has full bodied flavor, crunch, and multiple health benefits from the flax, the whole grains, and the Omega 3s.  I have heart disease and the Omega 3s are essential for my health.  We eat this cereal frequently, using homemade yogurt instead of milk and adding seasonal fruit as a topping.  Yum!  Amazon's price is equally amazing, significantly lower than anything we can find in our area and, with Amazon Prime, it is a steal.  Five stars are not enough!

review/summary: Multibran, Multi-tasty
review/text: I have been enjoying Flax Plus for years and was delighted to find it available for Subscribe & Save. This is one of three cereals that I always keep on hand.<br /><br />What first attracted me to Flax Plus Multibran was its promise of fiber and omega-3.  What made me buy the second and subsequent boxes was its taste and. . . the fact that it stays crispy even in milk. I add dried cranberries or raisins. I see no sense in paying for added raisins when it is so much cheaper, not to mention tastier, to add my own dried fruit.<br /><br />Raisin Bran cannot even compete with the taste of Flax Plus Multibran cereal.

review/summary: Absolutely the best!
review/text: Imagine a healthy low calorie cereal that tastes as good as the more main stream cereals!  Ever since I switched to a low fat, high nutrient diet, Flax Plus has been the standard choice with which to start the day.  It's definitely great that Amazon stocks it in multipacks since quantities are usually difficult to find locally and usually at a significant markup.  I strongly recommend it for those that are trying to ease into a diet regimen.

review/summary: The BEST BEST BEST cereal !!!!!!
review/text: I simply love this cereal. I can't believe that I am buying a 'cereal' on Amazon.com at an unbeatable price! I used to buy this at Trader Joe's. If Amazon continues to stock it, I am buying it from Amazon!<br /><br />Individual prferences may vary - I personally don't eat any other cereal these days. I am totally hooked on this one. I eat it with TJ's plain soymilk. Ahh... that's heaven...unbeatable taste! I occassionally add banana, strawberies, peach or blueberries to make my kids eat it too. My kids eat it in regular milk though not soymilk.<br /><br />Once opened transfer this cereal in an airtight container to keep it's crunch and freshness. Don't let it become stale. If it becomes mushy, microwave it dry for few seconds.

review/text: This is a wonderfully healthy and tasty cereal and does not get soggy quickly. Since finding Flax Plus, this is my daily cereal. It is filling and nutritious. Since I only use this, I ordered from Amazon at a great price over what I was paying locally. The order came as promised. Unlike the earlier reviewer, my cereal is not stale or otherwise damaged. I'm pleased with the service, the price, the product.

review/summary: Love Flax
review/text: I love this cereal.  First found it at Costco in bulk but they don't carry it anymore; at least not at the one that I shop at.  I live in a very small town that also doesn't have it in the local grocery.  Was so excited when I found this at Amazon.  The first bite always tastes a little funny after eating more common cereals (you know how it is; whole food has a totally different taste than all the other junk) but after eating a bowl you don't want to go back to the common stuff.  It tastes great and makes me feel good to know I'm doing something healthy for my body.

review/text: Items came pretty beat up and the cereal boxes where damaged but the internal sealed packages where ok. Probably gonna be quite a few crumbs in there. The packaging wrap around the pack of six was quite dusty and I was worried that the items where outdated but still good for a few more months, enough for me to eat them in time before expiration date is met.

Do not purchase from Reiss Innovations.  Buy this product somewhere else.

review/text: It's a little to good tasting for me because I seemed to eat it all in two days even though I told myself to stop. I just couldn't. I had no self control at all because the taste was just over the top to good. They need to find a way to control peoples portions so this doesn't happen to others. Maybe some sort of time lock should be included so you could only get so much per day. Other than being way to good tasting it was fine though.

How clean are cardboard shipping boxes?  The box was taped on top to seal it but air, bugs could easily get through the unsealed edges.  The jelly beans were good and still tasted fresh but we were very disappointed in the packaging.

Fresh and tasty, perfect size for little hands, great texture. Love that it's organic with no additives whatsoever.  Perfect on-the-go snack, too.

Also out of stock currently, but much better price. Think I'll be subscribing to this item as soon as possible.
