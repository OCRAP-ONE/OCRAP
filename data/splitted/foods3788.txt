review/text: This bread is a terrible tasting bread.  I needed a yeast free bread because of my allergic reaction to it.  But upon my reading it, I saw that it has leaven in it. I ate it without this prior knowledge and had an allergic reaction.  This is not yeast free because it has leaven. Yeast is leaven. On top of that it's extremely grainy and tastes terrible. How do people eat this? Kinnikinnick has a yeast free tapioca bread that tastes loads better for anyone who cares.

review/summary: tasters choice individual sticks
review/text: I ordered these for my older sister in California. She has severe arthritis and can't get out much. She and her husband both just adore these individual packets. Each one is fresh when opened,  not like the coffee one gets in a jar. They do not always drink coffee. Apparently, they do not get stale because someone with arthritis did not close the lid tight enough. Contrary to the bottle variety, the granules melt instantly without too much effort. The taste is fresh, easy to prepare so they are ecstatic about the thing. I order these for them as some items are cost prohibitive for their medicine ridden budget.

review/summary: Big hit--small package
review/text: I buy Taster's Choice Decaf and regular instant coffee in the "stick-style" packages for both convenience and flavor.  Brewing a pot of coffee in the morning is my routine, so these little packets are supplemental for me and very convenient at home or away.  The coffee flavor disputes the notion that instant can't be good, and the individual sticks are always fresh, unlike jars of instant that have an "off" taste once the jar's been opened.  Frequently, in mid-afternoon, I will use half a decaf packet with half a regular packet for a mild pick-up, rather than take a full caffeine jolt.  (Closing the open end of a stick by twisting it will preserve the freshness for use at a later date.)  Initially, I had purchased the Taster's Choice stick packages at local supermarkets, but it's not always in stock when I need it.  Also, buying in bulk at Amazon reduces the cost.

review/text: Having recently been switched to Decaf by my doctor, I was looking forward to trying these at work. I have previously purchased the Taster's Choice regular coffee in this form and found it to be quite good.  However, this decaf is slightly bitter and really does not taste good.  I drink decaf Kuerig at home, so I know that decaf can be good; this one simply is not.

review/summary: Decent Coffee Fast
review/text: Convenience is the major perk of Nescafe's Taster's Choice Decaffeinated Gourmet Instant Coffee packets. The taste is good but can't be compared to that of brewed coffee.  Other flavors in the packet line are: original, Vanilla, Colombian, and Hazelnut.<br />My favorite of the bunch is Hazelnut.<br /><br />The small, individual packets are supposed to be mixed with 6 ounces of water. I prefer a larger cup of brew so I use two packages in a large cup or a packet and a half which is harder to judge.<br />At work I fill a large mug with hot water, add one packet of Nescafe instant and one package of powdered hot chocolate mix. That way I get my coffee flavor with the addition of chocolate, sweetener , and milk. It's my Saturday morning regimen and a nice pick me up.<br /><br />Using these small instant coffee packets daily would be more expensive than spooning out instant from a jar. For occasional use and to add a little variety in one's coffee routine, the Taster's Choice packets are a good option.  Though the box and packets are  green, I wouldn't label this an environmentally green product because of the extra packaging.<br />On the side of the package is a graphic  illustrating the roast intensity of the decaffeinated instant. The graphic indicates that this coffee is judged between light and medium.<br />A cup of decaf only has 2 to 5 mg of caffeine.

review/summary: pleasantly surprised
review/text: i've often used instant coffee in a jar since no one else in the house drinks it and making a pot regardless of the size is a bit of a hassle. jar coffee loses its robust-ness after a while, it sort of 'stales'. being this coffee comes in little single serve sleeves it is always fresh. and the flavor was surprising and when it hits the hot water it smells brewed, mmm good. i first tried it when i picked up a pack of 6 at my local target for only $1. so then i thought i'd see if i can get a better deal on amazon for larger quantity. i don't care for super strong starbuck kind of coffee so i make mine using about 10-12oz of water verses the recommended 8oz. but if you like yours more full bodied i don't think this coffee will disappoint. ps. DO NOT buy Superior's brand of instant decaf, even tho i prefer weaker coffee i had to use 4 of their individual packets to get even a slightly mild flavor, it was much cheaper than tasters choice and as we learn over and over again 'you get what you paid for'...  so now i'm back ordering the good stuff

review/summary: Delicious and Satisfying Jelly Beans...
review/text: I received my pouch as part of a birthday gift basket from my parents.  Problem is my birthday isn't until November 29th.  I just so happen to be home when the Amazon delivery arrived and opened the box expecting it to be my own order ... only to find delicious Jelly Beans!  Early Birthday present win!  Anyhow, onto the review!!<br /><br />Jelly Belly Jelly Beans are easily my favorite snack food on the planet.  These little beans come in a wide variety of flavors, 49 for this 2-pound pouch.  Flavors such as: Green Apple, Mango, Raspberry, Red Apple, Plum, Kiwi, Peach, Coconut ... and Wild Flavors like: Buttered Popcorn, Bubble Gum, Dr. Pepper, French Vanilla, Toasted Marshmallow.  The pouch has a guide telling you what each jelly bean flavor is, and looks like.  Often included with gift box / sampler varieties of Jelly Belly is a small card that tells you how to make flavor combos to enhance your Jelly Bean experience.  A prime example wouldbe  Very Cherry.  By itself it is a very rich - cherry flavor.  However take 1 cherry + 1 Dr. Pepper and you now have  Cherry Dr. Pepper flavor.<br /><br />* POUCH DESIGN *<br />The pouch itself is quite durable and does a decent job when put into a "standing" position, however I wouldn't trust it.  Once you start to devour the beans inside the package becomes less and less stable.  The great thing about this package design is that Jelly Belly saw this happening and included a resealable zipper inside the pouch.  This zipper seal is quite durable and passed my spill test; I sealed the pouch then turned it upside-down with all 2-lbs of beans in it over a bowl, then began to shake and try to break the seal.  No failure.<br /><br />* JELLY BEAN QUALITY *<br />Now for the main event, the Jelly Belly's themselves.  The jelly belly's I got were excellent quality as I am used to with the Jelly Belly brand.  There is no comparison between a Jelly Belly bean and a generic jelly bean you find in the supermarket.  Jelly Belly beans are richly flavored, with each flavored bean having a distinct flavor to it.  This isn't just some sugary bean you pop into your mouth and enjoy a sweet treat.  Each tiny bean is packed with flavor, and by having 49 distinct flavors (plus mix n' match combos) the variety makes each portion of jelly beans a flavorful adventure.<br /><br />I will admit that not all the Jelly Bean flavors are my favorite.  I am not a fan of Cappuccino, crushed pineapple, or Strawberry Daiquiri plus I'm mixed on others... But that is what will happen when you have 49 unique flavors.  I will list all the flavors at the end of the review as well as nutritional information in the "Comment" section associated with this review.<br /><br />** OVERALL I would give this product 4 stars.  While the jelly beans are outstanding and still continue to be my favorite snack food of all time, it is an expensive product.  This was purchased on sale for about $11 or $5.50/lb (11/14/2011).  In a way that's a pretty decent price for Jelly Belly beans per pound, even when compared to some of the warehouse stores out there, but still very expensive if you compare it to a simple 24oz tin of generic jelly beans at the local supermarket for $2.99.  Despite Jelly Belly beans having a high  "per pound" cost, they are worth the asking price in my opinion(I wouldn't pay more than around $7.99/lb though).  The quality is exceptional and the variety of flavors make Jelly Belly beans truly a Gourmet Treat.

review/summary: Mine didn't arrive in anything close to the packaging shown in pitcture!!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Jelly Bellies and tried ordering them from Amazon since I usually am very happy with my Amazon purchases.  Big mistake!!  They came in a plain white square box (which was unsealed and nothing close to the bag shown with the product listing).  Inside the box was an unsealed bag with what I assume were Jelly Bellies.  The bag was only twisted closed with the end tucked into the side to keep the candy from spilling out.  It was in no other way safely sealed - it didn't even have a twist tie closting the bag!  On top of the safety issues with a food product being unsafely packaged the Jelly Bellies were hard as a rock and just looked old and stale...I obviously didn't eat them and intend to return them to Amazon.  In addition there was no indication of the brand, flavors included, a list of ingredients or any other information (which I believe is a requirement of the FDA).<br />I definitely don't recommend anyone purchasing this product from Amazon!

When you taste a single Jelly Belly, you will be able to tell what it tastes like - pear, pineapple, coconut, apple, cotton candy, or any of the other 49 flavors.  Warning - they're addictive!

review/summary: Forty-Nine Flavors...not all likeable, though...
review/text: These Jelly Belly jellybeans come in a nice resealable stand-up pouch which lists the different jelly bean flavors on its back. There are plenty of jelly beans in this container - enough to last the casual jellybean eater at least a month or two. The inclusion of forty-nine different flavors in one bag really drives me to assign favorite and not-so-favorite flavors: some of these beans are too wacky and taste strange while others [particularly the fruit-flavored beans in my opinion] are excellent. Each jellybean is brightly-colored and easy to tell apart from its peers, so you can theoretically hone in on a particular set of flavors as you whittle down the contents of this bag.<br /><br />Honestly, I would probably go for the "Superfruit Mix" or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IKG3S0">Jelly Belly Soda Pop Shoppe Jelly Beans, Assorted Flavors, 3.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> next time, only because of some of the oddball flavors included in this pouch. But everyone has their flavor preferences: you may enjoy some of the weirder flavors more than I did.

review/summary: Jar size (4 oz) should be listed on product
review/text: There's nothing wrong with Earth's Best baby foods if you're looking specifically for a wide variety of organic foods and are willing to pay more for that option. However, if you're looking for the best deal monetarily, Earth's Best is rarely the best option. When I saw this large package deal on amazon and looked at the weight listed (11.1 lbs), I did some math and thought I'd be getting 6 oz jars, putting these on the pricey end, but reasonable enough. However, the package I received -- two flats of 12 4 oz. jars of baby food -- had each flat labeled 3 lbs. I'm not sure how two 3 lb. flats become 11.1 lbs, but the result is that I ended up with far less baby food than the weight implied.<br /><br />If you're a regular Earth's Best user and are willing to shell out the extra money for organic baby food to be delivered to your door, this is probably a fine product for you. If you're a mom like me who's looking for ways to cut costs, this isn't one of them.

review/summary: Okay but not Cake Mate
review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

Only gripes: the "partially-hydrogenated" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.

review/text: Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/text: I've used Steviva for over four years now.  It has brought sanity to my life when I am not allowed to eat 'any' sugar products.  Most sweetners claim 'no sugar' yet they have dextrose which is sugar.  Stevivia is a pure, non sugar sweetner.  Don't fall for the other scams. I recommend this product to my clients.  Never have I heard a complaint.  At first it might seem bitter, so start lightly and add as you adjust your tastes.  Sugar controls our lives so moving away from this powerful agent is a process, not overnight!

review/text: I had squid ink pasta at a NOLA restaurant and was blown away by the presentation of a jet black pasta. I had a gift card to use and got this. It is a HUGE quantity, but I think I'll be able to use it in a timely fashion. It has a slight sea smell that for me disappeared when mixed with fresh pasta dough. My brother-in-law said he could still smell it though, very faintly, so if you have an aversion to the smell of seafood this may not be for you. I'm looking to give a unique look to things other than pasta such as rice, pizza dough, bread maybe. Anyway, I am very, very satisfied with the excellent quality, and of course going through amazon was easy.

review/summary: REAL Vermont Maple Syrup - tasty dark amber style!
review/text: Tho the picture shows "pure maple syrup" on the bottle, the jugs that you get DO say "Vermont Maple Syrup." This Butternut Mountain Farm Pure Maple Syrup is made in Vermont, USA, and is the finest quality! It is Grade A dark amber, which is tastier and has a deeper maple flavor than the lighter Grade A's, but it is NOT strong like the Grade B is. In fact, its JUST RIGHT, whether you use it on hot cereal, hot cakes, waffles, ice cream, or whatever. This is a pint jug and it goes pretty fast around our house, so you might want to buy a couple!

But don't worry-you will come up with new and inventive ways to use the extra so not a drop goes to waste!

review/summary: Don't be fooled- this stuff is good.
review/text: I have a Savannah kitten who's nearly five months old, and she needs to be on a grain-free diet since she's closer to her wild ancestors than most domestic cats. She eats this twice a day along with Nature's Variety's dry cat food, and we have never had a problem! I tried giving her other grain-free canned cat foods and they nearly always resulted in... explosive situations. A friend of mine has a degree in animal nutrition, and this brand was her top pick- if you look through the food, you can find individual veggies (peas, pieces of pumpkin, etc.). Subjecting your cat to eating Friskies or Fancy Feast over this is like switching a human to a diet of hot dogs, pieces of white bread, and that lunchmeat with the olive and macaroni pieces embedded in it. The other reviewers are severely mistaken :/

review/summary: Instinct Food Saved My Cats Life
review/text: I've been feeding this to my 8 year old male cat twice per day for about 3 years now. He was having severe problems with urinary track blockage off and on for most of his life. I read several reviews and Veterinary recommendations for cat foods. I tried the "raw" foods as well. He didn't like the "raw" (comes frozen) food. Since he has been on this food, he hasn't had any health problems. I recently began to add extra water to the food to ensure he gets plenty of fluids since he doesn't like to drink plain water.<br /><br />[Some symptoms of urinary track blockages are: frequent urination, small amounts of urine passed often, pain on urination, fear of using litter box due to fear of painful urination.] A blockage is a life threatening situation. Get your cat to a Vet immediately.<br /><br />His coat also gets raves from his Vet. Most cat foods have high amounts of grain. Grains are apparently a problem for cats. This food is approved as a complete diet.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: My kitten joined us when he was about 4 weeks old.  Ever since we switched him to solid foods, this is what he gets for canned food.  He is filling in nicely, and his coat is amazingly soft.  I did a lot of research before deciding what brand to give him, and this seemed like the best option.  Though he loves the chicken (I feed him 1/3 can twice a day)either room temperature or cold,  he won't eat the lamb unless it's been warmed up after being in the fridge.  Perhaps we will try different flavors in the future, but this is one of the cheaper flavors, and I know he likes it. Instinct also gives out coupons every once in a while.  I did try switching to another high quality brand to save a little money(Wellness Core is usually about 75cents cheaper), but his poop ended up being soft and smelly, so we've switched back.

review/summary: Cat food a dog wouldn't eat
review/text: I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called "cat" food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers. My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk. It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their "flavors" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is "good" food, I can't imagine the crap you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you! Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.

review/summary: Best brownies from a mix
review/text: The Pillsbury Fudge Supreme CHOCOLATE EXTREME Brownie Mix makes the very best brownies from a mix that I have tried. The brownies are dense and fudgy, with a lightly dry top and edges that make them easy to cut and easy to pick up and eat. This makes them better than the brownies made from the Ghiardelli's box mix which have an awesome flavor but tend to fall apart.

review/summary: Great After a Workout - But Not For Everyday Drink
review/text: Gatorade is manufactured by Quaker Oats which is a division Pepsi.  Heavily marketed and very popular, it is the official drink for the NFL, NBA and MLB and other major sports organization.  It is an engineered drink to help rehydrate and replenish fluid during heavy physical activities.<br /><br />This powdered form is a bit more hassle but a cheaper way of drinking Gatorade.  Just make sure you shake it enough.  The taste is also very similar to the bottled.<br /><br />I was introduced to Gatorade about 15 years ago when I played tennis with my cousin in Hawaii.  I loved it so much especially the taste that is not so sweet as compared to other drinks.  A very hot day and a ice cold Gatorade is just the perfect combination.  I really felt refreshed almost instantly that I thought it was short of a miracle product.<br /><br />Well, not that perfect.  Our family dentist warns us not to drink Gatorade on a casual basis.  Even worse than sodas when it comes to your the teeth.  He told me to Google it.  There is also a lot of sugar content.<br /><br />Great after a heavy workout but not your everyday drink.

review/text: I am not in love with the taste of Gatorade but I am not averse to it either,<br /><br />But I mainly drink this for effect. This drink is associated with athletes, but for those of us who DON'T take care of ourselves, it has its uses.<br /><br />Back when I drank--another story--if I had some of this before bed, I may have been tired the next day, but didn't feel like walking death--which I would have without hydrating with this.<br /><br />Hats off to me: two years and not a drop of booze. Which brings up the coffee and cigarettes, which a lot of us obsessive ex-guzzlers use as far more benign vices. These also dehydrate you. I am weening of the ciggies and cutting back on the java, but until that happens totally,  Gatorade mitigate the effects<br /><br />So the next time you think of that high school boys or girls varsity captain who you loved but never got the time of day from drinking this on the sidelines, just take comfort.<br /><br />Idiots like me use Gatorade too.

review/summary: i love these lentils
review/text: We eat lentils about once a week as they are one of the more nutritious foods in existence. I have fewer 'rejects' than with other brands and they cook up quickly nice and tender without turning to mush. I sautee my veggies first: all small dice: a couple of serranos (since we eat spicy--this is optional), a large onion, a couple of carrots, lots of celery, a whole garlic fist, tomatoes (I often just use a can of organic diced tomatoes, sometimes fire-roasted), sometimes leeks (although i put those in later or they will disappear) with whole cumin seed, oregano, turmeric and curry powder (I use the Simply Organic brand which I like the best after much exploration). Seasonings can vary. Coarse grind black pepper. A little trocomare or herbamare depending if I make my own stock, use prepackaged or just water. Sometimes add leftover chicken or lamb. After the veggies are quite sauteed add the liquid and lentils and bring to slow simmer. Do not let them boil hard but they need to slow simmer to cook. Hmmmm. I may need to go make some now. Especially delicious the second and third days. I add fresh parsley just as serving or sometimes serve over fresh spinach to just slightly cook it. Pita or cornbread goes well. My family enjoys different types of cheese as topping.<br /><br />I am on my third order of these and have yet to find a stone.<br /><br />Update: When I really did just go make these I realized that those unused to using bulk products may not know you need to sort through any product like this. I just pour them into a container and then have another container to slowly pour them into as I sort through them. My new shipment are the BEST lentils I have EVER used in about fifty years anywhere. Only had about ten discards (any lentil that I would not want to eat and I am very picky--broken, dirty, etc.)<br /><br />Also, I just read the instructions on the package which do not make clear that you need to sort through and then rinse the lentils before using. Do not salt any bean-type product until the end or they will be tough.<br /><br />I don't use recipes so I realize that my seasoning amounts are unclear. The only thing you need to add right away to the saute is if you use cumin seed. You can always add more of everything else later. If you want it spicier you can also add something like cayenne, even after serving. I forgot to mention that I sautee all my veggies in a bit of coconut oil for health reasons (it is the only stable oil). You do not taste this later and I finish it at the end of cooking with some good olive oil.<br /><br />When I mentioned the fist of garlic: this must be minced. I use a meat cleaver to smash the cloves to peal more easily and then fine dice. Wait ten more minutes to allow the allicin to develop DONT WAIT LONGER. Allicin is the anticarcinogenic property of garlic and must be exposed to oxygen to develop, but it will start to diminish after about fourteen minutes.<br /><br />OK--there is my novel on cooking lentils! Hope this is useful to someone.

review/summary: Comparison Review
review/text: I had previously bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PEZLCW">Pardina Lentils, Spanish Brown | 100% USA Grown | 5lbs | GMO Free (We Tell You What Field We Grew It In)</a> and loved it. When I finished the bag, I decided to order these instead  because the Eden Green Lentils are organic. I can now safely say that both products are amazing, and now I know the difference between green and brown lentils!<br /><br />Brown lentils kept their shape much better, and were a bit meatier. The green lentils are a bit thinner, flatter, and they are far easier to burst during cooking. Personally I found the brown to have a much better flavor too, the green lentils have this odd no-name flavor that this is hard to get rid of, even when using crazy amounts of spices/bullions/whichever. Healthwise, the green lentils are easily the winner; they have more vitamins and are of course organic. This brand of green lentils is also exceptionally clean, I don't think I saw any dirt at all in the box!<br /><br />When I eventually reorder, I think I am going to go with the Spanish Brown lentils purely from a taste stance. The Eden Organic are nice, but not for me. 5 stars all the same!

They are great to have on hand and make great leftovers.<br /><br />I saut&eacute; some onion, whole black peppers, carrots, and bay leaves. Then I rinse the lentils and add in a lot of water, bring to boil, then lower temp to low- medium. Let them cook about 45 to 60 minutes total until desired doneness. Sometimes I add pepperoni or ham. Ham is especially good.<br /><br />Anyways, these lentils are extremely good for you and make a filling meal.

Between that starting to play some recreational soccer once a week I've lost 40 lbs.<br /><br />I also stopped drinking soda and switched to the Sobe Lifewater 10 Cal and Vitamin Water ZERO.  This coincidentally also use either Purvia, or Truvia.  Both of these are just branded versions of the stevia extract.<br /><br />The taste of Truvia is very close to sugar.  There is a very very slight aftertaste.  The significant difference I have noticed is I don't have the lingering sweetness in my mouth that makes me want another, often unnecessary, cup of coffee or can of soda.

review/summary: Not the real deal.
review/text: I was delighted when I found another sweetener that seemed to be based on stevia and not aspartame or chlorine (clorinated sugar, that is, as in Splenda). But after I used up my first box, which was not the most enjoyable experience (had a bad aftertaste), I decided to boycott the stuff.<br /><br />The mix of erythritol and rebiana goes through a patented process that is controlled by the same big companies that manage aspartame. Some of it starts out with stevia but the same could be said of Splenda and sugar; the whole ends up being truly artificial in substance. Just say 'no'. Look for a stevia sweetener that consists of stevia, not some big company's invention.<br /><br />The stuff I'm using now is absolutely wonderful. It's called SweetLeaf.

In other words, you feel the sweetness on your taste buds after swallowing the coffee in your mouth not so much while it is in your mouth.<br /><br />Conclusion: Please buy a few and taste them before buying a lot. MAy be you may like it may be you wont.<br />  In my case I think I still have 280(more or less) packs to go. I have an Idea, join me for coffee guys:)

review/text: The only people who seem to like this are people who already have no problem and taste aversion to other artificial sweeteners. I bought this because I wanted to lay off the sugar, hoping since it was semi-"natural" it wouldn't taste as horrible as Splenda or anything else like that. Sadly this tastes like any other artificial sweetener. I can't describe it well but it reminds me of very bitter powdered sugar with a really bad aftertaste. It does not taste like regular sugar to me. I am really sensitive to the taste of artificial sweeteners and I can't even stomach diet pop. So if you're like me, don't buy this.

Truvia is a little pricey, so buying in bulk from Amazon helps with that. Highly recommended.

It was a real surprise when we found how good this product was, how it did not have any after-taste or artificial flavor. It sweetened like sugar without the calories and most of all, the product you use it in tasted like it was sweetened with sugar.  Also, you only need one packet as compared to two of the artifical sweeteners to get a perfect amount of sweetening. Highly recommend this as a "healthier" alternative to artifical sweeteners. As always, Amazon fulfilled its shipment and it arrived on time and it came to our house in perfect condition just as described.

I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia!

review/summary: love it
review/text: This was my 1st attempt to get off artificial sweeteners. I liked it! It takes as much as sweet n'low for each cup of coffee/tea(3 packs)..I should say it takes a little getting used to, it is less sweet that sweet n low(since natural sweet is less sweet anyhow) but you get used to it quite fast! and there's no aftertaste or anything like it. If you looking for something natural & with zero calories then you should give it a taste.

review/summary: Better than stevia from health-food store brand, just as good as splenda.
review/text: I tried stevia a long time ago, before it became "cool" and you could only get it at the health food store.  The after taste was too strong, so as much as I knew splenda was not good for me, I kept getting it because I did not want to sweeten things (mostly tea) with sugar and the after taste was just too much!  I decided to try truvia, figuring that maybe the after taste would be better, and I was right!  This is a great product.  I got it in a 9.8oz jar which is much more environmentally friendly as well.  I'll use up the splenda I have now, but I don't think I am going to be buying them again...

review/summary: Like drinking straight from a coconut
review/text: I love this coconut water!  I tried several other brands before trying this one; I like this one the best.  Because it has pulp, it is sweeter than the ones without.  This also means you have to chew the pulp since some of the pieces might be a bit uncomfortable to swallow.  This product does not have added sugar but it does have 10 grams of sugar per serving which is half of the can.  To me, it is just like the chilled coconuts I used to buy on the side of the road when I live in the carribean. (a coconut with a straw inserted in the top to get at the water inside)  A little taste of home!
