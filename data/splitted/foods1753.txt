review/summary: Ting Soda Review
review/text: I enjoyed this soda once before when I went to Jamaica.  It is very hard to find in United States, let alone in the state of Minnesota. The product sent tastes just like the Ting soda that is in Jamaica.  The only drawback to this product is the price you have to pay; 40+ dollars for 24 bottles.  For those who really enjoy the soda it may be worth paying the price, for others it may be steep.

review/summary: Ting good!  But even better in Jamaica!
review/text: I had this wonderful beverage when we honeymooned in Jamaica last year.  Wanted to surprise the wife for the first anniversary.  The bottles looked a little different than the ones in Jamaica and said they were made in CANADA!!!  Also, they didn't taste exactly as I remembered, but it could have been since they probably taste better on the beech and on vacation!

review/text: My husband and I had Ting in Tortola about 5 - 6 years ago. This wonderful restaurant had a drink that was Grey Goose and Ting with a twist of lime. What a refreshing drink. We bought some Ting at the grocery store there and had it plan, just as refreshing. Been searching for it in the US for awhile, with no luck until someone mentioned Amazon....bingo!

review/summary: Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna is The Best
review/text: I've been eating canned tuna for more than 40 years so that might make me an expert "consumer" of canned tuna. But seriously, when it comes to healthy eating, canned tuna has it all; rich in protein, low in fat and calories, and it's an excellent source of essential omega-3 fatty acids which help to lower blood pressure and cholesterol.<br /><br />But most of us only eat it as "tuna fish salad", with mayo and maybe some chopped celery, because most of us have been brought up on lower quality tuna that tastes "fishy" or simply looks dark and icky (that's a technical term by the way, used by discerning children for decades). I did the same; ate lesser brands of tuna reluctantly as a child, adding everything from cheese to pickles to onions to mask the flavor of the stinky tuna. And the tuna you get in the average deli in my neck of the woods, well it's also cheap and it's usually mixed with sugar to help cut the fishy flavor and bread crumbs to extend the volume.<br /><br />It wasn't until I was in my thirties that I decided to stop buying the less expensive brands and cuts of tuna and try something new, in hopes I would want to eat more tuna, and therefore eat healthier. I tried just about every brand and cut of canned tuna I could find in my local stores (in NY). And what I found was Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore (I prefer it packed in water) is the absolute best tasting tuna I could find. It's so good I can even eat it straight from the can, without doing anything to it!!<br /><br />Although I can eat it straight, I do prefer it with a little mayo as a sandwich. But when I do make "tuna salad" with Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna I don't have to add all sorts of things to mask the flavor of the fish, because there is no "fishy" ickiness to it. When I'm in a hurry or just want something easy to make, I simply add a little black pepper and maybe a little lemon juice, and some mayo. It's fantastic, never fails, the quality and taste is always consistent. But, if I'm in the mood for something with a little more kick I add diced fresh veggies and herbs, maybe even some diced cheese like I did when I was a kid. Either way, straight, with mayo, or all dressed up, this tuna is without a doubt the best. I even find it to be better than Bumble Bee's more expensive tuna in the pouch. No need to waste your money on that when this tuna is perfectly fine just as it is.<br /><br />Talking about money, you might notice the change in packages sizes in the last few years, for just about every product sold in the grocery stores these days. Used to be you had the choice of a 7 ounce can of tuna or the smaller single serve portion of about 3 ounces. Now most grocery stores don't offer the 7 ounce cans as the standard size. They offer the 5 ounce in place of it. All tuna's are now sold with 5 ounces being the standard can size, not just Bumble Bee. This is a trend throughout the food manufacturing industry, reducing the package size. But 7 ounce cans of tuna are not gone for good, not yet at least. You can still find them, and I have found, in my travels, the price per ounce for the 7 ounce can of Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna is often cheaper than the 5 ounce, when you can get it. So, I highly advise you shop around for the best price, and see if you can find the 7 ounce cans on sale. You'll find tips on this and other money saving advice on my blog. See my Amazon profile for details.<br /><br />PS) I've had the privilege to eat wild tuna caught and canned locally on the coast of Washington state, and it is awesome, but I didn't include a comparison to those tunas in this review because they're a local product, not something everyone can get (or can easily get) in a national grocery store or supermarket chains. But if I were to compare Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna to those fresh caught & canned tuna's, Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore ranks right up there with the ones I've tried.

review/text: Good flavor from a smaller crouton.<br /><br />I can't find any flaws - smaller size, good crunch and some real taste.<br /><br />If you want to know why I rated these croutons only 3 stars - it is because I have had better.<br /><br />I only wish I knew where better croutons were easily purchased on Amazon at a fair price.<br /><br />While I can certainly recommend these croutons, I hope someone on Amazon can recommend an even a better one. Post a comment!<br /><br />I really doubt anyone would be disappointed with these croutons although they may not be overwhelmed by the taste. I also like a larger crouton.<br /><br />In my opinion - this is a true 3 star product - which is to say good but not great

I am more then pleasantly surprised, I will have to try more from the ESP Emporium's store front.<br /><br />This tea was gentle, and yet flavorful; aromatic and just the right color. I followed the instructions that were printed on the label, and it turned out just right not too weak, and not bitter (which I had over-brewed tea).<br /><br />In conclusion whatever ESP emporium is doing they are doing it right.<br /><br />Btw the service is outstanding I never had such a prompt and pleasant reply.

Also, it's made from fair-traded coffee, and it's organic. The taste is a little unusual, with a hint of chocolate. It's naturally decaffeinated (no chemicals). For me, it's a keeper.

review/summary: Jelly Belly's are the Best
review/text: Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

review/text: These are very high quality, and especially good when you want to cut back on all the sugar that comes in the various fillings and milk chocolate found in their other varieties of squares. Very satisfying chocolate flavor without much regret. The photo at the time of this review shows one of the three flavors is Mint Bliss 60% Cacao, but my experience (and that of another reviewer as well) was that the mint flavor is replaced with Midnight Reverie 86% Cacao. The other two flavors are correct: Evening Dream 60% Cacao and Twilight Delight 72% Cacao. Still an excellent bag of chocolates, worth 5 stars, but I have to take off a star due to the misrepresentation, which has persisted for over a year.

review/text: I bought this assortment of Ghirardelli Intense Dark chocolate.  It's a combination of 60%, 72% and 86%--anything above 60% is recommended by nutritionists as being positive for health benefits. An ounce a day is great.  It's a non-guilty pleasure.  As a friend said, "Chocolate is a vegetable--it's a bean!"  These are not too bitter for my taste and silky and smooth.  I'm quite satisfied with a small amount after dinner as the flavor is intense and lasts.  This chocolate is an affordable, healthy and daily treat.

review/text: Do yourself a favor, and buy this syrup at your local Target for &lt;$4.00.<br />I buy these syrups from time to time- they taste great.<br />They are a bit thicker than other syrups I've used, but it's all good.<br /><br />If you look at the ingredients, you could almost think you could make them on your own.<br />It's essentially, water, and flavoring.<br />The non-sugar-free variety, sugar is the first ingredient, followed by "filtered water" and "natural and artificial flavor."<br /><br />Still a pretty good deal, for a person like me who only uses occasionally.<br />For $4, I mean.<br />Not the ridiculous $14! these are listed at.

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: This decaf espresso is really great.  The flavor is full bodied.  Does not have the watery taste of run of the milll decafs..<br />The aroma also compliments the full favor and tastes more like regular coffee that is made with fresh coffee beans. I have tried it now for over 2 years and have thoroughly enjoyed the bustello.

review/summary: tasty and quick to make
review/text: I have used this in protein powders to create a quick coffee drink flavor. I'll drink this for a quick cup on the go when I don't have time to brew some espresso. Takes time to grind beans, steam etc.  I use about 1tbs for a 16oz cup and its just about right for me. I normally can NOT stand instant coffee.  Weak in flavor and taste.  This isn't as good as a good cup of espresso, but when using a cheap at home espresso machine - this stuff is pretty comparable.  I'm not a big coffee drinker but when I do drink it, I feel it better be good, or I'm not going to bother.  I've also tried the starbucks VIA - and this stuff is just as good. Though when I got the bustello they did not have a decaf via. A warm cup of decaf is so soothing at night YUM

review/text: I like to take a cup of espresso out with me every morning. I was disappointed when the doctor said for me to cut out the caffeine.  This stuff is pretty good and is a good substitute if you are busy, single and take coffee only a cup at a time. Its quite expensive though and lasts only about 6 weeks for the large pack.

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: We've been drinking the instant Bustelo Decaf for a while and it's pretty good.  You have to remember one thing - it's instant coffee, so you can't expect it to taste "Exactly" like a freshly brewed espresso from a coffee shop.  That said, the flavor is good and we've drank it hot, iced, and mixed into a smoothie to give it a little coffee flavor - all methods worked really well.  The product dissolves really easily in either hot or cold water, so you can do a lot with it.  Just like anything, it's a matter of personal taste, but this is one of the few instant espressos we've purchased and actually enjoyed.

review/text: I was looking for instant coffee, because instant coffee is what I<br />normally drink, as it is easy to prepare.  I was looking for decaffinated coffee, because that's supposed to be better for your health.  I was looking for espresso coffee, because, so the legend goes, if you mix it with regular instant coffee, it will make the resulting cup of instant coffee taste like brewd coffee.<br /><br />I found all I wanted in Cafe Bustelo Decaffeinated Instant Espresso 97% Caffeine Free coffee.  All I wanted -- except TASTE!  This coffee is, to me at least, sort of bitter and syrupy in taste -- even when water is added.  FAR more bitter than the Medaglia D'Oro undecaffeinated espresso I usually buy.  Also a bit too strong.  Luckily, I also have on hand Instant Decaffeinated Taster's Choice Coffee, Instant Regular Maxweel House Coffee, Instant Decaffeinated Maxwell House Coffee, and other instant coffees, both decaffeinated and regular, that I have bought in the past year or so.  So -- I have mixed other instant coffees with the Cafe Bustelo Decaffeinated Instant Espresso 97% Caffein Free Coffee.  The strong, bitter taste of the Cafe Bustelo Decaffeinated still unhappily predominates -- but at least it's subdued, somewhat, by the other coffees, and I guess I can get through all four bottles.<br /><br />P.S.  The 3.5 ounce glass jar -- larger than other instant espresso coffee jars, and yet smaller than most regular instant coffee jars, however, will make a PERFECT carrying case for my pet betta fish, which has sadly developed some black spots on her otherwise pristine, pretty pink exteriour.  No, there are no air-holes for breathing in the instant-coffee's screw-on top....but if I leave three-quarters of the space free, and only add water for one-quarter of the area of the jar, there will be plenty of air for my sweet little fishy to breathe, during the 15 minute car-ride to the pet shop.<br /><br />I try hard to find at least SOME advantage in even the worst purchasing situation -- and seem to have found one here!

review/text: The Pumpkin Banana flavor, according to the response of our 7-month-old, is quite tasty!  She gobbled it up in no time at all.  Even though Plum puts lemon juice concentrate in this product (as they do all their products, and it is the last ingredient listed), my children have no aversion associated with the food, including this Pumpkin Banana product.  While it is not her favorite (the Spinach, Peas & Pears is), she does enjoy it and happily eats it when it's served.  Our extremely picky 3-1/2 year-old also enjoys the Pumpkin Banana flavor, and he is one tough cookie to please, so it must be decent!  We would definitely get it again.

Since she doesn't like them and I don't have a Keurig, they will be going to waste. The rest of the pack was mostly mint, with a couple of chamomile, green tea, and rooibos. If you are looking for good variety, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. If you don't mind your variety pack leaning heavily one way or another, this pack might be good for you.

review/summary: Our favourite REAL peanut butter
review/text: I have tried a number of peanut butters - I LOVE peanut butter.  I search the grocery store for peanut butter that is both affordable AND has one or (if I'm desperate) two ingredients: peanuts and if I must, salt.<br /><br />Krema peanut butter is our family's favourite.  It is a great peanut-ty taste.  Until we made the switch to natural, unadulterated peanut butter, I never thought that it tasted much like peanut butter.  I liked it, but it wasn't really peanut-ty.  Once you know what real peanut butter tastes like (and perhaps get used to the lack of sugar) the common stuff like Jif just tastes like nothing.<br /><br />Anyway, what I like most about the Krema peanut butter (we get smooth) is that we can stir it, refrigerate it and it still stays spreadable.  Most of the other peanut butters I tried required refrigeration but then would end up being hard and impossible to spread.  We make a lot of bread in our house so attempting to spread a cold solid on fresh bread is rather frustrating!<br /><br />I came here on Amazon to check prices, but it turns out that my local supermarket actually has a cheaper price for once!  Guess I'll keep shopping local.

review/summary: Quite good, and recommended
review/text: I've gone through several jars of this. First, it contains nothing but peanuts, but a "unique process" makes it semi-fluid. Yes, it has to be stirred. If you don't stir it, you'll have to drink the top half and chew the bottom. I keep mine in the fridge, and it's still not thick. That's okay with me. Next, the taste. Since this is a natural peanut butter with no added sugars, oils, salt, or other garbage, it doesn't taste like common Jif or Skippy, and that's for the good. But it's not the best tasting natural peanut butter I've ever had. Maybe it's just a matter of the variety of peanut they use. The price is good (though I've found it at a better price somewhere else). For the $, it's hard to beat. I'll probably buy more.

review/text: I work out in the hot sun and during the summer months I drink lots of water and in the past sports drinks. I try to watch what I eat and drink and have found sports drinks to loose their appeal after awhile. I think they have too much sugar in them and often leave me with heartburn. These coconut waters are much better that any sports drink! They have minerals and electrolytes that your body needs with natural sugars. When I drink a chilled coconut water I feel much better and more energized. I can keep working hard after feeling refreshed. They give me more energy than any sports drink ever could and they do not give me heartburn. They are a little pricey but with the subscribe and save program they are 15% off. Your health is your greatest reward! I Highly recommend these to anyone looking for a healthier and natural alternative for good hydration.<br /><br />I have tried the Zico brand as well which is a little more expensive and has a little different flavor and find they are both good. The Zico has a little more of a coconut taste while the O.N.E. has more of a younger coconut taste. They are very close however and I am now just buying the O.N.E. brand because it is a little less expensive. I find the taste delicious when your are thirsty!

review/text: I tried vitacoco in the past and was a bit turned off by the taste in a packaged product, but this came on sale so I gave it a go, boy was I surprised, just like the real thing!  I drink one a day now, no sugary aftertaste like gatorate or vitamin water which I used to drink, just clean and refreshing.

review/summary: Best electrolytes alternative to sport drinks.
review/text: I find this product taste great, and I feel this product is a great alternative to sport drinks.  I like the fact that this product is low in calories, then sport drinks, and that the taste is light enough to drink during my workouts. I would recommend this product to anyone that wish to replace high calorie drinks, and to add another tool to help themselves hydrate, and provide what the body needs to replace some of the electrolytes.  The tastes for some I have know to try this product is a love and hate kind of thing, but I wish to mention, for those that do not like the taste, I feel the benefits out way the way, how this product may taste.  I feel that this product has many healthily benefits, and I would recommend this product.

review/summary: O.N.E. Coconut Water
review/text: I was looking for something with less sugar than Gatorade and easy on my stomach when I rediscovered coconut water.  When I was little we lived in Brownsville, TX and had access to fresh coconuts.  I had almost forgotten the taste of coconut water and was very pleased to find it in such convenient packaging.  Plus, free shipping makes it a bargain.

review/summary: ONE coconut water
review/text: I had my doubts after reading all of the reviews. I had never tasted this brand coconut water before, only Vita Coco brand. There is a difference. I prefer Vita Coco over One brand by far. In general, coconut water is very light, crispy, and refreshing. It has a very mild taste that is good alone or could easily be mixed into a smoothie or with alcohol (rum, vodka, etc). It hydrates the body better than water or sports drinks. I used it when I was sick. It helped me feel better a lot faster. The buy one case, get one case of cashew juice deal free is a great bargain. The cashew juice was so good, I bought another case of One brand coconut water just for that reason. Pretty good for the lower price.

review/text: LIght, refreshing delicious, a perfect description for a cold coconut water.  We found it to be a perfect replacement for juices or soda on those afternoons when you are thirsty but want a touch of flavor rather than plain water.  To us, this coconut water delivered the same impact as a tropical juice without the heaviness and cloying sweetness.  We plan on trying it next mixed with a shot or two of rum.

The aroma of this is great, but at $2 average a drink, is there some way of reducing the cost and still preserving the flavor--e.g. smaller containers?  I don't think 11oz is needed to enjoy this.

The fact that it is a drink that is quite good for you is just icing on the cake (so to speak). I'd choose this over 95% of the unhealthy drinks out there based purely on taste.<br /><br />Also, regarding the texture: even though it is 100% coconut water, it has a bit of a milky appearance, and seems to have a small bit of fiber. That really doesn't bother me though; I like it!

Those few swallows of "coconut water" are so great...but it never occurred to me to wonder if you could buy it commercially.<br /><br />I just tried O.N.E. Coconut Water for the first time and -- in a nutshell -- it's exactly what I wanted.  It's the very same lightly sweet liquid you get out of a coconut!  (Without all the debris and dust that usually winds up in the glass)<br /><br />Love it!  Will buy it by the 12-pack from now on!

review/summary: Refreshing, light flavor. Expensive!
review/text: This "water" has a very, very light coconut flavor with a hint of sweetness. It is refreshing and doesn't leave an aftertaste like drinks with sugar. I like the fact that it has electrolytes, but they are really unnecessary for most people, in light of the fact that it takes a huge amount of exercise (like running a marathon) before one needs anything other than water to rehydrate. What I don't like is the number of calories, admittedly fewer than, say, an equal amount of soda or juice, but still more than I care to consume in a drink - and the price. I just can't see myself paying two bucks for a 12 oz. container when a glass of water from the tap (or just about any other drink I could choose) is much less. Or free!

review/summary: Coconut water
review/text: Coconut water is often used as a replacement for a sports drink. The biggest benefit of drinking coconut water over regular water is that is has a generous amount of potassium.  I have tried canned coconut water from the store and at best, found it to taste like...socks.<br /><br />However, after a 4 mile walk the other day, my thirst got to me and I grabbed this.  No sock taste. It tastes like real coconut water, no weird after taste.  Its very light, but I did feel replenished after drinking it. I would take along one or two if I was going to be biking all day.

review/text: As a brazilian I may say, this is the real thing, this is exactly how coconut water tastes directly from the tree.<br />Also, coconut water is low in fat and calories, has no cholesterol, and has a natural balance of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium- making it a healthy electrolyte drink.<br />Furthermore, coconut water is a healthy natural drink for summers. It keeps your body cool and maintains it proper and normal temperature. It is considered to be natural isotonic beverage and re-hydrates your body orally. It is also one of the best health drinks as after vigorous exercise it replenishes your body fluids.<br />It may also rejuvenates body cells by carrying oxygen and various essential nutrients, what can be beneficial in enhancing your body metabolism.<br />Coconut water improves your immune system and it is also helpful in controlling and reducing excess weight gain. Hence effective in weight loss.<br />It may efficiently cleanses your digestive tract and act as an effective natural detoxifying and anti-viral drink.<br />Besides rejuvenating your body it also maintains and balances your body pH and it is observed that it also enhances proper blood circulation.<br /><br />All of this in just one tetra pak, and thanks to O.N.E., it tastes like the real coconut water!<br />It is O.N.E. of a kind!!!

It has a very "off" taste.. not metallic - but, not pleasant.<br />Other people have mentioned that sometimes you can get a "good" case and sometimes you get a "bad" case - but, if that's the case, i think they should do a little quality control before the product is sent out!  I'm definetely going back to the Taste Nirvana brand - it is sweet tasting and is the best BY FAR!

review/summary: Why does O.N.E. have more sugar than Naked brand?
review/text: I bought some Naked coconut water from Whole Foods, loved it, and looked to Amazon to buy more. I read the reviews on O.N.E. and ordered a case. First off, I received a case that suspiciously did not have a USDA organic symbol that somehow is on the product image on amazon. Secondly, the product was way sweeter than Naked, which leads me to believe that they somehow add sugar to the product, because there can't be such a variation from one coconut water to another, if both claim to be all natural, blah, blah, blah. To be specific, O.N.E. has 3 more grams of sugar than Naked per 11.2 ounce serving. Because of the sugary taste, it makes the water less crisp and refreshing (and healthy) than Naked. Overall, feeling disenchanted and bamboozled by this purchase.

review/text: I ordered a case each of Vita Coco, Zico, Naked, and ONE.  I like my coconut water room temperature, which none of the manufacturers suggest as the optimal way to enjoy their products. Maybe this review will be useful to others that drink thinks at room temperature. I am comparing each of the four against actual fresh coconut water extracted out of a fresh young coconut, which I've been drinking for years.<br /><br />Here are my rankings:<br /><br />1. Vita Coco has the most natural flavor, with no off tastes, and a slightly sweet, nutty flavor.<br />2 (tie). Zico tastes slightly citrusuy and slighty "green" (like a green banana).<br />2 (tie). ONE ends on a slightly bitter note.<br />4. Naked has an off taste that I do not care for at all.<br /><br />I threw out all of the "Naked" boxes after my taste test.  Zico and ONE are drinkable, but both have flavors beyond the pure clean coconutty taste of Vita Coco.  I won't through the Zico or ONE out, but I'll drink all the Vita Coco first.

review/text: The water of tender coconut, technically the liquid endosperm, is the most nutritious wholesome beverage that the nature has provided for the people of the tropics to fight the sultry weather. It has a calorific value of 17.4 per 100 gm. the major constituents of coconut water are sugar and minerals along with some fat and nitrogenous substance. According to ayurveda-it is unctuous, sweet, promotes digestion and clears the urinary path.<br /><br />Coconut water is very effective in treating intestinal disturbances in infants. It kills intestinal worms.<br /><br />Coconut water acts as an oral rehydration medium in case of dehydration.<br /><br />External application of coconut prevents prickly heat and summer boils in body. It is also helpful in subsiding the rashes caused by small pox, chicken pox and measles etc. it helps in keeping the body cool.<br /><br />Coconut helps in keeping check over urinary infections. It is very effective in treating kidney and urethral stones. Coconut water is a significant urinary antiseptic that helps in eliminating the poison in case of mineral poisoning.<br /><br />Coconut water aids in absorption of drugs taken by you, making their peak concentration in the blood by their electrolytic effect.<br /><br />Presence of saline and albumen in coconut water makes it perfect drink for people suffering from cholera cases.<br /><br />Coconut water forms an excellent tonic for old and sick people who find it hard to digest solid and even semi-liquid foodstuff. Coconut water provides them various minerals and vitamins which they otherwise could not get. Coconut also helps in curing malnourished people by providing them the required doses of vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />Remember coconut water is a natural isotonic beverage with the same level of electrolytic balance as we have in our blood. It's a fluid of life.<br /><br />And as a brazilian I may say that only O.N.E.'s coconut water tastes like the real stuff!!!<br /><br />Thank's O.N.E.!!!! You're the best!!!

But it tastes fresh and was mildly enjoyable when poured over ice.  It's just not my thing at all, and as it's a wee bit expensive, it's unlikely I'll try it again.  But to its credit, I've got more coconut water-enthusiastic friends who swear by this and maintain it tastes just like its real, on-the-beach equivalent.  And it's loaded with potassium goodness.  I cannot fault any aspect of this product - it's just not my thing.

When they start the diet, they initially lose the excess water, which can affect potassium levels for the first week. This drink has loads of potassium and eliminates the problem for them.

review/text: I received the item well packaged and in good condition, marked to expire in 4 1/2 months. I have already had two packages to drink and I find it tasty and refreshing. I recycle the carton packages so I can confirm there was no mold. The item is marked as "gently pasteurized." I think it's also somewhat sweeter than VitaCoco which I've used in the past. Even so, the two are easily comparable. I happen to prefer the smaller packages because that's the amount I drink daily and I hate to keep the pacakge open since the water often goes bad.

review/summary: My Favorite Coconut Water
review/text: I've tried the Big Three (ONE, Vita Coco and Zico) and I've found ONE to have the best flavor... Zico is from concentrate and has "natural flavors", and Vita Coco adds Vitamin C... I just want straight un-altered/enhanced coconut water, and ONE is it!
