review/text: The Geek in me always hear's Patrick Stewart utter "Tea,Earl Grey, Hot" when I grab these cups. I was actually looking for REAL Earl Grey initially and ordered these instead.<br />Note to self: Yellow is DECAF! :)<br />I'm drinking it regardless and I must say, decaf has come a long way! This is a good tea for decaf. I fill my travel mug and it's still plenty strong but not too much so. "Die-Hard" tea drinkers will notice a bit of difference in the decaf, but the aroma and flavor still has the Earl Grey smoothness and appeal.

review/summary: Good for a quick cup of tea.
review/text: I often like a cup of Earl Grey tea in the afternoon. This gives me a decent cup of tea in less than 2 minutes. It is not quite as good as when I go through the full process with a kettle, but it is close enough that this is now how I get my afternoon tea

review/summary: The Step Between the Bags & Captain Picard's Way
review/text: I've tried this tea by the bag and it does tend to be milder than your average supermarket Tetley or Lipton. But I've been drinking Bigelow Green Tea that way for about a year and I wanted to revisit Earl Grey via a Keurig-clone machine I got for my birthday over the summer. After I went through a couple of "variety packs" I picked up an Ekobrew Refillable basket and started drinking expresso done that way for my morning coffee. I admit, using a Keurig machine is still a bit low tech compared to just asking for "Earl Grey, hot" in my best Patrick Stewart imitation (which isn't very good) but give Mr. Coffee 10-20 years and they'll come up with a voice-activated machine. After all, if I'd wanted to pay another c-note per month, the car I've been leasing since last year could have come with that technology.

review/text: I have been a tea drinker all of my life. When I bought my Keurig coffee maker I was delighted to learn that I could make tea also. At the time I needed to drink only Decaf and after trying a few different brands which are hard to find I ordered Twinings Decaf tea and was so happy to taste such a good cup of tea. It tasted so similar to the regular Twinings tea that you wouldn't it was decaf. I am a satisfied customer

review/text: I really love this tea, it's my favorite. I like the mildly sweet flavor, and it is a medium strength tea, not too weak and not too strong. I haven't tried the caffeinated version yet, but I hope to in the future. Unfortunately I have to rate this 4 stars as one of the boxes I received was filled with English Breakfast Tea instead of Earl Grey. This was probably a packing issue with the manufacturer as the box was correct (Twinings Earl Grey). I received a refund, but it was still inconvenient and I hope it doesn't happen again.

review/summary: Not my favorite k-cup Earl Grey
review/text: I like Earl Grey...at least I THINK I do as I have always enjoyed the Bergamot orange flavor/aroma of it. This product, however, leans too far in the direction of lemon for me...not enough orange (I like the combination of both.) I don't know if it is simply too much Bergamot for my taste, not enough black tea, or the k-cup is the wrong vehicle for this brand. Then again, maybe it IS the way it is supposed to taste and I have just been acclimated to other brands. I don't use sugar or honey, so it isn't that.<br /><br />Either way, I like the Bigelow brand better(or even the Celestial Seasonings which is further toward the orange side, not exactly Earl Grey-y, but still good.) Twinnings is a fine name in teas, but this particular product isn't MY preference.

review/text: My wife loves this tea. I tried a cup and I like it too, even though I'm a coffee drinker.<br /><br />The problem is, 5 out of every 6 K-Cups we've used have split open and spread the ground-up tea all over the place. It takes the fun out of having this type of coffee/tea maker if you have to clean it after every cup.<br /><br />We've bought these before, from a different source, and didn't have this problem. We're hoping this was just a bad batch. At any rate, if you buy these, be aware that you may have many cleanups in your future.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because the tea itself is so good.

review/summary: Good, but not one of my top-tier Bigelow favorites
review/text: I'm clearly in the minority here, as Darjeeling is not one of my favorite Bigelow varieties.  It is a good tea, and I enjoy drinking it, and I would never be unhappy if someone served it to me.  In fact, I do keep some in my house, and brew up a cup every couple weeks or so.  But Darjeeling isn't one of my top tier Bigelow favorites, and there are several others I drink more frequently.<br /><br />This is strictly a black tea (which is what I most prefer), without any additions, although when I do my teabag deep sniff (my favorite moment with any tea, right after I rip open a foil bag!) with Darjeeling, there is a hint of what is almost a lemon scent.  There is no lemon added to this tea, but it's interesting that the scent is there, particularly as another reviewer says this is the only tea he doesn't "have" to add lemon to.<br /><br />The flavor is quite good, but my main complaint is that it is weaker, or more mellow, than I prefer.  When I drink Darjeeling, I find myself wishing there was more of the flavor present.  It is often described as "rich" or "robust" but I think there are other straight black teas that better meet those terms.<br /><br />If you also find Darjeeling a little mellow for your tastes, I suggest you try the Bigelow English Breakfast (don't confuse this with the Bigelow English Teatime!) variety, which is also a straight black tea.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.

review/summary: Anyone will love this tea!
review/text: If you like tea as I do, you will really like this tea. This is not flavored or blended. Sure, I know it is "bag" tea and not "loose", and I know all about all the other things like the flush (harvest), the cut and such, but you don't have to be a tea "snob" to like this tea. I find that if I brew it with less than boiling water -around 190-200 degrees (just boil and wait a minute after pouring the water in the cup before adding the bag) and steep for 3 minutes, it comes out perfect. If I do want to sweeten it, I use orange blossom honey and it is great! Best of all, I didn't break the bank to get tea that I could enjoy. You can spend more, a lot more, and get "better", but I am perfectly happy with this because it is good tea, and at the rate I drink it, it is saving me a bunch of money. To me, that makes it taste even better!

review/text: As other reviewers have said, this tea is not quite as strong as other black teas. While I do enjoy a very strong cup of tea much of the time, when I'm looking for a mellower black tea with a rich flavor, this Darjeeling is one of the first I turn to. This tea doesn't tend to get much of the bitter flavor that some teas will have when it has steeped a bit longer than it should, and it generally just tastes great. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: No More Searching
review/text: Darjeeling tea used to be widely available at local supermarkets. However, as a plethora of tea varieties claimed shelf space in the tea section, Darjeeling has become increasingly difficult to find. As a dedicated Darjeeling fan, this became exasperating. Ordering my Darjeeling from Amazon eliminated my need to search out the store that carried my favorite flavor. Better yet, I get my favorite tea at a price lower than any local supermarket.  I am very pleased with the convenience and the low cost!

review/summary: too strong & bitter
review/text: I purchased this based on the good reviews I read from others.  I like a nice strong cup of coffee, but after drinking this I am now aware that there is a whole other level to "strong coffee"!  I know this may not sound too pleasant, but the only way I can describe the flavor is that it taste like the bottom of an ashtray.  No, I've never tasted an ashtray!  But if one could imagine what an ashtray taste like, it would be this coffee.  I know all those who gave this rave reviews probably want to shoot me, but I think it is only fair that anyone contemplating this magic extra bold coffee, needs to be prepared for possible disappointment.  Since we had a whole box to use up, we tried making it several ways - larger cup size, to help weaken it, flavors, extra cream & sugar...no matter what we did, we could not get that bitter flavor off our tongues! :(

It's full-bodied, extra bold in flavor, yet not bitter, and is perfect with a little chocolate syrup or chocolate stevia mixed in.  And the end result is I'm wide awake after just one cup of this fabulous flavor.

review/summary: Very Good, But Not the "Kick" I'm Looking For
review/text: There's no doubt that Green Mountain's Dark Magic K-cups make extremely good cups of coffee.  It's just that I don't think it packs that much of a punch.  The finest espresso K-cup I've tried so far is GM's Espresso Blend.  I like my extra dark coffee to have a little bitterness to it.  That quality makes me know that it's strong, and Espresso Blend has it.  Dark Magic is lacking that "something extra."  I think the word "sweet" in the product description is the culprit here.  Either way, I'd still recommend these to anybody, but Espresso Blend is the best espresso-like coffee to date.<br /><br />(Note:  I have 3 varieties that I've never tried coming in the mail:  Black Tiger, Double Black Diamond, and Revv.  It's highly possible that one of those could unseat Espresso Blend.  Can't wait to find out!)

review/summary: Perfect drink on a warm day!
review/text: I was very skeptical about buying this as I have never been a fan of any tea. I decided to give this a shot as I was looking for some new k-cups for my maker and for a new drink as I was getting tired for my packets of flavor added to water. After reading several review I made the purchase. I am very glad that I did! I make this over ice but have learned by trial and error to find the perfect combination of a 16 oz double walled cut filled to the brim with ice. From there I make it on the middle setting. Some people say you can use the pod twice for tea but I only like to use it once and I like the full flavor.  This is a great drink with a good amount of flavor and taste even if you ate not a tea drinker, it is not too sweet either which I like as well.

review/summary: Simply the BEST general-purpose seafood seasoning
review/text: I've been a cooking and fine foods enthusiast for several decades.  This is just an outstanding spice blend for most any type of seafood, the best I've ever found.  You can use it alone (as in under the broiler, with some butter and lemon), in soups, stews, seafood-oriented pasta dishes, or in tandem with other sauces.  This morning, I sprinkled some onto spreadable chevre on a toasted bagel with smoked salmon.  Fantastic !  The only bad thing about this product is when you run out !  It also has no sodium, but great flavor, which really gives the lie to the supposed need for all the killer doses of salt you find in so many products nowadays.<br /><br />The thing that really bugs me is how hard it is to find this item on the shelves anywhere.  So many places have huge racks of Spice Hunter products -- of which there are a great many to choose from, at premium prices -- but somehow THIS one never seems to make the cut.  Some Whole Foods locations had it -- briefly -- years ago.  I've asked Bristol Farms to add it to their stock, but I think they are phasing out of Spice Hunter entirely.  The one place I could find it semi-reliably was Erewhon in L.A., and even then they were usually down to the last couple jars.  Oh well . . .  this just joins a considerable list of great products you can only find online.  I suppose the much more reasonable price is adequate compensation for that.

review/summary: Great Taste! Easy Cooking! and it's HEALTHY too!! What's not to love?!
review/text: It is totally easy to use even if you're not the chef-like cook type. The sprinkler top has about the right sized and number of holes so you don't sprinkle too much or too little. There is no salt, MSG or other artificial junk in it, so what you're adding is healthy and flavorful. It adds ZERO calories, carbs or sodium to your food! The way I use this is to either make the fish in a frying pan or steamer. The seasoning works for both. Fast and easy after work meal: I just take a frozen fillet out, spray the fish and pan with non-stick olive oil spray (so no fat there), I sprinkle on the fish seasoning, and then fry both sides till done.  I  sometimes add a little "no salt", but it really doesn't need it.  That's it. It's delish! Fast & easy! Healthy! I have used it on: Tilapia, Orange Roughy, Flounder, Pollack, Swai, Catfish, & Cod. Loved it on all of them. I know folks also use it in marinades and sauces. I don't have experience to relate on that, but it is great just as is for a fast and easy seasoning and meal. Each bottle is about 4" tall by 1�" wide and one bottle lasted me a good long time even though I eat fish fairly regularly. I hope this helps you.

review/text: I seldom give five stars to products, but these are a delightful treat. It's basically an incredibly soft marshmallow, covered in chocolate, and dry coconut. The combination is surprising. They taste very good. Quite sweet, but I haven't it to be overly sweet like other British sweets. This will satisfy your sweet tooth. Of course you must be a fan of coconut and chocolate.

review/summary: my mother's favorite cookie
review/text: I have yet to try this product personally, because it is not currently available at our supermarket. But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/summary: No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts
review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

review/text: I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste. But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great.

review/text: First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda.<br />I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.

review/text: Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a "sweet" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/summary: Fab, as long as you understand what's in them!
review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

review/text: For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

review/text: I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!
