review/summary: you're cooking with Butter
review/text: Recently (I think it was their cookie show) ATK voted Lurpak as the #1 butter in their tasting. And unlike Rach Ray who doesn't think twice about recommending the most ludicrous ingredients that cost the most, I have tremendous respect for Chris Kimball because he actually knows what he's talking about.<br /><br />The taste of Lurpak is very similar to Land O' Lakes, which IMO is truly the standard of butter. I have only tried it a few times since I do not have any recipes that call for butter, but I wanted to try Lurpak since it was so highly recommended. On a piece of toast it is fine and it melts very well.<br /><br />It comes in a little block and it is extremely firm (the sign of all fine butter).<br /><br />I am not certain if I will purchase this again since I was not overly impressed with Lurpak and because Land O' Lakes comes packaged much nicer and is a lot less. Nevertheless, Lurpak is still a good butter to try and to use if you have any recipes that call for a high-fat content butter.<br /><br />Anyway I found this at Shop Rite (don't you dare buy this online unless you enjoy paying more than twice the price - it is stold at all grocery stores) for two ninety-nine for 8 ounces (which is the size of 2 Land O' Lakes sticks).<br /><br />Remember, you don't have to spend a lot to be a great cook.

review/summary: The Cure For Thick Hair
review/text: For those of you that are tired of using a handful of hair product to get your hair to stay in place, this is the product for you!<br /><br />I have always had thick hair and tried every product. With most products I have to put a handful in my hair to get it to stay in place. The only two products that have gotten my thick hair to spike up, with a pea sized amount, are this product and spiking glue. Between the two, this one is by far the more superior.<br /><br />With spiking glue, it's like putting glue in my hair so it goes into place and dries very hard. From there you can try to make it soften up, but it won't. With this product, it dries in place but can easily be made soft, without causing flaking. In fact, my hair has looked the healthiest it ever has while using this product.<br /><br />And the great part is that when you put it in your hair, you can easily manipulate your hair into any style without a blowdryer or reworking for 10 minutes.<br /><br />All together, I give it 5 stars.

review/text: If you decide that Lignans could be benificial to you this seems to be the easiest way to get them. I take them myself daily and will continue for the future. I began giving them to my wife after she was diagnosed with lung cancer and did chemo for a year without much success. It wasn't the only thing I gave her but she survived for 4 1/2 years. I wish that they would be more specific about how to take it. I mixed it in cereal for a long time but I thought it made the cereal taste different. One day I mixed it in orange juice and liked it much better.

review/summary: Amazing fresh flowers and lot's of them!
review/text: Ordered their 6 month Frequent Flower club subscription off of Amazon.  Wasn't sure what I was going to get but had some points I needed to use to I went ahead and ordered 6 months.  I was very impressed by the quantity and the quality of the flowers.  Each month I received a variety of flowers, two bouquets, sometimes two similar ones, sometimes they were different.  There were so many flowers I divided them up and made arrangements for the kitchen, the dining room table and even small arrangements in the bathrooms.  They're super fresh and come with several packets of preservative so as long as you change the water and cut them mine typically lasted at least 10 days looking super fresh.  This is my first month without them, I'm going to reorder another 6 months subscription because I really have missed them this month.  I'd highly recommend them!

review/summary: Kids Like It and NO antifreeze!
review/text: Jelly Belly syrups have a big advantage over some of the others that I've looked at.  Principally they don't use antifreeze as a sweetener.<br /><br />Instead the VERY BERRY syrup --which is made in the USA -- is made with high fructose corn syrup.  Other ingredients include: water, citric acid, natural and artificial flavor, xanthan gum, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, acesulfame potassium (which is an artificial sweetner sold under the brand names, Sunett and Sweet One), and FE&C Red-40.<br /><br />There are 15 calories per 1 tablespoon.<br /><br />As far as taste my kids loved it.  I thought there was a hint of cherry cough syrup taste, but apparently I'm the only one who thought so.<br /><br />Fun product.  It's got a safety tab over the top (like mustard and ketchup), plus a snap-cap which is absolutely excellent since it means the cap can't get lost!<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom and fur-mom

review/text: Definitely easier to prepare than the "Plentiful Pastry" cobbler - and with much better results.  Be sure to use enough butter, per the instructions, and this becomes a very buttery, sweet-tasting topping that rises up through the berries while baking.  It's not a "crumbly type" cobbler topping, but a solid dough-like one.  But it's not too thick or thin.  Preparation is extremely easy and everyone really liked the cobbler.  The instructions are clear and simple.  I've used it with both canned cherry mixtures and also berries.

Really, really good taste.  I appreciate that I can cook this rather quickly and my kids are very happy.  I have one that loves Kraft mac n cheese, one that loves the Rice a Roni Rice (4 cheese version), and one that loves Velveeta Shells and Cheese and one that loves this Knorr Pasta Sides (Alfredo).  So we rotate and they are all very happy.  (I personally say yucko to the Kraft mac n cheese (powder) and the velveeta; I want it homemade from scratch!;  but I really enjoy the Knorr Pasta Sides and the Rice A Roni rices.)  I haven't found a flavor of either of these products that I don't like.

review/text: I've had good luck with Lipton - aka Knorr - side dishes.<br /><br />Most are a bit bland but none have had any "off" tastes. That is quite an accomplishment for any prepared food. I have tried EVERY Lipton/Knorr side dish. None are bad nor are any stunning!<br /><br />This is one of my favorites. Add a healthy dose of cracked pepper after cooking and it really is tasty.<br /><br />It cooks fast, is very simple to prepare and you have a good sized SIDE dish for TWO - or a MEAL FOR ONE - or a small helping for FOUR.<br /><br />My three star rating may be a bit generous for a processed food. Still - I'd recommend this Lipton dish along with their Teriyaki Rice and their Stroganoff. These three are my favorites.

review/summary: Great source of "novel" protein and really, really tasty
review/text: The best I've found on the market.<br />And my very picky Australian Terrier loves it (well, with Australian roots it should not come as a surprise). The fat level is a little high for him, due to IBD he can't have more than 10% total dry matter fat content and this food has a minimum level of 8% and a maximum of 14%, so I mix it with a 6-10% fat food. He carefully picks out all of the other brand kibbles, puts them on the floor next to his bowl and eats the Kangaroo. So I have to ground up the other kibbles to a meal for him to eat it. Unfortunately the other food is not a novel protein, but this far he does good on this combination.<br /><br />When he was only 7 months old he got a bad infection and developed IBD. He lost weight from 14.5 lbs to 10.5 lbs and his poop loose as water we thought we were going to loose him. After diagnosis he's now on steroids and is getting a well managed food:<br />A combination of 2oz Kangaroo and Apple, 2oz of other low-fat kibble, 1oz canned pumpkin and 1oz of Addiction Venison or Brushtail canned food together with a tablespoon of Metamucil powder to increase the fiber content. Total dry matter fat content between 7-13% fat depending on the batches, I figure it evens out to around 10% (got extremely good response from Addiction when I requested information on max fat levels in their food). Two servings of this per day comes out to 500 kcal per day.<br /><br />A lot of work, I know, but it's worth it. A month later he's back to 14 lbs and is growing muscles and his stool is fine.

It has a very strange and unpleasant texture. It is not spongey or light. Besides the texture, the taste was also horrible.

review/summary: Perfect for Dunking!
review/text: Rich Tea biscuits are really not the most exciting or glamorous biscuits in the world, if "exciting" and "glamorous" are  even words that can be applied to biscuits at all. But they have one purpose in their un-glamorous existence, and that purpose is to stay together when dunked in very hot tea (with milk, of course) and to taste thoroughly delicious when devoured in that wobbly, floppy, milky-tea-sodden state. Basically, when you need a Rich Tea, you need a Rich Tea, and there is no other biscuit (that's "cookie" to most of you, I suppose) that will suffice. And when you need a Rich Tea, if it's not made by McVitie's, you really might as well forget about it. These are the dull, drab, boring, un-chocolate-covered, un-sexy, shy wallflowers of the biscuit tin, but dip 'em in a nice hot mug of English Breakfast and they are just incomparably  (if un-glamorously) delicious.<br /><br />I'm lucky in that I have a whole stash of the things my mother brought me over from the UK on her most recent visit, but that stash is dwindling already and I am very happy indeed that I can stock up via Amazon rather than having to wait until the next parental visit. Hmmm, this might just mean I can stop rationing the things out like it's WW2 or something and just munch my way merrily through half the pack with my cup of tea like I would back home!

review/summary: Great boost, taste not my favorite
review/text: Have used about 4 of these tablets and the boost of energy was so great I had to cut it down to 1/2 tablet instead and found that for myself that was a more desirable effect.  Was a bit too jittery with a whole tablet.  I will say that personally I do not care for the taste, but I also dislike sugar-free/artificially sweentend products as a whole.  But I dilute 1/2 tablet in a very small dixie cup and shoot it down quickly and that works great.  I bought this as a substitue for Red Bull and/or the Advocare Spark due to cost of these products - Eboost is a great alternative.

review/summary: Organic Five Spice Powder
review/text: I am a closet gourmet cook who likes to experiment with food and be creative in making interesting meals when friends come to visit or when I feel like spoiling my wife - which I do quite often I might add.<br /><br />I have not really gotten into oriental cooking but I keep seeing recipes using 5-spice and never had it myself. So, being adventuresome, I decided to see what my favorite on-line vendor, Amazon.com, had in their store. Because the wife and I are always concerned about junk ingredients in the foods we eat, I am always looking for organic foods and spices. One of the brands that Amazon.com carries is the Frontier brand. Frontier has both Organic and non-organic offerings, so if you ever buy this brand, make sure you are getting the organic variety. Just because it comes from Frontier doesn't mean you are getting the organic stuff. I do like the Frontier organic cinnamon which I buy also here on Amazon.com.<br /><br />That said, I wasn't sure I needed a whole pound of this stuff, but the price was the best I could find so I ordered it. When received, I split it into some empty herbal containers I have been saving and gave some to the kids and to some friends. A little goes a long ways so this pound could have lasted me for many years on my own.<br /><br />The flavor is interesting with cloves, anise, fennel and cinnamon as some of the more pronounced spices. It definitely is not for every kind of dish. I have found it works better in baking than it does with regular food. I have tried it on chicken and didn't care that much for it. But it worked great in some pumpkin muffins I made and also in an apple crisp. I will be experimenting a lot more to find just the right kinds of foods to use this with. But it does add an interesting twist to baked goods. And being organic, you can't go wrong in terms of your health.

review/summary: 3 Stars for Convenience - but expensive
review/text: I am a recovering scientist and lab rat so my thoughts on this product may be warped but here goes.  Splenda (sucralose + formulation aides) is approximately 8 times sweeter than plain sugar on a cup by cup basis. A cup of Splenda contains 96 calories. Table sugar as sold in the US contains 770 calories per cup. In the US a sweetener with less than 5 calories per teaspoon is allowed to be called zero calories.  Thus the normal Splenda formulation with 2 calories per teaspoon can be called zero calories and if you notice all the calorie information for splenda is based on a per teaspoon basis even if you are using a train hopper car amount to take advantage of the 2 calories per teaspoon equals 0 calories loophole. When you buy the Splenda Sugar blend formulation what do you get??? You get roughly 28 ounces of sugar and roughly 4.5 ounces of Splenda equivalent. Retail sugar goes for roughly 50 cents per pound so $1 for the sugar and retail Splenda probably 75 cents per ounce so in total retail value of the blend is $4.00-$4.50.  Therefore it must be assumed that the value of measuring sugar and Splenda separately is roughly $2-$3 per package.  As I said convenient but pricey.

review/summary: We Use Splenda Every Day
review/text: First, I want to say that Amazon's prices for Splenda are competitive with those in the supermarkets.<br /><br />Splenda is a staple at our house.  We like the taste of sweet things.  I drink it in hot tea all day.  I like sugar cane sugar too, but I need to cut calories.  With Splenda, I don't notice an aftertaste.<br /><br />We cook for cooking fun, eating pleasure, and recipe development; and we use Splenda.  This recipe is my sister Ruth's.  She gave it to me to use in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook.  When I finished the second edition, we went to our hometown and had a book signing for  Flavored with Love and also for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158851207X">Solomon's Porch: The Story of Ben and Rose</a>. We cooked a large amount of food because we knew this book signing was going to be a reunion.  When Ruth suggested making these, I said, "You expect me to take these simple little sugar free muffins --- we made them tiny -- to a book signing?"  Since my sister has won a few dozen cooking contests, I was expecting something complicated.  (Her husband was diabetic, and now she is.  She has become very conscious of the way she sweetens her food.)<br /><br />"You'll see," she said.  She used Splenda.  These little muffins stole the show!  People ate them fast and first.<br />--<br />Orange Muffins<br />2 cups self-rising flour<br />1 cup artificial granulated sweetener that is measured the same as sugar<br />1 cup orange juice<br />4 tablespoons margarine<br />2 eggs, beaten<br />2 teaspoons grated orange zest<br />Non-stick cooking spray<br /><br />Combine the flour and sweetener.  Add the orange juice, margarine, eggs, and orange zest.  Mix well.  Spray muffin tins with cooking spray.  Fill ' full.  Bake at 335� for 20-25 minutes.<br />--<br />When Paul and I developed the recipes for The Collard Patch we used Splenda throughout the book, because it tastes good, dissolves quickly, and saves calories.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy these muffins and find this review helpful.

This is not for those who must abstain from sugar! I don't exactly understand why one would need Splenda mixed with Sugar since Splenda alone does just fine and is what I consider a sugar substitute. So make sure you know that this contains real sugar.

review/summary: MORE calories per teaspoon than real sugar . . .
review/text: Splenda is the best-tasting artifical sweetener that I've tasted. So why give the Splenda blend only two stars? Two reasons: a recent article in the New Yorker revealed that some of the chemists who develop artificial sweeteners--at least, one who was interviewed for the story--won't eat them because they cannot predict the long-term effects, and they are apparently afraid that there will be unpleasant consequences. Not an unreasonable concern, given the checkered past of artificial sweeteners in general. Full disclosure: I eat Splenda (though not the Splenda blends) because I KNOW sugar is bad for me, whereas we still don't know if Splenda is bad or not. I'm taking a chance and I have to accept the consequences.<br /><br />That said, calorie-counting consumers who read labels know that when the company says "a half-cup [of the blended product] replaces a full cup of brown sugar," it applies to the calorie content, too. Which means that if you eat equal amounts of sugar and Splenda blend, you get more calories from the Splenda blend than you would from pure sugar. No kidding! Sugar has 15 calories per teaspoon, while the Splenda blends (white and brown) have 20 calories per teaspoon. Supposedly you can use less of the Splenda blend because it is "stronger" than sugar--but I can't tell it. I would just as soon have regular sugar if the Splenda blend has more calories, especially given the risks. Bottom line for me: Enjoy Splenda . . . but take it with a grain of salt.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: Pleased that it has more to offer nutritionally than regular pasta...a given. On top of that it tastes just like if not better than most brands of regular pasta. It is light-years better than other alternative pastas like whole wheat ones that taste like grainy globs of goo. My kids don't know the difference and I don't have to pretend that it tastes good, because it does. As far as the price, I always get mine cheaply at my grocery store. It is only a few cents more than other stuff so...as long as you're not buying it by the caseload-the few cents more is worth it for sure.<br />  Oh and all the smart pastas taste the same- a nice consistency.

review/summary: Nice to have a good tasting pasta choice with fiber
review/text: This pasta tastes similar to regular pasta but has nice fiber count, plus calcium and vitamin d. No one in my family ever says a word when I swap this in, and they are fussbudgets. The added fiber means that it satisfies for longer with less impact on blood sugars than traditional pastas. May need a little longer cook time than whatever you are used to. Looking for a Ronzoni angel hair, but have not yet found.

review/summary: Guilt-Free Pleasure
review/text: A hearty thank you to all the reviewers informing my purchase, made a few weeks back at this link from the vendor "Amazon Warehouse Deals," which, it seems, has sold out by now on this product. Rock-bottom price, unbeatable service. I second all the rave reviews on the Sweets & Beets for taste and nutrition, despite my foreboding prior to buying: I'd read the 3-star "Good & Stale" review (Too long on the shelf! These chips were stale!"). Whew. That could have happened to me. I feel for him/her, and count myself lucky on not getting hit with the same rotten deal. To the 4-star "Just a Tad Greasier Than I Would prefer" reviewer, perhaps I'd also like it lighter and drier, but who knows? Maybe the taste would suffer. To the 2-star "too salty" review, I'm mystified. The package claims 10 mg sodium, or 0% RDA of salt (per serving), and the contents passed my taste bud / lie-detector test. What on earth was dropped at your doorstep?<br /><br />To try to explain that--as well the pictured package here of crinkled chips, when I've never found them crinkled--I wrote the company. Here's their answer copied and pasted. Hope it helps.<br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Dear M. Bornstein,<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us regarding our Terra Chips Sweets & Beets. We apologize for the delay in our reply and appreciate your patience. We strive to maintain the highest quality products and your satisfaction is very important to us.<br /><br />Our Terra Sweets and Beets used to be "Krinkle Cut" a couple of years ago, however they are no longer this way.<br />The online retailer must have a previous label for the product (it does have the same UPC code).<br /><br />Regarding the sodium and salt flavor, the sodium is naturally occurring and we do not add salt to the product.

I had an open bag at work without a bag clip and the chips were still good after a couple of weeks. Satisfying probably a lot more good stuff for you than regular potato chips.

review/summary: Tasty But "TERRA-RISES" Those With Food Sensitivities!!
review/text: I got a great deal on these but it was clearly too good to be true. The taste is terrific -- very zingy but I had a strong negative allergic reaction to something in the chips. And that's where the mystery begins. Either it's the presence of canola oil (probably GMO) or some undocumented MSG -- or both. I would hope by now that the large corporate organic food companies would find a healthier oil and leave out anything that could cause health problems. I also have celiac disease so it may be some kind of wheat variant not listed on the package. Clearly this product could be a real winner but it only made me hyperventilate (even overnight), needlessly so. Maybe Terra should take a look at Kettle's old black bean tortilla chip recipe (which was phenomenal and so healthy) and then develop something along those lines. I would buy that in a nanosecond. The verdict? Savvy consumers should avoid this product -- I would recommend Plocky's chips instead!

The taste is mildly sweet and a better alternative to regular chips although there is 13 grams of fat. Keep in mind that the sodium is only 15 grams. I just hope the kids don't try them or they'll be gone even quicker. Great buy!

review/text: I am a big fan of Terra sweet potato chips for their nutrition and flavor, so I figured I would try the spiced chips. They aren't terrible, but something about the smell reminds me of body odor. I would imagine it is the cumin, so for some it might be an acquired taste.<br /><br />As for the packaging; They were delivered and left in the sun for a couple hours (we are currently having a 100+ heat wave) and 7/12 of the bags exploded in the box. I think Terra may put too much air in the bags.
