review/summary: AWESOME Natural...Alternative to what the Vet offered
review/text: My cat who I rescued almost 2 years ago, was having digestive issues. On her yearly visit to the Vet I mentioned that she was passing gas....PHEW  After a course of antibiotics and some Pro-Biotics, he said she had Inflammatory Bowl Disease. He wanted us to purchase a Deer or Duck dry food for her, it was 5 pounds, and cost $50.00! I said Oh no, I will cook for her for that price! Then I contacted Natural Balance and spoke with them in detail about her condition. They recommended this LID (limited ingredient) food. It took me some time to switch her over...since she was SUPER stubborn! I am proud to say I WON!!! She also has no bowl issues anymore, her coat is stunning, no runny poops...I could go on! Wonderful company, and awesome Natural food!!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XS6RJW">Natural Balance Dry Cat Food, Limited Ingredient Diet Green Pea and Duck Formula, 10 Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Tried many other holistic/natural brands.
review/text: I have two older male kittens, and I've had them since they were just 6 and 8 weeks old. They are not siblings. The one has had no problems with food, but other one has been dealing with horrid smelling chronic diarrhea for a while now. I've tried Castor and Pollux, Merrick's Grain-Free, and Solid Gold Katzenflocken. Finally I decided to give this one a try, and it has worked like a charm. No more yucky smelling, messy poos from Norman! His coat is now as lustrous as my other cat and my litter box stays much cleaner, and so does he.<br />My only wish is that it came in larger quantities than the 10lb bag, two growing 6 & 7 month old kittens eat A LOT and one bag has only been lasting me about 2.5 weeks!

review/summary: This Food Made My Cat Healthy
review/text: My vet told me my cat was probably allergic to his food, probably because of the grains. And the only way to stop his chronic diarrhea was to try new foods until I found one that he was not allergic to. In just a few days of feeding Natural Balance Green Pea and Duck Formula to him, his stomach problems vanished and he is healthy again. What more can I say? I will never stop feeding him this food.

review/summary: great limited ingreadient cat food
review/text: If your cats are recommend to be on a limited ingredient diet and they are used to a dry food, then this is a great food to put them on. The quality is good, my cats like it better than venison and green pea. My cats like it better than the canned verson. They are not used to canned food. Vets will recommend you used canned cat food. Cats have a way to deciding these things themselves.

review/text: My cats are not finicky eaters. They will eat most anything offered. However they would not touch this food. Even with introducing it slowly mixed with their regular food, they refused to eat at all. I had to dump it and go back to just their regular brand. Now I'm stuck with a pricey brand of cat food that won't be used.

review/summary: My cats won't eat this
review/text: I have two cats and neither will eat this food. I really wish they would because I've read that it's good for cats with allergies. Too bad because I'm running out of options. My cat has sores all over his skin and pukes a lot. The ZD prescription diet cat food is the only thing that has worked but the crappy ingredients in it cause the cats to become very lethargic and their coats become very dull. The ZD cat food has horrible ingredients as well.<br /><br />It would be nice to be able to find a cat food that the cats will eat, won't cause digestive or allergic reactions and won't require me to get a second job just to pay for the damn stuff.

review/summary: There must be better LID than this...
review/text: The first ingredient on my NB bag is Peas, followed by Duck, Pea Protein, and Canola Oil (Best By 20-May-2012). No wonder my cat's coat is so dull lately; she is taking too much protein from non-meat origin! I do not consider this "premium quality cat food" any more and I am changing her dry food to other LID brand.<br /><br />I now feel uneasy to buy a product that has several different versions of ingredients list. What is written on their website is different from what I see on the bag; the company's website lists "Pea, Duck, Duck Meal, and Pea Protein" as the first 4 ingredients. There is even a list on major pet supply store's websites with "Duck Meal" as a second ingredient and "Duck" itself is not on the list. What should I believe?

review/summary: Vet Recommended
review/text: Our Vet is very much into high quality nutrition for optimal health for our dogs and cats.  I used to be able to get Natural Balance at a store near us, but they closed. I didn't know until recently that Amazon sold pet food.  What a wonderful surprise!  I'm so glad to have found this.  If you only knew what was in that cheap, low quality food...you'd be horrified.  It explains why so many of our pets get cancer.  Good nutrition is key. Did you know that those cheaper brand dog and cat foods contain, road kill, sick and uthanized animals (cats and dogs, among others), and dangerous dyes and preservatives?  When I think about what I fed my animals before I knew any better, it just makes me cringe.  Would highly recommend this.

review/summary: SAN-J TAMARI BROWN RICE CRACKERS
review/text: This product is very flavorful and has a good texture.  It is a hard, crisp product, so if one has TMJ or Denture problems, it may prove a little bit hard on them for that reason.  Other than this, it would do well as an hors d'oeuvres with a nice topping on it for special occasions.  It makes a nice soup and cracker combo.  It is thicker and larger than most crackers in the same classification, thus the reason for less crackers per package than many in the same category.  We like these crackers and eat them on a regular basis.  The whole grain goodness is what we are looking for, and these meet that criteria.  Don't hesitate to buy if you love Rice Crackers, as these are on the top of the line.

review/summary: Works great for me, with modifications
review/text: I've been using this product for over a year, to bake for my egg allergic son.  I've had excellent results when substituting 1 or 2 eggs in a baking recipe.  However, I always DOUBLE the amount of Organ no-egg powder they recommend (the package says for each egg, use 1 tsp of orgran no-egg, and 2 Tbsp of water . . . I use 2 rounded tsp orgran and 2 Tbsp water) and I whisk it until it's nice and foamy.<br /><br />I've not tried using it for other cooking (custards, souffles, etc) so my review does not take those into account.

review/text: This product is great when used in baking. I've been using this for the past 3 years and have made numerous batches of cupcakes, muffins, coffee cakes, birthday cakes, etc. My son has had severe food allergies for the past 8 years; none of his classmates even know that the baked goods I take to class are egg and dairy free! I do usually double the amount for each egg (2 tsp/2 Tablespoon of water) and I only use recipes that call for 1 or 2 eggs. You also need to use a whisk and whip the "no egg" with the water thoroughly until it is frothy and thickened, then mix it with the oil and other liquid then add to the dry ingredients. It works great; people are always asking me for my recipes using this stuff. :)

The brownies didn't fully cook after 25 minutes and I wasn't going to bake them any longer.  They were ruined.  I may take the other reviewers suggestion and use twice as much next time.  Kinda disappointed as I bought this for my nephew who is allergic to milk and egg.

review/summary: Surprised At How Tasty These Truly Were
review/text: After some thought I decided to try these gummis out not really sure what to expect,  and now afterwords I'm truly happy to have made that choice.  The various taste each of the color gummi fish is truly tasty and you can tell the difference between them unlike a lot of other gummi candies that advertise the same deal.  The bag and price are also very affordable though the nest time I'll have to order two as this gummi order went very fast as I and many of my family and friends also enjoyed them very much.  I would advise getting a ziplock bag though after opening this bag though as to keep the freshness of the gummis intact,  and as for taste rating from this maker I'd say it rates in the top three of the other various gummis I've ordered from this maker(The other ones being Techno Gummi Bears and Gummi cherries)<br />.  So if you're a big gummi fan or have family and friends who are here's a very enjoyable treat either way....

review/summary: Great Breakfast flavor!
review/text: So, somehow Diamond captured the perfect flavor of french toast without all the calories. Such a great flavor, after tasting only a few for the first time I immediately orderd three more. These don't even have that "Almond" aftertaste, it finishes very nice with a hint of a butter maple flavor...wow.<br /><br />Now: To Diamond please rename to "Buttery French Toast", as this would be much better fitting.

review/summary: Unique product, well executed
review/text: The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true.

I will keep buying all their other flavors. The Bold line, especially the Habanero, is also excellent, as are the dark chocolate variety.

review/text: If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are "meaty" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!

review/summary: Not the same as the canned version
review/text: I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond "Roasted Almonds - Honey" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very "off" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and "other natural flavors", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not "slivered" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned "Honey Roasted Almonds" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased.

review/text: This is basically candy masquerading as a "healthy" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.

review/summary: Yummy in my Tummy :)
review/text: I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

review/text: I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

review/text: I must say, these almonds have made me a lover of nuts!!!  I have always been a cashew girl and never cared that much for almonds. Well, being on a low carb diet made cashews a no no.  Almonds roasted only with sea salt are soooo good. Blue Diamond makes the best tasting and these are hard to find in stores.  I love the 1 lb bag of these, but can't seem to find them. Buying these in bulk was the best deal out there and I will have to purchase again.  Thanks, Blue Diamond for a superior nut!

review/text: So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up.

review/text: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that "oven roasted" + "honey" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

It doesn't taste artificial, so if you usually drink tea that has some sort of sweetener, you may not like this.<br /><br />It brews very nicely because of the nylon tea bag, so you get all the tea very nicely in one cup, the amount of leaves in the bag is enough to only make one cup, and if won't have a strong taste even if you leave it in the cup too long.<br /><br />Would recommend if you want a healthy tasting green tea.

review/summary: I gifted it
review/text: The reason for me buying this product was that I heard it's good for the heart. I know someone who could use some of that goodness so I immediately went for it. The box was definitely bigger than what I was expecting, I liked that, still it's a bit awkward if you were trying to give a "small something" lol. Anyway, I haven't actually tasted it but I asked the gift's recipient for her opinion and she said:<br /><br />"needs sugar<br />but its cool<br />i like it"

review/summary: Tea tastes great, but strange stuff happens
review/text: Bought two packs of this tea. It tastes incredibly wonderful. However, after using a single cup for this tea for the past week, I noticed small, strange green gel on my cup. It's sticky and has a strange odor to it. It would appear after a few minutes while the tea bag is still in the cup. I'm worried about it and haven't found anything online about what it may be.

review/summary: high quality product.
review/text: Product in general is amazing, the tea bags came in a polyester fabric<br />witch is very easy to let the extracts of the plant melt in the water.<br />the convenience quantity for that price and quality is a plus.

review/summary: The real deal green tea.
review/text: This green tea is delicious! I've been in Japan and I can tell you this tea is a good quality green japanese tea, nothing like the ones you can find in the supermarket.<br /><br />That little green dust that comes out of the package when you open it is absolutely normal in good quality japanese teas like this!<br /><br />The price might seem a little high but the box is big and it will last you a long time.

review/summary: Green Tea
review/text: I was quite pleased with all phases of the purchase through Amazon. The price was a key factor in choosing to buy from this seller. However, the delivery was made in a minimum amount of time and though I was a bit concerned with possible damage to the product during shipping (I had ordered six boxes of the tea), the item arrived in a well packed box in perfect condition. The tea is a new selection for us and we are very pleased with the quality of the product. Perfectly satisfied with the purchase through Amazon. It could not have been better handled.

review/summary: Finally good tasting Green Tea
review/text: So...after buying numerous varieties of Green Tea in the Super Market and Health Food stores, this Ito En Matcha satisfied. It has good color, flavor and tastes like healthy Green Tea should. Other teas have lacked the flavor and freshness this tea has.

review/summary: I thought I did not like green tea.....
review/text: I picked up a box of this tea at my local Costco recently.  My DR recommended that I switch from coffee to green tea for the health benefits. I was not thrilled with the idea because I never had liked green tea.  So I tried this and it is soooooo good.  I love that you only have to steep it for 30 seconds in hot water and it still taste flavorful and not bland and yucky.  I also really like that you can cold brew it, you just use one bag for every 8oz of cold water and let steep for 3 mins.  Makes a quick tasty glass of iced tea.  I've never like iced green tea before either(I love iced black tea).  I'm so happy I decided to give this tea a try.

review/summary: The real green tea
review/text: I love the green tea Japanese restaurants serve. The tea is strong and very green in color. For years I could not find similar tea in any Asian grocery stores. My colleague gave this tea bag for me to try. Wow!  It is exactly like the tea you get in a Japanese restaurant.  Amazon is offering it at an amazing price. I cannot be happier with it.
