review/summary: Great flavors interesting shapes
review/text: I think I like these flops more than regular boring oval jelly bellies. Most of them are totally normal in shape, but some are twins and other shapes. I find that fun to eat. The flavors are the regular assortment of jelly belly flavors with no surprises. And of course these are cheaper, so there's no going wrong with this product.

review/summary: Got them before christmas
review/text: I have say I enjoyed them I never say any bad flops...I guess you say they were addictive to eat. But one thing is there more of blackberry kind then regular ones I liked to see in bag like cinnamon I liked that kind. I don't have much care for tequila or green apple or very red apple. But I glad to say I didn't see liver or tripe or vomit or something like that. I have say pop corn ones should be tasted really before going out to flops some them didn't taste like jelly belly beans anymore they tasted combination of vomit and popcorn.  I liked the butter popcorn type jelly bean but I kind wonder does it expire? Sincerely a jelly bean eater.

review/text: I love Jelly Bellys but giving them as gifts is a little pricey when you are living on a fixed income.  I saw the Jelly Flops and thought that might be a viable alternative and I bought five bags.  My wife and I finished one bag in a couple of days and the other four became stocking stuffers which turned out to be a big hit.  Just as good as the real thing with little surprises here and there at much less cost.

review/summary: More fun to eat than regular Jelly Bellys
review/text: Belly Flops are Jelly Bellys that are irregularly shaped and did not pass inspection to be packaged and sold as the regular jelly beans. So, instead of letting them go to waste, they're sold as "Flops". Some of them are squarish, conjoined, or lumpy on one side. There's nothing wrong with them. They're just special because they're all different. Because they're all unique, I find them more fun to eat than the regular ones. They're a big hit at the office too.

review/text: So far above other jelly beans you wouldn't even call them the same thing.  The flavors are surprisingly similar to their name sakes.  The only downside to Jelly Belly is the high price, which is why I bought the belly flops in 5 bags of 2 pounds each. If you are going to do it- do it big.

review/text: I bought 10 pounds of these and split them with someone else. Out of the 5 pounds I kept, I found it weird that certain flavors were missing entirely. I never once came across a cinnamon or a juicy pear flavored bean in any bag. It felt to me like the bags had been evenly divided up to have a certain number of each flavor in each bag (I found one mint Baskin Robbins bean in two of my bags, for example). I just expected the bags to seem a bit less calculated than that.

review/text: I bought a 2 lb. bag directly from the factory in Fairfield, CA not from Amazon so I don't know if there might be quality or freshness differences.  The jelly beans were stale and hard.  And the bag says "Product of Thailand" which was a surprise since it supposedly came from CA's factory.  In the past the belly flops were odd doubles or strange shapes packaged in a plain bag which also gave them a quirky appeal but these looked normal and are packaged like any other retail candy.  I much preferred the old flops.

She's been using both of these products for 5 1/2 weeks now and is no longer holding up her hind left leg. I read amazing reviews about both products and their results. It was recommended to pair them for dogs with stiff joints or showing signs of arthritis, so that's what we did. We are very pleased with the results. Some reviewers posted they saw results in two weeks. We didn't see any results until about 4 weeks. And even then she would hold her leg up one minute but not the next. Now she is walking normal all the time. I highly recommend these products!

I did some research and many websites advised to give glucosamine treats with fish oil to help heal the joints. Since I have done so, my dog is running around at full speed again and I have not seen her limping. She eats these from my hand as a treat a few times a day. They are also pretty cool looking--little blue fish. I would recommend this if your dog is starting to develop joint problems--I heard it's good for the coat too, but I did not purchase this product for that.

review/summary: Helped with illness and recovery!
review/text: I rescued a 3 year old Doberman Lily a few months ago who was not in the best of health, and after getting a checkup at the Vet, I found out that she has heartworms.  After all the shots she just received, she had to go through a lengthy treatment with more medications than I would ever want to give my dog, but I had no choice.  I was determined to get her healthy again, and knew that good nutrition would be especially important during this time of illness and treatment.  Lily received Olewo Carrots and Red Beets with her daily meals, and while the carrots improved her digestive health, I feel it was the Olewo Red Beets which played an important role in her recovery.  The red beets are a great natural detoxifier and helped get rid of the toxins in her system from all the medications. It also helped strengthen her immune system.  At the very beginning of her treatment she was sleeping most of the time, but after adding the red beets to her diet, she had more energy and was more active.  Lily is doing well now and will continue to receive Olewo to make sure she remains in good health.

review/text: These are wonderfully awesome snacks. They are so perfect for on the go or just to put a few out for my son to snack on on his high chair tray. I love that they are organic and I feel like I am giving him a healthy fruit snack without extra mystery sugar and color additives. I actually really like them too (Yes, even I have put them to the taste test!)

review/summary: No Joke, tasted like poison
review/text: I am not exaggerating. First off though, I have to mention that i bought a can of this stuff, not the one pictured here. Second, I am probably the least picky person in the world when it comes to junk food so my standards are not very high at all. Third, I have always loved Chef Boyardee products, I was practically raised on them. But when i tried this stuff for the first time, I could not eat more than the first spoonful, and even that was tough to get down. I have to wonder if i purchased a bad can (it didnt look like it though) because this macaroni and cheese tasted like bitter METAL. I am not joking, god honest truth. It didn't taste rancid it just tasted BITTER. I can't imagine even a homeless starving person wanting to eat this. If that is really what the flavor was supposed to be, I have NO idea how they expect kids to eat this stuff. it is absolutely horrible and I can't believe this product sells at all.

review/summary: Great for what they are!
review/text: I agree with the reviews that these Mac & Cheese singles are a bit runny, and maybe even a bit bland.  I always add a little seasoned salt to mine, and let them sit for a minute to thicken, and then I love them.  I keep a bunch at work for when I don't have time to get something and a protein bar just doesn't sound good.<br /><br />I can't say that they're "healthy" because I'm sure they're as processed as you get, but the calorie-to-protein ratio makes them actually pretty lean and diet-friendly meals (compare them to your favorite protein bar or shake, and I think you'll be surprised).

The texture of the sauce is like some kind of hand lotion...kind of tastes like that too. There is absolutely no cheese flavor in it and the noodles are slippery. Unfortunately when they were giving them away, I grabbed two. :(

review/text: I didn't buy this for myself. It was purchased for a church food drive to get supplies for kids who might otherwise go without lunch. And the one thing that the organizers made clear in our newsletter was that the kids wanted Chef Boyardee microwavables,  ESPECIALLY mac and cheese. Just to be sure, I sent the link to our church secretary, who confirmed that this is exactly what the kids want. Also Spaghetti-O's and Beefaroni.<br /><br />I doubt that this product is very suitable for adult palates. I prefer Stouffer's frozen macaroni myself. But the kids have spoken. This is what they want. This is what the organizers want to give them. And if I get a couple more rave reviews, then I'm upping my rating.

And honestly the stuff has an odd smell to it.  I think a can of Alpo would have been more satisfying. The chef makes tasty ravioli but he needs to stay far far away from mac and cheese.  If you are looking for a on the go mac and cheese lunch, Kraft Easy Mac for the win.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This sauce is one of the options at "Firehouse Subs", a sandwich shop similar to subway - but the sandwiches are not cold, and you get to sample their selection of hot sauces.<br /><br />I discovered this one at Firehouse, it's delicious!  I don't tolerate much heat, I always look for flavor. This one is comparable to the Smoked Chipotle sauce by Tabasco, found at Chipotle (the burritos place), with a little more heat and a little more flavor.

review/summary: Smoky, Tasty, Bacony
review/text: I mean to give this product four stars, though the interface is giving me a little trouble. I'm very fond of it. I can't have bacon in my household, and this sausage, while not replicating the texture of bacon, does suggest that smoky savory flavor when sliced thin and fried or microwaved to crispness, far better than that nasty turkey bacon does. Also, it's tasty in its own right.

review/text: For the last 15+ years, Figis.com has provided our family with what I've always thought was the best summer sausage available today.<br /><br />This Christmas, I was given a 20 ounce package of Old Wisconsin Original Summer Garlic Sausage. Without even opening it, I already made up my mind that if it's not a Figis product, it won't measure up.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong! I can't believe the quality of this summer sausage. The taste is one that cannot be described, you'll just have to try it yourself.<br /><br />Off to order more...

review/summary: Really wanted to like this, but sadly disappointed.
review/text: I have a regular monthly subscription to another brand of summer sausage available on Amazon. It's very popular with friends and family for snacking, and when the regular brand wasn't available, I purchased this one for a temporary replacement. I read through the reviews and felt this would do the trick until the regular stuff was available again.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only thing the two seem to have in common is general shape and color. While the flavor isn't unpleasant, the texture leaves a lot to be desired. It's both fibrous and greasy, with globs/pockets of fat and strings of what I can only imagine to be muscle or gristle of some kind. They're like white threads, and the mouthfeel of the sliced product is very unappetizing.<br /><br />In reading through the reviews again, I saw one where the reviewer mentioned this summer sausage had potential when heated/cooked, so I sliced it thinly and tried both panfrying and microwaving it. This does improve the texture and allows the extra fat to render out (if you're microwaving, be sure to sit the pieces on top of paper towels, and don't let it go too long without checking ... LOTS of fat drains out of the meat!). After it's been heated/cooked, the product can be enjoyed for its flavor without the unpleasant texture.<br /><br />If our regular choice becomes unavailable again at some point, we'll just do without or look for something in a local grocery store. We won't be purchasing this product again.

review/summary: A Good Shelf Stable Product
review/text: For summer sausage that doesn't have to be refridgerated, this is a good choice. The rolls tend to be a little on the fatty side and the salt content is hard to miss, but the overall flavor is good and in a sandwhich or paired with cheese or crackers, it makes a good snack or meal.

review/summary: Not Really That Great....
review/text: This summer sausage was not that great.  Had a very "tangy" taste, with very little other flavor.  If it were not for the price, this would have been returned.  My dog enjoys it.<br />For real summer sausage I'll stick with the small, specialty companies.  Try Woody's Smokehouse or try the venison summer sausage from the Vermont Country Store.  Heck, even Hickory Farms is better.

review/summary: Best taste ever
review/text: I bought several of these as Christmas gifts.  They were outstanding in taste and leaness of the product.  Sometimes summer sausage can leave a very oily residue on your tongue as you eat it.  This product does not do that and is one of the best I have ever eaten.  They easily excel over Hickory Farms Beef stick which is a good product in my estimation.

review/text: Easily one of the best summer sausages i have ever tasted.  I personally like the beef version of old wisconsin summer sausage because i think it taste better than the others when broiled.  The original flavor is also good, and i would say that one is the best if you're just going to slice and eat with no broiling.  I havent tried the Garlic one yet but im sure i would love it as well.  This summer sausage easily gets 5 stars from me.

review/text: This is the best summer sausage I've had. The fact that it's gluten-free is a huge plus otherwise I wouldn't be able to eat it. Just a small piece is good for a snack but it really stands out when cut up into little pieces and sauteed with some onions and boiled cauliflower. That way you get a very tasty, high protein, low carb meal which will sustain you for a long time. We ordered this for our camping trip but ate all of the 3 sausages already ha..ha...so good, now I need to place another order.

review/summary: Better than Hickory Farms
review/text: I ordered my Beef Summer Sausage from Old Wisconsin because my previously favorite Hickory Farms website only sold their stuff in packages and charged $9.99 for shipping making my order of two small sausages come to $30!  I had previously ordered the pickled eggs from Old Wisconsin and I knew their products were of the highest quality; so I tried their sausage and now I like it even better than Hickory Farms version.  The most important thing to note was that it has the same flavor and taste as what I was used to at Hickory Farms but it tasted fresher and better.  I'm not into new flavors and changing the basics of this sausage and I was actually surprised that I liked it better. I've tried many other brands and just threw them away after the first bite.  To top is off, they sent me three 1 lb packages for $20 and on Amazon the shipping was free.  So I ended up with one extra beef sausage for $10 less and it tastes even better (although the same in many ways).
