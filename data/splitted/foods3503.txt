review/summary: dangerous dog food
review/text: After 1 1/2 months on this food all three of my dogs had dangerous liver readings. After 3 weeks all three went back to normal. this is a dangerous food and can kill your dog be careful. I would not recommend feeding it unless you are willing to pay very high vet bills and lose your dog. the company never responded to my emails or phone calls.

review/summary: Mr. Kitty's favorite
review/text: I have recently adopted my son's cat and have spent the last few months educating myself about cats.  After learning that most cat foods are too high in carbs I decided to change his food supply. Transitioning him was easy, lucky me!!  Over time I've bought various brands of grain free cat food, both dry and wet. Most he ate, but some he just picked at. Then I came across the wellness brand and bought all their varieties.  He loves them, some flavors more than others, but he'll eat them. I recently bought wellness core and bingo!...we have a winner here.  He absolutely loves this food and wipes his plate clean every time; something he has never done with any other brand.  He especially loves the chicken, turkey and chicken liver.  The minute I put this down in front of him he doesn't come up for air until it's all gone.  It makes me happy to see him enjoy his food so thoroughly. His coat has developed a nice sheen to it and he has lost his excess weight. I'm glad that he prefers this food but even if he didn't, it doesn't say anything negative about this brand. Cats have preferences just like us.  This is one of the best canned, grain free foods out there.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Our cat is well again
review/text: In April of last year our cat was diagnosed with diabetes.  Our vet started him on insulin twice a day and asked that we bring him in for testing once a month.  This didn't sound right to me because a human diabetic tests almost every day.  We asked permission to self test.  We started testing him in the morning and at night before feeding him. By using the Wellness Core Cat food with its lack of grain and high protein content his blood sugar readings began to come down.  We found that we slowly had to reduce his insulin.  He has now been off of insulin for three months.  We still test him once a week but he is now a good weight, he has no dandruff and his coat is glossy.  He also has far more energy.<br />Winnie's Mom

review/summary: Amazing Cat Food!
review/text: I can't say enough about this cat food!  My fifteen year old cat is diabetic and has been on insulin since July.  While he is not completely off it YET, I have reduced his insulin by two thirds and hope that he'll be able to be completely off.  The benefits don't stop there.  I have two other cats - one that used to throw up every day - and one that has no current health issues of any kind.  My kitty that used to get sick, for some reason, every day, has only had two episodes of throwing up since I changed her to the core cat food two months ago.  My other cat looks fabulous, sleek, glossy coat(the coat on my two kitties with health issues has improved as well!) and lean and not overweight.  The benefits don't stop there, though!!  An amazing difference in my litter boxes!!  Less waste to clean up and very low oder!  My vomiting kitty used to have very foul smelling bowel movements, too.  Now there is little to no odor at all.  Urine seems to have less ammonia smell as well.  A GREAT PRODUCT! - Low carb as well!

review/summary: Fantastic food, the best available in the market
review/text: I did an extensive research on the web about the best food for my kittens (5 month old). Two brands came up: Evo and Wellness core. One of my 2 cats liked Evo but the other had a hard time digesting it (gas and soft stools). Evo canned food has stronger smell too. I tried Wellness canned food (chicken turkey) and both of them liked, with no digestive problems. I also tried its seafood one but one of the cats did not quite like it. Now, this chicken turkey and chicken liver formula is their basic food.<br />I have also tried several types of Weruva. They seem to like the soup but had a hard time eating the chunk of chicken. Also the Weruva can has far less fat content which worried me whether it was sufficient in terms of calories for very energetic kittens. Bottomline: Wellness core is the solution.

review/text: The first 3 ingredients of this food is Salmon, Whitefish, and Herring - straight up. This food stinks like fish really badly but I'm sure that makes my cat love it even more. It is grain free and is loaded with 50% more protein than the Wellness Complete Health canned variety (that is not CORE). Thankfully I can find this for $1.49 per 5.5 oz can at my local store instead of $1.75 here. I give it 5 stars.

review/summary: A pate food that my picky cats like
review/text: I bought this after trying a few of the 'healthier' cat foods out there. My cats love Fancy Feast, but I want to feed them better food. I've tried several 'healthy' brands that they hate (Newman's Own, Weruva, Natural Balance). They're extremely picky and turn their noses up at just about everything! So frustrating.<br /><br />After reading reviews of this, I bought some and gave it a try. Both of my cats really love this food. They normally won't touch a pate-type food (preferring cat foods with 'bits' in gravy) but this one they love. It's not smelly and it doesn't upset their stomachs, and they're always eager to eat as soon as I put the bowls out, so I consider this a success and have purchased more.<br /><br />So if your cat is picky and won't eat a lot of the 'healthier' foods, give this one a shot.

review/text: Petco has the same food online for 38.93 and free shipping over 49 dollars.  Just passing this along.<br /><br />As for the food...my cats would vomit after eating all the time and my vet put them on some expensive prescription food.  The prescription food didnt' help the vomiting.  I did research and found this food to be grain free...and after feeding it to my cats they haven't vomitted since.<br />Next time you go to the pet store look on the back of every cat food and you will see the second ingredient as either rice, grain, corn, etc.<br />When was the last time you saw a tiger eating rice?  Exactly my point!  You will see a difference in the softness of your cats fur after feeding them this food for a while.  Try it out!

I put my other cat on it so I wouldn't have to deal with two diets and she has improved in her health and hair quality.  It is grain free and closer to the natural diet a cat requires than other foods on the market.  I really recommend it, especially to cats who show signs of a poor coat, loss of weight, etc.

review/summary: cats love this stuff
review/text: I have two cats of ages 1 and 3 years old.  My 3-year old is a very picky eater.  She never liked eating canned food and stubbornly stuck to her dry kibble.  Well, all this changed when I introduced this Wellness Core Chicken can food to her.  She can't get enough of this stuff!  Now, she would meow loudly and persistently at my feet as I dish out the food, eagerly waiting for me to set down her food plate.  She gobbles it up at every meal.  I was simply amazed how much she loves this stuff.  I never got this reaction with other wet food I've tried (EVO, Weruva, Halo, Chicken Soup for the Cat's Soul, Merrick's, Felidae).  My 1 year old cat eats anything, so as expected, she gobbled up the food as well.  Big two thumbs up from my feline family!

review/text: This is one of the few wet foods that my cat, who is not a picky eater, actually refused to eat.  He grudgingly ate it for the first few days and then when I fed it to him today; he took one sniff of the dish and walked away.  This product does have a blended-meat, p�t&eacute; type of consistency which, from the other wet foods he hasn't taken to, seems to be a style that he isn't a fan of.  I do use the Indoor Health dry food that this company makes and my cat seems to enjoy that very much.

review/summary: Pleases the finicky AND is grain & gluten free!
review/text: I've been feeding my cats a combination of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ5A2W">Max Indoor Adult Roasted Chicken Flavor Cat Food, 16-Pound</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJJ1K0">Nutro MAX CAT Salmon and Whitefish Entr&eacute;e Gourmet Classics Adult Canned Cat Food</a> for years now.  Sadly, my older two just were not as crazy about the canned stuff as they are about the kibble.  I have been trying to find something they will eat that isn't junk (I think they would eat SPAM every day if they could).  After lots of research and a lot of trial and error, finally!  Wellness CORE has done the job.  They like - no, LOVE, the chicken and the fish flavors.  The texture is smooth, and it smells like something I would eat myself.<br /><br />I have been slowly increasing the canned food and decreasing the dry, which is good for all kitties.  Yes, this is expensive for cat food, but I'm OK with this. One day I will take the plunge and transition them to a full-raw and all-natural diet such as Feline's pride (not available on this site or in commercial stores) or god forbid make my own cat food.  Until then, I'm just glad the gals are happy.

Believe me, it's no fun cleaning up barf every couple days.  But since I started her on Wellness Core (dry and canned), the barf episodes have nearly been eliminated.  She can even eat the Wellness treats with no ill effects (before, we couldn't do any kind of treats).  She acts much brighter and happier and her coat has improved in sheen and texture.  I've put my dogs on Wellness food as well and seen similar results in their coats.  Awesome product!

review/summary: Made my girl healthy again
review/text: My 8 year old cat was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. She was having blood and mucus in her stools.<br />The vet prescribed a couple of different high fiber diets, neither of which worked. He also tried giving her steroids.<br />The steroids worked while she took them, but once off them her symptoms returned. He wanted to do more testing.<br />I spent $500 on an ultrasound, which was inconclusive. Next, he wanted me to do a $4000+ procedure (colonoscopy)<br />which would give a complete picture of the state of her disease. The next course of meds would be a combination<br />of chemo and steroids.<br />Meanwhile, after also mentioning this all to the breeder that I got my cat from, she told me to try the Core diet.<br />I had helped all her cats that had similar symptoms. She was pretty sure that all my problems were being caused<br />by grain allergies. So, I made the switch, using both the Core canned and the Core dry kibble. In addition, I<br />add probiotics and food enzyme powders to the wet food, daily. My cat is now almost completely symptom free.<br />Occasionally, I see a little mucus and maybe a smear of blood in the stool. My occasionally, I mean maybe<br />once in 8 weeks or so, where as before, it was every day.<br />I am sure the probiotics and the enzymes help, plus the holistic vet did some acupuncture, but I am thinking<br />also, the Core diet was the most beneficial treatment of all.

This makes me very happy knowing that not only does she like this food, but it's so darn good for her too!<br />The price is high for canned cat food, but it is cheaper than buying it in the store (if you can find it!) & you get free shipping!<br />I'm glad I took the risk & bought a case, I (well my cat that is) will be trying the other varieties next!

review/summary: Wellness Core is good ~~ maybe not their best product however
review/text: I bought this cat food because my cat had recently been diagnosed as diabetic.  The first, and recommended, action to take when hearing such a diagnosis is to immediately change your cats diet to a wet food only, low carbohydrate diet.  I did my research and found Wellness Core to be a good option because it was grain-free and was composed mainly of protein.  Upon doing more research I discovered that some of the original Wellness canned cat food (non Core) has a lower carbohydrate count, and a slightly higher fat count, than the Wellness Core pictured in this review.  The whole point of changing my cats diet was to lower her carbohydrate intake so as to (hopefully) lower and stabilize her blood sugar.  I (ultimately) spent more money on food that had a higher carbohydrate content.  Beyond that, the food is seemingly of good quality.  My cat liked it however only AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.  Once refrigerated, the food didn't quite seem to capture her attention as much.  My advice:  Wellness Beef and Chicken Formula.  Lower carbs, higher fat, and 1% lower in protein count (big deal) and cheaper.

review/summary: At First Perfect, Now Won't Eat It
review/text: I adopted my beautiful Siamese mix kitty (looks like a snowshoe) in August 2012.  I have never had a cat before and didn't understand how beneficial wet food is to their health.  Because I'm used to dogs, I thought the wet foods were meant to spoil your cat and that they contributed to obesity.  I was so wrong!  Even though I leave it out, she doesn't even touch her dry food anymore, and that's fine with me since Wellness foods are so high quality and balanced.<br /><br />I researched all kinds of foods before settling on Wellness.  Since I have always had dogs, I thought Blue Buffalo was the best brand of pet food available, but I think that's only true for their dog foods. It seems like Wellness foods are more specialized for cats (for the ingredients, taste, and texture).  I can find Wellness in stores in a pinch, but it's best to buy it through Amazon.  It did take a week or so for her digestion to normalize to the high protein levels in the wet food because she was used to eating low-quality food.  Now that she's used to it, though, I notice that she's even more playful and happy!  Everyday I notice how incredibly soft and shiny her fur is compared to when I got her.  She definitely regulates herself and is not gaining weight.  I think the wet food is also wonderful for keeping cats hydrated- I see her drinking less when she eats the wet food, yet she pees normally.<br /><br />I have decided to feed her Wellness Core as her "base food" because it has higher protein than the entrees in gravy, plus I can buy it in bulk for less than I can in stores.  I started mixing in Cubed and Sliced Chicken, Minced Tuna, and Sliced Turkey for variation (she does tend to get sick of the Core if that's all I give her every day, and prefers the food in gravy).  I'm also going to switch between Core Indoor and the Core Chicken/Turkey/Chicken Liver.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/18/12<br />Unfortunately, Lulu will no longer touch this food.  I had to start mixing it with other food to get her to eat any, until eventually she lost weight because she wouldn't touch it even if it was thoroughly mixed in with other food (I always found remains of this in the bottom of her bowl).  I found out she just likes non-pate style foods better.  She still loves other Wellness foods, but they have to be in gravy.

review/summary: My cat's favorite flavor
review/text: Cat *loves* this flavor above all the others and I've tried most.  I'm not a fan of feeding the same variety over and over and try to mix things up.  I wouldn't call her finicky but there are some flavors she'll turn her nose up and won't eat until she gets really hungry.  Not this chicken liver recipe, though.  It's usually wolfed down and she's looking for more.<br /><br />I like Wellness because they tend to have more meat and protein than other brands.  Personally I think Wellness is worth paying for.  Not really a fan of the added potatoes on the ingredient label because I have yet to see a cat pounce on one for their dinner.  I think this has become the "substitute filler" since people have realized grains aren't healthy for cats.  I doubt potatoes are any better.

review/summary: Healthy food my cat loves
review/text: I feed my 12 week old cat a combination of this wet food with the core dry food. My cat eats the dry food but he definitely prefers to eat the wet stuff. I store it in the fridge in my kitchen and now every time I go to get something from the fridge my cat comes running and meowing and begging for some more wet food. Each can I divide into 4 servings and just plop it on top of the dry food each time I wake up, come home, or go to bed, so this pack lasts about 1 month usually. I used to feed my cat Science Diet because I listened to my vet and when he ate that food he had very coarse hair, now that he eats wellness he has a nice silky soft and shiny coat. $40 a month to feed my cat the healthiest canned cat food I can find, seems worth it in my opinion.

review/summary: Cat Loves It!
review/text: I had always been a believer in giving my 9 year old male cat some flavor variety at mealtime. He always seemed to appreciate it too. Not since I gave him this... He wants this food and no other! For 4 months straight he has had nothing but 'Wellness CORE Chicken, Turkey and Chicken Liver Recipe' three times a day... And he devours it today just as lovingly as he did the very first time he tried it... Hey, if he's happy (and healthy) then I am happy. One can of Core's protien centered nutrition per day, along with a hairball supplement twice a week which includes omega oils etc. as well as 'Greenies' treats (which he also loves) ensures me he is getting a complete and nutritious diet, that keeps him happy even... (at both ends lol) If it were only so simple for us humans...

review/summary: Almost perfect
review/text: I order two to six jars of this honey each month. It's one of the better tasting honeys I've found (I think India might have the best honey.) I'm always trying out new honey, but some of them are disappointing and I have to make sure that I have this honey on hand -- it's my backup plan.<br /><br />Soliga forest honey is rich and floral with the perfect amount of sweetness. This honey has a waxy scent that reminds me of when I used to eat gooey pieces of honey comb. I prefer it straight from the jar as I require more than one spoonful to taste it in my tea (which unfortunately makes the jar empty sooner than I'd prefer.)<br /><br />I titled this review 'Almost perfect' because I prefer unfiltered honey. Depending on how you look at it, filtering can be a good or bad thing, especially for anyone looking for something that is smooth and not gritty. You won't be finding any pieces of wax in this. Filtering removes pollen which slows the crystallization process. If you're wondering why your soliga honey hasn't turned solid, then this is probably why.<br /><br />This is one of the most intelligent packaging designs I have seen in terms of honey jars. It is a small, round glass jar with a plastic lid. The lid is BPA free. The lid is made of polypropylene and there is not just one seal between the mouth of the jar and lid, but two seals! I don't have to worry about anything harmful leeching into my honey from the jar or lid.<br /><br />Many companies use aluminum lids that contain a layer on the underside of the lid called a food liner. I believe (but I might be wrong) that the food liner is there to prevent your food from being contaminated with aluminum, or to prevent corrosion from acidity levels. Aluminum is actually harmful to your health but very difficult to avoid. Food liners usually contain BPA. There is very little chance that they won't contain BPA. When a company claims that their food liners are BPA free it doesn't always mean that it is safe. Most food liners are made of 'plastisol' which apparently contains PVC. That's just as bad, if not worse.<br /><br />BPA and PVC in food liners defeats the purpose of organic practices and lifestyles. Always make sure your honey has a BPA (and PVC) free lid or make sure that there is at least a seal between your honey and that lid, or you may as well buy non-organic honey (preferably locally) for a better price.<br /><br />Other organic honey with BPA and PVC free packaging:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK08OC">Certified Organic Manuka</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y3ZECM">Really Raw Honey, 1 X 16 Oz</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OMJWXU">Wee Bee Naturally Raw Honey -- 1 lb Each</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BC740A">Hnz Organic Clover Honey, 1.1PoundsJar</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GV6O34">Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Raw Honey, 16oz</a><br /><br />I recently asked the company if their honey is shipped to the USA in barrels. It is not barreled (yay.)

review/summary: WORKS! They ALL like it; no force feeding here!!!!
review/text: With 7 large Greyhounds of my own plus fostering new Greys from the track all the time, this house has a minimum of 10 Greys in it at all times. I own and foster only special needs Greyhounds (never a shortage of them),  mostly due to broken legs and hocks at the track. I make glucosamine a daily staple in their morning meals (with my Vet's approval of course), regardless of their ages. I've tried countless products, some they liked and some they turned their snouts up in rebellion. Even my 3 older ones who have about 7 teeth total among them like these. (For my toothless wonders, I crush them before adding to their  bowl-break into pieces in my hands then use a small 'smack and chop' chopper on the cutting board and scoop the small pieces into individual bowls). My other 4 who still have most of their teeth wait for me at the top of the cellar stairs while I'm filling their bowls and placing one of these peanut butter biscuits on the top of each. While 1-2 try to distract me as I'm hauling all these bowls up the stairs, the others bob and weave in attempts to steal the treats out of the bowls as I near the top of the steps. Have to admit defeat on occasion when I'm not paying attention :(<br /><br />In any event, haven't met a Greyhound yet who does not love these. Not only that, I have seen remarkable improvement in agility, desire to play and romp, renewed interest in toys, consistent improvement in ease in pouncing on the beds, serious athleticism in swiping the tomatoes from my topsy turvys in the yard, even stealing a 3 lb pumpkin off the back step to munch on behind the tree in the back yard. The younger ones have resumed 'running laps' around the yard while the older ones (2 are 11, 9, 8, 5 and 2 are 4) seem younger and instigate play more often than before. They are energetic, not as stiff after a nap or nighttime, want to do more, play more, walk more/further and, while it may be my imagination, the older ones seem to be eating better. (They had gotten to a point where sometimes they would eat, sometimes not, sometimes just nibble a few bites and walk away).<br /><br />All in all, they like this product and I am thrilled already with the positive changes I see in my 'kids' who are always with me and the fosters who arrive in rough shape but leave for happy, responsible homes upon adoption. I dislike pumping meds into any pet when something else will help. I'm sticking with this product. It works for me and mine. I wouldn't purchase 7-10 6 lb bags of this product at a time if my pups weren't exhibiting such remarkable improvements. Their quality of life has definitely improved. Packaging says to allow 4-6 weeks for best results but it took less than 3 weeks for me to begin seeing significant changes in all of my guys and gals. Can't wait to see what 6+ weeks of using this product will produce!<br /><br />Each ALL NATURAL biscuit contains 500 mg glucosamine and is a substantial 'treat'. Biscuits are approx. 3-4" long and perhaps .75" high and quite crunchy to promote strong teeth and healthy gums. They are a bit difficult to break other than in halves. After that initial break, they are too tough to break into smaller chunks, thus the need for my abovementioned 'chopper'. Each bag purchased to date has arrived in excellent condition. Out of 14 6-lb bags to date (2 separate orders), only 2 biscuits were broken in half; nothing was crushed or broken into small chunks. Very little residue at bottom of resealable bags. Unfortunately, I did count the biscuits in the first 2 (original order) bags to determine whether or not I would stick with this product pricewise, but I've forgotten now what that count was so I cannot share that at this time. And because I'm back to order more, if I remember, I'll update this review when I count them again. Directions for use: 1/2 wafer/biscuit per 40 lbs body weight twice daily.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: Some (not all) of the statements on the reverse of package - thought I'd share before you buy:<br /><br />- Administer during or after the animal has eaten to reduce potential incidence of gastrointestinal upset.<br />- An exam from a vet is recommended prior to using this product.<br />- Keep out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, contact a health professional immediately.<br />- Safe use in pregnant animals or animals intended for breeding is not recommended.<br />- Consult with your vet before using this product in animals with clotting disorders, being treated with anticoagulant medications, diabetes, or any metabolic disorder causing hyperglycemia, history of urinary tract stones, and known allergies to shellfish.

review/text: One problem I've experienced in caring for an older dog is finding a glucosamine supplement that our 65 lb., 15 year old Akita/Chow-chow mix would really like eating.  Finding one that our dog, Kuma-chan liked eating was a challenge.  We've tried tablets in her food and she would smell it mixed in and not eat until the next day.  Other biscuit type supplements were left uneaten.  Sometimes the gel capsule would be left at the bottom of her dinner bowl.<br /><br />As soon as the Nutri-Vet Hip & Joint Peanut Butter Large Dog Biscuits arrived, I offered a biscuit to Kuma.  She took it, wagged her tail and came back for another one!  Now, she knows that she only gets one every morning before her chicken jerky treats!  It's great when you don't have to force feed your best friend!  What a relief to see Kuma walk with minimal stiffness or pain in her hips after a couple of weeks.

review/summary: Horrible Packing
review/text: Glucosamine was highly recommended by a number of friends who own older dogs.  After reviewing most of the glucosamine dog products offered through Amazon, I decided on this one.  The cardboard box containing the 20 lbs. of "wafers" (actually a dog bone) was tightly sealed with packing tape when it arrived.  When I turned the box over to find the correct side to open, I could hear the contents inside tumbling around.  Much to my displeasure, when I opened the box the "wafers" were just thrown inside... much like a bag of pretzels or chips.  The box was about 2/3s full... I will have to take their word that there was 20 lbs inside.  Approx. half of the "wafers" were broken or shredded.  It was so bad that when I emptied the "wafers" into a plastic container, I was able to fill a 16oz. paper cup with the dust/particles found at the bottom of the box. (and that did not include the broken pieces!)<br /><br />The shipper didn't wrap the "wafers" in a plastic bag.  The shipper didn't make any attempt to protect or bubble-wrap the contents.  I'm not in a position to report the effectiveness of the glucosamine; but I can tell you I am extremely disappointed in the way it was packaged and shipped.  If you plan to order any of Amazon's glucosamine products; I strongly urge you to check the way in which it will be packaged.  Thumbs down to Amazon for this product!!!

review/text: I wholeheartedly recommend these dog treats!  We were looking for a yummy Glucosamine dog treat for our 2-year-old dog, and these are a great value for the money!  Our pup loves the peanut butter flavor and does not have to be coaxed into eating them.  Also, I LOVE that they are Made in the USA.  Highly recommend.  These treats are great!

review/summary: My dog loves these
review/text: I have a 13 yr old Husky that has gotten so picky about her food that she only eats something like Fresh Pet or dried meats (mainly chicken).  She turns her nose up at most treats and won't eat pill pockets.  So I was thrilled to find these because she loves them.  She actually begs for them. And they seem to do the trick since she is a very 13 yr old with no noticeable joint pain.

I can honestly say, I saw the effects wear off the few days he was off then between shipments. We also saw him struggle when we had to have him fast before vet appointments.

review/summary: Seems to work
review/text: I have a year old Mastiff who came from a pretty bad situation when he was just 2 months old resulting in bad genetics and just overall he is a bit less healthy than a normal dog. I bought a small bag of these when they were on sale because it's pretty well known that Mastiff's have hip dysplasia issues as they age but unfortunately he has been showing symptoms (bunny hopping and some stiffness in the morning mainly) since 6 months... all that fast growing mixed with how large they get is a pretty bad combo for joints then a slow start and bad genetics on top of it can really mess up a Mastiff.... Because of this he has always been on glucosamine of some sort so I had no idea if these were working or not until I ran out and didn't bother buying more for a couple months.. I was thinking he was a pup, he wouldn't get much worse if I saved the money this month and just started back up when I had the extra money to buy the huge box again... I've seen HUGE changes in him since he has been off of these. I don't want to say it's the best source of glucosamine out there, but he LOVES the taste of them and it really does seem that he's been a bit more sore since he hasn't had them. I'm going to buy another box and see if he improves. I'll update my review after a month or so.

review/summary: Excellent Product Especially for Large Dogs
review/text: What better way to provide your dog with the potential benefits of Glucosamine?  Although the benefits for animals, such as dogs (and the jury is still out on humans too), are still argued, there are no drawbacks to providing your dog with Glucosamine.  If your dog loves peanut butter, then he or she will love these biscuits.  I selected this brand due to the natural ingredients as well as limited ingredients - there are no fillers, etc. in these biscuits.  Each biscuits contains 500mg of Glucosamine.  I provide my dog with two a day for his size (he is a large black lab, who often runs with me, as well as is an avid swimmer and walks an average of 3 miles a day).  All I have to do is say "biscuit" and he knows what he is getting.  Although if it is past his usually treat time, my dog is sure to remind me!<br /><br />I first purchased these biscuits at PetSmart about 6 months ago when I noticed my dog limping here and there - primarily after a lot of exercise.  He was approaching 7 years of age so I thought it was time to provide preventative measures for his hips and joints.  I found this item to be very expensive in PetSmart ($26.99 for one bag, so I decided to check Amazon when I was almost out of the biscuits.  I was able to purchase them for $17.99 a bag - almost a $10 difference!  Being a Prime member, I received free shipping.  Excellent deal all around.<br /><br />I am extremely picky with what my dogs eats, and I would highly recommend this product.  There is also a smaller biscuits size for small and medium dogs.

review/summary: Always reliably effective - and healthful too!  :)
review/text: Our 9 year old ~50lb blue heeler/border collie cross girl dog shows a near immediate difference between orders of these.  Yeah, I know, it is completely my fault not hers for not ordering the next couple of bags before the current one runs out.  She'd be right on top of it if she could. Anyway... she has had a broken front leg most of her life, and is showing a little soreness once in a while in her rear right hip without these biscuits.  Several days off of these biscuits is too long.<br /><br />But within a day or two of feeding these to her, she's back to walking normal again.  I know I know.  some of you might be calling BS on that, but I know our little girl dog here and how sensitive she is to any change in nutrition.  Just a few kibbles make a difference with her weight.  she's fed twice a day, about a cup or a little less each time, and one of these biscuits with her supper.<br /><br />Nutri-Vet did a very good job with these.  If I liked peanut butter flavor, I'd eat'em too for my bad joints.  You definitely can't beat the mg/biscuit for the price.<br /><br />In short, I'd most definitely recommend these for any dog who needs 'em.  They work.<br />And of course, Amazon always has the best price - even though several other places try to undercut amazon by a few bucks, they kill the deal with their shipping costs.  One thing that cracks me up though about Amazon, is the big box of these is, per biscuit or per pound, MORE expensive than buying a few 6lb'ers.  so watch that.  Bulk is not always in your favor.  If it is the box convenience you're after, use a plastic tub at home 'n empty the bags into it.  Oh, the bags also reseal to keep these from drying out - they're alreay crumbly crunchy texture, but I guess it makes us people feel better to think our dog(s) are getting the most fresh they can.<br /><br />Good luck, and remember - always do your best to be the great person your dog figures you are - it helps.<br /><br />Chuck

review/summary: A story...
review/text: Our four dogs love these.<br />It appears that these no longer get put into a plastic bag before being put into the box. This allows all sorts of mishaps.<br />The first box we got this way had mostly broken bits and appeared to be stale. (No, the puppies did not complain)<br />Amazon.com send out a replacement box. This one was full of little bugs. Grose. It got tossed into the trash. (Puppies were sad...)<br /><br />So I called the company, spoke to a very nice person who said they would look into it, and get back to me.<br />Less then a week later, a box arrived, and in it were four 6lbs bags of these treats! These 6lbs bags are heavy duty and re-sealable.<br /><br />Although I am not sure why they do not seal the 20lbs boxes as they used to, the company did a very nice CS fix, and I will continue to support them by buying the 6lbs bags.

review/summary: My picky eater gobbles these up.
review/text: My dog routinely spits out the chewable tablets and/or manages to eat around them when I try to hide them in her meals.  I mash the tablets and mix them into her meals and she ddoesn't seem to notice, however mashing the tablets and dosing the food, although not a huge effort, was quickly replaced with these biscuits once I found my dog actually likes the biscuits.<br /><br />I too found many broken biscuits, however I toss the broken bits into a meal and my dog thinks she's struck gold (she'll dig the bit out from the bowl, race down the hallway as if to hide the find from me while she gobbles it up, then return to finish her meal).<br /><br />My vet recommended glucosamine as a preventive measure for my dog (a seven year old SPCA-special, mini Aussie/Border Collie mix), coupled with the need to shave a few pounds from her as an added preventive measure - ultimately, these biscuits, bits and pieces included, have replaced many of the more caloric treats I was giving my dog - that's why I don't mind the broken bit (yes, I was guilty of providing too many treats, hence the need for her to drop a bit of weight).  Although my dog doesn't have joint issues, she has dropped two pounds and if that's all the biscuits do for her at this stage, well, I still think we're both ahead of the game :)<br /><br />Here's hoping my dog doesn't tire of these biscuits :)

review/text: My Golden Retriever is 10 years old now, and she moves a bit slower (especially with 2 titanium hips that she received at 6 months).  She's still incredibly active, but isn't as quick out of the gates as she used to be.  I figured that I would start her on some hip and joint meds, so I bought some pills to put in her food.  Then I found these, which she loves.  She's definitely not finicky, but she won't eat just anything either, and she gobbles these up.  I've given her 2 a day for about 3+ months, and I've found 3 broken biscuits.  Living in Colorado, nothing really goes stale out here, so I can't speak to that.  She loves them, and they seem to be working.

review/summary: Top Quality, Great Price
review/text: You can't go wrong here.  Nature's Variety is one of the top brands in terms of quality and I've researched this extensively.  If you choose the subscribe and save option the price cannot be beat anywhere.  The beef and lamb formula is the favorite of the Instinct flavors amongst my three dogs.  While not a cheap food, you get what you pay for.  I've been feeding Nature's Variety and admittedly a few other high quality brands for years.  First off, the amount to feed listed on the bag, at least for my adult dogs (10, 6 and 5 years old) is much lower than recommended.  My dogs generally get 3/4 cup twice a day, with the 10 year old getting a bit less.  A nice perk is very, very small stool production (gross I know) but if you have multiple dogs it's nice to have small "packages" to pick up in the yard.  (If you fed supermarket brands you'd be scooping all day- I know as I have a pet related business.) Kibble size will work for any size dog- big or small.  Perhaps most importantly, I truly believe your dogs will be healthier and live longer on Instinct foods.  My 10.5 year old Merlin is just starting to show signs of aging.  I adopted him as a scroungry rescue at age 3, so he didn't have the best start in life.  It's amazing what a great diet can do for a dog.  Definitely a food worth purchasing, and Amazon makes it easy.

review/summary: Good quality food
review/text: It's difficult to review a food when each dogs tastes may vary.  This food is a high quality, grain free food.  The kibble is small (slightly smaller than ToTW).  I moved my dog onto it after she spontaneously decided that she didn't like ToTW Pacific Stream anymore.  Reviews on dogfoodanalysis.com and dogfoodadvisor.com both list the food as a high quality food.  I have seen comments on using asorbic acid as a preservative that can lead to bloating if you pre-wet the food.  If that's the case, well, just don't pre-wet it.  My dog is loving this food and has been on it for several months.  Her coat and breath are both good.  I also add salmon oil and royal jelly to her food, so I don't know if it's the food or not.  She also has Antler chews in the house.  Either way, I'm just happy that the fussy eater is eating.  The subscribe and save option offers about $10 per bag off of the regular price, plus I'm a prime member so I don't pay shipping.  They offer the different flavors in small bags if you're interested in trying it out before investing in the biggers bags.

review/text: My nine year-old labracollie has a very sensitive tummy and is allergic to a lot of foods.  I started my labracollie on Instinct Grain-Free Duck/Turkey about two months ago, when I ran out of her usual dog food (which was working out "okay") and had to give her our wiener dog's food.  I immediately noticed how pungent this dog food was.  It smelled very concentrated but I ensured myself it was not bad by checking the kibble and expiration date.  The smell may shock some people, but after that initial surprise, I noticed how eager my dog looked when she got a whiff of this food.  I think some dogs like stinky-smelling food.  She started eating it right away, and the very next day I was happy to see that she passed a normal stool!  It was even great that she was not scratching like she a maddog.<br /><br />After she did well on the Duck/Turkey, I bought the Beef/Lamb.  She was fine on this one too.  I try to give her a variety of options to keep her interested in her meals so I was glad that I found at least two choices<br /><br />It's only been two months so I can't comment on how she does long-term.  I will probably update this review if I find notice anything that I feel could be shared.  My dog is about 52 pounds and I go through the 13-pound bag in about two weeks.  The results, so far, definitely validate the additional cost; and I feel this brand is decently priced compared to other grain-free dog foods out there.  So far she has tried the Turkey/Duck and Beef/Lamb and she liked both of them, and is still passing normal stool.  Unfortunately she's allergic to chicken so I can't give her the Chicken mix and she has never particularly cared for fish so I am debating if I should bother with the Salmon Meal.  My next bag will probably be the Instinct Grain-Free Limited Ingredients, just to give it a try.<br /><br />So to recap...<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good for dogs with sensitive tummies and food allergies<br />2. Kibbles are small.<br />3. Reasonable price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Smells strong.

review/summary: Not the same kibble that I buy from the local pet store.
review/text: Looks like this kibble (although sold as the same product) is different from the kibble that I buy locally. It looks like there are fillers in it. Very disappointed and pray that it doesn't set off my dogs bad allergies, because they do not accept returns (which my local store does!) I will be buying locally from now on!

review/text: My spoiled little fuzz butts will from time to time throw their tiny little noses in the air if I offer them the wrong treat but NEVER with cinnamon Bright Bites.  All I have to do is yell "Who wants to brush their teeth" and they come running.  I bought some in a larger size for my niece's two Golden Retrievers as part of their Christmas gift.  My dogs are a Japanese Chin and a Lhasa Apso.  Everyone on the Japanese Chin on-line forum raves about this treat - all the Chin love them.

review/summary: Pepper Overdose
review/text: As I write this, there are two other reviews for this product. Both are from the earlier part of 2012. So I'm not sure if the product has changed or if the problem I state below didn't bother them.<br /><br />The chips are heavily coated in cracked pepper. In addition to the ton there is on the chips, there is an equal amount at the bottom of the package. I hope the batch we received is off! We really love the avocado oil chips and looks like the olive oil ones taste awesome as well. Now if we could only get rid of most of the pepper.....sigh.

review/summary: Excellent Product!
review/text: I have ordered this product several times, as well as other flavors, i.e., Rosemary and plain Sea Salt.  The cracked pepper seems to be our favorite, but they are all so good, it's hard to choose! The low salt content is perfect for those on a restricted diet.  We have tried a number of other brands, but they are awful compared to these--they all seem to be coated with garlic, onion or some other combination of awful powder which overwhelms any other flavor and sticks to your hands!  These are just potatoes, olive oil, sea salt & pepper.  I've only found them in stores twice so I order them from Amazon. There is a new version out which is cooked in avacado oil, and we'll be trying it next.

review/summary: Possibly the best coffee, I've ever had
review/text: I purchased a pound of whole-bean while on a recent cruise to Jamaica (and Haiti) and could not wait to grind this up and put a cup of it through my aeropress.  Simply the best cup of coffee I've ever had.  0 acidity and 100% smooth! great notes throughout and makes the perfect cup of night-time coffee.<br /><br />If you much prefer bold/strong coffee, such as myself, then you would not want to buy this coffee. It is not strong at all, but great none-the-less.<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee for anyone that goes to the area, to at least buy some and bring it back to try.  You will not regret it.

review/summary: My new favorite coffee
review/text: I've been trying to buy organic fair trade coffee lately, but it does limit my in store options.  I've found some coffee online that I like (Buywell Guatemala Fuego is nice), but I LOVE this coffee.  The first thing I noticed when opening the package was the rich roasted aroma of the beans.  It was a sign of what was to come.  I actually sat there for a minute just smelling them.  The flavor is equally scrumptious.  Love Buzz creates a rich cup of coffee with hints of roasted chocolate.  This is my new favorite.

review/text: I ordered this coffee based on reviews here which are mostly positive. My experience with this coffee is not good I am afraid. Neither my wife or I can say anything positive about this blend. It was bad in every regard...no taste, beans very dry, no attributes at all.  In fact, I threw away about 1/3 of the last bag because I just couldn't take another mug...and I was trying to tough it out and find something to like.  DO NOT recommend...if you do get this...you were warned!

review/text: Equal Exchange is a great company with a delicious product. We are serious coffee drinkers and our 3 pack of coffee doesn't last the whole month (more like 1 1/2 weeks) but it is a treat that we look forward to each month. In between we experiment with other brands and roasts but Love Buzz is consistently our favorite. It is an added bonus that is organic and fairly traded.

review/summary: Red sea salt
review/text: Used it in a recipe for pulled-pork.  Had never heard of it before and couldn't find it locally.  Ordered it and Himalayan sea salt from Fairies Finest.  I'd procrastinated and was afraid it wouldn't arrive in time, so I called and they promised to get it in the mail right away.  Showed up in 3 days.<br />The salt has undertones of clay, which gives it a deeper flavor and was used as a rub it the recipe.  The liquid smoke overpowered it, but the flavor was there.  I think it best used as a rub or finishing salt.<br />There is also black Hawaiian salt... somehow mixed in with lava!  Have to try that next...<br />P.S.  The salt was well packaged in a jar.
