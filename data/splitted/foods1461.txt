review/summary: Breathies are made in China
review/text: These used to be the only treats my dog would eat.  He loved them, and would not eat anything else.  I saw a news report about the FDA warning on china imported jerky treats, and thought no way could that be reason my dog has been having health problems, they sell them at Whole Foods and advertise the chicken as organic and free-range, words which just aren't used in china imported meat.  I took a close look, and there it is, made in china in TINY print.  I stopped feeding them and slowly my dog has stopped throwing up all the time, has his energy back, and just obviously is feeling like himself again.  Please don't play roulette with your dogs life.  Check all packaging closely, and tell this company to stop importing from china!  Dogswell, btw, will not respond, and has banned and blocked and deleted my inquiries on their facebook page.  They do not care about your or my dogs health.

review/summary: No more doggie BAD breath :)
review/text: I am in the process of ordering Breathies Chicken Breast Strip for the second time.  My Tea cup poodle Lucy suffers from a mild case of Hypogycemia and also had breath that could peel paint off the walls. This product has been a life saver.  I give Lucy one in the morning and one in the evening. After a week of use her breath is fine and I believe this product helps keep her blood sugar level in check.  It gives her a treat that is a good source of protien without a sugar spike. I have tried all the green treats and flavored bones and nothing helped Lucy's breath like Breathies. I am a costomer for life now.  Katie C<br />  New Jersey

Because those things are exactly what I want -- something healthy that won't tempt me to overeat.  In this respect, the product delivers perfectly.<br /><br />I do wish that these cakes didn't have a tendency to fracture into a million pieces as soon as I bite into them, but I would venture that the only way to solve that problem would be to add something artificial, or sugary, neither of which would I favor.  Therefore I recommend leaning over your plate when eating the things.

review/text: I avoid glutinous grains and corn, but enjoy eating brown rice. I had an allergic reaction to these rice cakes. I wasn't sure what could've caused it. I contacted Lundberg and found out that they process the rice cakes on the same equipment they use for their other products that contain corn. I think I may have also reacted to the flavorings they use in the other rice cakes. I will not buy again.

review/summary: Excellent Lundberg Rice Cakes
review/text: We were very pleased to be able to purchase unsalted Lundberg rice cakes from Amazon. We sometimes buy them from Whole Foods but they do not always have the product and we are stuck with the inferior super market brands. Lundberg rice cakes are the absolute best, by far, in the marketplace. What differentiates them from the competition is their density, body and superior taste. My wife sprinkles unsweetened cocoa powder on them for a treat. If you are a sugar addict do not try this.<br />However, we did have a problem with the outer box from the shipper. It had a large stain across one fourth of the bottom of the box. It looked oily. Thankfully, however, there was an inner box and the stain did not penetrate that far. This may have been the fault of the delivery company.

review/summary: Mmmmmm, Vanilla Flavored Coffe
review/text: My wife first found this in Walgreen's and bought both Vanilla and Hazelnut flavors just to try them out. And here is our verdict: WE LOVED THEM. The Vanilla one, that is. We didn't care for the Hazelnut too much. And since my wife hates favors in her coffee you can say that the Vanilla flavored Splenda is really good. Now why would I mention by name where she bought it first? Well because you should know that it cost us a dollar more per box that what we would have spend here in Amazon. And since this product qualifies for free shipping it's a no lose situation. Here is a little more on this item:<br /><br />The Vanilla Splenda tastes like... well, Vanilla; the good vanilla, not the artificial stuff. It's delicate and subtle. You can easily taste both the vanilla and your favorite ground coffee separately and yet appreciate how wonderfully they come together. (Can you tell that I am sipping a hot cup of vanilla flavored coffee as I am writing?)<br /><br />The Hazelnut Splenda is a little too roasted for my taste, and in my opinion it kind of kills the otherwise nutty hazelnut flavor. But don't let that stop you from at least trying it. You might like it a lot more that we did.<br /><br />THERE IS NO AFTERTASTE. I hate Nutra Sweet because of that.<br /><br />Splenda No Calorie Sweetener comes in three flavors Vanilla, Hazelnut and Mocha. I give Vanilla 5 stars, Hazelnut 4 Stars and I have not tasted the Mocha yet. But if you are wondering if you should try this product, the answer is YES, go for it, you will love it. You will even impress a couple of friends too. Que te aproveche.

review/summary: Finally a flavored sugar!
review/text: First of all, If you read nothing else, I have to say........BUY IT!<br /><br />Okay, that being said, here's more:<br /><br />For years I kept seeing flavored creams everywhere.  Why don't they make flavored sugars, I wondered.  Interesting that Splenda came out with flavored sugars, as it was about one year ago that I emailed the company with the idea.  Perhaps it is just a coincidence.  Anyway, it doesn't matter...it is really (really) good.<br /><br />I've tried them all.  Vanilla being my favorite.  Mocha a very, very close second, and hazelnut is a distant (but worth trying) third.<br /><br />All of the flavors are very (well...) flavorful.  So much so, that in a "travel mug" size coffee cup, I use one flavored packet of Splenda and one regular Splenda and it's plenty flavorful.<br /><br />The vanilla is very vanilla-y (which I happen to prefer to chocolate).<br /><br />The mocha is very chocolately and delicious, especially for me, not being a chocolate fan.<br /><br />The hazelnut I could take or leave and I would take it if the others weren't around.  It is not at all or in the least bit objectionable, however.<br /><br />My only objection to this Splenda is the packets themselves (those tall, skinny packets) are somewhat cumbersome to open the way they were intended to be opened, I think.<br /><br />You are supposed to fold over the top just slightly and then use the already slit part at the top to tear it apart.<br /><br />The problem lies in that when you tear it this way, it tears all the way down the packet and can spill out.  ...and if you stop tearing it at mid-package, you end up with a small "pocket" of torn package that you have to hold with one hand while dumping the contents out with the other.  Otherwise, the small torn part of the package gets filled with the sugar and you have to dump that out, too.<br /><br />So, I use my teeth to tear it across the top (the way you open a freeze pop) and that way avoid the whole "ordeal".<br /><br />It's REALLY not that big a deal, I'm just sayin', that's what happens.  (this is a review, afterall).<br /><br />Other considerations:<br /><br />I read that you can find the product at certain Walmart stores (just not one near me), which means that Sam's will have it soon (in bulk).<br /><br />It is a little expensive, about one dollar more per box than regular, but so is Starbucks, and frankly, it's worth it, and I hate Starbucks bitter (tastes like it's several hours old) coffee, anyway.<br /><br />I've also tried the vanilla Splenda in my Grape Nuts cereal, and didn't care for it as much as I thought I would.  I prefer plain Splenda for that, but you might really like it, and it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />I haven't tried it in hot chocolate, but I will and it will undoubtedly be good.<br /><br />The flavor is so concentrated that you could probably serve it in a cup of hot water, which I also haven't tried and am actually kidding about.<br /><br />You can tell how strong it is when you are opening it up with your teeth and you taste it.  You can also smell it in your coffee from across your desk. It's wonderful.<br /><br />I purchased one of each of these flavors on Amazon. (no doubt, it's a lot of Splenda, but there are no shipping fees, so it's a great deal).<br /><br />I am now the star of the office since it is not really out yet in the stores (around here) and everyone here loves it.<br /><br />The other thing I'd like to mention about Splenda (in general) is that it is the only "sugar substitute" made from real sugar.  The best thing about this is that it doesn't react in your body like real sugar does, but it tastes the closest to real sugar, in my opinion, than anything else.<br /><br />Most importantly, it does not cause an insulin response in your body, which is what happens when you eat real or (chemical) artificial sugar substitutes.<br /><br />This is a HUGE plus for your body since sugar is the BIGGEST EVIL in our weight gain problems in this country.  Sugar is many, many, many times more the culprit in weight gain than any fat could be, as far as making you fat goes, because sugar CONVERTS TO / BECOMES FAT upon our digestion of it.  So to have Splenda come out with a flavored sugar is just the greatest thing.  It's even better than sliced bread because I like my slices really thick and sliced bread usually isn't.<br /><br />Well, that's all folks...hope you enjoyed.<br /><br />Now, sit back and watch, all of the other sugar makers will be coming out with flavored sugars, soon, and then it will be everywhere.  Choose Splenda for your health!  Oh, and by the way, I do not work for Splenda, if that's what you were thinking, I just love it that much.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Anastasia

review/summary: Splenda Flavored No Calorie Sweeteners
review/text: These Splenda sweeteners come in a few different flavors...mocha, hazelnut, and french vanilla.  I use these in combination with some non-fat coffee creamer.  Until I tried this product, I used regular flavored coffee creamers that contained fat as one of their ingredients. Overall taste was rich.  When Splenda introduced this product, I was able to migrate to the non-fat flavored coffee creamers without much loss of richness.  It was simply a matter of adding one of these flavored packets to my coffee in combination with the non-fat creamer.  You lower your fat intake; your calorie intake; and retain the rich flavor.  Great product.

Here she says she likes vanilla first, mocha "a close second" and hazlenut a "distant third."  On the mocha page, she submits a similar review in which she says "The mocha is absolutely the best of the three offered, and I am a French Vanilla fan, usually. The French Vanilla is a close second and the Hazelnut is a distant third."  Hmmmm.  Which is it?  You don't happen to be affiliated with the splenda producers, do you?

review/summary: Taste?  Where Are You?
review/text: I love coffee.  I would not go as far as to call myself a connoisseur, but I much prefer a good whole bean custom roast to a can of Hills Brothers or Maxwell House (though there is nothing wrong with either of those brands).<br /><br />To change things up, a great French Vanilla, Hazelnut Cream, or Irish Cream flavored coffee is excellent.  However, I tend to find flavored beans too strong when I use them at full strength, so usually I mix it half and half with unflavored coffee.<br /><br />As I've gotten a little soft around the middle in my later years, I've started using Splenda in my coffee.  When I saw the flavored Splenda packets, I thought it would be the best of both worlds.  I would have premeasured Splenda and I would be able to have flavored coffee on demand without buying a separate bag of beans.<br /><br />When I first opened a pack of the Splenda French Vanilla, I thought it had a strong, wonderful aroma.  The aroma reminded me of the scent of white cake batter.  Ready for a real taste treat, I put 2 packets in with about 12 ounces of coffee.<br /><br />The sweetness was just right, but the taste (or lack of) was quite surprising.  After being greeted with the wonderful pungent smell when I opened the packet, I expected something with a much stronger flavor.  The flavor of vanilla is very subtle, even for a person like me who doesn't drink flavored coffee at full strength.<br /><br />I would not go as far as to say these packets are a waste of money, but I do not think I'll be buying them again personally.  If you are looking for something to give your coffee a hint of flavor as well as sweeten it up, then these are the perfect product.  If you are looking for a quick and easy replacement for flavored coffee, then I would look for something else.

review/summary: Each Flavor is Very Different
review/text: My favorite is hazelnut, not too sweet and no peculiar aftertaste - I would rank hazelnut 5 stars. The french vanilla is very sweet, taste is not so much "vanilla" as it is just very sweet almost syrupy taste - I would rank french vanilla 4 1/2 stars. The mocha has a slightly sour aftertaste, it smells very good but the aftertaste is a bit sour - I would rank mocha 4 stars.

review/summary: Different amounts in each packet,.... :(
review/text: I LOVE the product, BUT, because each packet has a different amount in it, I could not give it 5*. I wrote to the company, & they never replied. It's really a pain in the neck, not knowing how sweet my coffee will be, with each packet. I wish they made it in bulk, so I could use just the right amount each time,...........but, then the company wouldn't make ALL the $$$$$$they do on the small packets. :(

review/summary: Quick, convenient, tastes naughty but is oh so good
review/text: I stash these at work and of course at home. Each small stick is enough for 1 large cup of coffee (I fill my to go cup all the way). The flavor is pretty strong - so some people who actually call 1 cup a cup of coffee (unlike my generous 3 cup "cups") may want to only use half a stick at a time. The taste is wonderful, very rich, no funny aftertaste. The sticks are very small and while easy to open, have stood up to weeks of riding around in my crammed full purse. Who needs sugar and cream anymore? I was less impressed with the caramel ones - but these have helped me kick my expensive and not so healthy caramel macchioto habit.

review/summary: Best Coffee Sweetener Ever!
review/text: I was looking for a coffee sweetener/creamer with the least amount of calories possible, and this is the best I could ever ask for. It tastes just like vanilla, and makes the coffee sweeter, especially if you use two packets. I've tried the hazelnut, and it's great too, but I love the vanilla one more. The vanilla one seems sweeter.

review/text: I'm a freak of nature where I love my coffee with cream, please NEVER a grain of sugar and my tea with sugar and NEVER a drop of dairy.  That being said I really don't like plain tea but I'm a great fan of strong flavored teas.  Normally I'm a Cinnamon or apple/cinnamon tea drinker as they seem to have the strongest flavors, that was until I discovered the combination of Sleepytime Vanilla tea and Splenda French Vanilla sweetener.  Together they make music in my mouth.<br /><br />Since I came upon the Splenda FV by accident I haven't been able to find it in stores so I was very pleased to find bulk packages on Amazon at a price that makes my pocketbook happy.  Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />Now I'm wondering if the Mocha would taste just as good in my newly discovered chocolate flavored tea ... hm...

review/summary: Makes My Favorite Diet Drink
review/text: I had just found this product in my local grocery store when they quit carrying it.  Well I decided to check Amazon and yea! found it again and on auto-ship.  I make a full pot of de-caf coffee the night before, then the next day ... during the day I use two packets with coffee and ice and a splash of 1% milk in a 20oz cup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PLLN90">2 Aladdin Foam Insulated Coffee Mug 20 oz w/Lids Blue</a> for a very satisfying "doesn't taste like diet" drink.<br /><br />The thing I like most about this flavor is that it doesn't have that cloying sweet taste that you get with so many "diet" products out there.  My only criticism would be that the packets are not always loaded equally and you sometimes get less product in your drink than you would like.  That being said, I hope they continue to make this product and Amazon continues to carry it and I will continue to buy it.

review/summary: Mediocre
review/text: Not so great, but not bad. It is a mediocre product. I first got hazelnut flavor, amazed by the exceptional smell and taste, bought this one immediately, expecting a similar quality. A little bit frustrated. The taste is a little weak for 1 tube per 16 oz coffee; too sweet when 2 tubes per 16 oz coffee. Too many adjustments kill the purpose. Get a box from the grocery and then go for the 6-pack only if you like it.

review/summary: Great low cal sweetener
review/text: I just started Weight Watchers and realized that I was drinking a LOT of points by putting flavored creamers into my coffee each morning. So, I found another solution to have a 0 point coffee. Instead of flavored creamer, I use Coffee-Mate Fat Free Original (only 2 tbsp per cup, no more than 4 tbsp a day), plus one of these Splenda Vanilla packets. It turns my 2 point cup of coffee into 0 points, without losing much of the flavor I previously enjoyed. Great product! I wish more grocery stores carried it.

Hopefully, Spenda will widen their sales range. Thanks Amazon, I can always count on your services.

review/summary: Subtle flavor, great aroma, portable low-calorie sweetener!
review/text: Most stores discontinued selling this coffee staple--so happy to find it on Amazon!<br /><br />If you like flavored coffee sweetened without the calories, this is the product! I find that the French Vanilla enhances both unflavored and flavored coffees (we have Pumpkin Spice in the office; I frequently add cocoa powder to ground coffee at home). The French vanilla flavor is subtle yet authentic. Very aromatic, too! When I use it at work, cubicle neighbors come around asking what that vanilla cupcake smell is. I also use it to flavor low-fat smoothies.<br /><br />Obviously if you dislike the taste of sugar-free products, then you probably won't be a fan of, well, a sugar-free flavored coffee sweetener. But if you indulge in sugar-free sweeteners, then Splenda Flavors for Coffee French Vanilla is a soothing, portable option to flavor and sweeten your coffee without needing to use a flavored non-dairy creamer. I hope that Amazon keeps this flavor stocked for a long time!

My favorite way to use it is in diet soda (especially diet coke, diet mt. dew, and diet root beer!) It makes a really good diet vanilla soda! (*Note to anyone who may want to use it to make the vanilla soda, do not add it directly to a can or bottle, it will fizz over. You have to put the soda in a glass first. I learned that one the hard way!)

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW68ZI">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavor for Coffee, Mocha, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> is my favorite, followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW68Z8">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavors for Coffee, Hazelnut, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and then the French Vanilla (but it is still really good!). This is only a sweetener so I still use a splash of "Half and Half" along with two of these in my morning cup. These have no calories and less than 1 Net Carb each, so it isn't bad for me to have more than one cup in the morning.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

I can tolerate it since I have been trying to eliminate calories and fat from my coffee, but it's not ideal.  I will not repurchase.  And I also tried the mocha but gave it away because I disliked it so much.  Try unsweetened cocoa and regular Splenda instead.

review/text: I just can't face black coffee but regular coffee creamers are so full of calories and fat. Even if you get the sugar-free kind you are still ingesting a whopping 1gm of fat PER TABLESPOON! Also the flavored creamers use hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats.<br />Rather than being a creamer, this flavors/sweetens your coffee. Many times I've found that things sweetened with Splenda are too sweet but that's not the case here. It adds a subtle sweetness, not overpowering at all. If you need it creamy, just add a splash of fat-free half and half or better yet, a tablespoon of non-fat powdered milk or a tsp of fat-free evaporated milk.<br />Even if you're not on a diet this is a great alternative to white sugar or fatty creamers.

review/text: I was hoping to find a good-tasting, low calorie alternative to flavored coffee cream. Unfortunately this product really didn't really do that. It does sweeten black coffee but not to the extent of actually giving it a great vanilla flavor. I found it better to just use regular artificial sweetener. The WORST part about these packets is that they are IMPOSSIBLE to open! I had to keep a scissors next to my coffee pot to cut the tops off of the packets. Ripping them open requires some secret trick that they don't tell you about and I still haven't figured out...

review/summary: Fizzy cola fun
review/text: I love Japanese candy, so this package was eagerly awaited. I liked the weird triangular shaped wrapper, and inside was a large, almost choking hazard-level sized brown candy. The initial taste varies from candy to candy, from a mild cola taste, to a soft fizzing sensation, to a taste so sour that you could fall off your chair. Overall, however, the candies had an adequately cola and soda feel to them, especially the fizziness factor, no doubt due to the baking soda in each candy piece. I'm glad I bought these, they were a lot of fun-- literally; each one lasted a LONG time.

review/text: I was picturing an effervescent explosion of sweet cola flavor in my mouth. I love the taste of Coke, but I don't drink caffeinated beverages or sugared sodas anymore. So I thought this might be a pleasant way to get that delicious cola flavor every once in a great while.<br /><br />What I got was a flat little jolt of sugar and a sour cola taste. Also, for whatever reason, this candy scratched the roof of my mouth. It has a very unpleasant texture. I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered it. I stumbled across it and thought, "hey, that looks tasty".<br /><br />I was wrong. :(

review/text: Out of all the different Cola candies I've eaten over the decades, this one definitely takes 1st place for taste accuracy & size. The candy tastes exactly like cola, and has a wonderful fizz surprise in the middle! Keep in mind that one bag doesn't look like it comes with much, however this is due to the fact that each candy is about double the size of a Warhead. If you're into cola candy, you definitely need to try this one!

review/text: I LOVE gummy colas, and I enjoy pop rocks well enough.  So when I saw the rave reviews for this cola-flavored candy I thought I HAVE TO TRY THIS!!!  Alas, they were only okay.  They tasted fine, like hard gummy colas.  The faint fizziness was interesting.  But NOT worth eight bucks, nuh-uh.  Especially after sucking on two of them in a row caused the roof of my mouth to get sore.  Next time I want a candy cola flavor, I will go round up some of my gummies.  :(

review/summary: THE BEST! But... 3.36oz for $7.89????
review/text: I absolutely adore these candies. I had them for the first time when a friend in middle school took me to an Asian grocery store. They're addictive!<br /><br />They are fizzy and have a particular flavor. It's definitely a "cola" flavor, but not a typical American cola flavor. Because I love these so much, and because I rarely often have a grocery store that I can purchase these at anymore, I am often hesitant to share these with friends/JiwaJiwa newcomers only because I've had a few people spit them out and that horrifies me! They are definitely not for everyone, but those people are missing out. So ha.<br /><br />The 3 stars I gave this candy is not for the actual product (which is 5 stars!) but for the price! $7.89? Seriously? I can pick this size of a bag up in any Asian grocery store for under $3. Heck, I think that CostPlus World Market even carries them sometimes! If you can find a local Asian grocery, I encourage it, who knows what else you'll pick up? It might be very exciting!

The package is very unique and adds to the over all cool idea of the candy.  At first glance it looks like a normal hard candy till you put it in your mouth.  My first reaction was wow what is this it's fizzy, then I spent the rest of the time trying to figure out what cola tastes like that.  I've shard this with my friends it's not a bad flavor, just different, and has a fun aspect like pop rocks. I still have a few left :P

review/summary: Decent cola flavor, terrible price
review/text: I bought this product for the home because we have avid soda-flavored candy lovers. Just to be clear, this product is NOT worth the price listed here. The quantity is slim, and as you'll see in my review, the flavor pales in comparison to other brands.<br /><br />In terms of finding cola hard candy, it's difficult to find it anywhere in the US. You may find haribo soda-flavored gummies, but their taste is usually not as strong as the hard-candy substitutes, and the gelatin ingredient may be unwanted to certain people. This candy is interesting in that it has a very mild fizz in it. That said, the candy is is very rough on the tongue/palette (most likely due to this fizz-additive). Now taste-wise, I've had many cola-flavor candies, and this candy's taste is not as strong as say-- candyland's cola flavored candy.<br /><br />If you can find a lower price, then have at it, but at the price amazon has this candy listed, it's not worth it. Be it made in Japan or Antarctica, this candy is candy, and should never be so expensive for such a meager amount.

review/text: I first ate these snacks on a Jetblue flight down to Fort Lauderdale, FL. I actually didn't even ask for them. I stated give me the bag of snacks I have never seen before. When I opened them up I didn't even realize they were supposed to taste like popcorn because I didn't read the bag.<br /><br />When I took the first bite I was amazed of the suttle flavors hitting my pallet that reminded me of kettle popcorn. However, it wasn't the over sugared kettle popcorn you always remember. It was like the perfect coating aruond the popcorn that wasn't dripping in its own sauce. I went to look at the bag and it has very few ingredients and all of them are healthy. It is even advertised as gluten-free.<br /><br />.............I was eating delicious..... HEALTH FOOD!!!!!!<br /><br />Believe me, health food is not my thing most of the time. All I care about is the taste. I am a food lover with a bottomless stomach to match. You won't find these most likely at your local corner store unless you live in the city. I highly suggest the purchase of the Kettle version. I have not tried the rest, but I intend too get a value pack next to try them out!

review/summary: Costly because....
review/text: ...the sugar content of maple sap is very low, therefore it takes a LOT of sap to make one gallon of syrup (something like 50 to 1).  Maple sugar is a further distillation of this very labor-intensive process; hence, the cost.  Like so many things, much of what you pay for is for labor...think about getting your car repaired.  Real maple sugar will never be inexpensive, but it is a genuinely unique product for which there is no true substitute.  To me, something as special as maple sugar--which is not used in great quantity like white cane sugar--is worth the higher price.
