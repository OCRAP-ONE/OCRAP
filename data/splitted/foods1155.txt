review/summary: Good Taffy
review/text: I have just recently become addicted to salt water taffy-thanks to beach club resort at Walt Disney world. (The restaurant there leaves you a handful of salt water taffy after you eat.) So since I live in Florida have not had the easiest time trying to find  real salt water taffy. I had been buying it at Bealls department store, but it was getting expensive. So i got the 5 lb bag to split with my son. This taffy by taffy town DOES have a salt flavor, but I like it. The flavors are all pretty good. Only one tasted chemically, still don't know what it was supposed to be. But most you can name & nail first bite! I'm having fun eating this candy. It came fast & fresh, I would buy it again. The assortment is pretty good too. They are not as hard & chewy as the ones you find in a box at department stores they are a little softer, but still fun to eat. Def. a great value too.

review/summary: Good intro to sushi.
review/text: Just tried my hand at sushi making for the first time with this kit. One mistake I made was that I did all the rice for my first time; which ended up being more then I wanted to make. I also will have to disagree with the book which says it only takes 5 minutes of de-starching/washing the rice. It took me an hour of constant washing to get it clear. The sushi book isn't really the best for recipes, at least the ones I like. It also suggests using items like turkey/chicken; which, seems too strange for me to even bother trying. The texture and flavor do not make sense for sushi.

review/summary: Great Curry for Chicken Salad
review/text: This is the perfect curry for Curried Chicken Salad.  We don't eat it that often and a can lasts us about a year.  The metal can and lid keeps it fresh.<br /><br />For the best taste, add a little water to a Tablespoon or so of curry powder to make a thick paste and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.  We then measure out the amount of mayonnaise needed for the chicken salad.  Blend in a little of the curry powder at a time until you get the flavor intensity you desire.<br /><br />We usually make it with 13 oz of canned chicken, diced onions, diced celery, chopped pecans/walnuts and the curried mayonnaise.  You can also add, diced hot or bell peppers, diced tomatoes, etc.

review/summary: Seven Month Old Loves Them
review/text: My son really likes these and hasn't been able to bite off any chunks. I like that they're made from organic oats and a handful of other recognizable ingredients. No wheat or soy. The simple ingredients look like something I could easily make at home, which is nice to see. At close to $7/lb, they'd better be pretty darned close to homemade quality and these certainly are.<br /><br />The only complaints I have are that they're a bit sweet and they leave brown muck on his clothing. Make sure your baby is wearing a bib before eating these! The sweetness isn't a huge issue and the biscuits don't seem to have much sugar in them, but these definitely fall closer to the "cookie" category tastewise. I think they're quite delicious, actually.<br /><br />I'd recommend breaking them in half before giving your child a biscuit, as they're longer and are likely to be dropped well before a dent has been made in them.

review/summary: Not for beginning chewers
review/text: After reading the reviews on these teething biscuits, I was so excited I ordered a case of them. They're still sitting in my cupboard three months later. After a couple tries and near choking incidents, I have decided to wait on giving any more to my son. He is a beginning chewer and could not handle the large pieces. I would recommend using these for older kids ONLY. Had the same negative results with Earth's Best Teething biscuits. The only teething biscuits I recommend for actual teething babies are the Mum Mums. Those melt in the mouth, so no possibility of choking and keep my car relatively crumb free. Win, win.

review/summary: Great for our 9 month old
review/text: Our 9 month old loves these. We don't necessarily use them for teething, per se, but he loves to gnaw on them at mealtimes. We started using them because we like the wholesome ingredients AND they are a decent source of iron (he has low levels). He is able to gnaw off pieces, for sure, but we've  never had any choking or even gagging. The mess on his hands and face wipes off easily afterwards, but I can see how that might be an issue if he was wandering around the house. As an added bonus, he smells like yummy maple for several hours after eating one. :-)

review/text: My 11-month old twins seem to enjoy these maple-flavored biscuits very much.  However, they are quite crumbly for teething biscuits.  Several in each box are either broken or have hairline fractures causing them to crumble easily.  I have to test each biscuit and I can't leave them unattended for even a second, because they gag on crumbs routinely, so I must be present to fish them out.  Perhaps I just got a bad box and the next one will be great.

review/text: These teething bisquits are actually pretty good, much like a graham cracker. Our baby's teeth started coming in at 3 months. Now, at 8 months, she is a very toothy baby. She can easily bite off pieces of this teething bisquit. Unfortunately, that makes her choke, as these are designed to be a slow dissolver. We had to take them away, even though she loved them.<br />I highly recommend these over any other teething bisquit for kids who are teething but do not have the ability to bite off a piece.

review/summary: Choking Hazard and then some
review/text: These teething biscuits are great, if you HOVER OVER YOUR CHILD THE WHOLE 4 DAYS it takes to eat this mess factory. Holy Crap, my daughter almost needed a Steel Wool pad to get the dried gunk off her body. She had it everywhere, on her nose, in her nose, her eyebrow, her elbow, armpit and legs...plus the high chair needed a pressure washer! I seriously think concrete is mixed in with this recipe. The first time we gave one of these teething jaw-breakers to our daughter we realized we would be up until midnight by the time she finished slurping the brick down. Fortunately, my husband who will eat anything ate it and said it was actually tasty. Kind of like those first generation Power Bars, you know, the ones that tasted like eating your front yard. Needless to say, our daughter did not CHOKE THE FIRST TIME, BUT SHE DID THE NEXT and we have decided that she will not have these anymore, unless they have soaked in a vat of water for three days. These things are so dense they are probably like sea monkeys...they probably expand to the size of our house, so we will soak them in an igloo cooler in the backyard.<br /><br />Still, prior to our daughter choking on these teething bricks we did discover their magical powers. The next morning after her first gnaw session, our daughter was walking, talking and was even potty trained. My husband called me into her room the next morning and to my surprise, there my little 9 month old girl stood there holding her soiled diaper (yes, she undressed herself as well) yelling at my husband how she was sick and tired of having to pee on herself all of the time. We knew right then, the teether had something to do with this. We have been cautious thus far with giving her more since we do not fully understand the powers this biscuit holds! Thinking it would effect adults the same way, my husband bought a case and ate them over the next three days. He did not get smarter, but he has been constipated for the past 3 months and he cannot stop drooling. The second time we provided our daughter with one of these we found her the next morning downstairs watching Good Will Hunting yelling at the screen disproving all mathematical theories presented to the screen. Yep, our daughter then decided to build a nuclear fission reactor in my husbands shower! All I can say is be cautious of the biscuits power...your little Junior might be telling you how to change your oil the next morning or how to cook his eggs!<br />- Show quoted text -

So after my bubble was "bursted"  I went on the Brach's web site.  The price for the 7 oz bag there was reasonable.  It had a feature that allowed me to receive an email when the product was in stock.  I have also looked high and low for the past two years.  What is going on?  I know I am not the only person besides the ones who commented that love these little candy "eggs"!!  Why the inflated price, I ask you?  Tsk, Tsk, Tsk.  And I am craving this like nobody's business!!  Oh, well.  The search continues.

review/summary: Not worth it!! Disappointed!!
review/text: Got this candy as a gift for my dad.  He loved these and we couldn't find them anywhere.  After a lot of looking I knew I was going to be paying an arm and leg for these candies so I broke down and ordered them.  They came fairly quickly.  Dad  was really excited and shared one with me for my effort but they were TERRIBLE!  I used to love these candies too, as a kid, but this was not them.  These were HARD and STALE.  Dad did not complain because its not his style but he deserved so much better.<br /><br />In the end, while I was willing to spend the extra money expecting a great candy, they did not come anywhere close to the mark!!  Will not buy again!!

review/summary: Fine Tea Experience, With Caveats
review/text: ****<br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to "Weightless" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: "For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming." So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: "Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs."<br />****

review/summary: You can't beat it for a natural diuretic
review/text: I love salt and shouldn't.  My biology causes me to retain water and shouldn't.  At least I don't think it should.  So I drink a lot of this tea, just to make sure I am not carrying a lot of water weight.  But I make sure I take potassium as well, so I don't mess myself up by flushing it all out.  Actually, to clarify, what I mean by I drink a lot of this tea is I have a Starbucks steel 22 oz hot beverage container, and I use 1 tea bag to 22 oz's, and throw in a little stevia for sweetening, and every now and then a dash of lemon juice.  I could drink herb tea all day long this way, it is the best way for me to get fluids.  I normally use only 1 tea bag with 22 oz of water a day, but sometimes I do 2 tea bags, with a total of 44 oz's of water, of this tea.  I would not recommend doing a cup of water per tea bag.  I have no idea if it would do you harm, and I am not saying it would, but it just seems if you are suppose to drink 8 glasses of water a day, or 60 to 80 oz's of water a day, that doing the largest amount of water that you can stand per tea bag won't do you harm.  I am talking any herb teas, but I happen to be reviewing this one.  Anyway, that is my experience with this particular herb tea.  I really like Traditional Medicinals brand of teas and use a lot of them in full protocols for addressing various health issues naturally.

review/summary: What the hell
review/text: So out of the 6 packs, 3-4 of them broke open. And since I wanted free shipping and combined my order into one package, my cute books also smelled like spoiled eggs. Three definitely popped open and the fourth one was opened a little bit but I didnt want to deal with contamination or anything so I threw them away. The remaining two were covered with the powder and smelled even though I washed the outside of the plastic so I had to triple pack it so it wouldn't make my kitchen smell ridiculously spoiled. And the bags are way big enough. I thought I was getting a great cheap deal for so much but if I could do this again I would buy it in a sealed jar and just the amount of one pacakage since most recipes only call for a few teaspoons or tablespoons anyways. Spice itself is super eggy in smell and taste so exactly what I wanted it for. Just not worth the clean up and excess waste you have to deal with and throw away.

review/summary: The coffee is great, but other buyers were right: mysterious punch hole
review/text: The coffe is really great, makes very aromatic, full bodied espresso.  I would just like to review the packaging more. I ordered several packs of these, packaged in bricks of 4, vacuum-packed, and covered with clear plastic. Very impressed because of the efficiency of packaging, very tightly packed. Of the 3 sets I ordered,  one set had one of the bricks with a punch hole at the bottom, seems mysterious since the clear plastic covering the 4 bricks was in no way punched and remained intact. It's just the one brick with the punch hole at the bottom. I wonder how it got that way. Anyway, this would have been 5-stars but for that. Highly recommend the coffee.

After Senseo stopped making their pods, we bought the Coffee Duck/Ecopad pack from Amazon but weren't sure which coffee to use in them.  Tried the Crema e Gusto based on high reviews and are happy we did! Best cup of coffee from our Senseo machine ever!  Much smoother and lower acidity than the Senseo coffee we were used to, and can get some nice crema when using the Ecopads. Price can't be beat, either!

review/text: I bought this to use with a 3 cup espresso maker.  This stuff seems to last quite a while, even though I fill up the holding dish to the top.  The espresso tastes great and in my opinion (if you flavor it right) is just as good or better than many of the coffee products that you can purchase that are made for you (aka starbucks, caribou, etc).  Buying it in the 4 pack also brings down cost quite a bit.<br /><br />Overall, a great product and highly recommended.  It is a very bold flavor, so if you aren't in to dark and bold coffee then beware.

Although it has a very high concentration of robusta beans (60 or 70%) instead of the market-favored arabica beans (40 or 30%),  it's the robusta beans which produce such an excellent creamy and rich crema, from both my stove-top espresso maker and my Nespresso machine (I fill my own home-made capsules with this brand...see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UP1M4I">Ne-Cap Nespresso� Compatible Refill Capsules</a> ), and the espresso is absolutely perfect. No bitterness, just rich, dark and flavorful. Would buy again if it goes on sale (the Amazon price is still better than NYC supermarkets which sell one pack for $4.75),

We always prefer to grind our own beans but we like to have a backup that is pre-ground for company so we can quickly make espressos without a lot of waiting between cups. We've tried several Lavazza pre-ground and all are pleasing, this is no exception. you aren't taking any chances here, except for a slightly higher-than-prefered price.

review/text: I love this espresso coffee, it makes such a nice cup of espresso with an amazing crema.  It's very consistent and the flavor is smooth, however I have noticed that I get a major headache after drinking an espresso made with this coffee.  I am making it properly with the right amount of coffee so I know it's not that.  It's also not the caffeine since I drink drip coffee almost every day.  That leaves really one thing which is the robusta beans that is blended with arabica to make this coffee.<br /><br />Great coffee, just not for me and if anyone else experiences this then it's the robusta beans so just try another 100% arabic blend, it comes out good anyways.

review/summary: My favorite for cappucino
review/text: Using Lavazza Crema Gusto in my Moka is like being back in Italy. It makes a great cup of cappucino, without which I cannot start my day.  Rich flavor, strongly roasted but not burnt tasting.  The vacuum package keeps it very fresh.

review/text: Amazing espresso coffee! I strongly advise anyone who as the passion for espresso coffee to buy this brand! Although once in a while due to the packaging the bricks come with small holes making it loose it's freshness and vacuum properties...<br />Besides this small problem it's definitely the best espresso coffee you can get in America!!!

review/summary: Starbucks has nothing on Lavazza
review/text: After spending almost $5.00 a day for months at Starbucks on iced lattes with an extra shot, I finally got wise and did some research on Amazon. After purchasing an espresso maker, I had to find a quality espresso to go along with it. The description is 100% accurate. Smooth and not bitter. This is the best espresso I have ever tasted. Thank goodness I can order it from Amazon.

review/text: I recently bought an espresso maker  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002A3S66">De'Longhi BAR32 Retro 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>  which I love, and wanted some good coffee to go with it.  Originally I was going to buy the illy espresso, but I saw this and it's cheaper and got great reviews, which are definitely well-deserved.  It's so delicious and I love the smell of the coffee - it's chocolaty.  MMMmmmmmmm.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Honey!
review/text: I was enthralled with the coffee I was served in Florence, Italy years ago and brought some home.  Now, it's available in the U.S. and it's Lavazza.  My local market used to sell it and no longer does but amazon comes through for us.  The flavor is intense but not harsh and has a slight mocha flavor (at least to my untrained palate).  The only negative is my own fault by not noticing that I was ordering a 4-pack, so I have more than I need.  After giving one away to someone who probably won't appreciate it, I'm going to keep the rest and transport myself back to Florence every morning.  The grind is fine enough for an espresso maker but also works for drip makers, although you should use less than usual at first.  It's pretty strong.  Americans are inundated with choices of coffee these days, but I highly recommend trying Lavazza if you're a regular coffee drinker.  The price was very reasonable, even with the shipping.  Share the cost and product with 3 friends at first to give it a try.<br />Ciao

review/summary: Love Lavazza
review/text: I always buy Lavazza coffee. It has such a smooth taste and is a great value for the quality. I use Crema e Gusto with my Bialetti caffettiera and with my Breville espresso/cappuccino maker. I always get a lot of crema when I use this with my Breville machine. I've tried other brands but I always go back to Lavazza.

review/summary: Best espresso ever!
review/text: I used to buy only coffee that I could grind in the supermarket since I wanted the best possible espresso from my machine. However, I just moved to an urban area where I am unable to grind my own coffee conveniently (outside my home). So I searched on Amazon and found this coffee, which has excellent reviews. I figured it couldn't be better than freshly ground coffee, but that it was better than getting some old gross coffee from the convenience store across the street. Much to my and my boyfriend's surprise, this coffee makes much better espresso than any other coffee we have tried over the past few years (and we have tried many, including expensive coffee from Whole Foods). I don't know about the other blends from this brand, but if you like strong rich espresso, this one is AMAZING. Try it, and you'll see.

review/summary: Nice Stuff!
review/text: I bought this on a whim after some sporadic experience with an old, trusted roaster....  This is a very nice new taste for me.  It's a bit lighter roast than the two espresso roasts that I have been using.  It's got a nice, delicate taste that asks to be made on the strong side to show its best character.  I haven't bought ground coffee in many years, so this whole experience was a bit of a lark for me but I'm glad I tried it.  I'm using in a LaPavoni machine and a Moka rig and they're both working well with the grind as arrived.

review/text: This is a dark, chocolaty cofee. Grind works well in my stovetop espresso maker. I have tried many different espresso blends and was not sure how this would be since it is a blend of robusto and arabica beans but it is rich, dark, and as others have remarked, not at all acidic or bitter. My new favorite.

review/summary: Excellent espresso mix
review/text: I was an avid fan of the Lavazza Cafe Espresso (black can) for years.  I was about to sign up for the subscription service for this product on Amazon.com when I started reading the reviews about the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. One of my main concerns is if the acid in a coffee will give me an upset stomach.  The Cafe Espresso didn't at all, so I was leery to switch to something else.  I figured I'd give the Crema e Gusto a try and if it was too much for my stomach, I'd switch back.  No worries.  Not only is this a smooth blend, it has a richer taste than the Cafe Espresso.  I won't need to switch back!

review/summary: You have to try this!
review/text: I have always loved the coffee in Italy and it's the only place where I consistently drink cappuccinos - no bitterness, bite or overwhelming strong flavor, just great coffee.  Until we decided to give this coffee I try, we were unable to duplicate that Italian espresso flavor.  Now we can!  We've given up all of our other gourmet espresso blends and drink only this in our lattes, cappuccinos, mochas and Americanos.  And everyone we've shared this coffee with has done the same!  Try it - I'll be surprised if you're disappointed!

review/text: If you are avid coffee espresso drinker look no further. This coffee comes perfectly pre-ground for espresso drinks. This espresso has a smooth rich flavor that is not too strong with a hint of a chocolate aftertaste. Warning after you drink this coffee a couple of times you will be hooked. If I had to compare this to Starbucks latt&eacute;'s, the Lavazza has a more refined and smoother flavor without the bitter burnt taste that Starbucks has.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />John S.

review/text: I tied Lavazza at a coffee house in Milano and really enjoyed the taste. It doesn't have the bitterness that you find in almost all coffee houses in US. It is very full flavored coffee. I couldn't find it in US, not even at small European food stores. I searched online and Amazon has the best deal if you sign for regular delivery. You don't have to spend $300 to $400 for an espresso machine when you have an excellent quality coffee.
