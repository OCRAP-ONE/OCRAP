review/text: I agree with the other reviews that the Starbucks t-discs are superior to any other brand in their quality and design, but Caffe Verona tastes terrible! Maybe I got a bad batch, but this is bitter, nasty coffee. I love their Breakfast Blend. House Blend and Africa Kitamu are nice, but this Caffe Verona is heinous.

review/summary: Good news, Coco Wheats lovers!
review/text: I was born in Wisconsin, where my family learned to love Coco Wheats.  When we moved to California and couldn't get it any more, my mother cooked Cream of Wheat mixed with a little powdered cocoa and voila!  Coco Wheats!  We kept a canister of Cream of Wheat and cocoa already mixed to save time in the morning.  I would say about a level teaspoon of cocoa per cup of dry Cream of Wheat would be the right ratio, but it's a matter of personal taste.  I try to go easy on the cocoa so that I can go easy on the sweetener.<br /><br />We sweetened it with way too much sugar as children, but I have found as an adult that you can actually accustom yourself to adding very little sugar and still enjoy it.  I use brown sugar, as I think it gives you the most sweetener bang for your buck.  My mother used Hershey's cocoa, but something more upscale would be even better.  I've found that hot cocoa mix works as well and eliminates the need to add sweetener.  I sometimes add cinnamon, vanilla, or other flavors and, if I'm feeling really virtuous, brewer's yeast.  I have also cooked oatmeal this way, with equally satisfactory results.<br /><br />The bottom line is you never have to go without Coco Wheats again if you can't buy it locally and don't want to order a case on-line.<br /><br />I took off one star for nutrition, since this is, after all, a refined and sweetened American breakfast food.  It's a guilty pleasure, but delicious!

review/summary: Favorite Hot Cereal (Besides Oatmeal)
review/text: This is a really good tasting hot breakfast cereal, that is getting tougher to find on grocery shelves.  I grew up with CoCo Wheats as a regular breakfast before school and/or work.  It can be made on the stove top or in the microwave.  It takes less than 2 minutes to make.  It has the following ingredients:  Wheat Farina, Cocoa, Calcium Phosphate, Artificial Flavors, Vitamin C, Niacin, Iron, Folate, Vitamin B12, B6, B2, And B1.<br />It has 200 calories per serving, of which only 10 come from fat.  It has 2 grams fiber.  It supplies about 25% of the essential Vitamin B's we need each day. There are 14 servings per box. Tip: make sure the plastic liner inside the box closes tight before placing back on the shelf.  You don't want moisture (or bugs) to get in the cereal!<br /><br />I have tried various toppings for sweetness: splenda (no calories), honey, maple syrup, and granular brown or white sugar.  My favorite is clover honey.  Pour on some milk, or a milk alternative like rice milk, almond milk, or soymilk before eating.  It really does taste delicious.<br /><br />No, it is not an all-natural cereal, but it sure tastes good, and is filling.  I like it.<br /><br />konedog

review/text: This cereal is sooooooo good. I've been eating CoCo Wheats for over 50 years and never get tired of it. It is sugar free so you can sweeten it to your taste with either sugar or a sugar substitute. And it's salt free to so you can add salt, a salt substitute, or nothing at all. Plus, it is fortified with calcium, iron, and vitamins. While it is a healthy, hot cereal for kids there is no law stating adults can't enjoy it to. I'm thrilled it can be ordered online since it isn't available in the Northwest. When I go back to Pittsburgh for a visit, or a friend from the "burgh" flies out to visit me, there are always boxes of CoCo Wheats packed in one of the suitcases. Gotta have my CoCo Wheats.

review/summary: Went from awesome to terrible recently
review/text: I used to be an ardent fan of Parle-G. There was a whole shelf in our kitchen dedicated to PG packets. However, they recently changed something in their recipe - the new biscuits look different, are slighly thicker and less dense, taste quite different (and slightly burnt, I must say) as compared to the old ones. The packet cover has changed ever so slightly, so thankfully, I can tell if a retailer has the old style or the new style cookies. Unfortunately, no one in the bay area has the old style any more, so no more P-G for me. I'm not sure why they had to mess with something that was working so well for them. Maybe in their opinion (and in that of the focus group that they worked with) the new ones are better. However, I and a few of my friends agree that it's time to re-allocate that shelf space in my kitchen to other snacks. Britannia Bourbons, maybe?

review/text: I received a Christmas gift coupon to Amazon, and decided to splurge on The Fantastic Feast. Everything in it was beyond expectations.  The hot dogs were the best we have ever had. They are HUGE!  So tasty too.  The stuffed sole was better than restaurant fare.  Great juicy beefy burgers.  I wasn't expecting much of the chicken breasts, I figured boneless chicken breast is boneless chicken breast... but they were unbelievably moist and delicious.  The center cut pork chops were flavorful and juicy!  Of course the sirloin steaks were wonderful as well, and the potatoes were a quick and delicious side.  So much in that magical cooler!  The quality of Omaha Steak products is truly exceptional.  I would not hesitate to purchase one of the combo packs again.  My only negative is that the shipping prices are high. I was actually ordering 8 hot dogs earlier today for 9.99 and they wanted 14.99 for shipping!  I decided against that purchase... Money is tight, and lower shipping costs would help us all out!  Fortunately for me there is a retail store nearby my home, which I plan on visiting soon!

review/summary: so disappointed ~ will not order Omaha steaks again
review/text: I finally decided to order a variety package deal knowing I could get stuffed sole (scallops and crabmeat) with steaks as well as various other things. Tried the steaks first and while I was disappointed with the size I do say they are way more properly portioned than what I usually get. They are quite thin and are okay at best but definitely not worth the money. Next we tried the potatoes au gratin and I liked that they were different than the sliced stuff in a casserole dish I remember having as a kid (never liked them before) but these were potato balls and while they looked really good they fell short of what I was expecting and my expectations were not that high. One of those deals where the first bite is pretty good and it just goes down hill from there ~ by the time I was done with the first one I didn't care to eat the second one. They seemed like processed frozen food rather than a gourmet type item. I had just always thought "Ohama Steaks" and figured for the price everything would be that of a high-end steakhouse in quality but it isn't even in the ball park of a high-end steakhouse.<br /><br />So... what has prompted me to finally write (I wasn't going to) was tonight I tried the stuffed sole. I had one a while back "just to see" and while it seemed really bland it was so-so, so I thought I'd prepare a side dish (my own mashed potatoes) with it this time and give it another shot. (I'm a nut for anything crab and scallop.) Being hungry I baked 2 of them. Again I was disappointed with how bland it was but when I started finding BONES in my mouth that was it. BOTH of them had little bones.<br /><br />It was obviously a waste of time and money and I don't even care about the rest of the food. I may try to see if I can give it away. I am simply not interested and having paid that much money for this stuff and it tasting like some cheap clearance item, not to mention the BONES!! That is just not acceptable to me. I'm glad it wasn't one of my kids eating it.<br /><br />I would have left this review on their website but, oh my, I couldn't find a page to do that on their website. I wonder why??

They were large, sweet, plump and just like the other brand of Medjool dates. Of course now Amazon is short on the other dates so I went with the dates from the Bergen Nut company and paid more and was seriously disappointed in the quality of the dates.<br /><br />So when they are in stock my suggestion would be to stock up on a couple packs if you are really into eating dates daily. I find myself missing these little beauties now that we have run out and they are worth the price as they are very healthy and loaded with vitamins and minerals. Speaking of price - if you are wondering - yes these are a solid value compared to others. The packages are large, larger than the Caramel Naturale dates I had been buying.<br /><br />These are also delicious over ice cream, search around for some recipes. I know Anthony Bourdain did a show where they showed chopped dates in a milkshake which looked sublime..:)<br /><br />Wholeheartedly recommend!<br />And as a side note, if you purchase from Amazon and ever have issue with the quality of a purchase CALL them! They have the best CS on earth (and I have been shopping online for 12 years now so I know) and they want to make right if you are displeased.

review/text: I just wolfed down 4 of these delicious dates. I love dates and these are as good as any I've ever had. Though I ordered with Amazon Prime two day shipping but it took 4 business days to arrive. The packaging is quite convenient. I would definitely order these again... though I now have 4 lbs in my fridge so it will be a while!

review/summary: Good dates but the organic version is better...
review/text: I have bought the organic version of these dates 3 times.  The quality was slipping a little so I thought I would try the non organic version, save a few dollars & maybe they would be comparable.<br /><br />These non organic dates are very good, have wonderful sweetness & deep flavor BUT they are a bit more tough & leathery in texture.  The skins are also a bit more papery.  They are not bad, they are better than most supermarket medjool dates & miles better than the chopped up kind in the baking aisle, but I do think it's worth the extra couple dollars to buy the organic version.  Possible health benefits aside (I'm not qualified to give that kind of advice), the organic are just better for eating out of hand; the texture & flavor is better.<br /><br />I like these for dessert. I have a 1/2 Cup of plain Greek yogurt (Fage 2% is my favorite) & 1 or 2 of these dates. My sweet tooth is completely satisfied by the dates and the yogurt is like eating pudding; delicious and healthy. Also great as an appetizer: just make a slit in the date, take the pit out & put in goat cheese, blue cheese, mascarpone or any creamy cheese. Warm them under the broiler for about 3 minutes or skip the broiler & eat at room temp. Or go all out & wrap bacon or prosciutto around the stuffed date & broil for about 4-5 minutes, turning them after about 3 minutes. The combination of salty and sweet is delicious.<br /><br />I have not found it necessary to store the dates in the refrigerator and I prefer to eat them at room temperature. I just store them in an airtight container in the cupboard after opening the package.<br /><br />The plastic container is recyclable: 1 PETE<br /><br />If you want to save a couple bucks & you're going to cook with the dates, these non organic dates would be very good.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NWIQWW">United With Earth Organic Medjool Dates, 16-Ounce Containers (Pack of 4)</a><br />I reviewed these w/updates:  Katawampas

review/summary: Pecan Pie
review/text: I would not say these dates are juicy at all but they are mildly sweet. They do contain pits so you have to remove the pit before eating them. They are quite delicious on their own but I recently read a recipe where you put a pecan inside each date and it sort of tastes like pecan pie. So these are good as a raw foods snack. You might also want to know that these are high in potassium, have lots of fiber and are high in antioxidants.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Bought these based on previous reviews.  I live in CA and dates are plentiful, but I hate shopping so I try to get as much as I can through Amazon. These don't compare at all to what is normally available locally.  Too dry, not all that sweet.  They seem like they've been on the shelf a long, long time and the packaging can't deal with it.  I didn't expect dates like I'd get in Indio, but I certainly won't be buying these again.  I may be spoiled becasuse of where I live, but if I have to spend the same amount of money, I'll just buy them locally and be sure of the quality.

They were small in size and some were very very dry. I'm not sure if they were really Medjool dates at all, they were different from the ones I usually have. Not very happy with this purchase. I'm giving 1 star since this is edible and can be consumed regardless.

review/summary: really good dates
review/text: I normally buy medjool dates in bulk from my food club, but thought I'd try these packaged ones.  They are large, moist and delicious.  I really like that they come in sealed one pound packages rather than the several pounds I buy from my food club because in their little box they stay much fresher in the refrigerator.  I would recommend these dates and will buy them again. You can cut & seed them and fill them with cream cheese or goat cheese and top with a walnut half for a delicious dessert or snack. They also make a wonderful pie crust:  take 3/4 cup of dates, remove seeds and grind them into a paste in a food processor and add 1 1/2 cup of walnuts and grind to blend together.  Then press into an 8" pie pan.  Chill an hour and then add your favorite no bake filling.  No baking, no flour, no eggs.  No fuss.  Just delicious!

review/summary: The Best Chili Seasoning!
review/text: I've tried all of the chili seasonings and McCormick is definitely the best. McCormick Chili seasoning makes the best chili that I've ever tasted. I've even tried making it from scratch with chili powder and it wasn't half as good as McCormick seasoning.<br /><br />It's so easy to whip up a batch of delicious chili with these packets. I make it in my crockpot and it takes very little time to assemble the ingredients, especially if you've already cooked the ground beef in advance. You just empty some cans of diced tomatoes and kidney beans into the crockpot. Add the cooked ground beef and McCormicks seasoning and you'll have an economical and delicious dinner that makes the whole house smell great.<br /><br />I was excited when I saw Amazon started carrying this product in a 24 pack box. My local stores charge up to $2 for each packet. When I make chili, I usually make a huge pot that requires 3 seasoning pouches. When you buy the packets at full price, it can really add up. I'm stocked up on my favorite chili seasoning now. I've got enough packets to make about 8 big pots of Chili this winter. I will continue to purchase this item from Amazon as long as they carry it for such a good price. With subscribe and save, I paid about 1/2 of what I'd pay in the regular grocery store.

review/summary: Don't Mess With A Good Chili Recipe!
review/text: McCormick's time-tested chili recipe is simple and delicious, mostly due to this chili mix. There's no downside at all. The recipe is simple, the ingredients are inexpensive, and the results are sure to please. This chili actually seems to get better on the second or third day after making it. Despite the fact that most of the ingredients come in cans (and this packet comes in... well... a packet), when you combine them you get fresh, hot, bubbling chili on the stove.<br /><br />These bulk packs of McCormick Chili Seasoning offer a great deal, especially because you'll probably want to double or triple the recipe. I actually made six batches at once, and it lasted us a long time.<br /><br />If you buy this chili mix and the other ingredients in large quantities, you can make a LOT of delicious food at a surprisingly low price per bowl.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: You will likely find this review to be quite strange.  But here goes ...<br /><br />As apple juice go, I find this product to be the BEST TASTING one of its kind in these single serving, sipit straw, carton containers.  That said, I HATE, HATE, HATE this type of packaging for juice.  Actually, I still prefer the old fashion GLASS container for juice, but I have learned to accept the waxed carton and REFUSE to use the canned variety.  As cartons go, I do not detect "off" taste I usually find with cartoned drinks.<br /><br />Now for the wierd part ...<br /><br />There is a laxative product called MiraLAX that I use.  The directions state to stir and dissolve the measured amount in any 4-8 ounces of beverage ... then drink.  Well, I used to just pick ANY beverage until one time when I used this Hansen's Natural Apple Juice on hand.  The carton was JUST the right amount.  The powder dissovle easily.  The taste was good, especially at room temperature.  But the best part was the effectiveness of the medicine and the elimination of uncomfortable side effects.  At first I thought it was just the apple juice and the pectin it contains.  However, I tried other brands of apple juice and could not get the same results.  Other family members use the MiraLAX and get inconsistent results.  When they visit and they need a "little help" I mix the LAX with a carton of my Hansen's and they get significantly better results with the same consistency as I.<br /><br />I buy cases of the product on the Amazon Subscription plan, so that, I ALWAYS have some in the house.  Now, this product is good enough just to drink for a snack, but I do not keep it on the pantry shelf or in the fridge.  It is kept back on the bottom shelf of one of my cabinets.  Or else, I would be spending too much money in restocking costs.

review/text: I buy this for my mother, who loves this product. I have heard great things about this from my aunts and uncles too.<br />I usually buy in large quantities (15 sachets per box, and about 18 boxes)(or 9 bags of 30 sachets/bag - if the count is 30, then they come in a large plastic bag instead of a little box) for my mother from the veryasia website directly because it has a flat rate shipping of $4.99. They carry this at the local Asian grocery store too, and it is around the ballpark of $4-5 per box of 15. The 30 count one usually is around $8. The direct website's price (veryasia) is around that price too. However, it would cost me more than $4.99 to ship all that to my mother, so that's why I order it.  I have placed about 3 or 4 of my large orders already. I do an order every 5 months, and they all have arrived well.

This one weighs in at 14.3 oz out of the packing box.  I've yet to determine what it will weight when it needs water.  The seller did send a paper with Bonsai care instructions.  That was nice.  All in all, the plant seems to be okay.  It looks exactly like the photo.

review/text: The item that I ordered was a "35 Pack Value Bag" but the value went down considerably when what I received was only 21 in each pack.  That means, for two packages, I received 28 fewer than advertised - almost another whole package and certainly another package of 21.  Either the listing or the price needs to change.  Still I rated the item as highly as I did because the ultimate customer is my dog and he loves them.  So, if you order them, be sure to check the number in the bags you actually receive (hopefully they'll correct the problem by then) but treat your dog to them, without reservation!

review/text: they pulled the old bait and switch, nothing to see here now folks. once a five star sauce lineup has become a 1 star mess. my advice? fire whatever new chefs you hired, because i prefer the cheaper pasty sauces over this chunky seed mess. apparently they must've forgotten what cheesecloth is, i shouldnt have to strain their sauces myself just to get an average flavor that totally is not worth 9 bucks anymore.

review/summary: Healthy and tasty cat food
review/text: Wellness is the only canned food I buy for my cats. I has no by products, preservatives or any artificial junk. No grain, and it's first four ingredients are good meats. My cats love it (even the finicky one) and I'm happy there is at least one cat food company out there that provides nutritious pet food. Thank you Wellness! Buying this is chaper than buying in the store as well, I think if you buy the same amount in the store you pay about 13 dollars more. Just be aware of the fact that you  need a can opener to open these cans.

review/text: I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.

review/text: I recently did a bunch of research on Cat nutrition, and my conclusion was that the Wellness cat foods offered the best combination of excellent nutrition, good variety, and affordability.  So I bought some for my crotchety, picky, 16+ year old cat who had been eating Nutro.  To my great relief, she accepted the switch without complaint!<br /><br />Although I haven't had a long history with this cat food yet, I've been pleased with the results so far, and based on my research I'm convinced I'm doing right by my furry friend.  I certainly recommend it.

review/summary: difficult to review for a cat but...
review/text: The product seemed great from the human viewpoint: high protein, no grain, quality ingredients and relatively reasonably priced on Amazon. However, my cats would not touch the food. I have one, older female, slightly fussy part Maine coon and a second, very large young male, an outdoor stray who has adopted us. Neither of them would eat it, both preferred the dry food  (Wellness Salmon). I usually give them both wet and dry food. The wet food, a different brand, is always eaten first but this time, both bowls of Wellness Canned cat food were left pretty much untouched after the first taste and remained so until I tossed the food the next day! I know cats are very particular ...they often dislike something for no reason I can understand and it doesn't necessarily imply a faulty product ...  but if a young, hungry stray decides against it, in this case, I reckon something is off with the product.

These brands even have by-products in their canned food.<br /><br />Cats are carnivores so the majority of their diet needs to be meat (aside from the small amount of veggies you might find in a mouse's or rabbit's stomach in the wild).<br /><br />Aside from that, my cat LOVES this food and it is very good for him. He eats a variety of flavors so he doesn't get sick of one.

review/text: My cats do like the food, although when I first started to feed them they kind of picked at it. Now I feed them only this food and a little bit of the dry food from this company and its no problem. My one cat was over weight and he is now more active and running around with the other cats and he looks much healthier and younger. I have one cat that vomits a lot and have had to buy special vet food, which helped him stop vomiting and he can eat this food too with no problem. I will say that the cats do like the chicken and herring recipe better, I think they like fish in general more then poultry. I do highly recommend this food, its worth the price, considering the vet food is just as expensive and there are lots of pork by-products and low quality grains in the ingredient list.

I fed them a  few times a day, and within  a week they had more energy, and were putting on weight.  Within a month their coat was soft and shinny.  These cats did a total turn around and I believe that this fine food saved their lives.  I continued feeding the cats this food  because I am confident that the high protein and natural antioxidants will keep my cats healthy and it will also keep the cats hydrated.  I am very pleased with this food.  It is the next best thing to a raw diet.<br />Wellness Complete Health Canned Cat Food, Chicken Recipe (Pack of 12 12.5-Ounce Cans)

review/text: I haven't bought Wellness through Amazon yet, but the prices are very competitive and will do so.  After discovering they carried Wellness, wanted to comment on the product.  When I adopted my cat, she came with unrevealed health problems.  She was on a nebulizer every day, no energy, vomiting and more.  As one reviewer stated, I did some internet research.  I tried some of the top of the line natural foods.  Once I got her on the Wellness wet food, her health was a complete turnaround.  She's twelve and acts like four or five years of age.  No more health problems.  The consistency is smooth, a potential problem for a lot of cats that won't eat chunky foods.  I absolutely can not recommend this food more highly.  The dry, is very small pieces and she's slow to eat it, but I keep it as a 'treat' food.  The wet is perfect in every way.

review/text: After my vet recommended switching from the basic Petsmart variety lo quality dry food, I tried Wellness canned cat food (even though the price was at least 3 times more expensive than the old Pro Plan).  My one cat would regularly throw up immediately following a meal of Pro Plan dry food.  The results now are that my cat has not thrown up in the 3 weeks since he has been on this food. I trust my vet and will continue to feed this food. My local Food Co-Op carries this food and it is cheaper than the vet's price.  My cat's health is important to me.<br />I switch between the chicken and the salmon varieties.  My 4 cats get 1/2 can(of a 5.5 ounce can) each - a day, plus, I also give them 3 tablespoons of the Wellness dry food a day.  Try it for a month and you will be pleased with the results!

But This time I noticed that this item, ordered FROM Amazon, was being promoted as a 2 day shipping item, despite having Prime Membership, and I needed it as soon as possible. After about a week of ordering this '2 day shipping item' i received notification that it had not yet shipped and was expected to be delivered a month later! The reasoning I was given was that if I order from Amazon.com directly I should expect a month wait time and they were out of stock. 1-I received no notification that the item was out of stock. 2-Don't promote something as a special with 2 day shipping when you don't mean it. People order things based on delivery time for a reason. I'm angry that I wasted my time and was relying for the food to get here in a timely manner. I will not order directly from Amazon again.

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Healthy Canned Diet
review/text: Until I am able to make my own raw diet for my cat, I purchase this food for her, and I've been able to tell a noticeable difference in her health and energy levels. I used to feed her Purina One dry food, but after a ton of research and questions, I'm slowly figuring out what she really needs to thrive. Wellness uses human-grade ingredients, and while I don't care for the Guar Gum or Carageenan additives, it's still a product worth buying.<br /><br />With regards to the one star rating, shame on you for buying from a breeder, and for passing up "health food" for your pets. Just because they can survive on cheap food that doesn't use natural ingredients, doesn't mean it's good for them. Children can survive on a diet of sugar cereal and cheeseburgers, but no responsible parent would feed that to them, either. If you love your kids, you make them eat their vegetables.<br /><br />In conclusion, it may take a little while for your kitty to accept natural food that isn't filled with nasty additives and flavorings to make it stinky, but when they do you will see an improvement! I also recommend Natural Balance canned food, another good quality diet. Raw food is best, but high quality canned food is still head and shoulders above dry kibble diets.

People scramble to find why their cat suddenly won't eat it ("they've been eating Wellness for years!"), and end up blaming it on the company.<br /><br />It's not necessarily the company's fault. It's at least partially your fault for creating a routine in which you allowed your cat to become so finicky.<br /><br />As a human, there are a few brands I prefer simply because I grew up with them, and I know the taste of those brands blind-folded. I'm finicky about them.  Cats are *super*-sensitive and can taste even the smallest changes - including the plant their can of food was processed from!!!<br /><br />Don't let your cat become so finicky by feeding only one brand or flavor or variety consistently for years.  Mix it up.  Wellness may be the best, but there are several high-quality brands of canned cat food on the market in the U.S. today -- look into them.<br /><br />I highly recommend rotating a few brands of high-quality canned foods if you have any problems with feeding Wellness to your cat, and even if you're not. Wellness is still a great brand of food (the best in my opinion), still containing the same high-quality ingredients as it ever did.  My cat loves it and I feed several flavors (Chicken, Beef & Chicken, Turkey) as part of his rotation.

review/summary: Different Poduct Than What's in the Store.
review/text: We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience.

review/summary: Our cats no longer will touch any of it.
review/text: We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.  MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore.  They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it.  Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal.  We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned.  Same thing.  We wonder what's in there they no longer will eat.

review/summary: wellness canned cat food
review/text: We bought a case of this cat food and our cats liked it and seemed to do well.  After it was gone, we bought a 2nd case and all 3 of our cats became violently ill and vomited after eating it.  Thought it might have been a bad can so we tossed what was left.  Gave them another can the next day and same thing, all three cats became sick, vomited, lethargic and stopped eating for several days.  We went back to a food from our vets and now after several days they are OK again and eating normally.  I don't know if this was just a bad case of food or if Wellness has a quality control problem, but I would hesitate to purchase another product from Wellness.

review/summary: My 2 cats love cubed Wellness food
review/text: I only feed Wellness to my cats - grain free is what I like the most about this brand.  In the wild, they would never eat grain, so why feed low quality, grain filled foods at home?<br /><br />Wellness ingredients are stellar, I'd eat this food.  First ingredient is plain turkey.<br /><br />Wellness Cubed 3oz varieties are my cat's favorites.  Sliced type is second, minced is third.  I also feed Wellness pouches and pate styles, plus Core as well.<br /><br />Cube size is approximately 1/3rd of an inch.<br /><br />Turkey is what I prefer to feed them, Salmon and Tuna are their favorite, but I try to feed less fish, make sure they get plenty of high protein turkey instead.<br /><br />Analysis:<br />Crude Protein  Not Less Than  8.0%<br />Crude Fat  Not Less Than  4.0%<br />Crude Fiber  Not More Than  1.0%<br />Moisture  Not More Than  82.0%<br />Ash  Not More Than  2.8%<br />Magnesium  Not More Than  0.025%<br />Taurine  Not Less Than  0.05%<br /><br />Ingredients: Turkey, Turkey Broth, Water Sufficient for Processing, Peas, Dried Egg Whites, Natural Flavor, Dried Egg Product, Guar Gum, Spinach, Sodium Phosphate, Ground Flaxseed, Salt, Potassium Chloride, Cranberries, Minerals (Iron Amino Acid Chelate, Zinc Amino Acid Chelate, Cobalt Amino Acid Chelate, Copper Amino Acid Chelate, Manganese Amino Acid Chelate, Sodium Selenite, Potassium Iodide), Carrageenan, Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin E Supplement, Thiamine Mononitrate, Niacin, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Folic Acid), Choline Chloride.

review/summary: My cats don't like it
review/text: If my cats could leave reviews they would probably give this product a 1 star. Fortunately they can't, so I'm giving it a 3 stars for effort :)  I realize that different cats used to different foods, however mine for some reason would rather starve than eat turkey formula cat food from Wellness. Otherwise I trust Wellness brand, they seem to put good ingredients, and no grains.<br />Also there was no mentioning anywhere about quantity. It comes in 12 large cans.<br />Before getting it tho, I suggest you go to local Petco and get a smaller can of same Turkey formula and check if your cats will eat it.

review/summary: Our 2 Kittens Love It
review/text: Our 2 kittens who are now 5 months old love Wellness Canned Kitten Food. They lick their dishes clean. And I feel very  good giving them a healthy food to eat.<br /><br />I've been so happy with the canned food orders I've placed with Petco. Have had trouble with orders coming from other companies arriving dented. Petco packages them very well and I have not received one dented can yet. Fast shipping too.

review/summary: Superior nutrition at excellent savings
review/text: My 14 year old feline - Archie - was diagnosed with diabetes 2 weeks ago.  His diet for the previous 6 years consisted solely of Science Diet (adult/senior/light/age defying)kibble and a small amount of Friskie's canned at dinner time.  Per his veterinarians instructions to feed only high quality canned (wet) foods, I purchased Science Diet MD for diabetic cats.  Over the course of the following 3 days, there was no significant change in Archie's blood glucose which prompted me to start investigating cat foods a little more thoroughly.<br /><br />As stated on the Science Diet MD label, their carbohydrate content tested at 13%.  This seemed very high to me as diabetes maintenance is nearly ALL about carbohydrates.<br /><br />I discovered that Wellness brand Chicken tested at 4% carbohydrates. The fat content, at 60%, is higher than I'd like, but I'm okay with that, at least for the time being.  Archie's blood glucose plummeted 100 points within 24 hours of his first meal of Wellness Chicken.<br /><br />At less than $3.00 per 12.5 oz. (Amazon price PLUS free shipping)compared to Science Diet MD at $2.75 per 5.5 oz., Wellness also wins in the cost category. A double win X2 as I live in Alaska which is prone to unnecessary and outrageous shipping fees from unscrupulous/lazy vendors.<br /><br />Wellness Chicken is not vegetable free - it does contain peas and potato fillers (among others) but it is grain free which is also in it's favor.  Cats, after all, are carnivores.  It makes sense to me that their diet reflect this as much as possible/affordable.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: Cats love it! And it's a brand I trust. Cats only get canned food once a week, and this does not adversely affect kitty tummies or the litter box between dry food meals.

review/text: My 6 month old kittens won't touch Wellness Kitten canned food.  I'm sure it's good for them but I can't get them to eat it.  I've tried on 2 separate occasions without any success.  One of my kittens is very finicky but the other one eats almost anything so I've given up on this brand.

review/summary: Wellness Rocks...!!!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Wellness, as well as a few other holistic brands of animal food. I am new to this product, as we have just been adopted by a brother and sister pair. This is even better than the adult formula we were giving them in the mean time, because this satiates them by giving them more of what they need, so I actually have to feed them less.<br /><br />To those poo-pooing the fruits, veggies, seeds etc., the protein and fat content are the highest you can find outside of making it yourself, and you would still find yourself having to add these items. Even though cats are true carnivores and most wouldn't eat these other things by themselves in the wild, the fact is is that they DO eat non-meat items, when they eat their prey. They don't just eat muscle, they also eat the contents of the intestines, stomach, crops, and gizzards, and many try to get in the skull for the fats and lipids (because most wild prey will be very lean this is often the only place to get them). The trick is getting everything in the right proportions, and using actual, nutritious food.<br /><br />The price, yes, it is more. But, my family has had many, many, animals over the last 25 years, and we have seen the difference that a GOOD diet makes. And in the long run, it can help save an awful lot in vet bills.

review/summary: Cats love the food, but no pull-tab top, and dented cans.
review/text: I appreciate being able to buy this larger, more economical size from Amazon.  However, I didn't examine the picture closely enough, because I was surprised to see that the cans were not pull-tab and I had to dig out a can opener.  Inconvenient, especially since I feed my cats in the laundry room in the basement, not in our tiny kitchen.  Five or six of the cans were dented (I ordered a total of 24), a couple pretty severely.  I'm not sure what the box went through with the shippers, but even the cans need better padding!
