review/summary: Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]
review/text: ASIN B0029XLH4Y - All right, I'm going to start by saying something negative about the Keurig coffee makers, which I will later explain better in my review of IT. Here goes: this coffee maker makes the weakest dang coffee in the history of the free world. You get a choice when brewing: itty bitty cup of semi-strong brew or sort-of-big cup of brown caffeinated water. This displeases me. I bought the thing because I love coffee and would like to mainline it but cannot. Now, I've learned to live with and even get around some of the deficiencies of the maker, but finding the coffee that makes the maker look good... tough job, but someone's got to do it.<br /><br />Jet Fuel is fantastic. It makes Keurig look like the geniuses they ought to be. This stuff is strong enough to overcome the wimpy options of the maker and then some. It's not bitter, but it might taste bitter to folks who aren't hardcore coffee drinkers. To me, that "bitter" taste is sharp, crisp and maybe a little chocolate-like. This is the stuff to wake up to, the perfect morning jolt.<br /><br />If there's a true negative for me, it's the individual cup issue, from the ecological point of view. You get a plastic cup with a foil lid and, inside, a small paper filter filled with grounds. It is, generally, thrown away as one piece. This means that the (unnumbered) cups, which may be recyclable, cannot be put with the plastics; the foil cannot be put with the rest of the foil; the biodegradable filter and grounds not only don't go into the composter, but they'll biodegrade very slowly, deprived of air, sun and water in their little foil and plastic casing. It's possible to take the thing apart and deal with the individual pieces appropriately, but that defeats the convenience factor of the maker. Someone's got to design a better k-cup, but I can't take points away from Jet Fuel for a flaw that all k-cups share.  On the up side of the packaging, Amazon's packaging is awesome - not just frustration free, but 100% recyclable!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/summary: the best coffee..the best deal
review/text: I like strong black coffee. I like it to taste strong, have body, & wake me up. The way to make strong coffee is use more grounds per water, but that doesn't guarantee it tastes good . "Jet Fuel" tastes good & wakes me up. It seems at least a time-&-a-half stronger than most other coffees, is full-bodied, &  is consistently, equally great cup after cup: I've had a hundred of them so far. It's my favorite. I bought 50 cups on sale for $20, but the regular price at the time was only $21! Since you'll probably only need one cup in the morning, it's a great deal. Also: It arrived less than 48 hours after the order was put in

review/summary: High Qulaity Seeds, Sweet Bourbon flavor
review/text: 5.0 out of 5 stars High Qulaity Seeds, Sweet Bourbon flavor, April 4, 2008<br /><br />My work mates and I have been snacking on these seeds for three months now. We're happy to see they finally made it onto Amazon. There are two things going for these seeds: the quality of the seeds themselves and the interesting Bourbon flavor.<br /><br />As opposed to an other non-premium brand sunflower seed, these seeds are far larger and thus "meatier". The seed inside is a satisfying size and the shells seem more moist and thus do not split into an unmanageable number of shards when split. The quality is on par with the "Spitz" brand from Canada for seed connoisseurs.<br /><br />The flavor of these seeds is also interesting. Rather than deriving most of their flavor from salt, soaking the seeds in bourbon gives them a slight, pleasant sugary flavor which is then complimented by your traditional salty or spicy flavors. The sweet taste is unnoticeable at first but can be perceived with prompting. The main benefit is that the seeds are less salty than competitors and thus more can be consumed without getting a case of "dry tongue".<br /><br />All in all, a great product and a great addition to the Amazon grocery catalog. The price is right as well.<br /><br />Out of the three Jim Beam flavors, I think this one is second best. Hence the 4 star rating for this flavor. BBQ gets 5 stars and original also 4 stars.

review/summary: Big seeds with great flavor
review/text: I ordered a 12-pack of these after reading many favorable reviews, and they've been as good as I'd hoped.  The seeds are a good size - far bigger than you'll find with the David's brand - and the flavor has been consistently strong as I've already gone through several bags.  They're very salty, but that salt combined with the jalapeno flavoring just enhances the taste.<br /><br />After having snacked on plain David's seeds throughout the day, this product has been a big step up.  I've been whipping through them, and I've already hooked a coworker on them too.  I'd heartily recommend these to anyone looking for good-tasting seeds.

review/summary: this is my third order, same brand same package, but taste so different
review/text: This is my third order within 2 months from Amazon on the Jim Beam Jalapeno Sunflower seeds. I went though average a pack a day for the first two orders, the seeds are not that spicy and salty outside, and so flavorful inside.  It's so addicative and I was so happy that I finally found my favor snack.  I gave both 5 star reviews on the first two orders.<br />Now this order I received is a totally different story, same brand; same package; but taste so different (the bad way) that I thought I ordered from some other brands. The package does say it's roasted by BIGs now, It's really Salty and spicy outside, but inside has no taste at all.  I opened the first bag two days ago and still have more than half left.  I dun know when am I going to finish all 12 packs of them, but I am sure I won't be ordering Jim Beam sunflower seed again.

review/text: I have access to a military base and they carried these. I got hooked on them. I like the size of the seeds, they are bigger than David seeds. I really like the spicy kick they have. After trying them all other seeds do not have enough flavor. Unfortunately the base stopped carrying this flavor. I have been unable to locate it in any stores in my area. So now I am forced to order them online. Oh well, these seeds are so good, I dont mind. As long as I can still get them I am Happy.

review/text: I've been alternating between this and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031O4B16">Magnum Jamaican Blue Mountain Blend Coffee, Whole Bean, 2 Lb Bag</a> as my everyday coffee, and I find the flavor of this coffee still entertains my palate, while the Magnum has become boring with repetition.<br />Yeah I know -- a very subjective review! Of course your mileage may vary, but here's a good coffee at a reasoable price.

review/summary: Not true blue, but Irie!
review/text: I've been a fan of Reggie's Roast for quite a while now. I've tried the Terrazu and the other blue mountain blend they offer and have been please with all of them. In fact I have all three set for Subscribe and Save!<br /><br />I recently had gotten some pure Blue Mountain coffee from Jamaica and I wanted to compare it to the Irie Blend from Reggie's. I didn't find it really comparable, but the Reggie's Roast has a great flavor for a blend and is a great way to get some Blue Mountain flavor for a good price. Out of all of the Reggie's Roast coffees I've tried, this has to be my favorite.<br /><br />Reggie's Roast is a good quality coffee company and I will be staying with this company for my day-to-day coffee needs.

review/summary: Very good--better than you'd expect from a non-specialty store
review/text: Received this as a gift from a friend who knows how much we love coffee.  I must admit I was a bit skeptical of coffee from Amazon.  The coffee is very good and fresh--each can is individually sealed and stayed fresh during the week or so it took to finish the can.<br />Flavor is vell-balanced coffee with a bit of the floral and sweeter notes you expect from New World coffees.<br />Technically, it is a blend--not 100% Blue Mountain--if you are a purist.  But coffee is often enhanced by blending and this is no exception.<br />I definitely plan to buy more Reggie's!

review/summary: Grinding to dust
review/text: When I started grinding the beans I noticed a slight haze coming from the grinder.. The coffee smelled great but when I went to put into the filters it was dust, not that oily tacky moist but not wet type of grind but this was pure dust like the beans were either very old or roasted to long. I believe if they would sent a fresher batch it probably would have been the best  cup of coffee I ever had. I might try them again, maybe after Christmas. All in all it's a questionable buy, I would have to give them a second try to give a solid  review, but for now I would say it would be a C+ or a B- at best.

review/summary: Buyer beware - (1) whole bean and (2) ground is what I found!
review/text: The rating is driven by the purchase of whole bean and receipt of ground.<br /><br />Excitedly waiting for a Blue Mountain blend, we received the coffee package.  Oddly enough, the first cannister was indeed whole bean and very enjoyable.<br /><br />However, the second cannister was ground; and yes, the third was ground as well.  I opened the other after the first.  After having a few cups of the ground, we ended up buying more Dunkin whole bean.  The ground left much to be desired with taste and freshness.  It is, however, better than some store brands.<br /><br />We are still using the first of the ground cannister as a spare and feel bamboozled.

I was assured by the media that the only product of the Skippy line in question was the reduced-fat line.  3 weeks later I got an email from Amazon saying my product was affected.  Confusing.  We have enjoyed 2 jars already..without worries. I did call Amazon  Customer Service and they told me to follow advice from manufacter...couldn't really explain WHY I got the email in the first place.

review/text: This product has palm oil in it, and as far as "vegetable" oils are concerned its one of the worst oils around. Yes, I suppose the palm oil is natural, but it's a saturated fat and it's NOT healthy. It also has added sugar. Other brands might be a better choice for health conscious consumers as it has only two ingredients, peanuts and salt.

review/summary: Skippy Peanut Butter
review/text: It can be overwhelming knowing that there is so much variety of the amazing Skippy Peanut Butter. For those that like a little crunch there is the Skippy Super Chunk and for those that desire a healthier treat there is the reduced fat creamy AND reduced fat chunk. Of course for those that just don't like salty flavors, there is Skippy Roasted Honey Nut Creamy or Chunk, a combination of peanut butter and real honey for those who have a sweet tooth. Skippy satisfies everyone's peanut butter cravings.<br />Remember when your mom would ask you what you wanted for snack time? Your face would automatically brighten and you would sarcastically say, " Of course I want a PB&J with Skippy." Knowing that you were about to bite into creamy peanut butter goodness just made you believe this was the best part of being a kid. Peanut butter was the topping that makes every meal better, from apple slices to peanut butter cookies. All the people allergic to peanut butter would be jealous because they would not be able to taste the amazing goodness of Skippy Peanut Butter. Its best partner in crime is the fruitful, sweet Smuckers strawberry jelly. What better combination than salty and sweet on a slice of bread. Skippy makes you want to go back to preschool and enjoy a traditional Skippy peanut butter and Smuckers strawberry jelly sandwich!!

review/summary: Horrible for kids
review/text: Just would like all parents to look carefully at the ingredients of skippy. Don't be fooled by the marketing or the bright colors on it. Read the ingredients. Roasted Peanuts, Sugar, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils (Cottonseed, Soybean and Rapeseed) to Prevent Separation, Salt. Sugar is the #2 ingredient in this stuff! Cottonseed oil??? The seed oils aren't even in their natural state: they are hydrogenated which means that they are the equivalent of saturated fats (not polyunsaturated which one could argue might be beneficial). Can you say heart attack in a bottle? Before you go saying this is "Great for kids" think about whether you really want your kids or family eating this crap. Maybe it's cheap, but the doctor bills down the road won't be.

review/summary: Junk Food
review/text: I was eating Earth Balance Natural Peanut Butter for a while, but couldn't resist jumping on a Skippy sale. The taste is by far completely different compared to the Earth Balance. Reading the ingredients on the Skippy jar, I realized there was added sugar and hydrogenated oils. I admit, I have a sweet tooth, but the amount of sugar added here must be used to cover up the filler. You're getting less actual peanut butter and more oil and sugar than other brands. I really liked the taste of the Earth Balance much better as Skippy tasted like candy (which is prob why kids prefer it). Pass on this junk food and ween yourself off the sugar intake. I'll use this to fill the Kong toy for my dogs.

This demonstrates the same proactive business philosophy as its continued use of trans fats. However, I am forced to deduct 4 stars for the inclusion of .3oz of unnecessary peanut butter. Since 16oz is a comfortable number for consumers it is completely unacceptable to include more than 15.5oz. This is especially unfortunate since Skippy already sells its "natural" peanut butter in 15oz jars. Fortunately, we can look forward to this 16.3oz jar being phased out for the already introduced 12oz size. Someday soon I hope to see consumers buying a two dozen of 1.2oz jars of 25% pure peanut butter for only one week's wages.

review/summary: Great candy for a great price!
review/text: I was not let down by this product.  Though I had to wait a few days for it to arrive, when I could just walk down the road and buy one at the gas station, and the price for shipping was a little much, it was well worth the wait.  It came in its own tube, which is braggable, but the M&Ms were smaller than I am used to.  Still, they deliver great taste at a price that even the most underpaid of us can appreciate.

review/text: We just received our first bag of yaky nuggets and immediately had to see what they did when microwaved, so we threw it in for 37seconds.  After about 2 seconds, the microwave started acting like there was a metal spoon in there with the nugget.  So I stopped it and we decided to put it in a coffee cup and tried again.  It worked ok that time...no sparks or loud creepy noises.  Not sure I'm gonna feed them to my dog though, maybe I'll contact the manufacturer first.

review/summary: My dogs ADORE these!!!
review/text: I have two pitbulls with sensitive stomachs, so I have to be careful what I feed them. I first started with the original Himalayan chew, and while my dogs love them, they leave tiny/sharp pieces around everywhere, and eventually get whittled down to small pieces that they can choke on. When I saw the puffs, I decided to try them. They are SO cool.....the bigger pieces take longer than the recommended time to fully puff but they are fabulous! My dogs were so excited and kept sniffing around everywhere to make sure there were no more left to munch on. They were super crunchy, but still seemed lighter than the full blown Himalayan chew. I am so happy I bought these and will recommend these to everyone I know who has dogs. I will definitely be buying this product again!!! THe yaky yams are fabulous too!!!

review/summary: Perfect for sparkling water!
review/text: I bought a SodaStream soda maker several months ago to cut down on the expense of buying carbonated soda water. I gave up artificial sweeteners a few years ago and didn't want to drink sugary drinks, so I hoped that I would be able to use the SodaStream to replace the fairly pricey carbonated water I was buying (LaCroix).<br /><br />I quickly realized that the flavorings for fancy water were not as simple as I'd hoped to replicate. Slicing fruit into the water was messy (and lemons and limes squeezed into the water made it pretty tart). Flavorings stabilized in alcohol are not bad, but they require a fair amount to flavor the water and are not inexpensive--a bottle of lemon extract sells for about $6 at my local grocery store and lasts 1-2 weeks.<br /><br />I finally took a chance and bought this grapefruit essential oil. The first batch I made, I added 10 drops. WAY too much. For the one liter bottle of carbonated water, three drops are just about perfect. At this pace, I believe that the 4 ounce bottle that I bought will last about the rest of my life.<br /><br />In addition to being economical, the oil is very tasty--though, it is obvious from the flavor that the oil comes from the skin of the grapefruit. Not that I've eaten a lot of grapefruit skins, but it tastes exactly like the skin smells as you peel the fruit. I find the taste delicious, but it is different from the taste of the juice of the fruit.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone looking to step back from sugar who doesn't want to give up cold, fizzy drinks. I'm buying this (the smaller size)  for my friends who also have a SodaStream maker.

review/summary: Health? Maybe. Tasty? No way.
review/text: I bought a bag of these at Whole Foods, despite the high price, because they sounds like they'd be good and I was looking for more healthy snacks to have around the house. I was wrong. They're gross. You know the stereotype of the 70's hippy dippy health food that tastes like a cardboard box? That's these "chips". First, they are not crispy. Second, there is little to no flavor to the chip itself. Third, all you're left with in your mouth is the nasty aftertaste of spicy lime. Which I usually like the flavor of, but does't make up for the lack of basic flavor or the unappetizing texture of the chip itself. Don't waste your money, especially at this price for a measly 2.2 ounces.

review/summary: Get out the vacuum!
review/text: My 17-month pit mix loves this chew.  She carries it around the house with her and has chewed on it steadily since I gave it to her a couple of days ago.  From a doggie prospective, this chew is definitely five stars.  However, from a human prospective, the chew leaves behind lots of tiny pieces of chew material (rawhide) on the floor and carpets.  That is, there is chew residue everywhere. So, your dog will love it, but you may not love the cleaning up.<br /><br />After writing the above paragraph, it occurred to me that the reason the chew is so brittle  is because it has been on the shelf too long and has dried out.  I've never seen rawhide break up like this.  Perhaps the seller should refresh its stock or offer a discount for ancient, brittle rawhide chews.

review/summary: Tastes Great But...
review/text: it's like chewing rubber bands. This tastes, for want of a better description, like chewy kippered snacks. They are really delicious but they are very tough and chewy. They are tougher than the Vigo brand but taste better. There's the dilemma. If you want the great taste your jaws are going to get a good workout :-)! If they were a bit more tender they would be awesome.<br /><br />The picture on the can is also a bit deceptive. as they aren't nice neat rounds. They are odd, unevenly cut, random pieces of octopus.

review/summary: A favorite for almost 30 years
review/text: I discovered these morsels almost 30 years ago, and have loved them ever since.  Back in the old days, though, there were more tentacles in the can, which I really liked (hence, only 4 stars).  There was more product in the can back then, too.  But still, I love the taste and texture of this snack, and don't at all think that they're too chewy.  They're certainly not as chewy as the ika salad at the local sushi restaurants.  If you like smoked seafood and you like calamari, I think you'll really like Roland smoked sliced octopus.

I'm using into the fresh kind and never had it in a can before so my guess would be that it's not good in cans. If it wasn't for the texture I may have been able to tolerate it and not give it to my cats.
