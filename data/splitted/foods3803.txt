Jell-O takes minutes in its basic form.<br />Jell-O's great for those with numerous allergies too!It doesn't have the seven most common allergens, WHEAT, SOY, DAIRY, TREE NUTS, SHELL FISH, and EGGS. Jell- O  has no hydrogenated ingredients, and its calorie content is less than the majority of desserts, on the market. Sensitive stomachs can rejoice, with this berry delight.

review/summary: Great training tool
review/text: Our dogs love this!  We use it as a training treat and it works wonderful.  It has a long shelf life but once you open it you need to keep it in the fridge.  I usually cut it up and place it in baggies in the fridge.  Then we just grab the bag when we want to use treats.  The product is easy to handle and won't get your hands messy like other treats. It smells kind of like jerky which makes the dogs more interested in it.  It is also a good option for hiding pills or for interesting a picky dog in thier normal food.  Highly suggest it.

review/summary: Life Gets Better for GF
review/text: I just received my first order from New Grains Bakery and you can color me impressed! Great taste and texture right out of the bag.  I'm betting even better toasted, and I'm salivating as I think of how this bread will work for french toast, fresh bread crumbs, croutons...  I just don't know how they managed to keep the carb and calorie count to such reasonable numbers -- the nutritional label claims 12g carbs and 70 calories per slice, and they're decent size slices.  The crust is a perfect light brown.  Many other GF breads I've tried have dark brown, almost burnt tasting crusts and I have often resorted to cutting off the crusts.  I won't have to with New Grains white bread though.<br /><br />I also ordered their whole grain dinner rolls, and they're awesome too...soft, moist, flavorful.  Higher carbs and calories, but worth it to me for the flavor/texture.<br /><br />I was also impressed that my shipment included a very nice personalized letter and "first timer" free samples.  I try to keep my sugar consumption to a minimum but those cookies look so delicious, I'm going to have to make an exception just this once.<br /><br />I found the product prices to be reasonable when compared to other GF bread products in the marketplace.  The shipping costs are pretty high though.  Next time I'm going to try ordering in bulk.  I freeze all my bread products in individual servings anyway, so that may help defray the shipping costs.

review/summary: Wonderful earthy flavor and clearly high quality for less cost
review/text: I cook a lot with paprika and I've found a great variance in quality over the years. Cheaper ones are more bland and have no heat, almost as though they are cut with some other spice. With better quality paprika, however, you can actually use less and get greater flavor and heat.<br /><br />And this was clearly good paprika in spite of my taking the risk of buying  it on the Internet. I bought it for the price but was surprised at the quality.<br /><br />if you like some heat in your food, paprika is the perfect spice to make it happen.  if you like smoky flavors such as chipotle or smoked salt, smoked paprika is even better. It adds an earthiness with the heat and the flavor to compliment the Southwest flavors I love.<br /><br />The flavors come through, it truly has a smoky flavor profile, and it has just the right touch of heat.<br /><br />Does everyone need 80 oz?  maybe not. but we use it enough that it's actually far cheaper for us to buy it this way. As a Mexican food lover, I make room in the pantry!

review/text: I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.

review/summary: Safer than rawhide, don't last as long but also cleans teeth
review/text: I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.<br /><br />Over all I am quite satisfied with these "bones." They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had "doggy breath." I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath "fresh" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them.

review/summary: A Wonderful Dark Roast - Organic And Fair Trade
review/text: This review refers to Newman's Own French Roast Coffee - Ground<br /><br />Newman's Own Organics brand has teamed up with Green Mountain Coffee for a great cup of coffee that is certified organic and fair trade at a reasonable price(comparatively)and makes for a good deal all around.<br /><br />The French Roast is a very dark roast that brews up a real eye-opener; with a rich, smooth, satisfying taste for coffee lovers and wonderful aroma. If you are like me and always use much more than the 'recommended amount' per cup, you'll love this one - and probably won't have to use as much per cup, making it a good deal economically as well.<br /><br />Certified Organic means the coffee is grown without chemicals; better for the environment; better for coffee lovers. You only get the taste of naturalness.<br /><br />Fair Trade means the farmers get a fair price and are better able to take care of the land they use to grow the coffee. You get delicious and naturally grown coffee.<br /><br />Newman's Own is known for the donations to charitable causes - Its a Win-Win-Win cup o'coffee!<br /><br />Also - at this time the deal for the two pack is excellent compared with other brands that are organic and fair trade (even the Newman's Own is higher in most supermarkets.)And personally I think it makes a way better cup of coffee than the "designer label" brands.<br /><br />The Coffee arrived well packaged and pretty fast. For a little variety I would also recommend :<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012BYIS6">Newman's Own Coffee Cafe Almond Biscotti Ground, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Wake up to a wonderful cup o' coffee.......Laurie

review/text: I have not seen these in a long time.  You can not find these in the stores any more, and I really don't understand why.  These are excellent.  I used to love these when I was a little boy.  My mom would give us a package of two every other day after school for our snacks, on the off days we got fruit.  These do not have the artifical butterscotch flavor you sometimes get with butterscotch snacks.

review/text: I received 6 boxes of Sazon Goya spices which contained 10 envelopes in each box. I have yet to try the spice, but that is not the problem. I thought I was getting 1 box containing 6 envelopes (packets) hence the misleading information used to sell the product. I think that your marketing procedures need to be more specific in this regard.

review/summary: FAMILY SAGA OF THE INDOOR KITTIES VERSUS THE FERAL FELINES
review/text: OUR CAT FAMILY CHICKEN AND LIVER PROPLAN SAGA: THE INDOOR DUDES VERSUS THE OUTSIDE FERALS<br /><br />YEAR 2009<br /><br />CHAPTER ONE: The Kittens versus the Cats<br /><br />I was blessed with two kittens at approximately the same time. One was a "failure to thrive" kitty with a compromised immune system and the one was a "Hey let's go eat everything in the kitchen" and see how big we can get kitten. At the time I got them from Foster Care, both wighed 5 pounds. The failure to thrive kitty was 7 months old and the "go get um" kitty was 3 months old. (Currently 8 and 10 pounds respectively.)<br /><br />I purchased Pro Plan Chicken and Liver "kitten food" from Amazon ASAP. I felt it would meet the nutritional needs of both Boys, so both would have the optimum chance to grow and and become as strong as possible.<br />Having JUST lost (a few months prior my "BEST BOY EVER!" to a long standing kidney problem, I though it was very important that my new family members have the most nutritious and "boy safe" food possible. "BEST BOY" died at the early age of twelve after cavorting his way through many adventures, which included being kidnapped by a jealous female. But that is a different part of this saga, and will be published under a different ProPlan review.<br />Both of my new boys had been eating dry food in their foster homes (both were born of feral mothers. They too would have grown up Wild had a human rescuer not stepped in to save them. as I was now the proud mom of two boy children, I felt my responsibility to them heavily; indeed, quite deeply. Both should, and would, have more water in their diets to prevent urinary tract problems. So I sought Amazon's best, though a bit pricey to me. Since "Best Boy" did much of his own meal planning and preparation, I was unaccustomed to providing three ounce tins for my family. But, as the "name" implies, "wet food" has water, so wet food it was. Most little kitties inhale wet food if they  have been on that "dry stuff" for any lenghth of time. But neither kitten would eat it. It was a puzzling situation. In fact, I was quite provoked with "the boys" because they turned their tiny noses up at this offering. It had, indeed, cost me dollars, and time and effort. I finally shrugged my saddened sholders and somewhat unwillingly fed this Chicken and Liver Kitten Food to the feral cats that live in the area.<br /><br />My feral kitties love it. My outdoor children who regularly appear are 1. A BEAUTIFUL female Long Haired Marmalade Tabby 2. A Scruffy Yellow and White Tom who seems to be the Head Honcho in the neighborhood, 3. a Black and White Tom who suffers the Lordship of "Head Honcho" and 4. a short haired Orange and Grey female Tabby who seems to never becomes "with kittens." I call them ferals, but really, they know me and sleep in the back yard when it is warm and in provided boxes, which include warm towels, when it is cold. BUT,Feral they are. They allow no petting, in fact, will let no one near them. They may look content and docile lounging in the green grass, but try to be friendly and they RUN. We are very discreet and safely distanced partners in this dance of friendship that we have establish. I do not know the rules. THEY teach ME as we get better acquainted.The ferals seem to have estabished their haunt based, somewhat upon, a willing group of people who feed them. I think of that group as The "Sneaky Neigborhood Ladies Kitty Kat Klub.". I am a Charter Member! It consists of those soft hearted women (and some men) who sneak the left-overs, or a tin of food out to the ferals when there spouse is not looking. You know, the spouse generally would want to know "what in the H___ are you doing encouraging those flea-bitten strays to hang around?! Just a Lot Of Trouble don't you know!" So we leave food out on a non-scheduled basis...just some of this or that when we have extra. Their feeding stations are random, varying from night to night. Those guys seem to have a scouting system set, checking the "route" daily to see who has food out. I sometimes see one or two of them wending their way from back porch to patio to see what is available. I have known them to turn things down now and again. Of course, some are hungrier than others.I am the "Kitty Cat Lady" who fed them  a couple of cases of Pro Plan kitten food because MY KITTENS would not touch it.<br />So--WHY did I run on about those feral cats? Well, my guys turned up their nose at the Chicken and Liver, but the ferals scarfed it down. Mine would rather eat a 38 cent can of any brand seafood feast than this.<br />So you are probably thinking: So, write about something relevant lady. A feral cat would happily eat roadkill. Why are you comparing the eating habits of "inside only" kittens to feral cats to start with? That is an apples to oranges situation and you are just wasting my time warbling on about your blessed feral cats and whether they will deign to eat Pro Plan or not?!<br />Well My Outside Ferals live by a Riparian area. My back fence abuts this area. The Government Planners can tell a BIG difference in that boundary. But the cat can have his hind paws on my fence as his front paws head to the Riparian area as he jumps the few inches to land thereon. His parents, or grandparents were likely tame kitties who were pitched out to a "good neighborhood" when some of my neighbors began to suffer financial problems as the Economy has gone south. But my feral guys were raised as true hunters and because of their location, they have immediate access to all the baby rabbits, mice, voles, moles and lizards thay they care to eat. My Hunter Kitty, who passed a few months ago (hence my new kittens) used to bring me presents of said items all the time. There is just no shortage of available food. ProPlan and leftovers are usually dessert. It has been about a year since I had a really hungry kitty show up. The long haired Marmalade female came a few times and was ravenous, but that was because she had just delivered a litter of kittens. I have a very stable group o guys and to me their opinion counts. Nobody will eat clams, cooked liver, raw liver, lamb or canned crab. They do like Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup.<br />So at my house, we have 4 who chow down on this and 2 who do not.<br /><br />THE INDOOR DUDES DO NOT LIKE IT. THE OUTDOOR DUDES DO LIKE IT.<br /><br />UPDATE IN DECEMBER 2011. FELINE FAMILY COMPOSITION HAS CHANGED TO:<br /><br />1. Only one male, previously mentioned indoor kitten remains. His name is Trinity, now 3 yr. and did not like this Pro Plan food. Still does not care for it.<br />The other male kitten I had, turned out to be severly immunosuppresed, requiring more expensive trips to the vet than I could manage. He found a permanent home with one of the vet's techs and is still with her til this day. I see photos of this little black and white when we go to the "doctor".<br />2. A two and a half year old female who did not grow up on Pro Plan, but will happily steal it from the new kittens. She is a ticked tabby called Gabby.<br />3. Kitten (black): Majic aged 4 mo. Loves this.<br />4. Kitten (brown stripes): Mercy age 4 mo. Loves this.<br />5. Feral Kitty: "Head Honcho" from above who is Yellow and White. Very creativly named "Yellow and White" Kitty. Age unknown. Has been a neighborhood cat for approximately 7 years. I had him Trapped, Neutered, and Returned about 3 years ago. He arrives for his daily meal at about 5:00 P.M. He likes this food just fine. He likes some others a bit better, but certainly shows no  disdain for it. So His vote is a Positive one.<br />Other Feral Kitties: The other ferals have moved on. At this time, Dec 2011, I have only the one noted above. As far as I know, nothing bad happened to the other guys. They just found other digs.<br /><br />The last two kittens I got, Majic and Mercy, LOVE this Pro Plan. Gabriella likes it just fine too. When I have a lazy day, I feed this Kitten Food to the adult tabby because the cans are right there, and easy to grab. She gives it a snif or two and then eats heartily. Any leftovers go to Yellow and White kitty (Occasionally I run out of his Friskies and he gets this instead) eats it right down. He prefers the days that I get lazy and give him a tin of human Tuna, Albacore packed in water, that I have found on sale somewhere. But as a day in and day out dish, he eats it fine. Since he is not a kitten, it does not grace his dish often.<br /><br />So, two or so years after writing my first review on this product, I find that 3/4's or so of the cats I feed, like this just fine. The kittens will continue to get it for about 4 more months, then I will switch the whole family of kitty kritters to the Adult variety of chicken with liver. I do not want anyone to be undernourished, but feeding time can be bedlam and seeing that only the kittens receive this food is just not feasible. But, while the little ones do still need extra nourishment, I will see that they get it. BUTTTTTT, do not want the adults to be over fed and become ungaily in size!<br /><br />INDOOR DUDES: THREE LIKE; ONE DOES NOT. OUTDOOR DUDES: ONE LIKES<br /><br />So, the number of Stars stays the same: 4 Stars. Four of my children recommend it. I think if you give them this early on, before they have a chance to be finicky, your children will like it. GABRIELLA, MAJIC, MERCY AND YELLOW KITTY SAY: "Buy On!" and a Merry Christmas and Happy New Years to you. (Christmas 2011)

review/summary: High quality, flavorful tea.
review/text: Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Earl Grey tea is simply delicious.  Each box comes with one hundred mesh bags of whole tea, not the dust and debris you'll find in cheaper brands.  The tea itself is flavorful and delicious, with none of the aftertaste of commercial brands.  As a single person, I hesitated to purchase so many tea bags at once.  However, it is definitely worth the investment, as the tea comes in sealed individual plastic bags and tastes superior to tea from Starbucks or Lipton.  The tea has a delicate but full flavor, and NO sugar is necessary to make the tea delicious.  In addition to making hot tea, you can also use the bags to make incredible iced tea.  Simply make the tea at double strength and poor over ice.  Again, no sugar is needed - making this tea a good beverage for those of us watching their sugar intake.

review/summary: They changed the recipe!
review/text: I bought a box of this tea a few months ago, and it was amazing, best Earl Grey I have ever had.<br /><br />I decided to order a package of 6 boxes, and the tea I got was completely different. Different packaging, different baggies, shorter string, and most importantly of all TERRIBLE TEA. I cannot even drink it, it is so BAD. It doesn't even taste like earl grey, but cheap Lipton tea. There are no words to explain my utter disappointment. I would give it zero stars, if I could.<br /><br />UPDATE...<br />I called Two Leaves and a Bud to ask why this tea was so different, and they admitted that they have changed not only their tea source, but also their production/packaging facility. So the new tea is indeed a completely different product (these changes span all packaging types: single boxes, bags, 100 count, and 6-box count).<br /><br />Their customer service however, is SUPERB. They offered to replace the 6 boxes with any of their other products. I chose loose-leaf Decaf Earl Grey (which is almost as delicious as the pre-change Earl Grey). I didn't even need to ship the 6 boxes back - they told me to keep it, give it away, whatever. What an outstanding company!

While the packaging on the individual bags looks very similar, this is not the same tea; it  the worst tea I have ever had, with a strong unpleasant taste and does not taste like Earl Grey.  I am very disappointed and feel very ripped off.

review/summary: Great mix but misrepresented by drugstore.com
review/text: I love this baking mix.  It makes the most fluffiest yummy pancakes I've ever made.  Better then anything I made in my pre gluten free days.  This mix will be a staple in my home.  I haven't tried any of the other recipes listed on the back but I would like to try  the chocolate chip cookie recipe soon.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because Drugstore has this list as three 4lb bags of mix but they only sell them as a single 4lb bag.  They were very quick to correct the misrepresentation and provided great customer service but I will not be ordering this from them again.  It's more cost effective to by the three 4lb bags from Amazon.

review/summary: Great mix, a bit expensive
review/text: This 4 lb. bag of Pamela's Gluten Free Baking and Pancake Mix lasts quite a while (depending on how many people you're trying to feed) and makes awesome baked goods... especially waffles. This mix makes great baked goods that don't taste gluten free, even though it is. The back of the package has a bunch of recipes and they appear to have been kitchen tested so they produce high quality foods.  That said, the price of this single bag from drugstore.com is a bit costly when compared to discount stores. Note that this listing on Amazon doesn't provide three 4 lb. bags like it says, it only provides one bag at this price. If this price were for three 4 lb. bags like it says, it's be a steal of a deal. However, don't fall for the listing as you only get one (1) bag. You can get this same bag at Target for $14.99 (baking goods isle).  It may not be available at all Target stores, so you'll want to visit or call. I wasn't able to find it at Target's web site, though. If you don't have a Target close, then purchasing through Amazon may be your best bet. Definitely worth a purchase if you love pancakes or waffles, though.<br /><br />If you are looking for the three pack, you can also find it here on Amazon.  Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMJWZO">Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix, 4-Pound Bags (Pack of 3)</a>.  This three pack ends up, per bag, even cheaper than Target.<br /><br />This mix works great in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FMT8">Oster 3883 Belgian Wafflemaker, Chrome</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012S8OWA">Oster 3874 Flip Nonstick Belgian Waffle Maker</a>.  If you like shallow waffles, get the 3883.  If you like deep holed waffles, get the 3874 flip. I also personally use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168637Y">Just Whites All Natural Egg Whites</a> to mix in rather than whole eggs when making waffles.  The Just Whites are great because you can store them on the shelf without worrying about buying eggs or worrying about eggs going bad (or being contaminated).<br /><br />Note, I'm only giving this listing 4 stars, not because of the mix, but because of the faulty listing.  Pamela's mix is 5 stars all the way.  This is a high quality product and is definitely worth a try.  Just be aware of the problems with this listing before you buy.<br /><br />Update: It looks like someone has corrected this listing to the correct price for 3 bags.  So, at the ~$60 price tag for this item will probably get you 3 4lb bags of this item.  Still, at $60 for 3 bags, that ends up $20 a bag which is still more expensive than buying it at Target or another discount store.

review/text: I ordered 2 packs of the Tassimo Gevalia Caramel Macchiato. As stated in the description of the item, ONE package contains 8 servings, which is 16 discs. HOWEVER, of those 16 discs, half of them are the latte creamers. If I am ordering 16 T-discs of the Caramel Macchiato, I should receive 16 of the actual coffee flavor AND 16 of the creamer that comes with it! I should have received FOUR packages total; I only got ONE! After shipping I was charged a grand total of $44.49, which is a whopping $5.56 per serving! On the actual company website ONE package (what I got) costs ONLY $10.99!!!!!!!!!! THE SELLER IS CHEATING YOU IF YOU BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!

I have tasted all the other brands available and none of them come close in terms of real vanilla taste.  To me it tastes like a melted vanilla soft serve ice cream cone.  It is so yummy on cereal, with graham crackers or just on its own.  I don't know why all the other vanilla soy milks don't get this taste right, but no matter, I stock up on Kikkoman.

review/summary: Cascadian Farm Organic Granola - Oats & Honey
review/text: I purchased this cereal from the Greenwise section of my local Publix.  It's a nice organic cereal with crunchy granola, crispy rice, and toasted oats.  I pay between $3.00-$3.99 per 17 oz. box.<br /><br />It's great to get it on sale but rare. You get a lot of cereal for your money as compared with other organic cereals which are typically 13-14 oz. per box.<br /><br />The cereal is hearty and saftisfying.  However, if you are in the habit of not consuming sugar the initial bowl can be a bit alarming.<br /><br />The cereal contains all organic ingredients:  whole grain oats, sugar, crisp rice (rice sugar, sea salt, malt), sunfolower oil, whole grain oat flour, molasses, maltodextrin, honey, sea salt, and vanilla extract.<br /><br />A serving size is 2/3 of a cup and the box contains 8 servings--that's a bit skimpy as most organic cereal serving sizes are typically one cup.  The fat content may be the culprit.<br /><br />Total fat per serving is 6 g and 42 g of carbs.  The sugar content is 14 g, 5 g protein, 3 g of fiber, and a mere trace of honey.<br /><br />However, to the credit of the manfacturer they didn't say it was a healthy cereal. It's organic and wholesome and full of flavors.  I give this cereal a 4/5 for flavor, 5/5 for maintaining organic integrity, and 5/5 for being Earth friendly (recycled packaging).

review/summary: Only fruit snack I will buy!
review/text: I do not usually write reviews unless I want to warn others about a product, but I have to make an exception with these fruit snacks. Yes, they are pricier than other brands, but I wouldn't take other brands now if you gave them to us! These fruit snacks are very fresh tasting, wonderfully soft and a true "chewy" - not a tough, pull-your-teeth-out texture. I could never give my toddler the usual fruit snacks because of the dyes, texture, and the insane amount of sugar. I love everything about these snacks and our whole family eats them!! She gets excited when she sees a pack of her gummies and I buy them on Amazon by the case! I feel confident giving her these since they contain 100% of her daily vitamin C in one small pack and are actually adding nutrition to her diet instead of a sugary snack. Can't recommend these enough - if you are on the fence and are trying to make good health decisions for your family look no further - buy a box! You won't be disappointed.

These natural fruit snacks taste about a zillion times better than any regular old fruit snacks (i.e. General Mills, etc.) you'd find at your neighborhood grocery store.<br /><br />I got to try 1 (yes, only 1!) of these fruit snacks.  My kids loved them so much and I didn't want to deprive them of that tasty, Vitamin C, fruit juice filled, natural goodness.  Probably the yummiest organic snack I've ever tried, and I've tried lots.  Sheesh.  I'm making myself wish I had some in the cupboard!

review/summary: Not a Panacea for Air-blown Popcorn
review/text: I wanted this product to be great.  I yearned for this product to be great.  It turned out to be fair.<br /><br />If you use the recommended serving size, you'll find you don't taste is AT ALL.  Nada.  Zip.<br /><br />If you use three times the recommended serving, you'll find it subtly makes your popcorn taste like cheddar, and I do mean subtle.  You'll have to hunt for the flavor.  Don't expect cheesy popcorn because you won't get it with this seasoning.<br /><br />It doesn't cling to the popcorn very well either, which further diminishes the flavor.  You'll need to prep the popcorn by popping in oil or by pouring butter on after you air-pop the popcorn.<br /><br />Oh well.  The search to make air-popped popcorn tasty goes on, because this product ain't it.<br /><br />That said, the flavor is pretty good, but as previously mentioned, I can't taste it unless I use way more than the recommended serving size, which then defeats the low-calorie benefit.  Too bad!

review/summary: Cheddariffic!
review/text: Let me start by saying I love cheese flavored anything, and so do my kids. I had tried a couple of other brands with very unsatisfying results. But was always on the hunt because our family loves to have popcorn and movie night. During the holidays I needed to come up with a small gift for my MIL. Just so happens she too is a popcorn lover- I'm talking melt a whole stick of real butter drizzle it on and dowse it with salt kind of popcorn lover. I bought a few of these seasonings and also their spray to make a gift basket up for her. Out of all the different flavors we tried White Cheddar and Kettle Corn were our favorites. When she traveled home she opted to leave her gift for us to enjoy rather than try to pack in onto an airplane. I started putting the White Cheddar on veggies and eggs for the kids and by accident put it on some chicken strips and french fries I made at home one day- now I'm hooked. Chicken, potatoes, fries, pizza, veggies, pasta, salads- all kinds of things up to an including the original use- popcorn. As for those who complain about it not sticking to dry popcorn- well duh. It needs moisture to stick. I've used their spray and it worked fine, but I also own a Misto, so I've used EVOO and sprayed the popcorn lightly then toss with the seasonings- a MUCH healthier alternative to bagged popcorn with high sodium and not taste!

review/text: This product is awesome!  So wonderful, in fact, I think I'm mildly addicted! I put it on popcorn, sandwiches, soup, pizza, eggs, french fries,  and even mix it with a little bit of olive oil for a dressing-free salad!  The flavor is very rich, and it really does add a lovely flavor to just about anything you can think to put it on.  The only downside I have to this is in regards to it's original use--when putting it on no, or low-butter popcorn, it doesn't stick very well.  I flies up like flour and can cause a sneezing/coughing fit if you're not careful.  I usually have to melt a little butter, mix the seasoning in, and pour it over the popcorn.  Otherwise, it's great!!

review/summary: Salty!!!!
review/text: I have purchased both the seasoning jar and Kernel Seasons White Cheddar Popcorn already popped in a bag both from Costco.  Both are extremely salty!  The popcorn in a bag has the right cheese flavor but with that comes like half a days intake of salt per serving and you can taste it immensely.  Also when you shake the cheddar seasoning jar onto your own popcorn, to get a good cheese flavor, you have to use quite a bit which adds the taste of quite a bit of salt.  I don't understand why so much salt is necessary.  Furthermore, if you air pop your popcorn and then use the seasoning, the seasoning will not stick to your popcorn.  The popcorn needs to be popped in butter, margarine or oil.  After it is done, while it is still hot and greasy, you have to shake the seasoning on to get it to stick to the popcorn.  My favorite easy to find brand, which is not nearly as salty, is O-kee-dokee popcorn which you can find in chip isle at most grocery stores.  I have tried every brand of white cheddar popcorn out there I can find because I love it so much.  By far, this brand is the king of salt.  Another good easy to find brand which is not as salty as Kernel Seasons is the Quaker brand white cheddar popcorn cakes.  Cape Cod White cheddar popcorn is good as well but is also salty, although not as nearly as salty as Kernel Seasons. Kernel Seasons either needs to reduce the sodium content of their products, or create low sodium alternatives as well, in order to appeal to a bigger market group.

review/summary: A Wonderful Dark Roast - Organic And Fair Trade
review/text: This review refers to Newman's Own French Roast Coffee<br /><br />Newman's Own Organics brand has teamed up with Green Mountain Coffee for a great cup of coffee that is certified organic and fair trade, and makes for a good deal all around.<br /><br />The French Roast is a very dark roast that brews up a real eye-opener; with a rich, smooth, satisfying taste for coffee lovers and wonderful aroma. If you are like me and always use much more than the 'recommended amount' per cup, you'll love this one - and probably won't have to use as much per cup, making it a good deal economically as well.<br /><br />Certified Organic means the coffee is grown without chemicals; better for the environment; better for coffee lovers. You only get the taste of naturalness.<br /><br />Fair Trade means the farmers get a fair price and are better able to take care of the land they use to grow the coffee. You get delicious and naturally grown coffee.<br /><br />Newman's Own is known for the donations to charitable causes - Its a Win-Win-Win cup o'coffee!I've used both the ground and whole bean and personally I think either way, it makes a way better cup of coffee than the "designer label" brands.<br /><br />The Coffee arrived well packaged and pretty fast. For a little variety I would also recommend:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012BYIS6">Newman's Own Coffee Cafe Almond Biscotti Ground, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Wake up to a wonderful cup o' coffee.......Laurie

review/summary: Perfect small dog treat
review/text: These dog treats are all nutritionally sound treat that little dogs love. Their highest ingredient is protein and they are low calorie. The four different flavors allow for variety and provide different shapes and textures so the dogs love them. My yorkie just loves them and so do my goldens but I save them for the yorkie because they are hard to find in the store.

review/summary: Good Tasting Darjeeling
review/text: I bought this because Amazon was out of the Two Leaves & a Bud Assam (which is my favorite).  This has a good clean flavor - slightly earthy, smokey, with some lighter notes (flowery?). Since it's whole leaf tea, I find it less bitter and has a fuller flavor than most bagged darjeeling tea. If you like a bold morning cup of black tea, this might not be the one for you.  However, it is lighter than the assam (or English/Irish breakfast types) and I prefer the darjeeling as an early afternoon tea.

review/summary: Excellent Stuff at a Decent Price
review/text: I have been buying this brand for several years at grocery stores and didn't know that it is available from Amazon at half the price. Comparing to the their bold Assam, this Darjeeing Tea initially seemed a bit subtle, but after a few bags I started loving it even more than the Assam. Excellent stuff at a decent price!

review/text: My husband and I fell in love with these Orgain shakes.  They are absolutely delicious and we each ordered our favorite flavor on Subscribe & Save and were thrilled with the product and the price.  Unfortunately, these items were discontinued on S&S with no advance notice.  If we had known, we would've stocked up on them.  With the price through the roof as it currently is, we will not be buying them here.

Everyone loves this as a year round treat.

review/summary: Blech! This tastes like cough medicine
review/text: Flavors of Sweet Leaf Liquid Stevia that taste really good are: Grape, Plain, Root Beer, Vanilla Cream.<br /><br />Flavors to avoid: Berry and Lemon Drop. These flavors are way to artificial tasting. Waste of money.<br />I would recommend buying organic strawberry flavor/extract and adding it to plain liquid stevia if you want to make this flavor. It tastes much better.<br /><br />Our main use for these is adding them to seltzer to made homemade soda flavors.

review/summary: Wonderful flavor boost to help increase one of the most important needs our body has for water.
review/text: As a doctor I know the importance of adequate water intake (and suspect the majority of people are dehydrated)and try to fulfill my need daily, but do get "bored" with plain water and sometimes need a little flavor to help. There are very few healthy products, most being poisons, including things with artificial flavors, colors, etc., but this is about the only real safe product (unless you have a stevia sensitivity, which is rare).I have used several of the liquid Stevia flavors, but Amazon has such a wider selection than what's available locally. Although the obesity and other health problems in this country are multifactorial, I wonder how big an impact there would be with adequate water intake and converting from HFCS and other poisonous products to a healthy product such as this.

review/summary: Great Stuff here
review/text: I have ordered all kinds of SweetLeaf Stevia products. The Berry Flavor here tastes great, I use it either to flavor my filtered water, put it in my Ice tea or add a few drops to my daily shake/smoothie. Has really great taste and no nasty after taste like many other kinds of fake sweetners. Plus it is more natural sweetner than those chemical ones that have all the bad side effects.

review/summary: Love this cereal
review/text: I know it's not the most healthy cereal in the world but this is my absolute favorite cereal. Usually have one of these single serving bowls worth on top of 1 packet of cooked oatmeal, and that's my weekday breakfast. Quick and easy. These bowls last a long time, expiration-date for each order has been months away from when I received them, with plenty of time to finish them before they expire.<br /><br />Also like that the bowls are recyclable. No guilt. And they're useful for other things if you're crafty or handy or wanting a one-use bowl for something.<br /><br />My only very minor problem (besides they're always quick to go out of stock!) is they come in a really big box that says what they are. It saves packaging, so I'll bear the embarrassment and hope my delivery guy isn't hungry.

review/summary: good honey, overpriced
review/text: This is ordinary Manuka raw honey. Honey is very good for you, especially Manuka, and in this case, you get what you pay for. It's expensive because it's Manuka, and certified. My only complaint is the price.<br /><br />Not too different in flavor from clover honey. Thick, opaque and textured. If you want Manuka honey, this is the honey you get. It doesn't need to be pasteurized because honey naturally prevents bacteria growth, does not spoil, and Manuka honey is especially naturally antiseptic. Unique Manuka Factor ("UMF") refers to the level of antiseptic strength.<br /><br />This is Manuka honey. It doesn't come in different artificial flavors with colors and additives. If artificial flavoring and high-fructose corn syrup are more important to you, save your money and suck on a cheap lollipop.
