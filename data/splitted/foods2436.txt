review/summary: French? Non, non, non!
review/text: Not really a french roast. If you've ever bought french roast coffee at the grocery store when you open the bag the grounds are nearly (if not actually) black. This is NOT the case with this coffee. When I grind these beans then look no darker than a medium roast. That doesn't mean the coffee tastes horrible, it doesn't. But it does taste very "Meh" and it's not what I was intending to get. That's disappointing. I also have to wonder.... the write up from Coffee Bean Direct says this contains a blend of African and South American beans. You can certainly tell its a blend from looking at the beans, but I wonder if it's an actual recipe they have or if they just toss whatever they have lying around in the hopper.<br />Overall: Not horrible, not french, not great.

review/text: I've bought Coffee Bean Direct coffee before (i.e. Dark Brazilian Santos) and the other varieties were good, but I prefer a stronger roast. When I ran across their French Roast I thought, great ... and bought a bag. I was so pleased I've now set up a subscription so I don't have to remember to order coffee anymore.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I just received it Friday.  5 lbs is a hell of a lot of coffee, but worth it at this price (with subscribe and save).  At first I didn't like the way it smelled, not used to dark roast, but it tastes amazing.  Also dark roast has a little less caffeine than a lighter roast like Colombian because it's cooked longer, fyi.  This is darn good coffee, highly recommended.

review/summary: Says Espresso and came as regular beans
review/text: The image of the product says FRENCH ROAST ESPRESSO. However, when it arrived, it did not and it is standard whole bean coffee.  It's great coffee, but it's not espresso and it's not what I ordered.  BE VERY CAREFUL and DO NOT rely on images as they are not always accurate and you have NO recourse in this issue if you rely on images.

review/summary: for espresso machine great!
review/text: We use this for espresso machine from bevelle or something like that called. We use on the machine grinder and grind it just before getting double shot portion from the machine. Makes it easy and handy to put more into the grinder's container from this big bag and we keep it sealed inside a larger air lock container. Keeps it fresh. 5 lb bag makes sense to buy it in bulk. Rich in flavor I think. I am not a big bean counter, but, this does the job. Makes me buy less starbucks but lets me enjoy my own coffee and latte at home. This is like the one I get from Starbucks.

review/summary: THIS IS NOT French Roast!
review/text: I was swayed by high reviews to try this roaster with a subscription order. A mistake that will take a long time to finish if ever. The beans are NOT a uniformly dark French Roast as expected, but a mix of multi-brown and reddish beans; it is what is considered a medium blend roast. When ground, it is actually reddish brown. It does NOT smell nor taste anything like French or dark roast. If you like medium (it is a notch about supermarket variety commerically roasted coffee such as Folgers or Maxwell House or whatever) it's fine, you'll find this palatable and to your liking. I question whether Coffee Bean Direct is roast house credible and whether some of the 5-star reviewers here aren't members of the company, or I got a mislabeled bag. IF it is NOT a French Roast, do NOT call it as such. To put it mildly, I am extremely angry that I'm stuck with five pounds of it. An expensive mistake. I have canceled my Coffee Bean Direct coffee subscription order.

review/summary: At Least the Crisp is There
review/text: Evaluations of food items, including snacks, are a matter of personal preference, personal taste. That's why so many flavors and varieties of food items are available from which to choose. The following is one Potato Head's opinion of Pepperidge Farm Cheese Crisps, Four Cheese Medley.<br /><br />When I saw the already opened box of Baked Naturals on my night stand, I was suspicious because Mrs. Spudman is not always generous with her snacks. On the box are all the gushy, feel good words: natural, No preservatives, Real ingredients, Always baked, Real cheese. I like natural and real, so I expected to like this hand-me-down snack.<br /><br />From the first crispy bite I was disappointed. Crispy, yes. Tasty, no. There may be four cheeses in there, but intense cheesy taste there is not. In fact the flavor is about as robust as that of the bland, Pepperidge Farm gold fish. One good thing about the lack of intensive flavor is that it's easy to exercise self control and not overeat this snack. I do share them with our two dogs who seem to like the crunch factor if not the taste. With their heightened senses, they may experience the cheese in a heightened plane.<br /><br />On the good side, the crisps aren't overly salty and when done my fingers aren't covered with that must-wash-hands residue left behind by other snacks, like delicious, cheesy cheese puffs, for example. Another positive is that buried in the extensive ingredient list I spied dehydrated POTATOES!<br /><br />A serving size of  pieces has  140 calories. Not bad. Before buying a four pack of this snack, perhaps buy a single box locally to make sure you like them.<br /><br />This has been one Potato Head's opinion of Pepperidge Farm Baked Naturals Cheese Crisps.

review/summary: Wonderful Mainstream Snack
review/text: Milo's Kitchen chicken meatballs have become one of our dogs' favorite treats and have been a big hit with them from the very first bite. The snacks actually look like little meatballs, and though I haven't actually tasted one myself, they do seem to be delicious to dogs.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient in these treats is chicken. I also like the absence of artificial colors, artificial flavors, and fillers. Though I'm not crazy about the inclusion of BHA as a preservative, it is also used in human processed foods. Also not desirable is sugar high up in the ingredient list.<br /><br />The flat bottomed bag stands tall is is resealable. For those who prefer to break snacks into pieces, these can be broken by hand, or as Mrs. Spudman does, with a knife or kitchen scissors. Gabby and Piper, our two furry girls, highly recommend the Milo's Kitchen dog treats.

review/text: We travel a lot and wanted some kind of meat to add to our 2 minpin's food that didn't have to be refrigerated.  After trying several other products, we found Milo's Meatballs and these fit our needs perfectly.<br /><br />They can be easily crumbled up and mixed into their food, and they love them.  We also occasionally use them for treats.<br /><br />I love that the bag is resealable and stands up, and that they offer large bags of the meatballs, saving us from having to constantly run to the store to find small bags of treats, as we did with some other products.

We bought the jerky to try at PETCO for 19 something where as they're about 26.00.  Xena just loves them so thought I could find them cheaper online, it sort of evens out for what the s&h + tax versus the price of gas it seems like we got the better deal.  Now when she wants them she goes right over to the table letting us know that she wants a treat.

review/summary: Saved my roses.
review/text: I planted 6 rose bushes (including one climber) last summer. One of them immediately started showing black spots and yellowing of leaves. Being a novice gardener I did not realize it was the black spot disease. This year after a wonderful bloom in early summer, I saw that the yellow leaves/ black spot had spread to 3 more of my bushes and by mid-june all four bushes shed all their leaves and this is when i tried to look up on the net and came to know of black spot and yes other wrong things done my end - not sunny location, bushes planted too close etc. After much search, I bought the Ortho product and sprayed my bushes every weekend. I also cleared all dead leaves, applied cornmeal on the soil, used rose fertilizer and must say now, after a month, my bushes have sprung back to life with beautiful blooms. Really like the ortho product. On the info side - this product does not seem to clear existing black spots on leaves. I pruned and removed all affected leaves and sprayed on the new growth and now they look BS free.

review/text: Actually I haven't used this version, I use Rose Pride Aerosol and the organic RX 3 in 1, which don't need to be mixed and can be sprayed directly from the can.  I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because acting like a backyard chemist and having to mix toxic liquids scares me.  However, the premixed version "Rose Pride Aerosol" is 5 star, so take a look at my review for that and see if that meets your needs.<br /><br />Get the Rose Pride that has the rose on the front and is called "Insect, Disease and Mide Control" not the other one that does not have the fungicide.<br /><br />It's hard to find, but worth it.

I, admittedly, ate 3/4 of a 5 oz bag in one sitting, which is why I purchased this 5 lb box.  I've tried the mango, peanut butter and peppermint flavors, too, and the orange blows them out of the water.  Be forewarned that these are incredibly addicting.

review/text: Ginger has many proven and documented health benefits. I first tried these when I had an upset stomach and could not find ginger ale or pink junk to help. Not only did they help they also taste great. I then had to order the giant box of them to always ensure I have a supply. Also turns out my American bulldog loves them and it helps reduce his gas and saves my sense of smell (and appetite)as well as acts like n anti-inflammatory when he gets sore.<br /><br />The flavor is refreshing in almost any condition. It is what I turn to for almost any and everything. If I am nauseous it helps quell that, if I am tired keeps me awake.

review/summary: Perfect chewy little treats are allergen-free!
review/text: Love these treats! They're chewy enough to take about 30 seconds to a minute to eat per piece, and have a great zesty orange flavor with a fiery ginger kick at the end that really stays with you (like ten minutes of slowly diminishing pleasant heat on your tongue from eating just one or two pieces). They don't get stuck in your teeth like some chewy candy does. And they're allergen-free (but made in a facility that also processes peanuts). No corn, no dairy, no soy, no gluten! They come individually wrapped, so there's no need to worry about eating them all fast once you open the bag.<br /><br />If you're looking for more awesome, allergen-free candy, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTI7MQ">Surf Sweets Gummy Worms, 2.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/text: I first found this amazing, delicious product while on vacation in San Diego. Upon returning to my home in Florida I began a quest for Chimes Orange Ginger Chews. Unable to find them within my area, I ordered a five pound box from Amazon. All I have to say is Thank You Amazon!

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: The combo of fruits is really yummy.  My favorite are the tart green mangoes.  Everything is soft and chewy and I don't feel like I'm about to rip out my teeth like when biting fruit leather.  I have kept bags of Mangoes & Berries in my office so I can have a little midday snack to hold me til lunch or til I get home.  I also like taking a bag to the beach or on road trips because it doesn't need refrigeration and doesn't get sticky when left in the hot sun like other dried fruit.  Yes, there is lots of sugar added (so keep a toothbrush handy) so I try limit myself to a small handful but it's pretty addicting. I'm not sure about the shelf life but I will demolish a bag before it reaches that point.  I'm not sure if the price is decent because I don't have a Costco membership card because I don't have much storage for bulk items.  So if I factor in gas and cost of a Costco membership and the fact that I didn't pay for shipping on my last order of Mangoes and Berries, I'd say it's pretty fair.  Enjoy

review/summary: expected more
review/text: Naturally, they're about 2/3 of the price @ Costco, but seem to have shorter shelf lives than most dried fruit assortments. A nice mix but make sure you shake the bag around before reaching in or you'll miss all the berries 'til the end. Some of the mango pieces can be a bit tough for my liking. Not sure I'd buy again, especially given the superior value of their Fruit & Nut medley.

review/summary: Exactly what it aims to be
review/text: For anyone who simply wants a basic, American-style cup of coffee, this is perfectly fine. No, it's not as full-flavored or (arguably) as good as most of the higher priced Tassimo offerings, but it isn't intended to be. This is a simple, inexpensive cup for everyday use.<br /><br />That said, I knocked off a star due to Amazon's current pricing. The unit price for the "Friday Sale" is roughly the same as the individual retail price at many stores. That's not a deal -- and certainly doesn't represent the sort of discount one would expect to receive when buying a 5-pack.

When I get to the kitchen, I have a great cup of coffee, with no mess and no waste. The coffee disc's are expensive, but there is no "day old" coffee left sitting in the pot. This coffee is nothing fancy, not too strong, and taste good every time I fix a cup.

Still, with a little time spent pressing the "give me more" button, we can get a nice full cup of medium bodied coffee. We generally alternate cups between this and Gevalia Vanilla Hazelnut on the weekends.

review/summary: It's Terrible.
review/text: Do you remember what it smells like to add water to an ashtray full of cigarettes? That's how this coffee tastes. I added a caramel, some hazelnut flavoring, a packet of hot chocolate with miniature marshmellows, and Coffeemate vanilla chai creamer too it. It still tasted bitter, like wet cigarettes and metallic. I think the metallic flavor comes from the t-disc packaging. It doesn't make sense to buy a $100 coffee maker and drink trashy coffee. Especially when you can take that same amount of cash and buy some good coffee. I ignored the bad ratings of other reviewers because I believed the positive reviews. The only redeeming factors are that it is cheaper (less than $7 at Walmart), and that you can make a single cup of coffee. If it were allowed, I'd give it a -5 rating (or &lt;-> -,  for infinitly horrible).

review/text: I bought the first bag of these at my vet's office.  He's not a big treat fan so I was intrigued with anything he would reccommend. The man actually sugggested I give my dog an ice cube as a treat.  I don't know about your dog, but an ice cube doesn't even appear on my dog's radar scope as a treat. I have a dachshund (pray for me), so he isn't a huge dog...yet.  I cut the treats up into four pieces to get more mileage out of them.  I would've given them 5 stars, but they stink.  I guess the dog wouldn't agree, but my nose tells me differently.  He sure likes them, stinky or not, so I'll be buying them again.

review/summary: Veterinarian review
review/text: Butler's Lean Treats are fantastic semi-moist, bite-sized treats that are highly palatable (even to JP, my dog, who is super picky!)! They're great nutritional rewards for dogs, and can be used as training treats (although I'd probably cut them into 4 pieces to make them even smaller). I use these to fill my dog's KONG toy, which provides hours of environmental enrichment and mental stimulation (he can play with the Kong toy, trying to free the contents for several hours while I'm gone at work) - they're the perfect size to fit in a Kong.<br /><br />These are made with skinless chicken, and are a low-fat treat, which is great for all those obese dogs out there. The ingredients include (listed in order): skinless chicken, chicken liver, corn, chicken by-product meal, high fructose corn syrup, wheat flour, glycerin, propylene glycol (to maintain the semimoist texture - it's a small amount!), phosphoric acid, salt, potassium sorbate and calcium propionate and BHA and citric acid (preservatives), iron oxide. Overall, I'm OK with these ingredients, and JP seems to enjoy them!

review/text: I know that's a horrible title but my dogs act like that's what it is! I have 3 dogs: a 14yr old Bichon and 2 18month old pit bulls (litter sisters). I initally purchased these treats for the pits when we first got them when they were puppies - like 8wks old.  With these treats I have taught them to sit, stay, down, and best of all, KENNEL.  They were kennel trained and that's where they sleep.  They also have a large dog run out in the yard and I get them in there with the treats too.  The minute they hear that bag, they sit. The Bichon is 14. She doesn't need a treat to sit or go to bed but she gets one just the same because if she doesn't, she whines.<br />These are also fantastic if you have to give your dog medication.  I tried hot dogs and cheese and Gracie (one of the pits) would just spit out the pill.  So...I tried a treat and down it went.<br />When the puppies got older and bigger (one is 70pds and the other is 65pds) I saw that they make treats for bigger dogs but all my girls love these.  I don't feel bad giving these treats to any of them.<br />I would DEFINITELY recommend to any pet owner.

review/summary: Dogs Love Lean Treats
review/text: My dogs have enjoyed Lean Treats since they were puppies.  They love the treats.  The treats arte healthy and, as the name implies, have little fat in them.  I highly recommend the treats for any dog.  The vendor was also very prompt in sending the item.  The price is also quite reasonable compared to purchasing them at the vet's office.

review/summary: LOVE these IF they're fresh!
review/text: I've given these to my dog for the 4 years that I've had her. I LOVE them, and the fact that they're good for her! I recently ordered them from Entirely Pets, as my vet was out of them. I ordered a 6-pack, and it was wonderful -- fresh and soft. This is important, as my dog only has 3 teeth left. Too, I put a small pill in half of one if these, to give to Mitzi. Unfortunately, the second (and final) order for a 6-pack was dried out. And when they're dried out, they're really tough. I suppose I could've returned them, but I gave them to a coworker with a younger dog, who could chew them. Decided I wouldn't order online again, given this experience...I'll get them from my vet, and I open one of the packs before leaving to make sure they're fresh.

review/summary: excellent for training treats
review/text: I like to use these treats for training because they are so soft, one can pinch off a portion of the treat for a quick reward.  The dog doesn't stop to chew (and thus interrupt the training session).  Because they are not very "expensive" nutritionally, even adding up all the tiny bits for training still won't make your dog fat.  They're a wonderful treat to have in your arsenal!

review/text: I first got these treats from my vet. My puppies loved them. The Lean treats are small and a great size for training. Being that they are lean makes them healthier for them.<br />I have a tendency to "over treat" so by giving them the Lean treats I am at least treating them with a better treat.<br />I order these all the time.

review/summary: I don't buy other treats anymore
review/text: I started buying these about a year and half ago from my vet when I got my first dog Lucy. Lucy is a pitbull that my fiancee and I adopted from a shelter. When I got her, she was petrified of water and hated taking baths in the bathtub. I tried giving her other treats to help calm her down but she was so upset during the bath she wouldn't eat them. My vets give these treats during exams so I decided to try them out. The next time I gave Lucy a bath I tossed a Lean Treat into the empty tub before I started to run the water, she jumped into the tub without hesitation. Baths are no problem anymore.<br /><br />I also have a french bulldog, Henry that is about a year now. He will do anything for a lean treat. These treats are amazing. The last time I bought them, I bought a box of ten for around $20 plus tax. They lasted a long time. I'm glad I found these on amazon!<br /><br />If you haven't tried lean treats yeat, please do! They are a nutritious and healthy way to treat you dogs!

review/summary: A great treat / pill delivery system.....
review/text: Even with shipping, a box of these can be found as cheap (or cheaper) on Amazon, than in a vets office.  Our vet stopped carrying them (because of issues with the distributor, not the product), so I was pleased to find them here.  Not only are they a low-cal, low-fat treat for the dogs, but if you have a dog that needs to take pill-form medication with any frequency, Lean Treats are soft enough for a pill to be pushed into.  Works great.  There's a product called Pill Pockets that work well too, but they are ridiculously priced and likely not as healthy as Lean Treats....

review/text: My dog is very picky about treats, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that she loves these. I bought them largely on others' reviews about their picky dogs and I'm so glad it's true. Over the past year I've switched almost exclusively to cruelty free treats for her, but I'm compelled to keep these because she likes them so consistently (rather than other treats in which her interest wanes over time). I would definately recommend trying these if you have a picky dog - and even if you don't.

review/summary: Oscar loves these treats!
review/text: I'm so glad to find these treats available on Amazon.com!<br /><br />Our mini-dachshund Oscar absolutely loves Lean Treats. We call them "stinky" treats because they have a strong aroma, which seems extremely appealing to Oscar. I don't know what it is about them, but Oscar thinks they're the best ever.<br /><br />Lean Treats are soft enough that we can break them in half to ensure he gets a very small portion. They are also low fat, which is wonderful for a 10-year-old dog that loves to eat.<br /><br />Lean Treats are great for travel. The packaging seals back up quickly and can fit into the glove compartment or suitcase. The packaging design also allows the treats to stay fresh without drying out. In fact, we always keep a package in the car to have handy.<br /><br />Oscar highly recommends Lean Treats! He gives them 5 paws up!
