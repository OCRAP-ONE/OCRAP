review/summary: Perfect liner for countertop composters
review/text: I bought these bags to use as liners for my new countertop compost bin. They fit perfectly and are very durable. They are also the perfect size to hold litter box scoopings. I use the smaller (regular) size of these bags to pick up waste from my small (12 lb.) dog. I also use the 3 gallon size to line my kitchen garbage pail. I am very happy with all the BioBag products.

review/summary: Much better than other "biodegradable" bags...
review/text: Most other biodegradable plastic poop-scoop bags, actually just break up in to smaller tiny pieces of plastic and eventually find their way to the ocean. These bags are made of real biodegradable ingredients!! Vastly superior and better for the environment. Just make sure to get the right size for your dog. They make other bags too, I use their garbage bags now as well. I've also asked my local pet store to start carrying their products!

review/summary: Awesome item!
review/text: I looked around when it came time to buy dog bags and I originally landed on another "biodegradable" item which turned out to do no such thing so I continued my search until I landed on these puppies (no pun intended).  They're the perfect size and work really well.  they aren't to thin, like some bags can be, and the holes provided make it easy for them to just hang right next to the door!  The only downside about them is sometimes it can be hard to open but it's something you can get used to really quick.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to anyone who asked about them!<br /><br />Update 08/2011 (from 5 stars to 3)<br /><br />I've had these items for a while now and with my last purchase it seemed that quite a few of the bags seemed to simply rip open on my walk.  It can be rather gross to simply be walking along and have poop fly out behind or in front of you.  In total they do seem to still work but I'm constantly bringing along more bags than I need as a precaution that I may have to double bag.  I'll stick with them until I can find a better product but now I'm on the look out.

review/summary: Eco poop
review/text: I assume (based on the manufacturer description) these are more eco friendly then the newspaper plastic wrapper and other plastic poop bags we used to buy, that's the positive, which is really enough, however, if they would make a few changes it would be an even better product.<br />1) The bags come in a box as sheets, I prefer the roll style that I can put in a bag holder and clip to a belt or put in a pocket.<br />2) They should be larger for larger dogs, one of my dogs is 100lbs and almost needs two bags each time. If your dog is not large it works fine.<br />I guess its a good start for the right reasons, hopefully they will continue to improve over time....this is a repeat purchase used daily.

review/summary: Great Value!
review/text: I'm really pleased with these bags. They come with holes punched in the top of the bag so you can hang them on a hook and just grab one as you head out the door with your dog. My dog is small/medium sized (a Bedlington Terrier) and these bags are just the right size for his poop. They're big enough that, after I've got the poop inside, I can tie a knot in the top of the bag -- making it a simple matter to just toss the bag in a trash can along our walk. I've found these bags to be plenty sturdy, too. Finally, what a great price! My local pet supply store sells these bags at $9.99 for 50. Amazon's price is like getting almost 2 1/2 boxes free. Such a deal.

review/text: These bags are exactly what I wanted for cat litter. They are a little small but manageable. However, I purchased them because they have a minimal effect on the environment, but they came in a huge box filled with plastic inflatable filling. The box could have fit 40x the product. Do you really need to protect a cardboard box with trash bags in it to that extent? I would have been really happy with an envelope to hold them. Amazon needs to take note. If someone buys an environmentally friendly product, they will look at the entire experience. Shame on Amason!

review/text: I got these for my 2 cats litter boxes and the opening of these bags is too small. You end up having to touch the stuff too much to get it in the bag. I wanted a kitty waste bio bag and they dont have any so I got the dog bags. I know you use these different than one would in emptying excess kitty mess, because your supposed to pick the stuff up with the bag and then flip it over, but I just wanted a bag to dump the stuff in and the hole opening doesnt work for that.

review/summary: i used to love these bags
review/text: i first found out about these bags several years back and before i found them available on amazon.  i have been using them for at least 4 years and while i love the concept and the product lived up to the expectations at first, my last two batches have really made me wary of their use.  i have a 40 lb dog and a 70lb dog.  i agree with the reviewer that sometimes with the medium sized dogs with a bigger, messier amount, the size of these bags doesn't quite cut it.  however, i carry extra and just use another if there is a larger deposit.<br /><br />to my dismay, my biggest beef has been with the reliability of these bags lately.  the last two orders of 4-packs that i have ordered have split open, either along the seam on the bottom or just along the crease on the side.  it's happened several times that i am just walking along and the poop flies out from the bag behind me, in front of me, off to the side, wherever, due to a burst seam.  i cringe at the thought of a bag bursting open and getting fecal on my leg or on my dogs.  my dogs are well trained, loose leash walkers who flank my legs so it's not like there is crazy activity on my part with regard to momentum/inertia.  i thought double bagging would be a solution but have found that even triple-bagged, the seams burst.  i think i have found a replacement biodegradable solution and am sad that i cannot stay with this product.<br /><br />i am not sure if the recipe for the starch bags has changed over the years or if i am getting really old batches (just like rubber bands, every product has a life-span) but due to my reluctance to get poop on my person, i have to switch away from these.

review/summary: Seams split, some bags slashed
review/text: I had been happily using these bags for about a year, and ordered them through Amazon's subscribe and save, but in my last shipment of 4 boxes, two of the boxes had bags with weak side seams which split open when I tried to use them. Also, in one of the boxes, some of the bags were slashed or cut, even though the box itself was whole and unmarked. That's 100 bags that are completely unusable.<br /><br />According to Amazon's return policy, this item is not eligible for return, so you'd be out some money if you order this item and it's defective. I have contacted Amazon anyway, and also written to Biobag USA to register a complaint.

review/summary: Regular Size is Too Small
review/text: The nice thing about the BioBags is that they open easily (the sides don't get stuck together), and that they are biodegradable - although, I'm not sure how beneficial the latter is if the bags end up inside another non-biodegradable bag, e.g. in the town park.<br /><br />The problem with the BioBag (regular size) is that it is only 7.4" wide, as compared to 8.5" for the Mutt Mitt and 10.7" for the Pooch Pick-Up bag. (All measurements are of one side of the bag, when it is opened and laid flat.) Instructions show you putting your hand through the bag and picking up the poop, and pulling it back through the bag. Unfortunately sometimes it is a tight fit to get your hand plus the poop back through this bag. If the poop is on the messy side, it can easily touch and stick to the inside top of the bag, and then maybe to you. (My experience is with a medium sized dog, but I think you could have the same problem with a small dog.) I find myself being very careful pulling the poop through, and I have sometimes had to put the dirty bag inside a second bag...then get out some sanitary wipes for my hands.<br /><br />The BioBag has from 1 to 3 dime-sized holes near the top (not sure why the hole punching seems to be inconsistent), so you can use one as a carrying handle by looping it over a finger. The actual purpose of the holes are so that you can pull through the other side of the bag as a way of closing it.

(Here is the link for the product site which give you the facts on these bags:  [...])  I purchased the regular bags and the bags are a nice size.  I am sure you could even pick up a large dogs feces in these bags.  They come in a recyclable box and the bags are lumped together with a perforated top.  I read another person's review and they had mentioned that these bags are difficult to open, but it is not true.  You separate the bag from the perforated top and they are opened.  Also, I love how there are holes on the top of the bag, so instead of tying a knot, you just stick one side through the hole and seal it that way.  Pretty neat, in my opinion.  Overall, these are great bags and they are great for the environment.  The only thing I wish is that Amazon would offer the Subscribe & Save feature for this product.

review/summary: Significant Drop in Quality
review/text: We purchased these bags for several months through Amazon and thought were they were a great idea for collecting dog poop.  The original we bags we purchased had a dull finish and the seams in the sides of the bags were quite strong.  The last batch of bags we received was made of a different material, one that has a shinier finish.  The seams in these bags are very weak and, more often than not, split open when you try and pick up the mess left by your pet.  This, unfortunately, can leave you with a handful of poop.  At the very least, you have the predicament of holding a potential mess in one hand and a leash in the other while trying get out a second bag.  We originally had Amazon sending us bags on a monthly basis.  That order has been canceled and we are looking for a new biodegradable bag.

review/summary: Narrow and rips easily
review/text: When it comes to doggy bags, I think consumers have the right to be outrageously critical. If 1 out of 1,000 bags rips during mid-poo-pick-up, the company automatically deserves zero stars in my opinion. In this case, about 9 out of the last 13 bags I've used from this brand has ripped either pre or post pick-up. It's incredibly annoying. And friggin gross. I've had to double-bag the last few times just to be extra cautious.<br /><br />The entire bag and its opening is very narrow, which makes flipping it inside out a pain in the ass, especially if you have an average or larger sized fist. Not only that, but if you have a medium/large sized dog that produces medium/large sized doggy doos, then in the process of flipping the bag inside out, you'll actually smear throughout the entire bag opening, which makes tying it up an even more delicate process. Just plain annoying. The seams are the weakest points, and that's where the rips tend to happen. No handles for easy tying -- also pretty annoying.<br /><br />In general, these suck.

review/text: I want to be environmentally friendly in every way possible, but was confused as to which bin I can toss these poop bags in.  After doing a little research at home, Seattle Public Utilities website ([...]) states that they approve BioBag and therefore can be thrown into the Food & Yard Waste bin.  However, King County's website ([...]) states that pet waste can NOT be thrown into the Food & Yard Waste bin.  Feeling a little confused, I decided to call Seattle Public Utilities to find out exactly which bin the pet waste BioBag can be tossed in.  Boy, I am glad I called the city before purchasing these bags!  The employee stated that while these bags are compostable, pet AND human wastes contain harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites that may continue to live on.  Because of health hazard reasons, the best way to dispose of these is to toss them into the garbage bin regardless of whether the bag is compostable or not.  After saying all this, the employee basically said that I should save money and buy regular pet waste bags and use the BioBags for food compost instead.<br /><br />Here are links I found afterwards that support what the employee told me (minus the health hazard details):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]

However, there are few things that make this particular packaging of BioBags unappealing to me.<br /><br />First, I seem to have a lot of "leftovers" after I've used all the bags.  Each set of 50 comes in it's own cardboard box... a little odd for a product that wants to be environmentally friendly.  However, there's now an bulk option with no individual boxes - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00873RFZU">BioBag Regular Dog Bags 50 count (Pack of 4) NO BOX</a>.<br /><br />The other leftover is the strip of material that holds each set of 50 bags together.  I assume rolls wouldn't have leftover like this.  I'll find out since rolls are now available - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CGJGK4">BioBag Dog Waste Bags On Roll, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 5)</a>.  I'll give them a try.  The only trouble is that I haven't yet found a bulk version of rolls.<br /><br />My other issue (other than leftovers) is that these tear-a-bag tablets tend to be more bulky than rolls.  I always found rolls fit  neatly in small spaces like pockets, making it less likely that I'd forget to take a bag when I leave the house.  For example, I always kept a roll of my previous bags in a coat pocket.  I could leave the house many times without thinking about grabbing a bag.  There was almost always some there.  On the other hand, I found these tear-a-bag tablets too bulky for my dog-walking coat and that I'd just tear one off before i left the house.  The problem is how often I'd forget to tear one off (my problem, not the manufacturer's :)<br /><br />--

review/summary: Biodegradable bags.
review/text: California apparently has banned the use of the word "biodegradable" in bags because of misleading advertising.  The Kyjen bags, for example, are made of polyethylene with biodegradable cornstarch added but the box makes it sound as though the bag breaks down completely.  This is the only bag I have found that breaks down completely in the landfill, rather than into small pieces of plastic.<br /><br />This size, however, is too small for my 95 lb Lab.  Biobags come in a large size, which should solve the problem others have had with a clean pickup.

review/summary: If you have cats, don't bother
review/text: Although theoretically these small bags are ideal --- waste from six cats fills up about three bags per day, the litter scoop fits easily into the opening, and these bags are easier to deal with than sandwich bags --- unfortunately they're not strong enough to deal with the weight of wet litter clumps. They stretch out just in being carried from pan to pan and occasionally rip and fall (usually in the litter pan, thank goodness).<br /><br />I hate it when companies make a product for dogs and then say oh yeah it's good for cats too! NOT.<br /><br />BioBag, please research your claims. Cat litter =/ dog poo. A bag should be strong enough to hold its contents when full, especially when it costs 10x as much as the competition (BioBag ~ 11 cents per bag, sandwich bag ~ 1.5 cents).

review/text: I have been using these bags for some time and they have been great until the last few boxes. Many (not all) of the bags tear along the side seam when attempting to pick up my dog's poop. Unfortunately I have 4 boxes remaining from the last purchased but I am going to start looking for a different brand. Beware of this product and carry a backup bag and a hand wipe!

review/summary: Good but a little small
review/text: I foster dogs of all sizes for a local shelter. My forever dog is an 80lb lab mix. For larger dogs like our lab, the large bags are a must.  We use the regular for anything under about 50lbs, I would guess. For really big dogs, like a 100lb great pyranees we had recently, even the big bags don't cut it. If you have a bear or a St Bernard, you may find these bags too small.<br /><br />These bags also compost as promised, even in my slow, unmanaged home yard composter (don't worry, it doesn't go on any food crops). The bags take about 6 months to a year to degrade completely under these conditions--I would say a few months slower than "regular" slow-composting items like corn cobs, for example. It helps if you don't tie the bag off completely, or rip it right before adding to the composter, so the poo microbes can get to work heating up the surrounding compost instead of dying in the plastic while they wait.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: We've been using these bags for almost two years, and we love them. They look and feel like thin stretchy plastic, and they are surprisingly strong. I even accidentally ran a few through the washer & dryer, and they worked fine. These come in two sizes, and I recommend trying a bag with the same dimensions before buying in bulk. Well worth the few pennies per bag to reduce the environmental impact.

review/summary: Poop Detail Made Easier for a Woman with Three Dogs
review/text: I like this products, they are lightweight and I was told by the Green Store near us that you could actually give these to farmers to use in their compost.  Thought we have not yet done that, we have used TONS of these bags.  We originally started off with recycling the plastic bags that stores give you- and although I would stick as much poop as I could in there, I still felt bad about what they were doing to the environment.  I have also on numerous occasions had a bag break on me.  However, since we switched to these bags, I have not yet had one issue- regardless of a dog stepping on them while playing, getting pulled extremely tight in a leash, etc.  They are so tiny, you can easily fit 5 or 6 in your pocket without having all the bulk that you would with plastic bags.  The best part is, that it easily accommodates all the deposits that each of my dogs make-whether it be my 5 month old puppy, my 60 pound husky, or my 80 pound aussie/chow mix.

review/summary: Not sure they arrived at "Biodegradable"
review/text: I bought these bags to go in our poo composter instead of tossing the bags in the trash.  Well, after several months these bags are not degrading at all, bio or otherwise.  The composter has RidX and the poos breaks find, just not the bags.<br /><br />Sooooo..... if you want a ok poop bag, these are as good as any other (although not as handy as the roll up type in the little carriers though) but don't expect them to break down in anything but your local landfill.<br /><br />Another down side to these bags; the bags are too small to be tied off tightly to seal in the poo so the trash can really smells.<br /><br />Since all this stuff will end up the landfill anyway, you will do much more good for the environment by reusing plastics grocery to pick up your dog waste.  Certainly plenty big and can be easily tied off to lock in the smell making trash day a much more pleasant experience.

review/summary: Best bags I've found
review/text: These bags are the best that I've found. I'm skeptical of just how biodegradable things like this are, but I like that it's made with natural materials. Of course, I'm not going compost a bag full of poop, but hey.<br /><br />Most importantly, the large sized bags are big enough for my large dogs' droppings. The bags are sturdy - I never, ever get the pleasant surprise of a hole in the bag as I pick up a steaming pile with these bags. So I get them shipped as a "subscription" from Amazon and use them even though my neighborhood and the dog park I frequent both have doggy-doo stations with inferior bags provided. If you're looking for top notch, large size bags, I highly recommend them.

I've used them on occasion to pick up after big dogs and they've held up fine, just keep in mind that something that is meant to biodegrade is not going to be as solid as something that isn't meant to decompose.

review/summary: Outdoor dispensing
review/text: I prefer the bags on a roll for portability, and biodegradable ones are a little harder to find, so I purchased these.  These waste bags are great if you have a post or a wall on which to hang them for one-at-a-time dispensing, ie in the dog park.  They are a good thickness so there's no risk of an accidental tear ruining your day while you're picking up your puppy's business.  The BioBag has a slightly smaller opening than I would like, so that while it's easy enough to slip your hand into the bag while it's empty, once you have a handful of poop, it's harder to slip the bag back over the mess to tie it off!  This is only a minor inconvenience, and overall the BioBag is a good product.

review/text: These bags are great!  I really enjoy that they come in the 50 pack since they last quite a while.  I pretty much add these to any Amazon order where I need to add something to qualify for free shipping.<br /><br />Ok people....I know that a bag is a bag is a bag and there is not much that can be said that will sound special.  What I can say is that these do not rip apart easily or tear hopes in themselves or anything like that.  So no risk of "stuff" on your hands.  They also tie easily and the "stuff" does not smell even if you leave the bag on the porch for a while.  They are thick enough that they seem like they are worth the money.<br /><br />They are also certified as compostable and not just biodegradable.  That means they will actually degrade in a reasonable amount of time, even if it is just in your backyard compost pile.  Most of those other biodegradable bags you see out there (especially the ones that come in little rolls, are cheap, or are colored/scented) are not going to disintegrate in your compost......and are also not certified by anyone.  They take years and years and years to degrade.  Trust me, these ones are tough when you need them, but will go back to nature when needed just as quickly.<br /><br />These bags come with two holes on the top tear strip above the perforation where they separate from each other.  My trick for using them is that I have two hooks by my front door mounted so that these bags hang from them perfectly.  I use the removable plastic ones like.... <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M3V8XI">Command 17003-VP-3PK Large Plastic Hooks Value Pack</a>.  I just tear off a bag or two when I am headed out the door with the dog.

review/text: We are trying to make some changes at our house and using less plastic is a difficult task when dogs are involved. "Waste bags" are a necessity and the plastic bags that supermarkets give for free were a simple solution until we discovered they were sitting in our local landfill and never going anywhere. BioBag is really great. Other reviewers seemed unhappy with the construction of the bags, but we have two 70 pound dogs and a visiting 80 pound dog and these bags hold up without any issue at all! We clean our yard three or four times a week and then we have daily walks and we haven't had any problems at all. We use the regular sized bags without size issue. We store the bags in a cool, dry pantry away from any light or heat. We both feel better that we are not contributing to the landfill problems and we're being responsible pet owners!

Whether you wanted 1 or 2 at a time or you wanted to separate them all and put them in a container, the perforations were way too strong and made separating the bags difficult.<br /><br />The perforations have been weakened so that now a box can be separate into individual bags in two or three pulls of batches of bags, making the separating process MUCH easier...(even if you just want 1 or 2 at a time). I like them. I really like them!

They are durable but light and can easily stand up to anything my 70lb Pointer mix and 50lb Heeler mix can dish out. The only drawback to them is that I broke it down to about $.05 per scoop. That ain't cheap and it makes it impossible for everyone to use. My wife and I aren't even close to well off financially but we make sacrifices in other areas for the peace of mind that we are not contributing to the daily destruction of our planet and its resources. Overall, GREAT poo bags and you should buy them if you can afford to do so but keep in mind that being environmentally responsible comes with its price.

review/summary: *Really* Compostable and Handy!
review/text: Unlike many bags which say they are biodegradable or compostable, these really are.  In addition, they are made from corn, so they hurt our environment a lot less (and avoid the waste of precious un-renewable resources).  Our local pet store is often out of stock of this size, which is perfect for our small dogs' amount of waste, so I find ordering them on Amazon much more convenient.  These are really easy to use (there are directions printed on each bag, though you can easily figure it out on your own), and they feature a hole in the top so you can pull the other side through to "close" it, then hang it off a finger--something I really appreciate when I have my hands full of leashes while walking two dogs. They are black, so no one has to look at your dog's waste, and they trap smell very well.  I can't recommend these enough!

review/summary: odd size mishap but good overall
review/text: These bags are great as they are actually fully biodegradable unlike many other products on the market which claim to be. If you haven't used compostable bags before be aware that leaving food in them for a few days can cause holes in the bottom (I don't always use them for pet stuff). Now for the odd part of my shipment: In the first box I opened the bags seemed surprisingly small I actually planned to use these for cat litter and it was hard to scoop into these little bags without spilling, to my surprise all three of the other boxes contained much better (bigger) sized bags, odd. Anyway no complaints about what seems to be the correct size.

review/text: We've had about 5 bag seams fail and splat poop on the ground (and once on us - we learned our lesson).  Most of the time, the bag will hold the 60lb dog's poop, but I don't think I'd trust it for anything over about a 40lb dog.  Small dog poops should be fine.  We'll be switching bags to something more ... robust.

review/summary: BioBags and Quality
review/text: There are almost 100 "BioBag" reviews on Amazon - so I don't see any need to review the product, per se. But I would like to comment on the "quality issues" raised by some reviewers. I am sure that those reviewers who report "split seams" are being honest about their experience - but that has not been mine.<br /><br />My wife and I share our home with the Three Muske-Terriers, (a male Westie, a female Scotty and a male Cesky) - these little fur balls manage to go through about a box of "BioBags" a week. We've been using BioBags for about a year now, (our favorite biodegradeable/compostable bags - Spike Brands' "Dog Business Bags" - seem to have disappeared from the marketplace*). To the best of my recollection, we've never had a defective bag straight from the box - nor have we had a bag "fail" during use.<br /><br />I do think that it would be difficult to use the "regular size" bags if your hands are the size of Sonny Liston's, or to pick up after a large dog. In either case, you should probably opt for the "large size."<br /><br />* 12/1/2011 Up-date: "Dog Business Bags" are once again available on Amazon through the Recycled Retriever.

review/text: Have used these bags for over 2 years now and have remained completely satisfied.  I've never had one tear or break and I have a 90 pound dog that makes relatively-sized "deposits". Yes, they cost more than plastic bags (many of which we can all get for free), but I feel it is something that I can spend my money on that helps the environment as these bags breakdown (as do doggie deposits) more quickly.

review/summary: Recycle part of bag make-up is great!  But....
review/text: Imagine my surprise when walking with my dogs (yes, 2 of them) after having picked up the poo from one of them and it's "in the bag" so-to-speak, and as we are walking to the nearest garbage can, we are leaving a trail of poo-poo behind us because the bottom of the poo-bag split open.  Oh my, what a mess.  Luckily, it didn't land on me anywhere.  But I did have to go back and re-pick up the poo in another bag.  I would not have been too upset had this been a one-time problem, but unfortunately it's now happened 5 or 6 times, all from the first box of 4 that I bought.  So now, I have to double-bag each poo, but that now means each walk is about $1.75 a dog.  I do not mind spending money to take care of my dogs, but I do like to purchase products that do what they are designed to do.  The recycle part is great, which is why I am buying them, but they need to do the job of actually containing the poo, to be effective.  Please fix this design flaw.  Thank you.

review/summary: Good for what they are.
review/text: These are some of the few bags (I haven't found any other) that are considered biodegradable in California. Other bags are "biodegradble except by California standards." I have a Chihuahua and Pekingese and size wise they work out fine. I haven't had the quality issues other reviewers have had (yet), but they do seem like a different material (more shiny) than years past. I will be looking out for splitting seams per the other reviewers. So far I am happy with them. One star deducted because they are expensive.

review/summary: Great Bags
review/text: I use these bags for a litter box used by two cats.  I bring my own bags to the grocery store and therefore, have no extra plastic bags to use every morning at the litter box.  I also wanted a green alternative.  I have been using these bags for about a year and will continue using them - they are small in size and good durability.  Depending what you need them for, they may be too small, but they are plenty big for a single cat or dog "event."  In my case, two cats 1x per day does the trick.<br /><br />The quality is quite good and the materials doesn't come off as cheap or weak (otherwise I would not enjoy handling waste).<br /><br />Highly recommended for both value (200 bags) and quality.

Even though the bags are thin, they are sturdy, and I have not had any blowouts with them.  I won't buy these again, though, because of those holes at the top.

review/summary: It's about the environment
review/text: I purchased the Large and Regular sized bags for cleaning up after my two 75 lb. labrador retrievers.  I've used BioBags for about a year and, very occasionally, I'll find one that is split in a seam, so I examine them first before I go for a pile.  For the most part, however, they stand up to the task.  Even though I have big dogs, I can usually pick up one pile with the smaller bag, which is cheaper per bag than the large.  If I'm going out to the yard for two or three piles, I'll use the larger bag.  Since I'm throwing two to four bags in the trash every day, it makes me feel better about the cumulative waste knowing that the bags will degrade in a landfill within short time.  (Some bags labeled "biodegradable" don't really break down easily and can be around for years, but BioBags degrade within weeks.)<br /><br />By the way, all bags will get really stinky if left in a covered trash can for a few days when the weather is warm.  I solved this problem by drilling drainage holes (in case of rain) in a small wastebasket and putting the bags in there when the temperature starts staying above 50 degrees.  I just leave the wastebasket outside next to the regular trashcan and it gets emptied with our twice-weekly pickup.  If you have to use a dumpster or wheeled trashcan, you can empty the small wastebasket into that the night before pickup.

Easy to finish the job and toss into a trash can.<br /><br />The only negative is that when I left one in my pocket, it exploded in the dryer and I got heated black plastic on my clothes that I couldn't get out.

review/summary: Good but not perfect
review/text: These bags do the job.  They are good quality and I have yet to find one that has a defect.  I feel good that they are as environmentally friendly as you can get.  My only gripe would be their size and/or their lack of handle ties.  My dogs are only 30 pounds so their - ahem - loads are not gigantic by any means.  But if you gather any extra debris such as leaves then it can be difficult to tie the bags off.  This was especially true when I was wearing winter gloves.  I would say any pup bigger than mine definitely needs the large size bags.<br /><br />Edit: Unfortunately the new batch of bags that I ordered did not measure up to the review I posted.  I would guess about 1 in 5 of the bags had faulty bottoms.  If you carry the bag for any distance then the bottom would give way and its contents would spill.  After this happened a few times I started handling the bags more gingerly, but even that didn't help much.  I don't know if it was a temporary glitch in the manufacturing process or not but I don't plan to find out.  Sorry Biobag, but I'm switching over to Mutt Mitts.

review/text: I did a long search for bio degradable bags and settled on these.  They are fine until the seam at the bottom slips apart.  Granted this only happened probably 3 times in the box, but that's three times too many.  Wet poop falling straight out on to the side walk is an unpleasant, difficult job to clean up.  Not being able to trust the bag makes for a tedious hold after use for the remainder of the walk.  Disappointed.  Find a better adhesive for the seam and it would be all good!

review/summary: Great for cats
review/text: I'd been looking for a long time for a poop bag for my cat that would actually degrade in a reasonable time. I ordered the LARGE size and they fit nicely into our tiny cat trash can. And so far I am very satisfied, no holes, they hold up very well, seem sturdy enough for poop and scooped litter, easy to tie up. The only downside to them is the following: As I said, I use the bags for my cat. So I use the bags to line a little plastic bucket that I use to store used litter. I take out the bag every time that I scoop poop (so every other day). It seems like the outside of the bag gets a little damp by then from the litter. On the other hand the bags are mean for picking up poop and throwing them out right afterwards, not for having them sit around with waste in them.

My husband likes the BioBag bags better because they are bigger than the J-Trend bags.  He finds that because the BioBag are closer in size to a grocery store plastic bag, it is a lot easier for him to put his hand inside the BioBag than the J-Trend bag.  I found that I don't have a problem with the J-Trend bag, but my hand is smaller than my husband.  Our dog is 48 lbs. and both bags are able to hold our dog's poop.  However, in our next order, I will be buying the BioBag bags instead of the J-Trend bags.

review/summary: Thank HEAVEN they came out with the large size!
review/text: So I've used Bio Bags for a few years now. They hold up better than the other compostable bags and they're not very expensive. I have a 90-pound Lab-Mastiff mix who doesn't poop *that* much but on days of large volume or lacking firmness, the regular sized bags wouldn't do the best of fitting all the waste in one bag, nor keeping it off my hands. When I turn the large size bags inside-out for pickup they go clear up to my wrist and I can do pretty tricky (and large) collection jobs using one bag, with no waste ending up on my hands. There's always plenty bag left to tie it off at the top so that I can carry the bag before throwing it away.<br /><br />A box of regular (50 bags) and a box of large size (35 bags) cost the same, however with the large size I don't have to use two bags per load, double bag, and pretty much never end up with messy hands. If you have a larger dog, about 70 lbs or more, the large size is the way to go.

review/summary: Best Price: Be aware these are probably not the same as you get in your local store
review/text: Just be aware these are not regular kind you most likely find in your local store that uses sea salt and olive oil.<br /><br />They are raw.<br /><br />What I do is take one sheet of the raw and then one sheet of the olive oil/salt and fold them together and snack on them that way.<br /><br />The raw sheets are hard to eat on their own because they stick to your mouth, but it works better when you combine them plus you are able to take advantage of the cost savings.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Tasty but not truly raw
review/text: These taste great and it's nice to see they've come out with some naked seaweed without anything added.  However...I've had raw seaweed before, and I seriously doubt this is raw.  It is crunchy which probably means it's been processed at high heat, which is also common for many products that claim to be raw.  Truly raw seaweed has a crispness to it but is still fairly chewy and more difficult to break apart. I read the label and it says nothing about what temperature it is processed  (other companies who manufacture raw items typically provide this information).  I knew I bought it at my own risk, and am disappointed since I like this company.

review/summary: Be Good Brand pressed rawhide bones
review/text: Just arrived. First thing I look for is where they're made. I bought these hoping they were made in USA. I choose these because the similar product on Amazon had a review stating they were made in China. These are too. Bummer! I just don't trust what you get from products made in China.<br />Hey Amazon, how about you put some pressed rawhide bones on your site that are made in America. I'd gladly pay a little more knowing they're actually made form cows instead of what ever is comming out of China.<br />As for the bones themselves, they look fine. My German Sheapard is less than impressed though. He took it out of my hand, set it down, and hasen't given it a look since. Waste of money!<br /><br />Update... After a while my dogs did enjoy these. They didn't last very long however, as pressed rawhide bones are supposed to. I bumped the rating up to 2 stars because at least they got around to eating them. Still hate the fact they're made in China

review/summary: Good American rawhide
review/text: I love my dog. He loves to chew on things. I hate it when he chews on my shoes, furniture, appliances, walls (yes he actually has chewed on my walls), etc. I also would like him to stay alive. So these are a great option. The compacted rawhide is better for him than the normal rawhide bones due to the fact that it wont break off in large intestine blocking pieces. They also last a whole lot longer than regular rawhide bones. To top it all off, these bones are not made in some factory in China, where we constantly hear of poisoned products coming from. I love my dog and even though I may have wanted to kill him after he chewed up a pair of my girlfriend's expensive shoes...I still want him to be healthy. So I will definitely purchase these again (As I have a few times now). Also, these bones are cost effective compared to others on the market.

review/summary: Sturdy for Heavy Chewers
review/text: Much tougher than most rawhides, even the compressed ones. I find that my dog took at least a day with a little leftover the first day. The second one, she doesn't even want to chew. It looks like it doesn't have a good flavor. I truly believe she only ate the first one because it was "new toy syndrome".<br />Got these at a GREAT price, but it's not really worth it if she doesn't eat them.<br />Collie/hound mix, 3 year old, loves rawhides.

review/summary: Great value
review/text: These bones are great because the compressed rawhide lasts much longer than other rawhides, making them great for powerful chewers.  And I love buying them in bulk like this because if you buy them individually they're usually around $8 each...

review/summary: Unwelcome Side Effects
review/text: I've been using Wellness "Just for Puppy" dry dog food mix ever since I brought my French Bulldog puppy home with great results. My pup simply loves his dog food and happily chows down at every meal.<br /><br />With the positive results from the puppy food I decided to try out these Wellness "Just for Puppy Treats". Unfortunately, even though the ingredient list is impressive - real pieces of lamb & salmon along with a mix of veggies and fruit - the results have been less than ideal. These treats cause my pup to have room-clearing gas and make his stool extremely runny.<br /><br />I planned on using these treats for obedience training and positive reinforcement for house breaking. But after putting up with a solid week of terrible gas and diarrhea I had to switch to a different puppy treat I purchase at my local Whole Foods. The results were immediately better - a lot less gas and firm stool.

review/summary: Gave my puppy the runs
review/text: These are the first treats I had purchased for our new puppy after reading several reviews on Amazon.  He'd only been home a few days and we were trying to reward him for going potty outside - these treats were completely counteractive.  The first night after starting the treats, his stools became very runny and he made many messes in the house.  We continued to give him the treats for another three days as we didn't realize the connection - his stools hardened the day after we stopped using these treats and he can now hold it and go outside!  He's been doing MUCH better on other puppy treats (went to PetCo for them) and I'm so thankful the runny poo messes are no longer a threat to my barefoot family.<br />Puppy is a 10 week old Staffordshire Terrier.

review/summary: Great Training Aid
review/text: I have been giving these treats to my nine month old Papillon since she was eight weeks old.  It is very easy to train her because she will do anything for one of these treats.  She just loves them!  And, there are no unpleasant side effects.

review/summary: Pomeranian Favorite
review/text: My very finicky, 5 yo - 5lb Pomeranian, with an fussy stomach, loves these treats and I love that this product is so nutritious.  This product is a large treat for a 5 lb dog as each is about 5/8 in square but it is soft enough to break into pieces for training rewards.  And although products states PUPPY I give it to my 5 yo because she likes it and it's nutritious.  I have a very hard time finding this in San Antonio stores and Amazon delivers them to my doorstep at better then local prices and no shipping or tax .. got to love it.  Product arrived safetly and quickly.

review/summary: Made Puppy Sick
review/text: My puppy just couldn't take these treats--or the grain-free dog food. It just wasn't for him. He was having a lot of digestions problems, which went away as soon as we stopped giving him these treats.<br /><br />Make your own treats if you have the time! My dog prefers our homemade treats, plus there are no added preservatives, and you'll know how long they've been sitting around.<br /><br />Good luck!
