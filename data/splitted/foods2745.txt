review/summary: Keurig Officepro
review/text: This is my third Keurig coffee maker. The first one lasted a little over a year before it started giving me problems. The second one lasted about eighteen months and I started having the same problem as with the first one.  So I decided to get a office pro because of the many cups of coffee I make and so far I have had no problems.  It cost more than the regular ones but is worth the extra money if you use your coffee maker a lot.

review/text: Like many others, I decided the home models were too unreliable and I bought an OfficePro 145 for home use. After 1 month of absolutely great coffee, and no problems with either setup or operation, I can recommend this unit. Haven't purchased a refillable cup adapter yet. If you're considering one of these, spend the extra $$ and get one of the office models. It's worth it.<br />CapnRuss

review/text: This product works well.  The water dispensing amount is the only issue we have.  The claims that the product would fill a travel mug on the large setting doesn't quite do that.  It fills more like 2/3.  The small and medium settings are just that, small and medium is more like half a cup.  Other than that, it's all it claims to be.

review/summary: Stay away!
review/text: Warning, mine has stopped pumping water inside the machine to be heated. The outer tank is seated properly and the drain switch is turned to the proper position. Worked fine for a month, now this junk is not working. Something to note. When this machine works it is noisy and vibrates quite a bit. Also, if you do not use the drain feature and take some time to pump the water out of the inner heating chamber you will NOT be making coffee with fresh water! So if you have not done the chore of draining the machine, the water will be as old as the last time you brewed! I am going back to my old Kitchenaid Spa brewer, it does a fantastic job, the water is ALWAYS fresh as I do not have to drain the thing then put in more water!The Keurig made great coffee when it worked, but if you take the price of the machine and the price of the 45 cups of coffee I made the last 38 days that comes to $3.64 per cup to own it. Also,be SURE that you do not forget to turn off the power to the machine AFTER EACH use. If yours stops pumping water as mine has and has no water in the inner heating tank, my question is does it have a safety device that keeps it from overheating and causing a fire? Just wanted to give my honest review and make sure that these things are safe. UPDATE: After contacting Keurig and waiting a MONTH. NOTHING. This is one disgusting Company. They make product that will not last, then when you ask for a fix or replacement you GET NOTHING. I WILL NEVER EVER OWN another one of these pieces of junk!

review/summary: A very disappointing Christmas present!
review/text: I purchased the Keurig OfficePRO for my daughter and her family as a Christmas present. She tried it out only to call me to tell me that this $$$$$ item made a very loud noise AND it wouldn't brew at all!!  She contacted the vendor to return it and was told she could only receive a store credit (my bad....didn't check that out before I purchased). So she went through the manufacturer directly and now she has to pay a substantial amount to get the home brewing system. Because she is a sweet, thoughtful daughter she refuses to tell me how much this is going to cost her.  I am very disappointed in this whole experience, as I read the reviews of the home brewing systems before I settled on the OfficePro. So I would not recommend this product through any vendor!!

review/summary: essential compenents not included! and seller not warned on box!
review/text: I bought a Keurig, couldnt get it to prime, and kept returning this silly product and getting a new one, only to not have it work either.  Then, LO!, I watched the online video and finally learned it requires a water filter that is not included with the product!  That alone is mystifying to me--why would an essential component not be included, like water filters for water pitchers??  Really, it includes a bonus pack of coffee that you cant initially use but not the filter that you absolutely have to have?!?!<br /><br />More disturbing, however, is why the absence of this critical component is not disclosed on the box (a la, "batteries not included" notices), or in the instructions, or even by  the two brain trust customer service reps with whom I spent 30-45 minutes on the phone with on 2 separate occasions!!<br /><br />Finally, I had to spend a day tracking down this essential-but-rare-and-not-included component b/c I have clients coming to the office tomorrow and cant wait for the online ordering process....  It turns out most of the various retailers dont know it's not included yet necessary, so none of them stock it on hand!<br /><br />Brilliant, Keurig!

review/summary: A BigShinyNoisy Keurig OfficePRO BRICK!
review/text: March 2012 - In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and started searching for a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the "K-Cup" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines, and the on-line Reviews for this model were all 4-Star or better. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' unit ... for offices and heavy-duty use.<br /><br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along-side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances, and took off.<br />When I returned back this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Right now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />Comparison of the Keurig OfficePRO versus the Tassimo Bosch:<br /><br />* Start-up Time: Tassimo Win's, as it starts to Brew immediately after you turn it on! Keurig has a 'Warm-Up Phase, until an Indicator light's up, to let you know that it's ready to brew.<br /><br />* Brewing Time: Tassimo Win's, as it's a bit Faster, regardless of the Size of the T-disc, and because you literally have no "start-up" time.<br />So Logically, this will play a factor in the Brewing Time, as well. In fairness, we are talking about a 2 to 3-minute gap, that this could be interpreted as being a bit too Subjective, but, that's how I roll ...<br /><br />* Brew Strength: Tassimo Win's again! I tested a Medium StarBuck's T-disc Grind, versus a Medium StarBuck's K-Cup. The Keurig's strength was more like MILD, than Medium.<br /><br />* Unit Noise: Tassimo is significantly quieter than the Keurig unit, by a factor of at least 3!<br /><br />* Water Capacity: Tassimo has 67-ounce removable water tank (without water filter) and accepts MAVEA water filters;<br />The Keurig B145 Water reservoir holds up to 48-ounces. Tassimo Win's!<br /><br />About the UIF (User Interface) and other features, worth mentioning:<br /><br />* Tassimo - On the Front Faceplate, it has 1 Large 'Chrome Button Wheel', that handles all Functions + an On/Off switch. Keurig - Has 5 controls on the Slant Top/Front aspect and 1 large one in the rear with two functions (brew and for drain).<br />* Tassimo - Has a "Add + Cup Feature" to adjust for a larger Size cup, that is available only during the brewing cycle.<br />* Keurig - Has a built-in Selector for 6, 8 and 10 ounce cups.<br />* Keurig - Has optional "Automatic shut-off" button. Tassimo does not, although I found myself turning off the Keurig, as the Automatic shut-off timer has a long LAG time.<br />* Both have a Removable drip tray for travel mug use. The Tassimo has an Adjustable Cup Platform for Smaller cups, AND can be removed for Taller 10 to 12 ounce cups, as well as, for Cleaning.<br />* Size: The Tassimo > W 8" x H 11" x D 13, at 9 pounds; Keurig larger footprint at about 18 pounds.<br />* WARRANTY: Tassimo > 1-year parts-and-labor warranty; Keurig > 30 DAYS! I just found out!!!!<br />* Disclaimer: Tassimo > No; Keurig > Yes!<br /><br />At it's best showing, those few weeks, the Keurig OfficePRO would have received only an overall 2.5 star rating.<br /><br />Postmortem - I was hoping that the Keurig would eventually replace my Little Red Tassimo Engine That Could ... however, now, I find myself with a Nice, Shiny, Noisy BRICK, that I'm trying to return and get my money back. If not I will sell it for Parts!<br />Meanwhile, The Little Red Tassimo Engine That Could ... Keeps Chugging along ...<br /><br />* Update - Just read the GREAT NEWS that StarBucks is releasing their own CONSUMER Model of a Coffee/Cappuccino Maker this Fall !!!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!

review/summary: I just wanted 1 cup of coffee!
review/text: I purchased this model from my local Staples for $129 for my home. I brought it home and followed the 1st time Prime instructions. First of all when it turned on it was extremely loud! So loud you could hear it all over the house. It shook everything on the counter tops. I know it doesn't have "quiet brew" technology but does it have to sound like a fighter jet in my kitchen! To make matters worse NOTHING came out, not one drop of water. All I got out of the machine was loud noises. I'm extremely disappointed and have to return it to the store today. I'm not sure I even want a replacement because if that's how loud they really are, I think i'll pass. My roommate gets up at 5 am and if I get woken up by the house shaking due to him making coffee every morning, I'll end up throwing the the thing right out the front door.

I ended up giving some of them out to friends. I stopped smoking "tobacco" recently(gotta go to college and get a job), so I don't use them anymore, but I think of them fondly. Only downside is they don't handle the weight of the "tobacco" well.

review/text: Turkey, Duck and Pheasant may sound good to you if you are a human but neither of my two dogs like it. (They don't like the wild salmon either.) BUT they are spoiled and finicky but yours probably are too. They love the lamb which Amazon was out of in the smaller bags so I saw this new flavor and gave it a try. Spot Stew is the only dog food that doesn't make my American Eskimo's skin not break out and he loves the taste as does the other Eskie. I gave it three stars because they will eat it if I supplement it with some chicken.

This is simply outrageous. I got on-line to find a discount on quantity and found this out-of-line pricing instead. For $1 more than they want to charge, I can get 36!

review/summary: The best option yet for our Keurig Brewers!
review/text: Just bought a few of these along with the paper filters. I've been refilling and reusing the regular k-cups and although cost effective and environmentally responsible, a big mess.  The biggest issue I had with refilling was that it was a pain and it was a bit messy.  I could also only get a few good uses before the filter deteriorated.<br /><br />Now here comes these new EZ-Cups!  These are simple to use.  Throw in a filter, add your favorite roast, snap on the lid and brew. There is a spring and a tamper built into the EZ-Cup so that when you snap on the lid the coffee gets tamped/compressed a bit so that the hot water flows through uniformly. The best part is that the cleanup up is a breeze!  Open the lid to the EZ-Cup and toss the filter and used grounds.  Ready for the next cup! No mess and I think very convenient. Brew quality is excellent as you can choose your own favorites and control how much coffee to use. These just work!<br /><br />Great idea!

review/summary: needs slight but easy adaptation
review/text: As is the cup allows water flow thru too quickly thus brewing a rather weak cup of coffee. Simply cut off the bottom of a used K-cup about 3/8" and insert into cup. Proceed as normal and the water will flow more slowly thus brewing a normal cup of coffee. Just keep reusing the insert. It is a no brainer but I got the idea from another reviewer at another site. Best gismo I bought for the Keurig coffee maker!

review/text: I initially had a hard time getting a good and consistant cup of coffee from the EZ cup.  To be honeset, I didn't buy the EZ cup because it was ecofriendly, or even because it would cost less per cup.  I bought it because I love a good cup of coffee.  They are few and far between when using K-cups, and even with all of the blends available in K-cups, there were some I liked that I still just couldn't get. I wanted this to wok, so I followed another reviewer's recommendations and cut the bottom off of a K-cup.  This was to slow the flow of coffe through the device. Unlike the other reviewer, I didn't find that a 3/8" disk did anything, so I experimented. I wound up with a plastic disk that was cut just inside the protruding rim that you find on the bottom of each K-cup.  It seems to slow the flow enough to strengthen the brew.  I also used 2 TBSP of coffee per cup.  I am getting a great consistant cup of coffee.  I can make it allot stronger which is one of the reasons that I have a problem with K-cups.  I used the EZ cup filter with fresh ground coffee.  I agree that the EZ Cup spring tamps down the coffee and it seems to work better with more coffee and the plastic K-cup disk. Now I finally can get a strong cup of coffee regardless of whether a dark or lighter roast. I really think this has made the difference between a convenient coffee maker with mediocre coffee and a great cup of coffee.  I hope you find this review helpful.

review/text: This is a little pricey for the quality.  It can be made to work with the B150 but you need to modify the K Cup holder.  There are two ribs in the holder that need to be removed with a Dremel or similar tool in order to use it.  The first time I put the cup in it didn't fit.  After removing the two ribs it works fine.  Makes no difference when using standard K-Cups after the modification.  Just be sure not to put a hole in the side of the holder or it won't work anymore.  Also would be pretty sure this would void the warranty.

review/summary: Tea for Creative Moods
review/text: Numi's tea sampler has a lot to offer if you enjoy mild teas. If you prefer stronger teas, then you may want to creatively mix and match for a new experience.<br /><br />Delicate Tea for Calm Mornings<br /><br />The Numi "Morning Rise," organic breakfast blend has elements of smooth perfection when blended with milk powder or cream. This tea has a mild dreamy flavor when using one teabag. You may want two if you prefer a stronger morning blend. If you are looking for an elegant tea, this blend of Fair Trade Certified Keemun, Darjeeling, Ceylon and Assam black tea is sure to impress. Morning Rise is a delicate tea that awakens you slowly to the day and seems to bring a new clarity to the mind.<br /><br />Dreamy Vanilla<br /><br />Numi teas are blended to an elegant perfection. Numi "Decaf Black Vanilla" is no exception and will please anyone who loves mild black tea with a hint of vanilla. For a richer experience, use two teabags per 8-ounce cup. This tea is perfect for drinking at night when you are relaxing, reading poetry or starting a new novel. The vanilla flavor is enhanced with a dash of cream or even an little vanilla syrup from France. I can recommend Rieme French Vanilla syrup or even a cane sugar to add a caramel twist.<br /><br />Delicate Ginger with hints of Anise<br /><br />Numi "Golden Chai" is a delicately spiced Assam black tea that I like to blend with the Numi "Chinese Breakfast" tea made with Yunnan black tea. Together they seem perfect and I like using two teabags per experience. This creates a flowery tea scented with anise and cardamom and spiced with cinnamon and ginger. If you like making chai with milk, heat some milk in a saucepan and then add one or two teabags. It is much more convenient than having to look around for all the separate ingredients and the spices and tea are perfectly blended.<br /><br />Afternoons in Africa<br /><br />Bushmen's Brew "Honeybush," "Jasmine Green Tea" and "White Nectar Osmanthus Spring" make a good combination for a honey/floral tea. Adding in a little honey enhances the experience. With this blend you can enjoy white tea with Osmanthus flowers, green tea with jasmine flowers and honeybush tea with a mild flavor. You may enjoy this as an ice tea in the summer.<br /><br />Lemon Iced Mint Tea<br /><br />Numi's "Gen Mai Cha" Toasted Rice Green, Simply Mint "Mooccan Herbal Teasan" and Rainforest Green "Mate Lemon Myrtle Green Tea" can be steeped together to create a delicious tea to pour over ice. Add honey while the tea is hot and lemon juice just before serving.<br /><br />The Lemon Iced Tea was the best experience of all the teas<br /><br />and I can see myself buying a box of each tea so I can make<br /><br />this tea again.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: A Real Treat for My Pooches!
review/text: I keep these treats in the garage because they have have a rather unpleasant odor to me--but not to my two dogs (an Italian Greyhound & Aussie Shepard).  When I head to the garage from the kitchen and reach for the high shelf, my dogs go bonkers, knowing that a trachea is on the menu.  We then head to the backyard--and the dogs split up so they don't have to share their spoils!  The dogs are somewhat thirsty afterwards but it doesn't upset their digestion or bowel movements.  I will buy more!

review/summary: Great chew and healthy too
review/text: I agree with the other reviewer that the product smell is a little unpleasant, but not overwhelming. The chews don't last extremely long for my big dogs. These don't chip into shards or get really smushy so I feel safe letting them chew without supervision. I like knowing that they are getting a natural source of glucosamine and chondroitin, especially since one has arthritis. I used to order these from "Only Natural Pet Store", but they are a little more expensive there and always seem to be out of stock. I'm so glad that I found these on Amazon.

review/text: I love this product, the texture is different than similar ones I have tried.  Unique because these are nice and crunchy, but almost melt in your mouth. Satisfies me the way candy or chips would, but are better because pineapple is so much healthier. This was the first time I ordered these from Amazon. I ordered the three pack and two out of three were great, but one package had a hole in it and the pineapple was too chewy and actually un-edible.  Unfortunately, Amazon does not accept returns on this product.

review/text: As a Florida native, I grew up eating mangoes and love them dearly.  I just tasted this tart and it is wonderful to eat and a nice sight to see.  It is light and creamy, with a delicious mango flavor that lingers in the mouth.  The crust is perfect and it holds up well when sliced.  Although I was told this could last in the freezer for up to a year, I doubt that any thinking person could keep it in the freezer for that long.  It sings out to be savored now.

review/summary: Reminder of my youth
review/text: Once upon a time, one of my friends and I would play wiffleball, expending much energy and perspiring freely (while I still lived back in Illinois). Afterwards? A trip to the local A & W drive in stand. We'd order one or two of the root beers, delivered to our car. Yum! What a way of refreshing ourselves after having engaged in our titanic wiffleball duels!<br /><br />I haven't seen any of the A & W root beer stands in recent years. But I have run across these cans of A & W. The product is not quite as good as the "draft" version. But it still has the cool bite of the original root beer and it still satisfies when I'm thirsty. And it brings back memories from years ago, when the root beer provided relief and rehydration.

review/summary: Quenches Popcorn Thirsts on Hot Days, and Continues Carnival Romances
review/text: A&W Root Beer. Cold, with aged vanilla. The taste is familiar, sweet... a flavor we all knew just moments after leaving the womb. The can's metal has changed throughout the years, but its inner truth remains. My mettle, though, to sip from it again quivers.<br /><br />In my hand is a crushed can. Empty, of course, as it has been for three years when it fell half full. I found it almost buried under mud and thistle, barely revealed in the sun.<br /><br />Until yesterday, the can rested aside the bench near where the popcorn stand barkers clamored their chorus. I met Nancy in line just as the county fair was closing for the season. She was traveling, she said, through town on business, and I was just traveling, though this was my hometown. I never learned which town was hers, or what she did, but I knew she loved gardenias. She had never seen one, but was she sure would if she did. I never met anyone with her quiet smile, and stammered in awe that we might sit for a while. We did.<br /><br />The heat of August, and the popcorn's salty butter gave way to root beer. There is no nutrition in A&W Root Beer. Just 170 calories and a bit of sodium. Not much more. I bought us each one, and we talked until the light's turned off. She looked at her watch, and ran, dropping her drink. She never said good-bye.<br /><br />No one has sat there since. Why would they? The fair moved elsewhere, and now, it is just a lot with occasionally mowed weeds. I found it while wandering.<br /><br />I hosed the can off, now flat and wrinkled but fully colored. "Since 1919" it says in brown letters. Three years is long enough. 91 years? I don't know what to do with it. I never did.<br /><br />May your root beer always be cold, and your time be eternal.<br /><br />--Brockeim

This tea is stale and does not taste like any of the Gen Mai Cha I've been drinking for the last decade. You'd expect them to be willing to exchange it, especially as one of the two bags is unopened. But no.<br /><br />BE VERY WARY OF ANY of the Two Leaves and a Bud items that Amazon is selling. MANY OF THE ITEMS say "only 3 left in stock" or similar. I suspect these are the last remains of some old stock.

review/summary: best hot chocolate available...
review/text: I originally ordered the Swiss Miss as I thought that was most common and best tasting product...much to my shagrin, I quickly found out that it had FULLY hydrogenated oil in it...amazing, in this day of age, that Swiss Miss would put this poison (literally) in their product.<br /><br />So, my search continued for a good sugar-free hot chocolate...and I came across Caffe D'Vita.  Never heard of it but liked how they advertised no hydrogenated oils/trans fats of any kind and that it was MADE IN THE USA...<br /><br />For those of us who still love our country, this is great...a USA product that is actually healthy!<br /><br />As far as the taste goes, it's excellent.  You have to work with the amount of teaspoons of cocoa and liquid volume for a bit, but no biggie....oh, always heat the water before you add the mix for it mixes better.<br /><br />I really like this product and recommend it over the 'bad for you' alternatives.

review/text: I have searched everywhere for an effective clay mask. This is not like other powdered clays. Redmond clay "swells" when you mix it in water. Try adding 1/4 clay to 1 cup water. Stir it and let it sit. At first it will be clumpy. But then the clay will absorb all the water and become almost like a gel. Give it a good stir with a wire whisk and store the wet clay in a jar. I use it for any skin problems I have. It can be used as a detox supplement as well. Great natural product!

review/summary: A two-liter bottle of great soda
review/text: I don't really crave any sodas, and drink water more often than I do soda (as I suspect many people do).  However, I will make an exception for Vernor's, which has such a great taste I'm craving it as I write this review!<br /><br />Vernor's is hard to get on the West Coast, at least in California's Central Valley.  I have found six packs in the Bay Area, but only Safeway seems to carry it.  So if you want a 2-liter size, you have to get it on-line.<br /><br />It's not cheap, but as an occasional treat, it's worth it.  Just grin and bear the cost for a taste of the best ginger ale out there, and one of the best over-all sodas available.  It's a Detroit staple, and with the internet, available world-wide.<br /><br />Five stars for Vernor's!

review/summary: Made in Michigan since 1866
review/text: I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is "The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.

review/summary: The Good Stuff
review/text: Yes, it costs a bit more than Uncle Wally's Bargain Dog Food but it lacks the fillers and artificial junk found in many of the cheap foods. Note that the first two ingredients are chicken and chicken meal. In your cheap foods the first ingredient may be corn or wheat with meat by-products somewhere down the list. Another plus is the inclusion of menhaden fish meal - a source of fiber and high quality protein.<br /><br />Our two girls have been thriving on this food for the past year. Their stools have been mostly well formed and solid; their health has been good. I like that the kibble is small enough for the dainty mouths of our shih tzu and our Bolognese. To top it all off, our girls like the taste of this food and mostly eat it with enjoyment except for those fussy days when nothing will catch their fancies.<br /><br />As good as this food may be, I sadly must add that there is no POTATO content here.

review/summary: Fantastic Food!!
review/text: We have 2 dogs.One is a 6 year old (possible) Border Collie Mix, and the other is a newly adopted, 9 month old American Pit Bull Terrier mix. When we adopted the APBT we were informed that they are often allergic to grains and to try and find a grain free food. This was the first brand we found and thankfully it was a hit....not only does our new puppy love it, but our older dog loves it as well. Also a wonderful benefit is ,our older dog had been chewing and scratching at himself, and his fur was becoming discolored in those spots. We had taken him to the vet for this and we all assumed it was an allergy to fleas. We have him on flea meds but still were experiencing the same issues with him. Now, after being on this food for a month and a half he is no longer chewing himself and the red color is dissipating!!<br />I recommend this food highly.

review/summary: If you like indian boiled tea or chai, nothing beats this...
review/text: Well, nothing that comes with an brand name label beats this. There are brands that are better, but not one you'd find easily. These are not ground leaves. They are tiny little leaves allowed to dry and curl up, so expect to see almost mini-peppercorn-like granules. If you're not familiar with leaf teas, the boiling/steeping time is higher, and the outcome is very strong, so if your normal cup of tea involves lukewarm water and Celestial Seasoning, I'd let this be. Note that you should use less, but not steep it a shorter time. The full taste only develops after the leaves open up.<br /><br />I'm from the Indian subcontinent, and once I got this, I introduced it to other folks from around there, and they've all been sold on the taste, aroma, and body. I personally feel that's a pretty good endorsement from that bunch.<br /><br />Also, this is a huge pile of tea, enough to fill a 5lb bag of sugar (though of course much lighter in weight). Tetley also makes the round bags in the purple box that have a very similar quality if you don't drink tea 3 times a day.

review/summary: Great Afternoon Tea
review/text: I've always gone back and forth between a good strong black tea and a very subtle green tea.  Tetley's falls firmly in the black tea area.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, these are little tea nuggets, the description from Amazon initially made me think these were going to be the tiny leaves I expected from a "loose leaf" tea, be forewarned, these won't unfurl into tea leaves in the pot or the bottom of your cup, they'll remain little nuggets, which doesn't detract from the tea, I assure you.<br /><br />This is a great, basic black tea.  At this price it is great, and for the amount you get, you can easily make this an everyday tea, not something you save for "occasions" whether special or routine.  I like it because it is just that, simple and straightforward.  I don't need to think about whether a book is good enough to warrant me brewing up a cup to enjoy with it, I'll make this tea anytime I want a decent cup of tea.<br /><br />I'm not an expert of tea by far, but I do think this one brews a bit strong for the amount.  The 3-5 minute steeping time is great for me, but I enjoy strong, dark coffee and tea, and if you're expecting the color of the cup on the box, aim a little lower in your measuring.<br /><br />On a side note, consider buying a smaller container to get your daily portion and keeping the Tetley box sealed up, it is really a huge amount of tea, a bit unwieldy to get a couple spoons from it daily and the less tea is exposed to air, the better.

I go through quite a lot of tea for my yoga business, both making it to serve and to sell, so I had been looking for a while for a larger size container of loose-cut black tea that still had a straight-forward, plain black tea taste to complement the chai-type spices I use. I was a bit suprised that the tea is of the "rolled leaves" variety of loose tea, that is, it looks like little nuggets rather than sifted and cut leaves. I've quite grown to appreciate this though, because it makes for easier pouring into my tea strainer and even easier clean-up. I'd love to find an organic version of this, though overall, great find and a good price, too.

review/text: Makes excellent iced tea. I like to compost and hated having all those non-degradable tea bags. I use a 2.5 inch tea ball, less packaging, and feel better about my carbon footprint. We drink at least 1 gallon of tea per day and this box lasts for at least a month. Makes a nice orange colored tea with smooth taste.

review/summary: Tetley Gunpowder like tea
review/text: I like my tea very strong, which requires using a lot of tea when brewing.  Tetley is a very reasonably priced, good tasting blend.  I typically use 5-6 tsp per 14oz of boiling water brewed for 4-5 minutes.  Brewing longer makes a stronger tea, but introduces some unpleasant tastes.  My favorite is inexpensive Kroger brand loose tea in a 12oz tin, which I can no longer find.  Tetley stands up nicely compared to the more expensive Twinnings blends and I prefer Tetley's taste.

review/summary: Takes me right back to England
review/text: Wherever I travel in Britain, there is one common denominator.  No, it's not the language.  Sometimes I understand the English that is spoken and sometimes I don't.  I do, however, always understand the tea.  It's reliably British.  Stout, flavorful and begging for a little milk and sugar.  Like the language, it comes in many subtle varieties, but unlike the language, I'm always sure it's English.  The Scottish and Irish might argue with that, but no matter where you travel in Great Britain the tea is the common denominator.  Which brings us to this particular tea.  Tetley is reliably authentic, right down to the packaging.  You'll know it as soon as it begins brewing.  Unlike our most popular American brand of tea which almost stings the olfactory senses, Tetley will both bolster and soothe.  A scoop of Tetley tea also contains quite a bit more tea than traditional Chinese or American teas.  Tetley forms the leaves in to little pellets, so there isn't much air between the leafs.  That makes the tea brew stronger and if that's too strong for your taste, you can easily use fewer scoops and get the same strength brew as you would from traditional bulk tea.  I'm sure that my method of tea brewing would offend British tea purists, but we've been having tea "issues" since the 1773 Boston Tea Party.  Instead of the traditional British brewing method,  I use a regular coffee maker (that is never used for making coffee) to brew my Tetley tea.  I get about 4 or 5 standard cups of strongly brewed tea from 3 scoops of Tetley.  At that rate, this 31.75 oz. box lasts for months making it an excellent bargain, despite the weak dollar.  When you serve this to your friends, invite them to try it with a little milk.  Let them experience one of the really nice things that our cousins across the Atlantic have to share.  Now that Amazon carries this product, I can relive those cool, misty British mornings without ever leaving the desert.  Now that you've taken a trip to the "Amazon" you might as well extend it to another continent!

review/text: These are the best. I have gotten everyone I know to try these and they're all hooked, adults and children alike. I found these a couple years ago at Trader Joe's when I was looking for a healthy snack for my toddler and we all just loved them. Luckily, our local supermarket started stocking these so we always have them in stock at home. I bought these at Amazon with the subscribe and save option and got them a good bit cheaper than I can anywhere else. These are a great way to sneak veggies into your child's diet. The best way I can describe them is that they are similar in texture to cheese puffs, and even though they are only salted they have lots of flavor.

review/text: We were familiar with the Snapea Crisps from a local retailer and were happy to find the product on Amazon.  We selected the automatic reorder service which gives free shipping and a discount on the product.  The Snapea Crisps have come twice so far and were fresh on both occasions and at a lower cost than the local supplier.  The automatic reorder feature is great.  I receive an email a few days before the shipment detailing the order information and the total cost.  This gives me plenty of time to decline the order if I so chose.  The email includes handy links to cancel the shipment or to edit the auto-order options.  I couldn't be more pleased with the product or the process.  I would recommend to others.

review/text: I try to generally follow a low-carb lifestyle and eat as much whole food as I can but every so often I crave something that just seems bad for you. I could easily grab a small bag of chips at the neighborhood bodega but there is a store only two miles away that sells these tasty treats which satisfy my cravings without leaving me feeling like I've totally blown my diet. At 12 net grams of carbohydrates per serving (and there are 3+ servings in the bag) they're certainly not low-carb, but they also don't have a lot of the additives or MSG that many chips have. Honestly, I would have given them 5 stars had they not used GMO corn oil because I really like them.

review/summary: Shouldn't be a veggie substitute
review/text: I have two kids, a 3 year old and a 5 year old. My 3 yr old was crazy about them (she loves veggies and she loves chips so it was the perfect combination for her. She excitedly called them "green frenchfries!"). My 5 yr old hates peas and disliked the pungent whiff you get when you first open the bag. She was not crazy about the color. It took her a couple of tries before they grew on her (seeing her sister devour them encouraged her to give them another chance).<br /><br />These are a bit oily even though they are baked. They have a great crunch and are not too salty (but we love salt!) I think they look cool and taste good. They can be addicting! I like dippingthem in hummus.<br /><br />I don't think they are a healthy substitute for vegeatables (fat content) but a good way to introduce veggies into a veggie-hater's diet. They are in our snack cabinet and make a nice addition to a lunchbox every now and then but I don't offer them everyday.

review/text: I gave them a 4 rating for being yummy, crispy and different.  I won't buy again because they were way too greasy and salty.  I thought I read it wrong when I glanced at the nutritional value while holding the bag with intensely greasy fingers after eating them.  Not fried?  All that grease doesn't make sense.  Anyway, was fun to try.

review/summary: My new addiction
review/text: I picked up a bag of these Snapea Crisps on a whim at the grocery store... that was it, I am totally hooked on them. I kept going back to the grocery store and they ran out so I ordered them on line. Healthy is happy and happy to me is a bag of snapea crisps. On a salad, as a snack, floating on top of soup, no matter where you put them, they will be gone in a flash and you will have had a healthy snack. Oh so tastey.

review/summary: So Very Yummy, Like Baked Sugar Peas!
review/text: These are lightweight, super-crisp, taste "green" like peas, and have that satisfying "crunch" factor. When my 12-pack box arrived this morning, I ate half a bag! I like it that they have protein content. They're so delicious I know I'll be finishing off those 11 other bags in no time, and I know these will make the BEST salad croutons, just like they say.

review/summary: tasty way to eat veggies
review/text: These are a easy way to eat your veggies.  Not as healthy as raw veggies, of course, but they're a good "middle ground" for getting kids (and adults) to add more vegetables to their diets.<br /><br />If you like chips, you'll like these.  They are surprisingly tasty!

review/summary: Crunchy Good
review/text: I think these are very good. They are not overly salty, and the taste is mild. The best part is they are not unhealthy and they crunch so nicely. This is my latest "favorite snack". Just a little on the pricey side, but cheaper on Amazon than in the stores. Good snack for any age.

review/summary: The Food-Nut's Cheetos
review/text: They remind me a of a fat Cheeto. Although tasting like peas, they've got the addictive saltiness people crave when they reach for a chip.

review/summary: Healthy Snack
review/text: I love these as a snack. I've only had them in Salad once but use them more as a chip. They are made with brown rice so they are much healthier than chips. And very tasty. Great for kids!

review/summary: These are excellent in many ways!
review/text: My husband and I both love this product!  Not only are they baked, not fried, but they taste a little like potato chips.  I've never liked peas and these taste nothing like peas.  Everyone I have had try these really likes them.  I would feel much better giving these to a child versus potato chips.  They even contain fiber!

review/summary: Thomas Jefferson knew best!
review/text: Peas were good old Thomas Jefferson's favorite veggie! Once you try Calbee Snack Salad Snapea Crisps, you'll love them, too -- and be able to stash them in your purse or desk for a snack any time you want to indulge.<br /><br />Nutritionally, these are great, especially compared to the other junk you might find yourself reaching for. Sprinkled as a topping on salads, they add tremendous flavor and crunch.<br /><br />I'm sure Mr. Jefferson would also be thrilled by the free shipping!

review/summary: Healthy Snack
review/text: This product I would recommend to anyone who likes peas; it is different and delicious; the taste is great and if you can't get your children to eat peas they will definitely enjoy these.It also great to use in salads instead of croutons because they are healthier for everyone.

review/text: I LOVED these delicious little crunchy treats until I checked the sodium content!<br />I still loved snacking on them BUT I can't for my health's sake.  I gave most of the little delicious treats away away to friends without the sodium caution I have to watch.<br /><br />Oh my....they are good!

review/summary: Great snack!
review/text: We found this product while on vacation in South Carolina. Once we got home, we found it wasn't available in our town so, I went to Amazon.com and sure enough, there it was! It's a wonderful snack that 'grows on you' the more you eat. We were so pleased that once we ordered it, it arrived within 48 hours! Great service and cheaper than making a 45 mile drive, one way, to get it.

review/summary: Great Scack!
review/text: I love these crisps!  They taste good and they are hard to put down once you  start eating them.  What is great they are a good snack that you do not have to worry about the fat, as they are baked! I am on a special diet and they are allowed!
