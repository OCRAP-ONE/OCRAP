review/summary: The Closest Thing to The Real Movie Theatre Popcorn
review/text: I love movie theatre popcorn and if you read posts on how it's made, the secret is using coconut oil and flavoring salt. What you have here is all the contents needed in one simple package.  I have tried other brands that have the same three key ingredients, but this brand is BY FAR, the closest thing to movie theatre popcorn as you'll get. This is it!!! If you want the same taste as the theatres, look no further.  Great Northern is the brand!!!!

review/summary: Best Popcorn Yet
review/text: My husband and I had been using a different type of popcorn for our popper, but in looking into purchasing it the last time, it was quite expensive so we started looking around for something new.  In our search we came across this popcorn and thought we should give it a try.  We got the same amount of popcorn for half the price, which was huge bonus for us.  Once we received it, we had to try it right away and we were thoroughly impressed with it.  It is even better than the previous brand.  Fabulous product!

review/text: I got this to pop in my Whirly Pop stovetop popper, and it works great. This is comparable to the packages sold by the Whirly Pop manufacturer, but much less expensive. A great buy for popcorn lovers. My only complaint is that the packaging is a little awkward in that you pretty much need to cut the popcorn, salt, and oil open and pour them into the popper separately to avoid spilling them all over the place-- but this style packaging seems to be very common from brand to brand.

review/summary: Quality product, packaging is a dud though.
review/text: I bought a case of 8 ounce packs of Great Northern Popcorn. The popcorn is great and the convenience of having pre-measured packs is very handy, it lowers the risks of contaminated product and guarantees freshness. However, something is wrong with the case I received. I just went through my remaining stock and threw away another 5 packs that were leaking oil. I then washed the oil mess off of what was left and tossed one more that wasn't sealed on the popcorn. This is after I tossed 7 away a month after buying the case. I had started organizing my pantry and noticed oil everywhere, the source being the corner of box of popcorn. Not a fun clean-up job. I had forgotten about it until today, when I had noticed oil all over again.<br /><br />The bottom edge of the packaging seems to weaken and develop points that "crack" open.<br /><br />So out of my case of 24, I've thrown away 12 and used 3, that's ridiculous in my opinion. It just might be cheaper to buy it elsewhere and avoid the waste.

review/summary: Yellow flavorful yummy missing from your popcorn?  Order this!
review/text: When you go to the movie theater, the popcorn comes coated yellowish and golden.  You love the taste so much that you pick out the yellowist most flavorful kernels and eat them first. You've made popcorn at home, both on-the-stove and the microwave type, and it is missing "something".  This popcorn isn't missing anything.  From the tropical based oils to the carefully measured popcorn salt, this has it all.  It tastes exactly like the popcorn you get at the theater.  I've read a few complaints here that this popcorn is too salty.  I don't agree.  In fact when I make it, I add the full amount of oil and salt but withhold about 1/4 of the kernels to amplify the salty greasiness.  When I pop this corn the entire house fills up with that awesome "movie theater" popcorn smell but without that nasty microwave undertone.  The price was great, the product rocks, the shipping (even to Alaska!) was free, I can't really think of any constructive criticism for this product.  I don't  have a popcorn kettle, and the instructions on each package shows how to pop this rockstar either on the stove, with an air popper, in a kettle, etc.  So long as the free shipping applies, I will be ordering this product again and again and again.

review/text: Our guests love this popcorn!  The premeasured portions make it so easy to use, and while it's not perfectly easy to add the ingredients, for us it's more about the location of the kettle in our theatre style machine than the packaging.<br /><br />Easy enough for my kids to make (teens, as I would worry about younger kids getting burnt on the kettle).<br /><br />For those who think it's too salty, that is easy enough to remedy, don't use all the salt!  Salty is a matter of taste, and some people might think the saltiness is just right with the amount they put in each package.  So, isn't the amount of salt they provide just right?  If they used less, there would be people complaining that there isn't enough salt.<br /><br />We think it's great!!

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I usually make my popcorn on the stove but when I got a popcorn machine I quickly noticed you can't use the same methods and decided to buy these packets.  The popcorn doesn't come out the same as when I make it on the stove but it is good nonetheless (a diff type of good) plus much less hassle.  I was worried when I read other reviews about the "stale" taste and oil...I didn't have any of that.  When the box came some of the oil was liquid and other packets were solid, it worried me but I found out that the oil had just hardened (it happens according to the temp of my house) which is quickly fixed when you pour the stuff into your hot popcorn maker.  No complaints here!

review/text: Ever since we bought our popcorn machine two years ago we've used this popcorn. Originally we had thought we'd get our own oil and save money rather than use the pre-portioned packs. However we tried it once and could never go back. It's just so easy and delicious that it's worth any extra expense. We went on the auto-ship program to save some money. I highly recommend this popcorn. It's actually ruined us on movie theater popcorn since we actually prefer this.

Put this corn in a souvenir bucket from one of our big amusement parks in Orlando and you can't tell the difference. Everybody that's tasted it is very impressed.<br /><br />I have a whirly-pop popper, the larger size that should use the 5.5oz packs that come with the popper. While these 6oz packs work fine in the popper, the corn nearly bursts from the popper. Next time I'll get the 4oz packs.<br /><br />Perfect texture, fluffiness, color, and flavor. I love it!

review/summary: Excellent, but...
review/text: Just got a popper and bought some of this as well as some West Bend popcorn (which I tried with the Lou-Ana popcorn oil bars). I very much prefer these. More of the kernels popped, they were far fluffier, and the popcorn simply tasted better (this is after salting the West Bend with Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt). The packs make it very simple. Cut the top, dump in the kettle, hit the heater, wait for the sound of the sizzle, and go! My only concern is that you have to take a bit of care not to drop oil all over the place. If you cut the top off, then carefully 'roll' the pack, it makes it much easier to drop it all in, then squeeze the oil out.

review/text: I have a Waring Pro, and this stuff is fantastic. It is salty and buttery, and tastes like movie theater popcorn. Some complain it doesn't all pop, that's because some of the kernals are thrown out of the kettle while the others pop. It always fills the tray that comes with my popper all the way up. I love it.

review/text: I have purchased the Popcorn popper (that looks like those at the theatre but a little smaller) and the Great Northern Popcorn 8-ounce portion packs. This is a great deal. The popcorn taste great, everyone in our center loves it. The people in charge of popping love the all in one so they don't have to measure anything. We also order the popcorn sacks. The works great for our center when we have fun days. We purchased our order from Discount Tommy's the price for the popcorn and popcorn popper was great. We got a good deal. It arrived fast and we got to popping right away.

review/summary: Not bad for what you pay
review/text: I like to first state that I used this product in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R">West Bend 82306X Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a>, not a traditional kettle popcorn maker like you see at the theater.  The other reviews all state that the popcorn once popped is really salty. I did not have this experience and quite on the contrary found it to be not salty at all.  This might be due to the difference in popping machines.  In the stir crazy when I poured the popcorn/salt side into the machine the salt all fell into a pile.  The stirring arm on the machine probably wasn't able to move the salt around like in a kettle type machine.  I also feel that the package does not include enough of the oil to make the popcorn really flavorful.  There was plenty to pop and flavor it but I think I just prefer more oil in my popcorn.  Lastly, the kernels while tasting pretty good did not pop as big as Orville Reddenbacher.  They weren't as fluffy and were more dense as well.  On the plus size they did not have a lot of husks to get stuck in your teeth like the "Gold Medal" brand I've tried recently.  Overall a pretty good product to use in the Stir Crazy.  When I get a kettle type machine in the near future I will definitely be trying these packs again to see if there is a difference in the taste based on the type of machine.

review/summary: Perfect Popcorn and Allows Adjustable Salt Content
review/text: These packs guarantee that each batch you pop is fresh (obviosuly much fresher than even theater popcorn), and of course it tastes great!  This is a perfect pack for 8oz poppers, everything is pre-measured.  My wife really likes that fact that the the corn, oil and salt are all partitioned separately on these packs.  That way we can control exactly how much salt goes into the batch for popping.  Reducing the amount of salt by half still gives us great tasting popcorn.  I can vary the amount of salt in each batch based upon the preference of the people that will be eating the popcorn.  Everyone is happy this way.  Try doing that at a theater concession stand!

review/summary: Great Tasting popcorn!  Sooo much better than microwave stuff!
review/text: It seems all of our friends and family are so used to microwave popcorn, that when we pop this, they start to ask lots of questions.  One of my friends "had" to go out and buy a larger machine than mine!  (It seems he always has to 1-up me)  In any case, this is the closest stuff to movie theater popcorn you can get, however I like it a bit better than the movie theater popcorn served here.  The packs are perfect for the size of machine we have, I just wish I had a larger machine...  I have no complaints about this product.  I have a couple about my machine, but we will leave that to another review!

review/summary: Yes, this is the stuff you're looking for.
review/text: These little packets have everything you need to make commercial-quality popcorn.  Two pouches in each packet:  one with popcorn and flavored salt (flavacol, or something just like it), and one with that bright orange oil (solid at room temperature).  The yellow color, the flavor and the salt all find their way into the popcorn.  If you like the "butter" stuff they squirt on at the theater, that's a separate purchase.  You might want to consult your doctor.<br /><br />The 2.5 oz. packets are made for the baby-sized commercial-style machines, and they produce a smallish batch, about enough for one person.  I got one of these for Christmas, and now I wish I got a bigger model, at least a 4-oz. popper.  The little tub loses too many kernels during popping.  Plus, the small size makes it tough to clean and load the tub.  Anyway, the popcorn is great.  If you are an occasional popcorn eater, these packets are incredibly handy.  If you make a few batches a week, though, you might want to invest in a big tub of the oil and a box of flavacol, which should save money in the long run.

If you have a home theater, get a popcorn maker (i have the paramount 8oz - works perfect), then get this popcorn.  I will be ordering again.  I accidentally bought the 4oz instead of 8oz, but i just use two packets.  8oz is a better deal it seems for about $7 more.

It was well worth the wait.  The first batch tasted just like movie popcorn!  The texture, color, saltiness and flavor were just what I was hoping for.

review/text: I use this in my 6 quart Whirley pop maker.  The popcorn maker over flows with delicious popcorn every time.  Hardly any old maids!  I am a true convert now - I will only use these premeasured packets.

review/summary: Popcorn
review/text: We have a 4 oz stand up electric popcorn popper and find 4 oz bags a little hard to come by. This popcorn, salt and oil is 6 ozs and work perfectly in out 4 oz popper. About 80 to 90% of the grains pop and that is our only complaint. We have tested the kettle at very hot and at start up tempatures and there is still at least 10% of the grains unpopped. What are we doing wrong?

review/summary: Very good popcorn
review/text: My family loves popcorn; the portioned packages work well.  the only suggestion that I would have is to cut the popcorn and seasoning part out first, place them in a measuring cup.  this will make it easier to pour in the pan for popping.  I spilled a significant amount of the seasoning and popcorn at first; and the fact that it's stored in plastic makes it not such a wise decision to place the plastic next to the hot pan.  of course put the butter in first, then add the popcorn and seasoning; less mess.<br /><br />just about every kernel pops.  very tasty!!!

review/summary: Super yummy!
review/text: We have a floor standing popcorn machine and tried a few different products before getting this one.  We stopped looking when we got this!  It's the bomb!  We love it and buy it by the case.  It's the real deal, and I highly recommend it.  We top it with 'popping and topping' for more butter flavor, but many of our guests like it just as is.  Just a heads up, the 'oil' portion is somewhat solid when it comes, not watery.

review/text: I received a popcorn machine for my birthday and I have not been able to find the right combination to make popcorn that tastes like you get at the movies.  The local convienence store always has great popcorn and I happened to notice they use this.  I just went through a case in less than a month! It is good stuff!  The 8 oz size is a bit much for my family of four, so I will go with the 6 oz this time.  I ordered two cases this time!

review/text: I ordered this to use with my Whirley Pop and I absolutely love it.<br /><br />This pouch has a bit more stuff in it than the standard single serve pouch from Wabash Farms (8oz vs 5.5oz) so I expected some unpopped kernels and indeed ended up with a few dozen.<br /><br />I have only popped one pouch so far so I plan to leave it on a few more seconds next time around, but even with the remaining kernels, the Whirley Pop was totally stuffed with popcorn.<br /><br />The popcorn is delicious and tastes exactly like super fresh movie theater popcorn. The salt in the pouch gave the popcorn the perfect amount of saltiness for my tastes, but it may be a bit salty for some.<br /><br />I'll probably stick with the 6oz version even when I reorder, as it's only a $2 difference (as of 08/13/09).

review/summary: Captures that movie theater taste, but far from perfect
review/text: I purchased this product for use with my new Maxi-Matic popcorn machine, with the goal of producing that movie-theater taste that none of my previous popping efforts had replicated. These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot-on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another brand's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.<br /><br />Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn.

review/text: It's hard to order anything on the internet and be confident enough that you got a good product, let alone a great food product. Initially, I ordered this popcorn because of it's great price and relevance to what I needed, and ended up really enjoying it for the taste! The butter's consistency is hard when I received it in the mail, though it melts right up in the popper and YUM! We had great popcorn.....

review/summary: Who needs to go to the movies?
review/text: This popcorn is da bomb!  Very yummy, even when cold and over 24 hours old.  (I know kind of gross)  I bought the 2.5 ounce so I could pop smaller portions in my 4 ounce popcorn machine.  Works like a champ.  The oil is coconut oil, same oil they use in theaters nationwide.  It is a solid and is a little difficult to get out and into the kettle while you try not to spill your corn and salt mixture.  I let the kettle heat up for about 3-5 minutes, then empty the oil in the kettle.  Immediate afterwords I pour in the popcorn salt mixture and less than 4 minutes BAM you are at the movies for about 1/56 of the price.  Healthy economical snack for the whole family.  We LOVE our Great Northern popper and popcorn from Discount Tommy!!!

review/summary: Awesome popcorn
review/text: I have a small theater style popcorn maker in my home-theater room. This popcorn is well measured and tastes great. All that being said, I am guessing it is not very healthy. We do not live on this product. What could taste so good and be healthy anyway. My only complaint is that the popping is so rigorous that I do get quite a few unpopped kernals that fly from the kettle. But with the old-maid holes in the floor, its a small price to pay for such a great product.

review/text: The 2.5 oz. size bags of Great Northern Popcorn comes with oil on one side of bag and the popcorn and salt on the other side. This way you can add the oil to the popper and warm it up ( usually takes around 3 minutes.) Add the popcorn and salt and in just a few minutes you are ready to enjoy. Now I did found some old maids, but i had tried other popcorns and also found it true with these too. This has a good taste and just the right amount of salt. I feel that this is a good buy for the money. This work good with the use of the 2.5 oz table top retro style popcorn popper.

review/summary: Theater Style Popcorn at Home
review/text: This makes Carnival/Theater style popcorn and the taste and smell makes you feel you are at the Movies. I too like it because it is easy to use. All the Ingredients are there in a small package...popcorn, salt, butter, oil. I use it with a Popcorn Machine that my daughter got for Christmas. She can easily make great popcorn for her friends, parties,etc without having to measure the amount of oil,salt,popcorn. If you own a Popcorn Maker I would strongly suggest this product. No need of having to find the right popcorn oil, popcorn butter or popcorn salt because it is mixed together in the package along with the popcorn. Amazon sells this cheap as well. Only $0.71 for each package.

review/text: The great Northern popcorn popper we use these in seems to be used almost daily, since we have 8 and 10 year old girls, and their friends, who are always wanting a snack (specially after school). Although we also use the separate corn and oil also, the packs are just as good tasting, and sometimes a little handier when in a hurry, or out of the separate ingredients. The popcorn is very good either way.

I found this on Amazon less than 2 weeks before Christmas and had it wrapped and ready to go in plenty of time. This popcorn tastes wonderful. Friends and family love it and I will keep on ordering this as long as my popcorn maker keeps popping. This package makes just enough for two kids at snack time and two paks for the adults also.
