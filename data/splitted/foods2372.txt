review/summary: Starbucks Via - Just like a cup of fresh Starbucks!
review/text: My husband and I have been coffee drinkers for many years.  We have bought and brewed just about all of the best coffees out there, including Starbucks whole beans.  We tried instant coffee, the usual brands to see if we could tolerate it, instead of waiting and watching the percolator, so it would'nt boil over on the stove.  The usual brands were tolerable.  That was until we tried the real deal...Starbucks Via Ready Brew Coffee.  I'd say that it is just about the best cup of coffee from Starbucks ever!

review/summary: the best instant out there for me
review/text: I have to admit I'm a coffee snob, owning a semi-comm espresso machine at home and am heavily into all that coffee voodoo stuff.  Although I think Starbucks coffee is just so-so unless buried beneath lots of caramel and other stuff, I really like these VIA instants for some reason.  Maybe it has more a french press taste and experience than other instants that draws me to them, I don't know.  I do know that I will take these quick and easy to use instant packs over the cafeteria coffee any day.  Before folks get all on me about my contradictions, it's a personal taste thing.  I love apples, too, and eat tons of them, but hate applesauce.  The same goes with these things...I hate liking them, but I do.

review/summary: Less than 50 cents a cup
review/text: I bought this coffee pack for my parents because they can only drink decaf. This is perfect for them, especially when on the go. The price was the most appealing part because it comes down to about less than 50 cents a cup, where if you go to a Starbucks a cup of coffee is more than double. I recommend this item if you have no preference over freshly brewed and instant coffee.

review/summary: Great Instant Coffee
review/text: As usual, Starbucks does a great job with coffee. One pack of the Italian roast can still make a pretty good 16oz cup of coffee. It's better as 8oz - 12oz but you can get away with 16oz. I tried the Taster's Choice and regretted it. The Taster's Choice is half the price but you need at least 3 TC's packs to equal 1 VIA and it's still not that good. Spend the extra couple of dollars on Starbucks. You know it's worth it.

review/summary: Starbucks in West Africa.
review/text: I live in West Africa, where there are currently no Starbucks stores and our grocery stores do not sell Starbucks coffee. It will probably be a least 50 years, and I don't plan on being here in 50 years. So, when I took that first delicious sip of Starbucks Instant Italian Roast Coffee...it hit the Starbucks-craving spot. The flavor is so much better than any other instant coffee I've ever tasted. Here's the thing--it's still instant coffee. But, it actually tastes almost exactly like regular brewed coffee. It's an expensive cup of heaven...I'll be saving mine for special occasions. Because, in West Africa, you have to savor the luxurious moments in-between mosquito attacks and power cuts.

review/summary: This stuff is amazing
review/text: I love this coffee.  It is so quick and easy to whip up a cup and it tastes great.  I use it at work, home, camping, road trips, etc.  Pick up a small electric kettle and you can have it just about anywhere on trips as long as you have access to water and electricity.  I have used it on cruise ships when the coffee is terrible or at conferences for the same reason.  They usually have hot water for tea, so I just use one of these.<br /><br />One note of caution though, it is smooth but don't drink it too fast or else you will be seeing through walls.  Then again, sometimes seeing through walls could be kind of fun.  What I mean is that to me, it has more of a kick to it than regular coffee.

review/text: I like my coffee strong and rich, and can't stand the typical watery cup of coffee served in cheap restaurants, and I can never get consistent brews when I make it myself. Most instant coffees are disgusting. The Italian Roast is a great alternative. It really caters for people like me, who like it stronger than average. I wish the cost would go down a little so I could make it a daily beverage.<br /><br />I also drink the decaf version, which is just as good.

review/summary: SHAME ON AMAZON
review/text: Shame on Amazon for enhancing their financial facts (list price $50) on this product. First, Starbucks list this item for $35.95 so there is no $21.05 savings. Next, add in the shipping cost and your saving is further erroded. The bottomline is that Amazon is not rewarding you with a 42% saving....With that said, I love brewed coffee and drink my coffee black. For an instant coffee VIA brand is probably one of the best on the market. The Italian Roast is labeled "extra bold" by Starbucks and indeed it is. This is not a very smooth coffee and has a robust taste. If you like a medium taste (ex. Colombia) you might want to give thought before buying the Italian Roast. Even though the Columbian is medium this coffee still has a rich flavor. An if you prefer a strong coffee (as I do) this is not the one. Last thing for those who drink brewed coffee (and especially black coffee) every morning. The VIA is NOT a substitute brand for your every morning coffee. This is fine as an emergency when freshly brewed coffee is not possible. Oh yes, I have purchased the VIA direct from Starbucks and the grocery store, the "use by" stamp on the coffee has been from four to eight months (grocery store). So, the shelf life the buyer sees depends on how long its been on the shelf of the seller and when you make the purchase. Would I purchase this product? Yes, but I would compare prices (at the grocery store-no shipping cost, Starbucks, etc.) before I purchase from Amazon.

review/summary: Favorite Afternoon Instant Coffee
review/text: I have ordered Starbucks VIA Decaf several times and am always pleased.  Being a chocoholic, I combine it with a "low"-calorie instant cocoa to make myself a mocha.  (So I order decaf to "offset" the extra caffeine from the cocoa &lt;grin>.)<br /><br />While the product on the first shipment had an early (as in about 4-5 months) expiration date, that has not since been the case.  (The early expiration date didn't matter at the time since I went through the product within a couple of months.)  In fact, I have 8-9 months before the expiration date on the latest shipment, which is good because I stocked up on the caffeinated version when it went on "sale" at Costco before the holidays.<br /><br />An unexpected bonus in this latest shipment was a sample of Blonde Veranda Blend.  Cool!  (I don't have an automatic drip coffee maker so I need to dig out my Keurig filter basket to try the coffee.  But I'm looking forward to it.)

review/summary: This coffee has saved me more than once
review/text: Recently at work, we've been looking to cut costs and save money, and so the first thing to go was decent coffee.  The swill that they're serving now is an abomination to coffee, so I finally went out and bought a pack of these 50 Starbucks Via Italian Roast instant coffee.  Starbucks Via is pretty good, I mean, it's really good for instant coffee.  I am fortunate at work we have a hot-water maker thing that works well and gives you piping hot water, which dissolves this coffee dust in a matter of seconds... barely requiring a stir.<br /><br />THe coffee is strong and tastes similar to the Starbucks Italian Roast you might get from the store;  not the same, not as robust, not as "burnt" (something that I personally prefer), but still pretty damn good for instant coffee.<br /><br />Having irregular sleep patterns, this coffee has spared me the embarrassment of falling asleep in countless meetings.  It works, it tastes good, it holds cream well.  Only drawback is it leaves this muddy residue on the bottom of your cup.  But, that ain't all that bad.  It's not Sanka.

I've used a half-packet for a small cup. It's very rich and flavorful, there is not another instant like this.  My husband drinks strictly decaf, and it's usually a Starbucks Via Italian Roast.  During our recent relocation, living in a furnished apartment with an inferior coffee maker, we both used VIA for the duration.  The Amazon price is lowest I've found, but I'd pay full-price if necessary, it's worth it.

review/text: I was worried after reading some of the reviews saying the exp. date on this coffee was bad, but I ordered anyway because it's such a fantastic deal. When I got mine it says it doesn't expire for another year! I mean make sure when you order it's from Starbucks and I'd say your good. It's such a great buy and comes in a very nice pop open box thing that makes it simple to grab a ready brew in the mornings and pop it open and pour it into my hot water. I own a Keurig so I just make it brew hot water and then I use these, it's so much cheaper than k-cups and the taste is the same great Starbucks taste I get at their stores! The colombia blend is my favorite blend at Starbucks, it offers a nice bold flavor but it's not too strong and the finish is just fantastic, I recommend Baileys Caramel Creamer to add to your cup of coffee of Colombia, you will have to buy the creamer at your local grocery store though since it needs to be refrigerated. I can't say enough about how great of a buy this is, the only thing I would change is making it a Amazon Prime item, I am a Prime member and love the free 2 day shipping, but had to pay shipping on this since it wasn't prime, other than that, this is my new favorite must have here on Amazon!

review/text: These are are crunchy, delectable cookies that come in a variety of flavors, of which, I find The Original & Gingerspice tastier than others - 5 stars. What I find very puzzling is that Amazon has different flavors under Amazon Prime at different times: last week it was The Original and now it is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZM7H0">Almondina Almond Cookies, Choconut, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FJCXX6">Almondina Almonduo with Pistachio Biscuits, 4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>. Almondina also makes an assorted 8 cookie flavor giftbox but for some reason Amazon does not carry it, as of March 2010. If your favorite flavor is not under Amazon Prime, keep checking, next week it may be!<br /><br />Each cookie has 35 calories and the package lists the serving size as 4 cookies. For me, usually 2 cookies are filling enough and satisfy my hunger. Cookies have roasted almonds, pitachios and resins. Each cookie has 5.5 gm carbohydrate approximately half of which is sugar, but the company claims it to be "All Natural". I guess they consider sugar to be natural!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40">Biscoff Family Pack</a> are also delicious cookies, with 25 calorie per cookie and roughly the same amount of carbohydrates and sugar per cookie as Almondina, but they are't as filling and you end up consuming more calories. May be it is not possible to make delicious cookies with any less sugar. To give you perspective and comparison, Oreo Cookies have double the sugar and carbohydrate and each serving has 160 calories; and they are not filling so you end up consuming a lot more than one serving at a time. I have't found any other delicious cookies with as low carbohydrate content as Almondina. For me, they make a very healthy snack that satiates my hunger and craving for food.

Each cookie has 5.5 gm carbohydrate approximately half of which is sugar, but the company claims it to be "All Natural". I guess they consider sugar to be natural!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40">Biscoff Family Pack</a> are also delicious cookies, with 25 calorie per cookie and roughly the same amount of carbohydrates and sugar per cookie as Almondina, but they are't as filling and you end up consuming more calories. May be it is not possible to make delicious cookies with any less sugar. To give you perspective and comparison, Oreo Cookies have double the sugar and carbohydrate and each serving has 160 calories; and they are not filling so you end up consuming a lot more than one serving at a time. I have't found any other delicious cookies with as low carbohydrate content as Almondina. For me, they make a very healthy snack that satiates my hunger and craving for food.

review/summary: Great cookie ...when fresh
review/text: I love these cookies!!<br /><br />But when I received my 6 pack from Amazon, they were slightly off in crispness and flavor.  They still had 4 months before they expired, WTH!<br /><br />I wrote a letter to Almondina suggesting the re-evaluate their freshness calculation.  They responded that they do not sell to Amazon, so they could not comment on any product handling that may have impacted their product's flavor, crispness or freshness.  They offered to replace my cookies.  Which I thought was excellent customer service.  I will buy my Almondinas directly from their website in the future.

review/summary: Not recommended
review/text: To start with, these bags do NOT contain 70 treat packs.  They contain 65 treat packs.  I checked more than one bag, and the shortage seems to be consistent.  The packs themselves are skimpy.  Some only contained 4 or 5 pieces of candy corn.  Packs available from other sources are much more generous in their content.  So, if you are satisfied with a short count of skimpy treats, I suppose you might buy these, but I like a little more for my money.<br /><br />Note: Since posting this earlier review, the company seems to have corrected the shortage problem (I counted the contents of a bag purchased this year).  The individual packetts are still on the skimpy size.  There were some extra packetts, so if you discard the ones with only three or four pieces of candy corn, you might end up with 70 that each have about 7 pieces of candy corn.  That compares with a different source that has packetts with about 14 pieces of candy corn (at a somewhat higher price).

review/text: I cook a lot of pasta, but don't have the time or patience to make my own. This is the finest dried pasta I have ever cooked. My guests always agree. It has a chewiness and ability to hold sauce that is outstanding. Rarely sticks (only if you totally ignore it in the pot.) Worth the effort--far above the best usual store brands.

review/summary: This is wonderful stuff!
review/text: I had no clue until a previous reviewer called this stuff the "world's greatest pasta". Curious, I tried 3 bags ... the reviewer was spot on to my culinary delight. Martelli pasta is made outside of Pisa. I don't know what they are doing differently at Martelli, but the al dente snap and texture is special.<br /><br />Cooks spend most of our spaghetti making time on our sauce. I paid little attention to the pasta ... dried, store bought fresh and even home made ... i.e. pasta, it seemed, is pasta, Costco is as good as anyplace for the basic stuff.<br /><br />So I spend say $10-15 on a good homemade sauce... then I pour it over $1 of pasta. No more. As pasta has become less dietary friendly, one must, none the less, periodically get back to the stuff. If you must have pasta to maintain your life force, but have cut it back because of the carbs, don't eat anymore with $1 pasta ... splurge for a more complete experience. It may look expensive, and it is by comparison and your mate may suggest that you're out of your mind to pay $8 versus the $1. I'm convinced (as is my suprised wife) that this may be as good as a pasta gets and surely enriches the reduced pasta eating events.

review/summary: doubtlessly the best pasta available, but unfortunately no longer affordable
review/text: I know this pasta brand for many years, back in Germany I used to pay around 6 DM for 1 kg. That would be 3$ for 2.2 pounds for Americans.<br />And I thought that was pretty expensive! But I bought it regularly and really loved it.<br /><br />Then 5 years ago I came to the USA, and among so many other things I missed the foods from home. How happy was I to find out Martelli was sold over here, too!<br /><br />Of course, it was very expensive, even more expensive than in Germany. 5,50$ for a bag (and at the time I did not understand USA-measurements, was not aware they sell only half the size over here!). So I thought the 2.2 pound bag would be expensive with 5,50 $, and for 3 years I could not afford to mail order it. You have to pay 15 $ postage for any order, so I figured any order below 150 $ would not be reasonable with that postage fee.<br /><br />Last year, after the winter holiday, I got some money and finally did it: I ordered my beloved Martelli pasta. And it is really wonderful.<br />Only I saw that I got half the amount I was thinking to get. The bags contain 500g, which is exactly half of what I used to buy in Germany. And I paid 5,50 $ each plus postage now! Almost twice the price for half the weight - uhm - does that make it quadroopled?<br /><br />Now my birthday came in July, I got money again, and I am looking into another order. But - oh shock! The price of 5,50$ has turned into 8$ now. And the bags did not turn into the original sizes (1ooog or 1kg).<br /><br />Wow - is that a sign the dollar loses its value completely now?<br /><br />Would it not be cheaper to order the pasta in Italy or France or Germany and have it shipped overseas to me? I guess I would get a better deal.<br /><br />I checked it, the bags in Europe still contain 1kg, and I saw them offered online for 6 Euros. I guess I will have to make some serious calculations.<br /><br />But the order from amazon is unthinkable now.<br /><br />Rustichella d'abruzzo is second best. Also expensive, but I guess I can afford that with forsaking other things.<br /><br />P.S. (edited on Nov.7) Now check out this new brand! Montebello Organic Fusili, Italian Macaroni, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I am saved, hooray!<br />With the new subscription price I can finally afford great pasta again!<br />Read also my review of the Montebello Fusili (click on above link) to find out more!

review/summary: Good Alternative To Cocoa...
review/text: Like a lot of other products by Barry Farms, I was first introduced to carob powder way back during my sons scouting days. Camping trips during the fall and winter months always resulted in the evening ending with a traditional "jawin" session around the fire, complete of course with hot cocoa and marshmallows, among other treats.  In the beginning, real hot chocolate was used for it was easy to locate, and of course what the boys wanted and expected.  The biggest problem we had with the real thing was the obvious caffeine high it used to give the boys late at night when we least wanted it.  (As any of you with youngin's in your household can imagine, most kids don't need the bountiful effects of caffeine at any time, but especially late at night).  After the traditional session around the campfire ended, a not so well liked and substandard other tradition would unfortunately follow.  Trying to get the well wired boys to settle down and let the old men and ladies on the trip get some much needed rest.<br /><br />Enter carob powder.  Carob is a tropical pod that contains a sweet dark pulp that is very similar in taste and texture to cocoa.  The pulp is dried and then ground into a powder that both appears and tastes similar to chocolate.  It used to be something only available in health food stores.  But now with the advent of the internet, it is widely available here and other places online.  Despite carob powder being very similar to chocolate in calories and fats, it is nonetheless a healthier alternative.  It contains three times the calcium found in chocolate, and more importantly to me, unlike chocolate it contains no caffeine.  This was the true benefit we had in mind in substituting it for the cocoa at trails end each night.  Make no mistake about it, carob is a little sweeter, but definitely not as flavorful as real chocolate ounce for ounce.  Anyone expecting hot chocolate will be disappointed by a straight mug of carob.  It's not only not as tasty, but it remains a little grittier as well when dissolved.  Surprisingly however, my experience back in my sons scouting days proved that the boys got used to the carob powder very quickly, and actually enjoyed its little grittier texture.  As for its flavor, straight carob brewed hot reminded a lot of the scouts of Yoo Hoo drink.  Anyone familiar with the taste of Yoo Hoo can easily imagine carobs flavor.  Even if we decided to spike the carob powder with a little real chocolate, we were still giving the boys a healthier drink, and of course a lot less caffeine. We went through quite a few pounds of it in my sons younger days.  With very few complaints or disappointment.<br /><br />In conclusion, I highly recommend carob powder for anyone that prefers a little healthier alternative drink to real hot chocolate, and without any of the caffeine. Or, if you just happen to be one of those poor unfortunates that is allergic to chocolate. I still today buy it from Barry Farms and take it along on my own hikes here for I am so used too, and have taken a liking to its flavor over the years.  If you decide to give it a try, I recommend buying two or more pounds at a time to make the shipping a better deal.  The Barry Farms carob is a very good quality product, and has been around for many years.<br /><br />PS:  By the way, like some of the other reviewers here, I recommend the regular or light carob powder over the dark brewed blend also available on Amazon.  Carob is not like chocolate in that it gets sweeter and stronger when roasted a bit longer. In my opinion and that of others here, it just gets more bitter and less pleasant by the lengthier process...

review/text: For those who cannot go to sleep without a glass of chocolate milk before going to bed(chocolate milk was my drug of choice), this is the answer!<br />Years of drinking chocolate milk before going to bed will do nothing but increase your cholesterol and make you obese.<br />Carob has no sugar. Mix several teaspoons in a glass of Vanilla Soymilk, then add chocolate flavor Stevia sweetener.  You will have a chocolate drink which tastes even better than the real thing, with no sugar, and no cholesterol! Try it!

review/text: I've used carob in place of cocoa for years -- in fact, my children don't like brownies made with cocoa nearly as much as the carob brownies.  This carob powder is great -- it mixes beautifully and is just the right roast for my cooking needs.

review/text: I have been allergic to chocolate for over 35 years now.  I have had carob chips and carob candy bars.  I found this carob powder by mistake actually and I am glad I did.  It arrived very fast and I made the most delicious carob cake with carob icing.  I wish I had known about this product much sooner.  Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Did not receive Product
review/text: I'm unable to review product, but surely can say that Barry Farm is not the easiest place to work with.  Perhaps it's just the Holiday jitters.  Postal Service notified me they received empty package from the order I placed with them several weeks ago.  I thought it'd be an easy matter to handle, but after not hearing back, I called Barry Farms, and was greeted with rudeness from person answering the phone.  She told me I was talking over her as I tried to briefly explain the situation.  Having paid only $2.69 for a product that cost $7.80 to ship, I was not satisfied with their customer service, and since the company told me this happens sometimes, perhaps they need to readjust their packaging methods.

review/summary: Caroh Powder 1 lb.  Light roast
review/text: Not bad for a chocolate substitute - not the same as using real cocoa powder but gives the same general idea.  We're on a candida diet so I can't give an honest critique because it's not the only change I'm making.  Not using real sugar makes the biggest change in my baked goods.  I have noticed that the carob powder soaks up more water and my batters are drier and denser. Still experimenting.<br /><br />I first ordered this because I have a friend who is allergic to chocolate and wanted to make them a treat.  Before I had the chance, both my husband & I had to go on a Candida diet.  We can't eat chocolate, any sweetner but stevia and 100% Pure Vegetable glycerin, dairy, etc.  Brownies aren't the same but it helps.  Can't wait to try it w/a real sweetner!

review/text: This is the perfect candy. It's long-lasting, it tastes great and it quenches thirst. I think the green ones are the best, but they're all delicious! There's layers upon layers of tasty flavors, and if you resist the urge to bite them, they can last for a long time. Not quite "everlasting" like in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" but definitely as long-lasting as any candy out there. I can't think of any better candy product. There just simply isn't one.

review/summary: Dogs love them, but they're not healthy
review/text: Greenies tries to position itself as a healthy treat, but I'm not so sure.<br /><br />My dogs love them, but buyers should be aware that one of the main ingredients in Greenies is wheat, which, according to my vet, sticks to teeth like glue. In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.<br /><br />Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy. You're better off giving them a cheaper rawhide stick, which does a much better job of cleaning teeth.

review/text: I bought "Greenies" after hearing rave reviews about them from friends. I buy all my pet supplies on Amazon.com and was able to purchase the value pack 36oz container when on a lightening deal ($22). My dog loves them, but she eats anything - I do think they help with tartar and her breath. My reason for 3 stars is because I don't feel like it is that good of a deal. There are not that many chews in the box and I thought I was getting a steal on them when I did. No one in their right mind would pay $130 for this container, I think even $35 is a ripoff.

Everyday about noon he gets one.  I know when it's noon because he walks up to me and puts his paws on my legs and then turns circles.  When I say, "Do you want a Greenie"?  he goes nuts and runs to the cabinet where I keep them.<br />Happy dog<br />Happy owner

review/summary: My dogs love Greenies
review/text: Greyhounds notoriously have bad breath.  I first bought Greenies years ago when my first greyhound, Sophie, was alive.  She very much enjoyed these treats and her breath improved, at least a little.  Several dogs later, I was excited to bring a box of Greenies back to Mexico to give to my two dogs, Etheldreda - a greyhound, and Sadie - a greyhound mix.  I'm sorry that I can't find them in Mexico and I hate to ration out the Greenies because of the short supply.  Greenies are expensive, but they do help with the dogs' bad breath.  And my dogs love Greenies.

I may look at comporable brands that are less costly, since she eats any type of treat thrown her way.  I am lucky that she is not picky.

review/summary: Bonkers over greenies!
review/text: We had a dog for nearly 16 years, who had terrible teeth and foul breath, and ended up needing surgery to remove 19 teeth.  She had infections under the teeth into the bone beneath.  She ended up with kidney disease and we lost her several months ago.  We now have a 1 year old pit/lab mix, Daisy, who will not let us brush her teeth, and I am determined to keep her teeth healthy.  Daisy gets one regular greenie (she weighs 57#) after her evening meal.  Daisy goes bonkers when I open the package, dancing all around the kitchen.  She loves them so much. Daisy gulps down her food, but the texture of the greenies forces her to take her time when she eats them.  So far her breath is not even noticeable, and her teeth are pearly white.  Also, I never give her wet food, which sticks to her teeth.  And, she chews on nylabones throughout the day.  Buying this through amazon.com saves me at least $10, so I am happy to get this online.  The packages always arrive on time and in good shape.  When the weather was very hot and humid here, I did get one box where some of the greenies were stuck together, but the individual greenies were still in good shape.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Not for my dog
review/text: The product does seem to work. If my dog has had a few of these over the course of a few days, her breath is noticably fresher. However, I walk her every single day, and she usually has to use the bathroom around this time. I do not give her Greenies daily, but I have noticed that every time I do give her one in the morning, her bowel movements are not formed well and very loose during her afternoon walk. This could well be a reaction in just my dog and not for others, but I would rather err on the side of caution. These just don't seem to digest well for my pup, so I will not be buying another bag. However, I cannot completely slam this product, as it did help her breath somewhat.<br /><br />If it matters, my dog is a 5 year old long-haired Black Cream Daschund. She hovers between 12 and 12 1/2 lbs.

review/summary: My dogs understand the word greenies
review/text: My dogs love greenIes.  They may not understand anything else, but they they understand greenies.  Every time I ask my partner to give them greenies, all there of them jump up and run to the and state at the container it is in.  They get there before us.  I have shepherd, lab, and blue tick.  Shepherd is the picky dog.  She does not like Hyde or even dog biscuits, but she loves these

review/summary: My Yellow Lab Loves Them
review/text: I've tried to find a "dental" treat to feed my 2 year old Yellow Lab for the past 6 months. None of the recommended chews nor treats did the trick, she plain refused them upon first sniff. I took a chance on the greenies based on some quick and dirty research, and am sure glad I did. She absolutely devours them in no time flat. For a somewhat picky eater (an extreme rarity in the world of Labs) these proved a fantastic purchase.
