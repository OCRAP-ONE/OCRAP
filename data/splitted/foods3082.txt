review/summary: Delicious, soft baked cookies
review/text: I am so impressed with these cookies.  I have multiple food allergies and sensitivities and have tried a variety of products over the years.  The Enjoy Life brand has been consistently good - full flavor, great texture.  Packaging could be better and the price could be lower but for the options available, I'm very pleased.  The chocolate chips in these cookies don't contain soy lecithin which is a huge plus as soy lecithin is in everything these days.  I also highly recommend the Chocolate Brownie cookies.

review/summary: Allergy-friendly cookies that taste great!
review/text: We buy these cookies in bulk to save a little money and so that we always have a stockpile of safe treats for our son who is allergic to eggs, dairy, is gluten and a whole host of other things. He loves them and they are the perfect tool for bribing him to eat all of his dinner and assisting with toilet training.<br />They are soft-baked and taste great. It's nice for him to be able to have a little treat without having to resort to baking absolutely everything yourself. The fact that they are baked in a gluten free, nut free facility also reassures on any cross-contamination concerns. I wish there were more products out there like this....

review/summary: Does not taste anything like chocolate chip cookies
review/text: EWWWW!!!  These cookies make me sick, literally.  I felt so nauseated after eating just one, and they do not taste anything like chocolate chip cookies.  They actually tasted like an over spiced molasses cookie which makes me want to end my life not enjoy it like the label states.  I laugh now that the box claims to be even tastier, so before they must have tasted like ass.  They smelled great and sounded promising so I thought that I was going to end up finding a new cookie obsession.  I guess it is a good thing for my wallet that I didn't find a new cookie obsession but my taste buds are angry.  Buyer beware, don't expect chocolate chip cookies because these are anything but.

review/summary: Terrible.
review/text: I bought these cookies over at my local Kroger to try something new. however, I didn't know they would be that bad. I only ate one, and wanted to stop as I started. It barely had any kind of "chocolate chip cookie" taste, and even if it did, the "cookie" was so gritty that I wouldn't have been able to taste it in the first place. Maybe it's because it's gluten free, I don't know. Gluten free bakery products always seem to have this grittiness to them in my opinion. I'm not allergic to gluten or anything, but they're egg/dairy free and I eat cookies containing gluten usually, so maybe I'm biased. I can just say I didn't really care for them personally.

review/summary: My puppy loved it
review/text: I ordered this Nutri-Boosters Treats for Puppies for my little doggy whom I've found on a street in Cape Verde, Africa. She was so small, she had so many skin problems, warms and anything you can imagine. I started to feed her properly and the part of the diet was also the Nutri-Boosters Treats. Now she is a beautiful little doggy-girl. He fur coat is great and she's in fantastic condition. I know that the Treats were not the only reason which help to achieve such a great result, but for sure they did their work. And she loved it.<br /><br />I must also say that the Nutri-Boosters Treats are for sure for puppies, because my second, 4 years old dog was not interested in them at all ;)

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: If you're a chip lover, take heart. There are healthy options out there to soothe your cravings. RW Garcia has a soy flaxseed chip with no trans fats, no gluten, with fiber and omega 3s.<br /><br />I've tried many different chip varieties over the years. Many of them are very cardboardy - they try their best, but they sacrifice a lot of flavor in order to keep the junk stuff out. I'm really pleased that in modern times they seem to have figured out the balance of ingredients to make this work!<br /><br />First, this chip set is fully organic, including certification. The ingredient list is rather clear. Corn. Soy grits. Flaxseed. Corn oil, sea salt, water, lime. You know exactly what is in here! There's no wheat, no gluten. No cholesterol.<br /><br />Ah, but how does it taste? If it's like cardboard, it doesn't matter how good it is for you - you're not going to eat it. Luckily, it is rather good! I am *especially* impressed how it tastes nice and salty, but each serving only has 50mg of salt - i.e only 2% of your daily salt intake!! This is incredibly low for a chip or snack food.<br /><br />For other stats, there is 13g of carbs, minus the 4g of fiber leaves 9g of net carbs. There are 8g of fat (1g is saturated) and 140 calories. This is for about 7 large chips.<br /><br />These chips have 6% iron, 2% Vitamin A and 2% calcium. So the serving is not going to give you enough to really worry about skipping your multivitamins, but heck, it's a nice bonus.<br /><br />Now, I don't recommend sitting down and eating your way through an entire bag of these at one sitting :) The whole bag would still give you 90g of carbs, or 1400 calories. That's not a healthy way to get your energy! But there are many times that you want a snack and want something crunchy. Fiber is of course VERY good for you, too. If you have some healthy salsa, it's a good way to get some good veggies into you on a chip base that has very little salt, has good ingredients and is tasty.<br /><br />The only real downside that I see is that I had to order these from a website - I can't find these in my local stores. Maybe if they start to gain in popularity they'll become in more locations.

review/text: Taste and texture is good.  Not dry or cardboard tasting.  A bit denser than major brand tortillas chips, but they have a good corn taste.  Because they are denser, they can replace crackers if following a low carb diet. Overall very pleased with this brand of tortilla chips and I will buy them again.  Price was as expected.

review/text: Yum.  These are GREAT.  Only problem is portion size.  7 is enough at 140 calories.  Yet, I only need about that or half that with a bowl of turkey chili to get that crunch.  Be sure NOT to eat out of the bag or you'll do some serious damage to your waistline.  They are really that good if you like the wholesome grainy taste and somewhat grainy texture.  Excellent with cheese, but again, they are so good that I could eat a bag with nacho cheese... so be warned.<br />I found them at Trader Joes.  You can go online for store locations, or buy them online.

There are only two stalks in mine, so I had to leave the tacky looking flowers in it.  Don't bother buying this.  It's not worth the money.

review/summary: Promotes the coffee craving
review/text: I treated myself to a coffee percolater and browsing amazon for some coffee to go with it, came across this set which looked like a good idea, a nice starbucks mug for when I am at home and a travel mug to take my lovely coffee to work with me.<br />The mug is a regular sized mug from starbucks.<br /><br />The travel mug is fantastic, I actually use it at home as well as to work.  The outer white part is a plastic-y material, you can feel the heat of your drink but not uncomfortably so, the inside stainless steel.  The top is the same rubbery plastic that most travel mugs use, and is structured so that the liquid pours out, no risk of burning your lip on the lid either by the escaping steam or your drink, tho depending on how hot your drink is you can still burn your mouth.  The mug is not perfect, if you tip it over, the drink will spill, if you shake it, drop it, turn it upside down, the drink will spill.  But what is fantastic about it is that with the lid on - your drink stays hot for a *long* time! (havent tried a cold drink yet).  Made some tea in this mug about 11:30ish, by 13:10 tho cooler you could still feel some heat in the drink.<br /><br />The ground coffee is a 70g sample of Startbucks Caf&eacute; Estima Blend, which supposed to be a smooth Roasty flavour and a bold taste.  I used my little desktop (drip) coffee maker.  I used the same as with my other coffees one and half heaped teaspoons of the grounds.  The first cupful was strong, so much so that I had a bitter burnt aftertaste which a lot of people mentioned on other reviews of starbucks ground coffees.  I ran a second batch of water thro the same grounds which was a bit better - not so much bitterness.<br />Now I dont give up too easily, so what I did was put both batches of coffee into my travel mug and another of just hot water a little coffee mate and some brown sugar (travel mug easily took all this - did I mention its a fantastic mug??), Result?  A nice mug of coffee, not perfect but still enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this set, but warn the user of the grounds, a little trial and error will get you there, tho I think the coffee mate helped masked the 'burnt' taste so that it became a 'roasted' flavor as advertised on the box, so not sure how drinkers of coffees 'strong and black' will fare.<br /><br />xx

review/text: I just ordered my 3rd case! Our local store use to carry it until last year. Glad I found it here on Amazon.<br />I like to doctor up the instructions and recipe. Someone mentioned the cooking time, I just cook the pasta until it is al-dente. Also when you strain the water from the pasta, I use a fine mesh metal strainer so I don't loose any of the pasta mix.<br />As far as rinsing in cold water, I prefer to go right to the bowl hot, skip the milk and mayo and mix the packet using sour cream and serving it warm.

It was perfect - not too firm or floppy.<br /><br />I miss this in the local grocery stores; am tempted to stock up in case Amazon runs out, as well...

review/text: Ever since I got the bulk spaghetti I've been getting more and more Anna pasta.  This time I got the penne and it was quite possibly the best penne pasta I've had.  I'm still deciding whether its better than the Barilla stuff I usually get.  I would say the comparison is debateably equal if not better than Barilla penne pasta.  I don't know if this happened on purpose, but I did get a 40 bag supply instead of the 20 lb shown which is a lot of pasta for me.  It was convenient getting a nice big 6 lb bag of penne pasta from Sam's club yes, but technically the individual do stay fresher over a longer period of time.  Nonetheless it still would've been nice if it came in a nice big resealable bag.

review/text: This Jack Link's Premium Cuts Peppered Beef Jerky is one of the better Jack Link's jerkies in terms of both texture and taste. It is tender and easy to chew, neither too chewy nor stringy. Some jerkies are really hard to bite into and tear a piece off with your teeth, but this isn't one of them. At the same time it isn't too tender that it's gross to chew on, but it's really got a pretty good, solid consistency while being moderately thin (around a quarter-centimeter width). It has a bold taste that is not excessively spicy but definitely has some kick to it, and tastes great compared to other Jack Link's jerkies (cough cough Matador cough). There isn't a whole lot in a single package, but if you shop in the right place you can get it for pretty cheap ($3.99 at Target as of writing). Not the best jerky I've ever had, but definitely worth trying if you like jerky.

review/summary: Yummy Gingerbread!
review/text: I didn't eat a lot of gingerbread as a kid.  When I was growing up, gingerbread wasn't a huge tradition ... to me, gingerbread was nothing more than part of a story about a cookie that came to life and got the whole town running after it.<br /><br />But I did eat gingersnaps.  And I loved them!  And since my childhood, I've tried a few different gingerbreads - some were cookie-ish, some were more cake-y or bread-y than cookie ... but I've only tasted a very few that I would say tasted as good as the sharp, peppery snap of a gingersnap.  That warm, sassy spice of a gingersnap - that's what I like!<br /><br />And that's what I taste with this Gingerbread Matcha from Red Leaf Tea.  It is warm and spicy, but not in a hot spicy kind of way.  More of a warm, exotic spicy taste.  And while I did not taste a lot of "bready" or "cake-y" or "cookie" kind of notes to the Matcha when it is prepared traditionally with water, after preparing it traditionally and taking a few sips, and deciding it needed something more, I added just a splash of milk to it, and that did the trick!  Now I have a gingerbread Matcha latte that is absolutely ah-mazing!  I love it!

I am very pleased with this matcha. : )<br /><br />The first time I tried it was shaken in a waterbottle! This was not the way to go haha. It tasted like ginger water - definitely tasted like it was good for me! Just not too palatable.<br /><br />Whisking it up hot with a pinch of brown sugar is *definitely* the way to go! Holy moley that's good! Sweet and gingery (VERYgingery) with the depth of molasses. I tamed the ginger with a splash of cream and was more than happy with the result.

review/text: This tea gave me the best idea ever: Zombie Gingerbread Men. Every year for Christmas, I make cookies for my wife and sister-in-law to decorate and they are insane with it. In the past years we've ended up with Ed Wood, an Orion slave girl in a Star Trek uniform, a Purple People Eater, and many, many other cracked decorations. These two really shouldn't be trusted with pastry bags. But yes, this year I am definitely making sugar cookies with gingerbread matcha and letting them go at it. I should get some of those gingerbread men cookie cutters that look like they already have a bite taken out of it. I need to do a trial run to be sure they taste alright, maybe for Hallowe'en.<br /><br />Anyway, yes, on to the matcha. Well, one thing is for sure, it is definitely GINGER bread. The ginger is very, very strong, but I'm not entirely sure that's a bad thing. Maybe a touch of brown sugar will help round out the edges, because right now I can't really taste anything but ginger. I tried it witht he brown sugar and while it did bring out the molasses goodness of gingerbread, it's still a bit too gingery for me. But the taste that remains on my tongue is amazing...maybe I'll get used to that bite of ginger over time.

review/text: well, I ordered 4 boxes believing the pictures on the box.  But the nuts are few and far in between.  So either I got 4 bad boxes or their quality control is not good.  So mostly just sweet gooey cornstarch.<br /><br />Will not be ordering this again.

review/summary: Good, but not the best
review/text: This product was packaged so as to keep the candy fresh and attractive.  It was cut into fairly uniform pieces which were fairly uniformly dusted with powdered sugar so they didn't stick together at all.  The care in packaging makes me think that the slight chewiness of this candy is intentional.  I must say that the people I gave it to at Christmas really loved it.  They would probably have given it a 5.  I prefer the pieces to be a little larger and a little more tender.  It's this preference that makes me give it 4 stars instead of 5.

review/summary: Hazer Baba Turkish Delight
review/text: I bought Galil Almond TD and Hazer Baba Pistachio TD in the same order to compare.  The boxes are similar, but the Hazer is cheaper.  I like both, but prefer the Galil brand.  The Hazer Baba was softer and mushier and the aliquot of nuts is skimpier, certainly than the picture on the front of the box.  Still it's good and will be gone too soon.

review/summary: Too much sugar
review/text: I have been in LOVE with Turkish Delight ever since spending a month in Turkey a couple years ago. So I'm always on the lookout for good stuff. But this is just caked in powdered sugar - so much so, that I have to shake, pinch, and scrape off the excess. After all that effort, I still can't taste the delight under all that confectioner's sugar :(

review/text: I got the Mystic Morning flavor, and if this is what a medium roast from this brand tastes like, I wonder how deep their dark roasts go. It's a bracing flavor profile in the morning, the kind of coffee that'll put hair on your chest. If you want your coffee strong enough to get up and walk away on its own, this is for you. Bear in mind though that an 8 oz pack will not go very far.

review/text: ...one of my favorite pleasures in life and I decided to try this brand once it was on sale for under $6. A bit lighter coffee then I'm used to but it was smooth and well rounded with just the right amount of nutty after taste. I'll be watching for the whole bean since I'm sure it will heighten the flavor. Actually bought some interest in the company (JAMN) since i think Mr. Marley has a winning product. Sure would be fun to sit down with him and listen to stories about his father over a cup of this Joe!

review/text: Torani sugar free almond syrup is my favorite and has been for years.  Recently, the store where I used to purchase it told me that they are unable to carry it in the future.  Much to my delight as a frequent Amazon customer, it was available online at a comparable price, but not as an Amazon product.  OMG.  I ordered a case and was shocked at the shipping cost!!!!!!  I tried to cancel the order but the company said it had shipped, although I had immediately emailed and they were closed (Sunday).<br /><br />I will never order again from the company just because of this shipping cost experience.  Although the almond flavor is still my favorite, I will switch to a different one.

review/summary: Healthy Alternative to Kibble, Canned or Raw Diets
review/text: Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing.

Amazon stored the Sojos bag in the original mailing box Sojos sent them.  My order was picked from the shelf and the box containing the Sojos was placed in another box and mailed to me.  The bag of Sojos was almost one year old and there was no way Amazon kept track of that.  I got a refund from Amazon with no question and very quickly, but Amazon needs to keep control of the "use-by" dates of food they offer on their site.

review/summary: picky puppy...
review/text: I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test, I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with, as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula), which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well, I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original, he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days, I would play with and take his food away, so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans.

review/summary: Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor
review/text: To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words "Medium Extra Bold" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.

review/summary: My Favorite by a Landslide so Far
review/text: I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do.

Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes.

review/text: We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as "extra bold" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand.

review/summary: Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups
review/text: I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.

A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.

Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NP30XQ">Green Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend</a>  But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees.  The Dunkin Donut brand.<br /><br />This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand.  Not bold or bitter.  Not weak or under flavored.  It is smooth and very flavorful.  It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night.<br /><br />I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Amazon when you join their club.  A great value.<br /><br />I do wish that Amazon would change the name by removing "Extra Bold".  It is not.  It is, at most, a medium roast.  Even when brewed with the smallest setting of the Keurig I would not concider it bold.  It comes out great on the medium size setting.  Very remanicent of that great cup of Joe you would get in the old days at your favorite diner.
