review/summary: Adore them
review/text: I tried these for the first time about a year ago; then my market stopped carrying them (lack of shelf space).  So I took the web address off the package and ordered online.  No way I was going to miss out on this delicious and amazing chip.  I even saw a program on how they were made and loved it even more.  The best; not too spicy; CRISP AND CRUNCHY.  Simply terrific!!!

review/summary: Good but Variable
review/text: I bought these at a grocery store and I had all I could do to not eat the whole bag and then lick the wrapper.  So olive-y! So delicious!!!.  Amazon had all BUT Olive so I waited for notification which came pretty quickly.  I ordered a case and I was....disappointed.  While the lot I received is good, it is not shout-from-the-rooftops good like the first bag.  My case was quite garlicky and slightly burnt flavored, but not really olive-y.  That first bag was so good though, that I will try again.  But not maybe by the case.

review/summary: Tasty, but not the best chip ever
review/text: The Olive tortilla chips are tasty, but I certainly would not rate them the best tortilla chip ever.  The olive pieces in the chips are very small and dried.  They impart a light earthy flavor in the background and in no way overwhelm.  These are excellent with dip and do not break easily like some other gourmet chips.

review/text: These chips were amazingly delicious!<br />These olive chips were thin, crispy, tatsty, yet not too salty.<br />My 2 year old son loved them. The best part of these chips is the fact that they (chips) are super healthy.<br />These chips are also small enough for your little ones to enjoy and eat easily.<br />I highly recommend these chips for any occasion, especially to place in your or your little ones' lunch box.

review/text: I like these tortilla chips.  You can taste the olive but only faintly-you know it is there so you search out the taste but it is is a background flavor.  However if you don't like olives don't order these!  The fat content is reasonable for a snack food and they are satifyingly crispy!

Over all I have had lots of different brands, flavorings and such of tortilla crackers/chips but I think these were unique first the multigrain thats something new in a tortilla to me and I thought that was tasty ,then they added the olive flavoring . I loved it instant hit with me I would definitly buy these anytime i seen them in a local grocery or back on amazon someday . I think they are unique  and something as I said a different pace and taste definitly worth getting others interested in trying.

review/summary: Good. Different. Not too strong. Could maybe be stronger.
review/text: I'm a pros and cons gal. I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting. The flavor was stronger than subtle and the chips were utlra-fresh tasting. Straight up, here's the pros and cons:<br />PROS: Super fresh. Nice portion size, especially because you'll want more than one portion. Attractive on a plate, unlike traditional tortilla chips. Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy. Chips were sturdy and didn't crumble in the bag easily. No pile of "chip-lets" at the bottom. Would probably be a nice surprise in someone's lunch box or at a movie party or summer get-together.<br /><br />CONS: Probably not great for dipping. If you're an olive lover, you may prefer the flavor to be more potent, as I did. If you're concerned about packaging waste, there's a lot of extra bag here which seems wasteful.<br /><br />I personally felt the olive flavor could have been stronger, so I withheld one star, but that is my personal taste. Several people felt it was strong enough. They are definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Average Chip...
review/text: Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly "olive" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of "crunch".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty & healthier substitute for junk-food chips
review/text: Are you the type of person that always needs a side bag of chips to accompany their lunchtime sandwich but then feels pangs of guilt afterward for consuming  that extra 120-200 trans-fat laden empty calories?  If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Olive' line of tortilla chips (think of a white corn tortilla chip with flavor profiles of black and green olives and a hit of garlic) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite.  These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself.  These chips are tasty enough with the right crisp texture you've come to know and expect from your standard snack tortilla morsel.  Great product all around.

No trans fats, not overly salty, nothing artifical (like the label says...) makes for something a bit different that your typical tortilla chip.<br /><br />You don't need any salsa or cheese on top of them -- the flavor is perfect (if you like the taste of green olives, that is.) You'll be asking for more as the 1 oz. bag will not be enough!

review/text: When looking for snack products, I tend to look for those with the fewest artificial ingredients or no artificial ingredients, if possible.  On this count, chips from Food Should Taste Good easily qualify.  All the ingredients are pronounceable and identifiable (quinoa, pronounced keen-wa, is a South American grain).  I have now tried three of the seven flavors, Chocolate, Sweet Potato, and Multigrain, and they all, well, taste good as the brand name implies they should.  The Multigrain chips have a wholesome nuttiness that would go well with a variety of dips (although I'm eating them plain).<br /><br />Best of all, they're kosher, gluten-free, and vegan.  How can one go wrong?

review/summary: Very good tortilla chips
review/text: The taste of these is right between Tostitos Multigrain chips and Original Sun Chips, and that's pretty nice place to be. A little sweeter corn flavor then the Tostitos, but not as much as the Sun Chips.<br /><br />They company/brand/motto of FoodShouldTasteGood lives up to its promise. Even though tastes vary greatly I think most people who like tortilla chips or even thin crackers like Wheat Thins will find these very enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing I thought was funny was that the mini bag seems to be just a scaled down version of the large bag since the picture which they claim is "Enlarged to show texture and detail" is really a bit smaller than actual size (which is about a 2" x 1.5" hexagon).

review/text: These were absolutely delicious.  They came very nicely packaged, with a thick and smooth exterior plastic packaging.  I was a little disappointed that the package was mainly air- there were only about 15 chips in the 1 oz. bag.  However, each chip was delicious and wholesome.<br /><br />They were perfectly seasoned- not too salty, but just enough to bring out the flavor.  The sesame and flax seeds were very evident, and a nice addition.  The ingredients list the chips as being partially made from corn, but frankly, they tasted mainly like whole wheat.<br /><br />I ate them plain, and they were excellent.  I think eating them with salsa would be a waste!

review/summary: Tasty chips
review/text: I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.<br /><br />Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand.  The chips are little hexagons about 1" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  While the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  They're not overly salty - indeed, if I had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.<br /><br />These chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself.

review/summary: Pretty tasty chips with no weird ingredients
review/text: These multigrain chips are more like those vegetable/organic/seed crackers than a tortilla chip.  It does taste a bit like a tortilla chip, but most of the flavor comes from the seeds in it.  I don't think they're too salty and the flavor is pretty well balanced.  The thickness and crunchiness is comparable to that of a Wheat Thin.  I only had one chip broken in half in the last bag that I ate.<br /><br />The ingredients list is pretty interesting in that there aren't any long chemical names: stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.  Take a look at the gallery above for a picture of the back of the bag.<br /><br />Each bag is 140 calories and contains 7 grams of fat so they make a pretty good snack.

The whole grains are entirely satisfying and work well with most traditional accompaniments for chips.

Just like the olive-flavored chips, virtually all the chips are whole and unbroken, which is a nice change of pace from what one gets with most similar products.

review/text: These chips are a nice break from the carbon copy corn-chips that we are all used to.  They have a nice, but not overwhelming, flavor of olive that is really quite delightful and that even people who dislike olives might enjoy.  They go well with guacamole, salsa, one of my favorite spinach dips, vegetable pate and just about any other dip that one might care to eat with it.  They have a hearty taste and texture that is quite satisfying and almost all the chips are whole.  The size is right for a lunch.  Frankly, I cannot imagine anybody not finding these chips enjoyable.<br /><br />I suppose that the only caveat is that if you specifically want the same-old corn chip, then this is probably not for you.

review/text: I'm always in search for good, healthy, whole grain products.

They are not overly salty like most other tortilla chips, which is a nice surprise.<br /><br />They are hearty chips and hold salsa well without breaking. They have a very good taste - corn, nutty, slight hint of salt, and hearty.<br /><br />My main complaint is with the texture. They're crunchy, but have too much of a cardboard texture for my liking.<br /><br />Overall, they're deliciously healthy chips, if you can get past the texture.

We strongly sense the company really believes that, "Food Should Taste Good."<br /><br />Although we were skeptical at first, the unique olive flavor attracted us to this product. In addition, there are NO artificial colors, flavors, or GMOs in the ingredients.<br /><br />After opening the bag, we observed an attractive sight and scent and . This product is not like average chips, it has the aroma of real-food. The taste is also unlike any other, not only because of the olive flavor, but because of the marriage between the cracker and tortilla chip. The crispness is just right, and the Olive flavor is included without dominating other ingredients. The one-ounce serving size is just right and allows one to easily travel or pack this with a lunch.<br /><br />Overall, this healthy snack is recommended for both kids and adults.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: I've tried 2 types of FoodShouldTasteGood chips - the Multigrain and these. I must say, I'm impressed with both. Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, "No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential. Whether you're willing to shell out the extra cash for a non-essential snack will depend on your tastes, your priorities and your pocketbook.

review/summary: An All Natural Winner
review/text: Though I like to try and use all natural foods, I will not sacrifice flavor just to "go natural". From the 1st mini-chip to the last in one of the 1 oz snack-sized bags, I was entirely satisfied and will definitely buy these. I started eating the chips plain and, from the 1st bite, found the multigrain flavor satisfingly strong with a just a hint of sweetness that took the edge off the grain flavor. The size and shape of the chips (more like crackers than larger tortilla chips) was good for snacking, plus the thickness provided just the right texture and "crunch" factor.<br /><br />Later I finished the chips with a pesto dip and the complementary flavors worked perfectly: the chip didn't over power the dip, but neither did it roll over and die. I am sure I would enjoy these tortilla chips with other dips.<br /><br />Finally a last observation is how well these mini-chips kept their original shape. Out of the entire (albeit small) bag, only 1-2 chips were broken.<br /><br />An all natural winner that will have a permanent spot on my households snack-food roster.

They are great with the usual salsa and sour cream just like any other tortilla chips but these you can try more exotic things like an Italian salsa (tomatos and Italian dressing).<br /><br />Other serious reasons to buy these chips:<br />-No GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms; Basically you get all the plant chemistries God intended for your health, not the Monsanto Corporation.)<br />-Kosher Certified by the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations (For those who care about a holistic diet and raise everything to a spiritual level.)<br />-Certified Gluten-Free (I'm not sure who certifies this.)<br />-No Artificial Colors or Flavors<br />-No Preservatives (Except Sea Salt of course, 80mg per ounce.)<br />-No Cholesterol or Trans Fats

review/text: I liked the flavor and texture of the tortillas.  They are not spicy, but the taste is not bland because of the olives. The chips are small and the serving size in the bag is just enough for a quick, satisfying snack.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Sesame. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, "No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors". 11% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost.

review/summary: Tasty fatty corny
review/text: These chips have a great taste and if you keep it in the front of your mind you can taste the green olives. I don't know how much olive gets into the chips but just knowing some was in them made them taste fattier to me. (Each serving is 11% of your recommended daily fat.) The main ingredients are white and yellow corn.

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: Wow, the olive flavor socked me from the first bite. GREAT flavor. A little more unusual for a tortilla chip, which is what I like about it.<br /><br />There's a nice, very subtle hint of garlic there, too, which gives it a bit of pinch. (Not punch, just pinch)<br /><br />Very fresh right out of the bag, nice small sized chip.<br /><br />The olive flavor was overpowered by any dips or salsas. It tastes best to me plain, but then again, I tend to like vanilla flavored ice cream. To each his own--I'd definitely suggest trying this with hummus.<br /><br />Ingredients: Stone ground white corn, high oleic sunflower oil, black olives, green olives, sugarcane fiber, garlic powder, sea salt.<br /><br />One serving: 1 oz., one package, 140 calories

review/text: These are wonderful chips that really do taste like what they say, olives! If you like a very crispy thin chip packed with wonderful olivey goodness and subtle garlic then try these they are awsome! I first tried this companies products from Costco where I purchased their multi grain chips. I was hooked from the first bite and like them even better then the olive ones but they are both excellent chips. They are not too salty either which is another reason I love them. The grainy taste is nutty and a little sweet and addictive. The little bags were not enough I was left wanting more but on the other hand the little bags are safer to have around! You will love these I promise!

review/summary: Healthy alternative
review/text: Before opening this package I read the ingrediants and daily values. There was an advantage in the lack of saturated fats which was pleasing to me. I had the Olive flavored variety. I found the chips to be tasty but a little dry and lacking the olive flavor I had expected. I THOUGHT I tasted an olive experience in the first bite but did not taste it again. By saying I thought it was dry may have been the thought that the product may have been a little old OR had the same sensation in my mouth as stale varieties I have bitten into in the past. Was pleasing enougha but I can't honestly say I would purchase again.

review/summary: Excellent, natural chip
review/text: You won't find any MSG, hydrogenated oils, or various things that most people can't pronounce and have no idea what it actually is in these chips.  What you WILL find, however, is a very flavorful chip that has enough flavor for eating plain, but not too much flavor for dipping.<br /><br />While I couldn't really taste a true "olive" flavor, I think that the olives mixed with the garlic salt provides a very subtle flavor that is more robust than plain salted chips.  Of course, not having an overpowering flavor is a good thing...<br /><br />Texture is important with the foods I eat, and these had a nice firm crispness to them.  Other various natural tortilla chips I've tried (including "store brand" Whole Foods chips) have an off-texture (not quite crisp, not quite stale) that have prevented me from repeated buys.  Not the case with these ones.

review/summary: you can actually taste the olives . .very unique
review/text: I like these chips just a bit better than I liked the multigrain version.  The flavor here is unique in that you can actually taste the green and black olives - I think they hit just the right balance here, as well, not too much, not too little.  Salt level is good - I don't care for overly salty chips so these are good for me.  Very textured and multi-level flavor in that you can taste the individual ingredients.  I think they'd go well with a mild guacamole or a smooth cheese and some fruit; nothing should compete with the flavor of these chips.

review/text: I love these chips.  Wonderfully pristine and interesting ingredients.  1-ounce bag, which is perfect to take to work as an emergency snack if there's no time for a lunch break, has 140 calories, 3 grams of fiber, zero trans fats, 7 grams of total fat (a little high but the truth is sometimes higher fat content equals more filling) and a nice and low 2 grams of sugar and equally nice and low 80 mg of sodium.  I will save the bags and recycle with http://www.terracycle.net/ with my energy bar wrappers.  I rarely eat chips because of weight considerations.  These are definitely worth the calories.  But they could be addictive so I've gotta watch it.  Bottom line:  absolutely delicious and crunchy.

review/text: To sum it up . . I liked these chips, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy them.  That's not a bad thing since I would chose them over other chips- they're just not a 'must have'.  Flavor is good, multi-layered in that you can pretty much taste the individual ingredients - the oat bran, the grains.  Salt level is good.  To compare, Tostitos regular tortilla chips can be extremely salty, whereas these are not.  Flavor is also more dimensional than the Tostitos multi-grain chips (but not that far apart); the ingredients are obviously much better.  They do look nice with their textured nuts and such in them, so they would look much better than your average chip if you were hosting a nice party.

review/summary: Definitely not a tortilla substitute
review/text: Does it matter if things are healthy if they don't taste very good?  This multi-grain chips may be packed with goodness, but they taste like a stale wheat thin that was left sitting in a bag of real tortilla chips for awhile and managed to pick up a bit of their flavor.  I think I would actually like these better if they were simple multi-grain crackers without the thin brushing of flavoring.<br /><br />Someone looking for a healthy alternative might be happy with these.  If you are a compulsive snacker, then maybe you could get used to the taste.  But anyone looking to chow down on some tortilla chips isn't going to be too happy, and would have to force themselves through a bag of these rather than eating what they really wanted.<br /><br />Unless you covered them with cheese and made nachos.  Because that makes everything taste better!

review/text: For a company who's name is "Food Should Taste Good," they certainly do a poor job of practicing what they preach. I bought a couple bags of their lime torilla chips, and wasn't the least bit impressed. Granted, I only bought them because they were so cheap, and that was only because they had been marked 75% off (after being mark 50% off, and 25% off before that). Suffice it to say, it seems that I wasn't the first person to discover their horrible taste, otherwise people would have been buying them more regularly, and the Base Exchange wouldn't have been getting so desperate to get rid of them.<br /><br />Even with a gob of Tostitos cheese dip, the taste of these chips is barely tolerable.

review/text: Imagine a small "wheat thin" that tastes like a slightly stale tortilla chip and you get an idea of what this product tastes like.  The caloric intake and the fat, cholesterol, sodium, protein and carbohydrate amounts are similar to other snacks of this type.  The ingredients lists flax, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, brown rice, oat fiber, soy, but the taste is that of a lightly salted tortilla chip.  The word, "Multi-Grain" is a good buzz word for health and this does not contain any Trans fat or other harmful ingredients.  However, I can't say that it's much different than most snack foods on the market other than it is not greasy.  It's not bad, just not different enough to spark my interest.

review/summary: Food Should Taste Good ....
review/text: ... and these do!!<br /><br />Wow!  I was really surprised at how good these chips are.  These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there.  The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right.<br /><br />They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips.  Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt.  Not these.  An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium.<br /><br />For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts.  Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack.  Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges?  These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers.  Yum!!<br /><br />I'll definitely be purchasing these from Amazon -- I've never seen them in the stores, and I simply must have more of them!

review/summary: Tastes great ... and gets 2-year-old approval
review/text: These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags. Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips.<br /><br />These chips are technically "multigrain" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt. With only 140 calories per bag and 7 grams of fat it's hard not to say yes to this tasty treat.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these chips!

review/text: These are wonderful!  They're definitely chocolate, but not overpowering.  The sea salt provides a nice foil, so you can eat a whole bag by yourself without going into a chocolate coma (maybe that's bad).  They're just sweet enough to make the chocolate happen.  They're like "hint of oreo" without all the garbage and without all the guilt (unless you eat a whole bag in one sitting).<br />I've had them with a peach salsa, which was nice.  I think they'd go really well with a fresh fruit salad.  They'd go well with ice cream, and they're perfect with a tart, plain yogurt.  I dipped them in hummus too, and while it doesn't not work...I'm not sure it's great.  Still, basically they're versatile and not too bad for you.  When you find yourself at the bottom of the bag you can always say, "well, at least it wasn't a bag of oreos."

review/summary: A tasty snack for the health conscious
review/text: I am a label reader - I count fat grams, carbs, proteins and grams of fiber vs. grams of sugar.  Most foods that advertise themselves as a "healthy" snack are not really all that good for you.  Often they are too high in calories or they use products that you just shouldn't eat.  This snack food, FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain chips really is a good tasting, good for you snack.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup and no MSG.  They contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber.  (The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)<br /><br />The chips are delicious.  They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip.  The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat.  I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip.  I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out.  I tried the Buffalo flavor this weekend and they have a very mild kick; much milder than I expected.  I still like them, but not as much as the plain.

review/summary: Subtle yet sweet tortilla adventure...
review/text: What impresses me first off about this brand "food should taste good" is the fact it is an all natural brand.  They do not use preservatives, trans fats, they are gluten free, Certified Kosher, no Genetic modification etc.  What is even better about all that is it sacrifices all the unhealthy without sacrificing flavor.<br /><br />** CHOCOLATE TORTILLA ** (6oz bags) [5 stars]<br />These Tortilla chips I just had to try.. I mean chocolate Tortilla chips!?  Rather then getting an explosion of sweet sugary chocolate you get this nice, soft subtle taste of chocolate with each crunch of the chip.  These clearly aren't meant for salsa and in fact the back of the bag suggested  to sprinkle them in vanilla ice-cream or better yet... warm the chips up slightly to bring out the flavor.  Both suggestions worked great.  In fact I prefer these to chocolate chips in my ice cream and they probably are far healthier<br /><br />The chips are rectangular in shape and are delightful to eat.  They make for a perfect snack or to help enhance an existing snack; or satisfy the chocoholic in you<br /><br />Definitely a 5 star product with 5 star quality taste.<br /><br />** JALAPENO TORTILLA ** (1.5oz bags) [5 stars]<br />The Jalapeno tortilla chips are outstanding!  I'm a fan of spicy food so I had to test these out for myself.  The chips do not smell spicy at all which means they are spiced properly (not overloaded).  Upon first bite you might not taste much but that is when this chip gets you.  Very quickly a subtle jalapeno flavor kicks in with a bit of nice spice that isn't to overpowering.<br /><br />With the added kick of the chips these would go perfect with a nice mild salsa.  The chips are crispy and fresh, with that nice subtle spice lingering on your taste-buds for a good few minutes so a small 1.5oz bag will last you some time and allow you to savor the flavor.

review/summary: A tasty snack for the health conscious
review/text: I am a label reader - I count fat grams, carbs, proteins and grams of fiber vs. grams of sugar. Most foods that advertise themselves as a "healthy" snack are not really all that good for you. Often they are too high in calories or they use products that you just shouldn't eat. This snack food, FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain chips really is a good tasting, good for you snack.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup and no MSG. They contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber. (The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)<br /><br />The chips are delicious. They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip. The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat. I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip. I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out. I tried the Buffalo flavor and they have a very mild kick; much milder than I expected. I still like them, but not as much as the plain.  I really enjoy eating the Multigrain with a little lowfat queso!

review/summary: The Real Thing
review/text: These awesome chips get their flavor from actual jalapeno bits and crushed red peppers.  There is a world of difference between this product and Dorito-type chips that have flavor merely sticking to the surface.  For the health-conscious, these chips have three grams of fiber per serving.  The beet powder gives these chips a red-hot appearance, however they are not too hot.  This product is healthy thanks to the fiber grams, plus it tastes great.  Highly recommended.

They work well with salsa, cheese, dips, and even by themselves. The chips are crispy, have a great texture, and they stand up to thick dips.  Despite being jalapeno, they are not too spicy and not too bland. These are just right. Highly recommend these chips!

review/summary: Good try, but tasted stale
review/text: Looking over the ingredients on the bag, I was pretty impressed.  Whole grains, no processed sugar, etc.  And at 140 calories per bag, not too bad in that respect either.  3 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein isn't too shabby, but with ingredients like quinoa and all the other whole grains, I was a little surprised that it wasn't more.  But maybe I have unreasonable expectations.<br /><br />The only problem was when I stated it.  The chips were hard, and my immediate reaction was that they had gone stale.  They had that 'stale taste' as well, if you know what I mean.  But with the bag just opened that moment, and an expiration date over a year in advance, I'm apt to believe that this is just how they're supposed to be.  The flavor was alright, lightly salty and a little nutty.  But this is probably not the best snack for children, as they will most likely not enjoy the hardness and staleness.

review/summary: FoodDOESTasteGood Multigrain
review/text: These tortilla chips should be renamed to FoodDoesTasteGood!  So many times "healthy" or "good for you" snacks are as flavorless as water.  Good for you, but absolutely boring to the taste buds.  These chips, however break the rules.  No Trans Fat, 0.5% staurated fat. 18g carb, 3g dietary fiber, 2g sugars and 3g protein with only 140 calories per 1 ounce bag w/60 of them from non saturated (good)fats.  Remember, not all fat is bad.  Some fat, like these are needed for digestion and brain function.  The flavor is great.  They are filled with flax seed, whole grains, wheat, but have a crisp, thick feel without grainy flavor.  They have a salty flavor like that of a tortilla, but you don't need a topping or salsa for the flavor.  No itchy lips from to much salt like a regular tortilla and no salsa falling on your clothes!  I eat these just as a quick snack but have served them along with hummus, cheese and veggie sticks for a crowd.  I also toss them into my kids lunch instead of chips or pretzels.  Most of the time they take a couple bags because they share them!  I like the one oz. bags because they tide me over at that 3:00 snack time without letting me indulge with too many.  I've had the Olive and the chocolate, but the multigrain are by far my favorite.  Serve these at your next party, but make sure you have quite a few bags...you will need them.

review/text: I *love* the Multigrain flavor of these chips/crackers!  I especially love the fact that they're only 80 mg of sodium--so I was totally excited to see--under the nutritional info at Amazon--that the olive and jalapeno flavors were also 80 mg of sodium per serving.  So I ordered all three.  Imagine my total shock and dismay to find out that the olive and jalapeno flavors are truly 210 mg of sodium per serving! Just wanted to warn all future buyers--if you must watch your salt for health reasons--stick to the Multigrain ones!

It's not drowning in salt, just enough sea salt to bring out the natural flavors. Honestly they're so good I can't bear to cover them up in any sort of salsa or dip and can't think of any that would both compliment and stay subtle - then again I'm not a huge fan of chips with dips. Just plain chips for me!

review/summary: healthy AND heavenly
review/text: As a weight loss coach, I often talk about quinoa.  The Aztecs called this "the food of the Gods" and it truly is...incredibly healthy and full of vitamins, protein, antioxidants and it's extremely filling. I have gotten many people hooked on it using it as a substitute for rice.  I got these chips (multigrain and the cheddar flavors) simply because I saw good ol' quinoa in the ingredient list but also tons of other good stuff: Stone Ground Yellow Corn, Non-hydrogenated Canola Oil, Brown Rice Flour, Flax Seeds, Turbinado Cane Sugar, Oat Fiber, Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Quinoa, Soy Flour, Sea Salt, real cheese in the cheddar.<br /><br />But having "good" ingredients doesn't often equate to good taste.<br /><br />It does here.  These are addictive.  I typically buy them at Target or Central Market but it's cheaper to get them here with subscribe and save and no taxLove these...and I actually feel GOOD about putting them in my body. A rarity for a snack.  Bring on the cheddar and I'll sign up for auto delivery.  Try em with hummus.<br /><br />Alternatives: I am also equally addicted to barbecue PoPChips...they are also an all natural snack that's low in fat and calories but highly addictive in my opinion.

review/text: As a big fan of sweet potato fries, I was instantly drawn to these chips when I saw them at the grocery store.  I actually bought a few different varieties of Food Should Taste Good chips because I haven't seen them before and they seemed different than other chips.  I'm trying to eat healthier, but not give up all the things I enjoy eating and chips are one of those things.  This particular chip is a great alternative to the normally greesy fried potato chips and they taste just like sweet potatoes.  Apparently they are a combination of sweet potato and corn, but its still good.  Highly recommended as a snacking alternative to regular chips.

review/summary: Guilt free tortilla-chip snacking pleasure
review/text: Are you the type of person that always needs a side bag of chips to accompany their lunchtime sandwich but then feels pangs of guilt afterward for consuming that extra 120-200 trans-fat laden empty calories? If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Multigrain' line of tortilla chips (think of a corn tortilla chip that's tasty yet packed with such whole grain goodness like flax, sunflower and sesame seeds as well as oat fiber, brown rice, quinoa and soy - yes please!) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite. These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself. These chips are tasty enough with the right crisp texture you've come to know and expect from your standard snack tortilla morsel. Great product all around.

review/text: I have order anxiety:  so when I go to order something I usually panic and blurt out something I didn't really want, or in this case, click the ORDER THESE button on these Multigrain things.<br /><br />Fast forward to today... I studied the bag with this description:<br />TORTILLA CHIPS (it's a cracker, too!) MADE WITH<br />Flax, Sunflower, and Sesame Seeds<br />Oat Fiber, Brown Rice<br />Quinoa, Soy<br /><br />We have pavers that look like the cracker on the front of the bag... and I have no idea what quinoa is, but I tried one.  Hmmm kind of like a not so salty corn chip, with a little sesame seed flavor thrown in.  Just enough salt.  Crunchy, and without the stab-the-roof-of-your mouth shards.  Nice mingling of flavors...can't say I know what flax seed tastes like, but I think I like it now!  I like them.  I really like them!!<br /><br />The ingredients list is:  Stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt. Not a bad ingredients list!  For one 1 oz bag, 140 calories, 60 from fat.  And each cracker feels like you are eating something, not like a bite of air in a salt-laden wafer.<br /><br />I could seriously go for more of these now.  They would be fantastic with a slice of mild cheddar or something really different with a creamy artichoke dip.  Lots of possiblities, and still good right out of the bag.  They say they are available at your local supermarket or grocer--really, I am going to get more of these, they are that good!

review/summary: Tastes the way it looks.
review/text: The actual product is exactly what it is described as - a hybrid of a chip and a cracker.  Some pieces tasted more like a cracker and others more like a tortilla chip - either way it was pretty good but I think the saltier pieces were better tasting.  It took a few pieces to get used to the taste and texture since it's really not quite like any other snack I've had.  The pieces are very thin and light like a tortilla chip, but they're also textured and grainy like a cracker.<br /><br />After the first 4 or 5 chips I decided I did like the taste and texture and easily munched down the rest of the bag.  The bag is a small 1 oz of 140 calories and seems to have as many chips as one of those 100-Calorie packs.  This would be a refined alternative to Baked Lays.

review/summary: Average Chip, Good Ingredients.
review/text: Not too bad. It is similar to the stone ground or multigrain chips out there. The smaller size should not fool you because it's still sold by weight. I liked them more for snacking because of this. The smaller size is not as hot for dip or salsa holding. Not too salty, for sure. Had a fairly low sodium content for a chip even.<br /><br />Earthy with a touch of salt is perhaps the best way to describe it.<br /><br />The ingredients are what make this. Simple, nothing crazy or 8 syllables. It is not like eating cardboard or styrofoam, just good stuff. If you've ever made corn chips with rough meal from scratch, this has a similarity in texture and quality.<br /><br />Lastly it arrived nicely packaged from Amazon. I did not have a bag of crumbs but intact chips. Something that is always a plus with products like this.

review/text: Well, the manufactures of the Multigrain, FoodShouldTasteGood, tortilla chip has succeeded in their claim.....this chip does taste good.  The one ounce bags are perfect for on the go and the "mini" version allows the consumer to pop the entire chip in the mouth with no mess.  The packaging looks (dare I say it) more sophisticated and "adult like" so you won't feel embarrassed to tote one around in your brief case (no orange tigers lurking around with artificial colors or flavors).  This blend between a chip and cracker taste quite good all in its own right but it is also great with dips and cheese.  I really enjoyed it and hoped the kids would hate it so that I'd have more for myself.....sadly, not the case.  This multigrain chip was a hit.

review/summary: Delicious and healthy tortilla chips
review/text: I have been on a quest for a number of years now to eat foods that provide good nourishment to my body without sacrificing taste and satisfaction.  I immediately loved these chips when I tried them -- sometimes "healthy" foods have to grow on you, but not so with these chips.  They come in a nice little pentagon shape, and there are about 16 chips in the bag, which is just right for a snack or to combine with a sandwich for lunch.  If you are watching your calories and fat, it is great that they list the nutritional information for the whole bag and not for 1/2 bag like some companies do.  All the ingredients in these chips are ones that you see on those lists of "healthy foods you should be eating."  All the flavors meld together to make a really nice, rich flavor that is ever-so-slightly sweet, and you get a light taste of flax and sesame seeds.<br /><br />I compared the label with Doritos Toasted Corn Tortilla Chips, and these Multigrain Chips have 3 times the fiber, 2/3 the sodium, 1/2 the saturated fat, and of course the much healthier ingredients, with no trans fats.<br /><br />These are the best chips of the many I have tried that use healthy ingredients, and I'll be definitely ordering more of them.

review/summary: great chips in single serving size
review/text: These chips are my favorites! They're great with guacamole or just by themselves. I love the single serving size bags & I haven't found them anywhere else but Amazon. It's a big enough serving to share, but I don't feel too guilty if I eat the whole bag.

review/summary: Amazing taste!
review/text: I purchased these chips because I love sweet potato chips in general, but these far surpass the taste of your ordinary sweet potato chip. These are crisp and crunchy and not as sweet as the standard variety. That they are kosher, trans fat free, and gluten free are an added bonus. The 1.5 oz. bags are perfect for an afternoon snack, and only around 200 calories. I love them so much I now have Amazon ship a case every month.

review/summary: Great gluten free chips!
review/text: My 12 year old daughter who has celiac loves these chips.  When we frist tried them at a friend's house we weren't sure if we would like them being made from sweet potatos.  Boy were we wrong.  We could eat a whole bag in one day.  They are addiciting.  Thankfully we found them in the individual packs for school on amazon.  They are expensive but it was worth the price to see my daughter happy about having to take her food to school.

review/text: These haven't been available at the stores near here, so I took a chance ordering them. I'm glad I did. When I just want a little chocolate flavor, this is a crunchy and tasty alternative. And they're really good with peanut butter sandwiches--just sweet enough but not overpowering.

review/text: I am on a gluten free diet, as are many members of my family.  This sweet potato chip is so tasty, we use it with many tasty sandwich fillers.  Eggs salad, tuna salad, avocado and so on.  I sent a case of them to my daughter and her family, and they also love them.<br /><br />I will keep a case in my pantry as a staple.  Excellent.

review/summary: Celiac sufferers--try these!
review/text: These have a nice mild olive flavor. It makes the tortilla chip more savory and slightly complex instead if just bland corn and salt. I don't even really like olives and I really like these chips. I love that they are gluten and soy free so I can eat them without worry of an allergic reaction!

review/summary: A Great change from other chips -- Tasty and Healthy
review/text: Like another reviewer, I've had sweet potato fries at a restaurant and thought they were great.  My boss says that sweet potatoes are actually better then regular ones for people trying to watch their sugar levels.<br /><br />These chips taste great, with just the right amount of saltiness and sweetness, yet have a small amount of sodium (which is good).  They don't seem greasy either.<br /><br />So far I've had them plain, but I'm sure they'd totally rock with some Pineapple Peach salsa (my favorite salsa from Super Target grocery stores :-) .

review/summary: Amazing flavorful chip!
review/text: I saw these on display at my supermarket and tried them on a whim.  Boy am I glad I did!  They are spicy and flavorful.  I would describe them as a medium hot; the heat kicks in after you've eaten a few, but it's not too hot.  They are so excellent with just plain sour cream -- it's hard to stop!  They are also sturdy enough and big enough to use as a cracker if you want to top them with cheese slices or relishes.<br /><br />Buying a case on Amazon saved me $1.00 per bag compared to the grocery store.  And, thank you Amazon for placing the case inside of another box before shipping.  They arrived in perfect condition -- no crumbs!  I think I'll go have some more...

review/summary: Real chocolate and sweet/salty addictiveness
review/text: How could a chip get better than the Food Should Taste Good chips? I love the distinct, natural flavor that's built into the chip, balanced with the perfect amount of sea salt sprinkled on the outside.<br />These are whole-grain, high-quality, no-junk, full-o'-flavor...and the bag looks stylish, besides.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Easy to eat the whole bag - but you actually feel OK even if you do (woops). (I had no sugar rush, only a very slight chocolate rush, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.)<br /><br />Seal of approval from Lovejoy Fitness -- http://lovejoyfitness.com.

review/text: AMAZING chips.  I picked them up at Whole Paycheck, and as soon as I'd had a few, I ran to Amazon to see if I could buy them by the carton!<br /><br />I believe I have never tasted a better chip of any sort.<br /><br />They're lighter and crisper than the usual kinds of tortilla chips that come in brown paper bags, and they have the taste of olive oil, black pepper, salt and olives.<br /><br />I ate them right out of the bag, but I could see them working well with some kinds of pate or hummus, too.<br /><br />The main down side:  one 6oz bag contains 840 calories, and they're quite addicting.

I love them with a thin slice of Colby.<br /><br />Last but not least these healthy chips contain flax, Sunflower,oat fiber and brown rice. One small one ounce package contains 11% od dietary fiber.<br /><br />They are delicious and very satisfying and I recommend them highly.

review/summary: YUM, Chips...!
review/text: Not optimistic about the taste of healthy chips I was expecting these to taste roughly like chewing a cardboard box. Boy was I surprised and delighted! These chips taste like a cross between a salty Frito and Sun Chips. With no trans fat, no cholesterol, no crazy preservatives to make them look good after months on the shelf. And even though they taste so yummily salty there's only 80 mg of sodium. Compare that to your average chip! I'd definitly eat these again.

review/summary: Tasty Snack
review/text: I am munching on these chips as I type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. I like the way they taste. The flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. There's a nice nutty aftertaste. I like texture, too. Just the right amount of crunch.  These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.<br /><br />One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.<br /><br />My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well.
