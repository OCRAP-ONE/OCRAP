review/summary: Delicious Cotton Candy in a Bag!
review/text: I bought this 12 pack of 2.5 Charms Cotton Candy for Christmas stocking stuffers. It arrived fresh and flavorful. I couldn't resist eating one of the bags right away. The 2.5 ounce bags contained a good sized portion of cotton candy. You have to be careful when you order this though. I almost purchased the 1 ounce bags of the same product at a higher price! Make sure that you are ordering the larger bags.<br /><br />The cotton candy comes in big fluffy balls inside the bag. Each cotton candy ball is a different color. It looks like you are about to eat a rainbow. The kids loved eating this colorful and fun treat on Christmas morning! It tastes just like the stuff you get at the county fair. It's nice to be able to enjoy this in the middle of winter.<br /><br />The bags of cotton candy were packaged in a nice durable box (inside the regular shipping box) to keep them from getting crushed during the delivery.<br /><br />This is a great price for these delicious bags of cotton candy. I hope Amazon keeps selling them in the larger bags.

review/summary: Salt lick!
review/text: We bought and returned this to Whole Foods for $5.49.  This spice has very little flavor other than salt.  We got it b/c it mentioned ginger and nutmeg, but we would have been much better off going to the spice section and just buying nutmeg and ginger b/c this turned our beautiful Bell and Evans chicken breast into salt sticks.  I had to get Bulls Eye BBQ sauce just to attempt to damp down the salt lavor in this spice.

review/summary: Shame D'aim
review/text: My neighbor turned me on to this delicious chocolate/toffee candy and so we went looking for it on the internet.  When we found it, we ordered four bags.  The quality of the candy in the first bag was disappointing.  It tastes all right, but the chocolate has begun to de-mulsify and has a white-ish, powdery look that gives it an unapetizing look.  I wanted to put them out in a bowl for Christmas guests, but I'm afraid that many would-be consumers would think it spoiled and would not eat it.  I'm keeping it in my private stash.  I have seen this before in either old product or product that has been exposed to excessive heat and then recooled.  My friend took two of the bags over to his house and I haven't discussed the quality of those bags with him, so I don't know if his bags contain the same degraded contents.  I'm assuming that all four bags will have similar content.  The price for this candy is in the premium range, so the value is not present, considering the degradation of the candy.  I will not be ordering from this site, again.

review/summary: This Chocolate Yum!
review/text: I first had this candy when I bought a bag of it while I was in Denmark.  I thought it was Danish chocolate but later found out it was from Sweden.  I shared it with the entire tour bus of friends on our trip and everyone loved it.  I bought a small bag first and then a large bag at the Copenhagen airport because I didn't think it would be available when I got back to the U.S.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found it on Amazon because now I can have it whenever I want!

review/text: Although these are great, as far as taste and lightness are concerned, I will never order them through Amazon again. I placed an order for several cans because they are not available in the area where I recently moved. Upon opening the first can I was thoroughly disappointed to find the contents to be broken into little pieces. Not one of the cans had any piece more than 1 1/2 inch long. Most of the pieces were under 1 inch. Unless you intend to use them as a crumb topping for ice cream or something similar, don't order them thru Amazon.

review/summary: Fabulous!
review/text: I had only previously tried the hazelnut ones in the Pirouline wafers, but since I adore dark chocolate, I thought I would purchase these dark chocolate filled ones for a new taste treat. They arrived today and I'm just so very pleased with them! Since I've gotten many tins in the store that contained a lot of broken pieces, I worried that these would be likewise crumbled and broken, especially after going through the mail. However, all of the tins were in perfect undented condition ( purchased directly from Amazon.com ) in a "Ready-To-Ship" box, tucked inside another box with plastic bubbles padding it, and the tin I opened to try held absolutely no broken cookie wafers whatever..not a one!<br /><br />The taste is just wonderful, too, and the familiar flakey crisp of the wafer roll is simply perfect, but I was particularly pleased with the really rich semi-solid ( but still soft ) deep dark chocolate filling! They are to die for, just eaten alone, or dunked in your coffee. Since I have 6 tins now, I can easily share one with my sons or a friend, if I can bring myself to part with a tin, that is!

The ingredients include grill-marked onions and corn, big hearty chunks of potato, some black beans, and a little tomato. The stock has some olive oil but it's not overly greasy and actually quiet light.  Overall, a great vegan soup option.

review/summary: Best vegetable soup!!
review/text: This is the best vegetable soup I have ever consumed.  I eat soup EVERY DAY for lunch because I am trying to lose weight.  This means that I have to pass up the yummy fattening soup like Wolfgang Puck's potato (YUMMY) but this soup is a fully satisfying substitute.  It is low in fat and calories (The whole can has 9 grams of fat (probably mostly from the olive oil) and just under 300 calories) and it tastes GREAT.  Other reviewers have mentioned the dented cans.  Since we eat so much soup, we buy exclusively from amazon because of the price. We have recently encountered the dented can problem (not only from this product, but other canned items as well: chili, fruit, etc) but the occurence of the dents versus the number of items purchase is minimal. All in all this soup is a GREAT product.  I give it four out five stars because of the dent issue, even though we still buy this product quite frequently.<br /><br />If you are looking for other good tasting soup from Amy's some of my other favorites are as follows:  Light Sodium Chunky Tomato Bisque, Curried Lentil, and Black Bean Vegetable.  Hope this helps

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice southwestern style soup. Goes well with organic tortilla chips and any of your other favorite Border-style foods.  Prominent black pepper and chipotle flavor notes with yummy pieces of fire roasted veggies in a flavor rich broth. Approx. 280 kcal, 8g protein, and 9g fat per can. Add more of your favorite beans or cubed tofu for even more protein.

review/summary: Great Product/Price if you dont mind all of the cans being Dented
review/text: Ive enjoyed this product for some time now and decided to get it a bit cheaper from Amazon than from my grocery here in NY. Apparently they offer the cheaper price since all of the cans are dented, which is not from shipping. Cans in the middle are also dented. Every last one. Would be 4-5 stars if not for this. Ive read articles relating to health risks posed by dented cans, even if not fully punctured.

review/summary: bizarre burning aftertaste
review/text: I remember once cooking a can of beans over charcoal before letting all the lighter fluid burn off. There was an odd aftertaste and burning in the roof of my mouth that gave me no illusion that i was eating some uncombusted lighter fluid.<br /><br />I get this feeling here, there's a burning in the roof of my mouth but not my tongue. Maybe I'm just imagining things, but I'm not getting any more of these.<br /><br />I got this at a supermarket. I eat a lot of amys. I recommend french country vegetable, italian vegetable, low sodium lentil vegetable, no chicken noodle.. pretty much anything with the word 'vegetable' in the title have the best flavor, except for this.

review/summary: Nice and Spicy Organic Vegan soup
review/text: I love the fire-roasted taste of the vegetables. I'm a raw vegan during the day, and this soup definitely gives me the cooked food fullness that I look for during my evening meal. If the taste is too spicy for you, try the new French Country Vegetable - it's not in every store yet and I don't see it on Amazon either, so if you see it in a local store grab a can and try it.

review/summary: A soup with lots of veggies but the smokiness is a bit too much for me
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Amy's products and was excited to try Amy's Organic Fire Roasted Southwest Vegetable Soup. Like most of the Amy's line, the manufacturer does not skimp on the important ingredients.  This soup is chock full of vegetables. It is thick and has a nice texture and vegetable diversity. While the soup is heavy on vegetables and lighter on broth, the broth that is in the soup is somewhat oily. (This tends to be an issue with many Amy's soups save their chili options and a couple of pureed vegetable options).<br /><br />So why the three stars?  It comes down to personal preference.  My problem with the soup is attributable to one ingredient and that is the chipotle pepper. Chipotle pepper can add a smokey component to foods and it was definitely present with the Fire Roasted Southwest Vegetable.  I had hoped that the chipotle essence would be subdued given its low spot on the ingredient list, but it wasn't.<br /><br />This is a filling soup and when paired with a slice of crusty bread, you have a meal.  Adding some brown rice would yield an even more filling soup for the more hearty appetite.  I did not find the soup to be hot but for reference I eat a lot of spicy Indian curries.<br /><br />This is a vegan product.<br /><br />Ingredients: Filtered water, organic tomatoes, organic roasted potatoes, organic fire roasted corn, organic black beans, organic fire roasted onions, organic carrots, organic fire roasted bell peppers, organic celery, organic green chilies, organic extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, chipotle peppers, spices, organic black pepper, organic onions, organic balsamic vinegar.<br /><br />I purchase Amy's Kitchen soups at my local co-op for about 2.50 a can.  If your store does not carry this and you only want to try one can, consider iherb.com.  You can use my code LEK375 for a discount.

review/summary: Surprised by the wonderful flavor of Amy's Southwestern Vegetable Soup
review/text: I'm fairly discriminating about what I consider a praiseworthy vegetable soup.  I happened upon this one in the organic section of the supermarket & was pleasantly surprised with the flavor & spice.  Not overpowering but spiced enough to give the soup & its mixed flavors a standing ovation.  Not many 'canned' soups can taste homemade while still maintaining its flavors.  Bottom line?  A random soup pick has made an enthusiastic customer out of me.  I'm hoping Amy's other soups can live up to this introduction...I'll find out when grocery shopping on our return trip.

review/summary: The best soup I have ever had!!!
review/text: I was so scared to try this soup, I didnt want to feel bloated like I usually do after eating soups.  This didnt leave me feeling bloated at all, but instead satisfied.  It is the best soup that I have ever consumed, and I am telling the truth, THE BEST EVER!!!  You will not be dissapointed with this soup, the vegetables are actally fire roasted.  When I opened the can I saw vegetables with grill marks, it was fantastic.  I love many amy's products but have only ever had her frozen meals.  I love this soup and it makes me want to try her other vegan soups.  There is just the right amount of spice and flavor to this soup that makes it mind blowing perfect.  Its not too spicy but not lacking in the spice area either.  The chunks of potatos are big and you actually know what you are eating.  Everything is organic and no GMO's.  I am going to buy more:D

review/summary: Flavorful canned soup - imagine!
review/text: As a gourmand, I generally rank canned soup somewhere between "an old shoe" and "wet cardboard" on the list of things I'd prefer not to eat.  A recent renovation left me temporarily kitchenless and at the mercy of the packaged food aisle, where I opted for the organics hoping for a slightly less appalling<br />palate experience.  While the rest of the Amy's soup series was a slightly uneven affair, the roasted vegetable, to my great relief, proved highly edible.  Like any processed food, it benefits greatly from a little doctoring - fresh lime zest, chopped cilantro, creme fraiche or any combination thereof introduce fresh notes that nicely complement the smoky overtones of this soup, and elevate a decent comestible to a quite fine one.  A few spoonfuls of leftover rice, quinoa, small pasta, baked tofu, etc tossed in can add substance, and easily stretch a can to 2 generous servings.  If you're going to keep some canned soup on hand for those too-tired-to-cook winter evenings, it should be this one.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Buyer Beware - good soup, crushed cans
review/text: A very nutritrious and delicious soup from Amy's not offered in the organic sections of grocery stores in my area of the U.S. But about a quarter of the cans in the case were dented, and therefore, not acceptable for long term storage.<br /> I wouldn't buy a dented can from a store, and therefore am dismayed that Amazon would ship damaged goods.<br /> If Amazon is getting a good price on this product because the cans are dented already, the product should be advertized as such. I don't like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What's up with that?<br /> I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.<br /> It is not worth my time to complain and return.<br /> But I won't buy Amy's soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right -  considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.<br /> Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy. It's not a "deal" if you send me damaged goods.

review/summary: delicious New England-style baked beans!!!
review/text: We absolutely love these traditional baked beans -- either this lovely molasses version, or the original version. My husband loves them enough to eat them cold out of the can, so he'll take them to work for lunch or sometimes have a late night snack (usually in the single-serving versions -- at least better for him than potato chips or candy bars!). We also use them as a side dish for pork and sauerkraut meals. In addition to just microwaving them in a bowl (or eating them out of the can!), here are 3 other great ways to cook them:<br /><br />1) Put in an ovenproof dish and bake alongside anything else in your oven. They'll only get better. We put pork and sauerkraut in one open dish and these in another and leave them both in a 400 degree oven for about 50 minutes with excellent results (try putting sliced sweet onions misted with a little olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper into a third dish for an awesome vegetable side!).<br /><br />2) If you cook pork chops, hot dogs, sliced ham or kielbasa in a skillet, add these beans to the skillet around the pork and let the flavors mix as both are browned and heated.<br /><br />3) To feed a crowd, heat contents in a slow-cooker, add your choice of flavorings (onions, celery, carrots, brown sugar, mustard, ketchup, garlic, diced tomatoes, etc.) and/or meat (chunks of ham, hot dogs, kielbasa, whatever), and bring on the hungry hordes! Can leave on keep-warm in the slow cooker literally for days -- great for feeding a work crew that's cleaning up storm damage or running a charity event.<br /><br />B&M is a famous maker of baked beans, very hard to find these days, and we're thrilled to be able to obtain their products through Amazon.  An old family favorite.  Hope you like them as much as we do.

review/summary: Not as Advertised
review/text: I ordered these beans, but the ones I received were B&M Homestyle. They do not taste the same! My family does not like the Homestyle variety. This has happened twice -- the first time I thought it was a mistake and let it go. After we tried them, however, we donated the remainder to a food pantry which is probably what I will do with these too (non-returnable due to being a food item). I think that B&M may have consolidated their line and doesn't offer both anymore, but the Amazon product descrition is misleading in any case. Just because my family didn't like the flavor though, yours might. In general we love B&M products and living in Arizona, they are hard to find, so finding them on Amazon is a bonus.

review/text: When I was little, this was always the syrup that my Grandma had when we were at her house.  I hadn't had the Karo syrup in easily more than 20 years, so it brought back a lot of memories!  Wish it was still sold in stores around here...  very tasty!

review/summary: Karo pancake syrup
review/text: Very, very fast shipping. Very, very good product as well! This pancake syrup, from Karo; is rich with flavor and is thick compared to most pancake syrups. It has the best flavor of any pancake syrup that I have ever seen! Unlike most pancake syrups out there, Karo can be used for various recipes as well. (Sticky bun recipe on label for the ones I recieved.) Although you have to buy a case (6 bottles @ 16 oz.), it has a long, long shelf life (mine don't expire till Sept. 2014). I like to mix it with butter for a bisquit. It's listed serving size is: 4 Tbsp./ 1/4 cup, with 240 calories, 85 mg of sodium, total carbohydrate 63g, and 25 g. of sugar. We personally don't use but about 1/2 that much at any one time. Hard to find here, but there is nothing that can match it for flavor or value, to me!

review/summary: Karo Pancake Syrup-It's a southern thang!
review/text: I had received damaged bottles and had written a review complaining about the tops being cracked. I received a call quickly from customer service and 4 new bottles as compensation. They were prompt and I am extremely pleased with the outcome. I love this syrup and can't seem to find it anymore. I gave some to my mother also, as she loves it, too! Maybe it's a southern thing but it makes the recipes just taste better. There is not substitute!

review/summary: Best Father's Day Gift
review/text: My husband grew up on this syrup and has to have it on pancakes, waffles, biscuits, etc. He has been complaining ever since we moved out West that they don't sell it.  I think this syrup helped make this "The best father's day I ever had."  I first I was taken aback by having to order so much but with 3/4 of the bottle already gone, I don't think I'll have to worry about the remaining 5 getting stale.  It was well worth the price and the shipping was very fast.  I would definitely recommend this seller again.

review/summary: A Dentist Recommends This Product
review/text: As a dentist I see many patients that have dry mouth as a result of medication use or due to cancer radiation therapy of the head and neck area.  I ALWAYS RECOMMEND BIOTENE CHEWING GUM FOR THESE PATIENTS.  Biotene is a biocompatible gum that has natural salivary enzymes that help remove plaque from the teeth.  Gum chewing also stimulates saliva release and any natural saliva that can be produced is of benefit.<br /><br />This is a great product for those with dry mouths and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Jim "Konedog" Koenig, DDS

review/summary: Dry mouth patient reviews Biotene gum.
review/text: I like chewing gum for my dry mouth, but Biotene is not my favorite: it is expensive, hard to find, and, in my opinion, not any better than many traditional chewing gums.  You have to chew two and a time, and that costs about $.20 per use at the listed price, not including shipping. The gum is boring and small and doesn't retain flavor or the texture I like, so I don't chew it very long when I use it. I don't like hard gums like Dentine or bubble gum; I usually use a soft sugar free gum like Extra.  It's cheap and comes in lots of flavors and stimulates saliva flow. I'm not a big chewer, I mostly suck on it, or let it sit in my mouth.  Biotene may be better in terms of mildness, but I love flavored gum, and am not willing to shell out so much to keep buying Biotene gum. (I do like Biotene toothpaste , though.)

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: I have to start a course of chemotherapy; and my dentist recommended this gum to me to chew during the months I am on chemo. I am impressed with this gum because of its way of using natural enzyme protection to relieve dry mouth and protect your teeth from decay during cancer treatment.<br /><br />Oh yes, it's true--the gum loses it mild mint flavor pretty quickly--after just about a minute! However, if you want to protect your mouth during chemo, it certainly couldn't hurt to at least chew this gum some of the time. It beats getting cavities. At 44 I still have no cavities and I'm not about to start now!<br /><br />You do need to chew two pieces of this gum at the same time. One piece will be too small and you could accidentally swallow it, I suppose.<br /><br />The two pieces of gum have a total of five calories, so don't be concerned about that. It is sweetened with xylitol.<br /><br />Overall, this gum can save you from dry mouth and tooth decay during a course of cancer therapy such as chemo. It may work well if you need radiation therapy, too. It's not a fun type of bubble gum, (how I wish that it were) but it does what it sets out to do--protect your mouth from decay during a course of chemo treatment.<br /><br />Ask your dentist if you have any questions.

Nutella is for eating toast while reading "Remebrance Of Things Past" or "Dracula".  Rather luscious.  Like Marmite, Nutella goes a lot farther than the prescribed serving size.  Spread thinly.  Now, my children, go out and turn your whole wheat toast into a chocolate doughnut.  Marcel Proust would want you to.

When I had almost lost all hope...I tried Nutella.<br /><br />  I have found while using Nutella is that it is a great grab and go meal. Plus it is a delicious and nutritious. It is also great for any time of day.<br /><br />  Nutella is sold in a clear plastic jar, with a white lid and label. It comes in many different sized jars from small to go sizes to large peanut butter sized jars. But for the actual product inside the jar, their lives a rich, creamy, chocolaty, hazelnut spread. Its consistency is  similar to peanut butter, so it is great on toast and bagels.<br /><br />  If you are someone who is allergic to nuts, you should stay away from this product, because it contains nuts. But if you are someone who is nutty for chocolate and hazelnut, you are in the right place.<br /><br />Nutella is a long lasting product. After opening it, it can last for weeks to months before it goes bad.  It's fast, it's easy and it is a great way to start your day.<br /><br />The only negative I have to say about Nutella is, that it is messy. But it is because chocolate in general is messy.<br /><br />But overall I am very impressed with the convenience of  Nutella. It's the best breakfast spread out there so go get your Nutella and enjoy!

review/text: From time to time my wife brings home a jar of Nutella. I like it, but only on rare occasion. The flavor is just too overpowering for me and I tire of it quickly. My wife loves the stuff on bread (toast) or crackers and she eats it with her afternoon or evening tea. She raves about the chocolatey-nutty flavor and can't understand why I don't see things the same way. Such is life. In any case, if it pleases her, I'm happy with it. Oh, I might add that the baby seems to like it too. That's two out of three.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: A chocoholic's dream come true!
review/text: I know the description talks more about nuts, etc., but this stuff is actually seriously CHOCOLATE!  It's a creamy fudgy chocolate spread with a hazelnut flavor (think fudge spiked with hazelnut liqueur).  It's incredibly rich -- a little really goes a long way.  I usually just spread it on graham crackers for a wonderful indulgent treat.<br /><br />I'm hooked -- this will be in my pantry from now on.  (No refrigeration necessary -- how convenient is that?)
