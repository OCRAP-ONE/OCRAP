review/summary: Putrid!
review/text: Please, please, please, do not listen to anyone who claims this is a decent product.  I have tried all sorts of foods designed to cut fat/calories, etc.  This is by far the worst I have ever experienced.  My wife and I could not believe this stuff was even marketable.  Seriously, a lot of folks hate fat-free mayo or fat free ranch dressing.  This is 1000 times beyond those items in terms of terrible!  I even tried to get my dachshunds to sample it; they wouldn't!  And they eat everything!  It's like a plastic goo!  We threw it all away.  We had low expectations when we bought this.  But it was so much worse than we could imagine.  Beware!  Save yourself some money.  Spread face cream on a slice of bread.  It will taste better!  Ooof!

review/summary: Not a bad way to cut one's calorie intake
review/text: The texture is definitely what the product calls itself - a spread.  Not creamy like a regular peanut butter, but not entirely disgusting either.  As far as taste, I would say it is very similar to peanut brittle, just enough peanut flavor and very sweet.  Definitely a good side for sliced apple pieces or other fruit.  For use in sandwiches, I would agree with the other reviewers who suggest mixing this with a tablespoon of regular or even low fat peanut butter just to bump the taste up a bit and add a creamier texture to it.  We did this for my wife, who is very particular about what she eats and she had no complaints about using this to cut her calories in half.  Overall I give it a 3 for taste a 3 for texture and a 5 for effort. This is definitely a product that begs to be experimented with in many different recipes.

Truly unusable as a food, regardless of how similar it may or may not be to peanut butter (not very similar, by the way - general taste profile, density and mouthfeel are all wildly off-base - only aroma seems to match).

review/text: I didn't buy this expecting it to taste anything like peanut butter. All I wanted was peanut flavor. That's all. What I got was the single most awful thing I've ever eaten. I bought my jar from Sprouts, but they sell it in a lot of places. My local Albertson's stocks it. If you are hell-bent on trying it, at least don't pay for shipping. That way it hurts less when you throw it out.

review/summary: Blech
review/text: I have issues with portion control when it comes to peanut butter, so I thought the was the perfect solution.  Yes, I read the bad reviews but thought just how bad can it be?  Well, let me tell you this stuff is BAD!  I didn't want to throw it out so I tried mixing it in plain Greek yogurt.  That was a cruel thing to do to the yogurt.  It takes a lot for me to dislike something enough to throw it away, but this stuff was inedible.<br /><br />Now with that said, I also bought the apricot and strawberry jellies and they were good!  I tried mixing that peanut spread with the jelly and that was bad.  Jelly good!  Peanut spread bad.  No way around it.<br /><br />But in the end, I think I rather stick will real whole foods, not processed products.  That's what I get for looking for a short cut.

review/text: I don't think my expectations for this product were too high. I've had my fair share of diet foods, and especially Walden Farms foods, some of which I absolutely love. This product is not one of them.<br /><br />The texture is something like jello, and the taste is terrible. It's sweet and has a vague peanut taste, but the peanut taste is more of a background flavor. Most of the flavor is occupied by whatever disgusting taste this failed chemistry experiment has combined to make.

review/text: My daughter and I are on low carb diets.  She purchased this product as an alternative to peanut butter.  Don't make the same mistake.  It is unfortunate we cannot assign a negative number of stars.  She sadly bought the Peanut Butter Raisin variety as well.  I hate raisins, and I'm not stupid, so I didn't make the mistake of trying that one.<br /><br />This jar of congealed chemical matter is, by far, the most disgusting thing to ever have passed my lips.  On the plus side, it has no carbs, no calories, no fat, but it also has no protein, peanuts, or nutritional value of any kind.  It does have sodium.  I can only describe it as peanut flavored fluff.  No, not fluff, more like the gel-like substance in an air freshener.  I don't know what's worse, the flavor or the consistency.  To be labelled Walden Farms is purely scandalous.  It indicates to me that some ingredient within was perhaps in the vicinity of an actual farm.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say about this is, it will be fun to see the expressions on our friends' faces when we get them to taste it.

review/text: This stuff is the worst.  It tasted like chemicals not peanut butter. I didn't want to waste it so I mixed it with some sugar and flour and cocoa powder to make some "chocolate, peanut butter" cookies.  They were not good either but after I frosted them they were passable.  Sort of defeats the purpose of a calorie free spread.  If I didn't have to pay for shipping (bought the peanut butter product at walmart) I would try the other products mentioned by the others that reviewed this product in a similar light- at least I know you all still have your taste buds.  As for the others that gave this high marks, I'm not not sure but I think you should see a doctor as there could be something wrong with your mouth.

Walden Farms makes some excellent products but they fell flat on their butts with this one.  The putrid taste is indescribable!  I'd say it probably tastes similar to melted saran wrap.  Ugh!!

I can't believe a company would actually produce something so horrendous and take consumers hard earned money for it. I paid $4.99 for it and threw it away after I spit out what was in my mouth.  Shame on you Walden Farms for selling this under the pretense of peanut butter. Even more so, for thinking it to be edible.

Why does it have to be that sweet? It's like they didn't even taste test before this was put on the market. Was this a joke on the consumer or what? I mean it is THAT bad. I told myself I'd eat it because I hate throwing food away, but even opening the jar makes me gag when that awful smell hits my nostrils. What a waste of money. I bought mine at the store, not through amazon, but seeing the other reviews on here, it's going to be terrible either way. I don't normally complain about food but man, this is the worst thing I have ever eaten. I hope there are better alternatives to peanut butter out there than this.

review/summary: Worst. Food. Ever.
review/text: I have heard of Walden Farms products for a while now but hadn't had an opportunity to try anything until recently.  If I had to judge Walden Farms based on this one product, I would have to say they deserve to be closed down...this peanut spread was the weirdest, grossest thing I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to eat!  I'm an adventurous eater and this now tops my list of top five worst things I've ever eaten...the smell is similar to peanut butter, with plastic thrown in.  The texture is a cross between pudding and shaving cream and is slightly rubbery in appearance.  The taste...well, I can't come up with an accurate description of the taste, but I will say there was NO peanut flavor and the after-taste of splenda/sugar substitute is unpleasant and lingers for hours (or until you brush your teeth until your gums hurt).  The rubbery appearance translates into a rubbery texture (and I swear it tasted rubbery too) that melts into bread once you spread it...it soaked into my bread and turned my bread to rubber...no amount of jelly made it work.  I made two sandwiches with it and will not harm the bread with it again!  This product has to be the worst ever made...AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS AND CONSIDER YOURSELF SMARTER THAN ME!!!

review/summary: Incredibly awful
review/text: I am the queen of alternate, reduced-calorie foods, with an affinity for diet sodas, Splenda sweetener and everything substitutional.  This being the case, I have developed a taste for the artificial.  But even I cannot bear the flavor (and attributing the word flavor is being kind) of this product.  There isn't even a hint of peanut taste.  I took one spoonful and had to spit it right back out.  Even went so far as to try to re-flavor the product with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar-free maple syrup.  Nothing... absolutely nothing... will make this product edible.  Do not waste your money.  Try PB2 powdered peanut butter instead.  45 calories for 2 tablespoons, but tastes even better than full-fat peanut butter.

review/summary: If I could give it 0 stars, I would.
review/text: I saw this on the shelf at my local grocery store and thought, "What a brilliant idea!" I love peanut butter, and the thought of consuming more than a few spoonfuls of the stuff was enough to make me purchase it. Upon opening the jar, I was met by a wobbling mass of glutinous, jelly-like stuff. I dipped a spoon in, stirred it up, and introduced a generous dollop into my mouth. My reaction: BLECHHHHH! The "peanut spread" did not make it down my throat, but the aftertaste stuck with me for hours. I use Splenda frequently in my tea and cereal, but oh lord, this stuff is DISGUSTING. It went straight into the trash can. What a waste of $4.

review/summary: JUST PLAIN NASTY
review/text: I love Walden Farms.  I order their salad dressings and syrups in quantity and gladly pay the shipping for the priviledge.  The other day I was in HEB and experienced great joy to see that they carried almost all of the dressings and several fruit spreads.  Then, I saw the peanut butter.  I knew they made one and looked forward to trying it someday.<br /><br />Based on the quality of their other products (which I have been using for over a year now), I bought 2 jars.  Well,  I just opened the first one... revulsion on all levels.  The color- while a color in nature, not the color of something I want to eat.  The smell- sweet in a chemical way.  The texture- what texture?  I tasted it. YUCK.  Tried again... more YUCK.<br /><br />The product does not remotely smack of peanuts or any other nut for that matter.  This from a person who is NOT picky.<br /><br />Happily, the jars are glass and therefore reusable for other more worthy items.  I am going to try P2B instead if I find myself craving peanut butter to the necessary degree.  I am think I am off PB now!<br /><br />BTW- I am being KIND in this review...

review/summary: Great alternative for those who truely need it
review/text: First of all, I did read some of the reviews.  I have to say most of you are buying this product for the wrong reasons.  No one should be on a 500 calorie diet.  1200 is the min.  This is not a product to "lose weight".  There are other products you can use of real peanut butter for that.  This product is designed for those of us who have restrictions due to diabeties or gluten related issues.  I have to watch my carbs and sugars very carefully and saw this as a great alternative on a diabetic store sight.  I tried it with the grape spread.  The two together are not bad.  On bread, it is alot like a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich.  But without the carbs, sugars and fat associated with it.  The taste is not bad, it is actually alot like a whipped mousse.  The grape spread was good with it.  Will I buy it again?  Probably, unless I find something the same that is better.<br />Do not always follow the reviews, most people have too high of expectations when they buy foods like these.  If you truely needed it because of health issues, you would be saying thank you's to this product.

review/text: I do really enjoy many of the Walden Farm products, but this product taste really terrible in my opinion.  I am not a picky eater, but this product doesn't even taste like food.  The smell, texture, and taste are so way off, it's almost impossible to describe.  It's definitely a very artificial flavor, which wouldn't be so bad if it tasted in anyway like peanuts, but it doesn't even remotely taste like a nut of any kind. I tried mixing it with other things to mask the flavor, because most Walden Farm products don't taste great on their own, but are good mixed with the right foods. That didn't make it any more palatable, it just ruined whatever I mixed it with. Just know that you are taking a chance buying this product, you will either really like it or end up throw it in the trash like I did.

review/text: Walden Farms peanut spread is not going to displace Peter Pan or Jif any time soon but for someone who is on an extremely limited low fat diet (due to medical condition) or who is minimizing fat intake for whatever reason, this can provide a helpful substitute for a traditional comfort food.  Works well with jam or jelly for a PBJ, dip (or spread on) a banana, top some fat-free, sugar free ice cream with this, spread between two crackers.<br /><br />I have been known to add a sprinkle of Grape-Nuts when making a sandwich - makes it "crunchy" style :-)<br /><br />Not for everyone but a great alternative in my book.

review/summary: Minority Opinion - But I LOVE This Spread
review/text: I discovered this great product about several months ago and since then have consumed a jar or two of it every month. I love it and order it by the case now. I use it almost daily, and sometimes more than once a day. It isn't peanut butter but it has a nutty taste and mixed with some of the Walden fruit spreads (raspberry, strawberry and apple seem to work best) it makes a great peanut butter/jelly taste to use on crackers, bread, etc. The consistency is pretty firm although not as thick as regular peanut butter it's perfectly acceptable (to me). The color is fine a bit darker than regular peanut butter (not that you can taste color - but it does influence people's opinion). I rarely take the time to write product reviews and was shocked when I came here to look for another Walden product to find that so many people had left negative reviews of this product and felt compelled to leave a more positive opinion. I think if you like Diet Coke and understand that it's not regular Coke than you will understand this product isn't Peanut Butter but just as Diet Coke is a good substitute for Coke and saves you about 200 calories a serving that this "Peanut Spread" is a good alternative to regular peanut butter and will save you about 200 calories a serving (2 Tablespoons).

review/summary: This is not like peanut butter at all
review/text: I purchased the product hoping for a peanut butter sandwhich. I was so excited when it came I immediately cut up an apple spead the peanut spread on the fruit and OMG YUCK. It was bitter and had only a hint of a peanut butter taste. I was going to throw it out but decided to try a spoonful in my chocolate/peanutbutter protein shake. Come to find out it gave the drink a better taste. So I have decided to use it in recipies that would normally require peanut butter. Don't order if you are expecting it to taste anything like PB,.. A better suggestion would be PB2 has 45 calories per 2TBS.

review/text: I bought this because I have been unable to get PB2 at my local store, so I thought I would give it a try. It is horrendous! I knew it wouldn't taste "just like peanut butter", but I was not prepared for how awful it was. Not only does it not taste like peanut butter, it doesn't taste like anything edible. I seriously can't imagine someone eating this and I eat a lot of "healthy" alternatives that other people think are not palatable, so I'm pretty forgiving. I'm just floored that this product could even make it to the shelves, seriously.

review/summary: The Buddha calls it dukkha
review/text: As I am writing this, this listing has 130 (out of 173) 1-star reviews (soon to be 131). Please bear in mind that I rarely review products; I must feel very strongly about one before I review it.<br /><br />I am an adventurous person, and when it comes to food, as long is it is vegetarian I will try anything. Even if the experience is terrible I do not regret chancing it; this is how you find GOOD foods (also bad). But IMHO this product is not good and it is probably not food. Judging by the ingredients, it appears to be mainly water, vegetable fiber (probably the bulk of its volume), and peanut flavoring/extract. I lean toward health foods and like others, have portion control issues when it comes to legit pb, one of my famous weaknesses. I was intrigued when I found this in our local wal mart; calorie-free imitation peanut butter! With low expectations I opted to give it a fair chance BEFORE reading a single review.<br /><br />I mistakenly applied this product single-agent to a sandwich. I have not yet managed to consume this in its entirety; it was a failed experiment. I will hold off on throwing this out until I have mustered up the courage to attempt it in a different setting. It has a few positive reviews, so I suspect that it may be redeemable somehow (I may take up some reviewers' suggestions) but thus far I believe this product to be a travesty; this is coming from a person who can tolerate certain well-known brands of veggie bacon.<br /><br />Okay, I knew this product would be so different from actual pb that it would be unfair to compare it. I did not expect it to resemble pb, however I did expect it to resemble food at least in some remote fashion. The texture is that of a synthetic, waxy, fluffy butter (why is it "whipped"???). The taste is.. somewhat akin to the same, but I would not recommend it as a butter substitute except in non-food usages which I may attempt, as I hate to be wasteful. I would compare the taste to what I would expect of a spread made from crayons. Brown crayons, ew.<br /><br />So here's my 100% honest and dead-serious evaluation: truly, you and I are better off looking to natural sources with awesome flavor and more balanced nutrition to go with the calories. We could probably do with a little less artifice all around, and this product has no nutritional value whatsoever-- except some sodium. It even lacks dietary fiber, despite vegetable fiber being the second ingredient listed (after water)! If you are trying to eat healthier, this is surely not the way. If you are on a low-calorie diet, learn portion control-- and I empathize with the pain you feel in even considering cutting down on our beloved peanut butter. As for myself, I have to get my protein from somewhere and pb is my main squeeze, so in my pantry the Walden Farms was never destined to be more than a novelty to begin with.<br /><br />The one good thing that came of this experience, besides satisfying my curiosity? A number of the 1-star reviews praised certain other Walden Farms products DESPITE this unforgettable failure. I consider this a brave endorsement as I would personally be embarrassed to defend the entities that brought this abomination into our world. So brave, in fact, that I am convinced of their authenticity (unless ALL of these individuals are trolling), and will be looking forward to sampling OTHER Walden Farms products (this was my first). But, as for redeeming this one, I am not hopeful.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />- I DO NOT recommend this product in any way.<br /><br />- I CANNOT recommend any alternative low-cal pb substitutes as I have not personally sampled any others.<br /><br />+ I DO recommend MaraNatha for a more natural and flavorful nut butter experience. With some self-control it is worth the calories and the price.<br /><br />+ I HIGHLY recommend, in addition to the above, diet and exercise. If you can't cut portions, walk it off.

review/summary: Rotten Peanut Butter
review/text: I love peanut butter and at 200 calories a serving it just doesn't fit into a healthy diet, especially when you're trying to lose weight. I'm a nurse and I work with patients who have kidney failure and they have to limit their peanut intake due to the high potassium, so I thought this would be a good peanut butter substitute for me and the patients. I did not buy this through Amazon, I came across it by accident at Wal-Mart. It was only $3. I was so excited. Couldn't wait to get home to try it. It was the first thing I opened when I got home. It smelled like peanut butter, looked like peanut butter, tasted like rotten peanut butter. What did I expect for 0 calories, 0 fat, and $3. I got my mom to taste it and she just gagged. I gave it 1 star because you have to rate it.

review/text: Everyone's taste is subjective but here is my 2 cents worth. I'd read all the reviews so my expectations were minimal. I can honestly say I was mildly surprised as there was a slight peanut smell to the product. I used it on a toasted English muffin & it wasn't that bad (although it didn't melt at all). For my money, it tastes similar, & certainly no worse than Better 'n Peanut Butter. It wins out over BnPB which has 100 calories per 2 T serving. But PB2 easily tastes more authentic than either of them, but PB2 does have 45 calories per 2T serving. And PB2's other drawback is that it's a hassle to mix. But if I'm not dieting, it's REAL peanut butter for me.

The ingredient list was a little scary but I thought it might be worth a shot.  Big mistake.  This stuff is nasty tasting.  To me it tasted like sickly sweet chemicals.  The healthier I eat, the more I can taste the chemicals in processed foods such as this.  If it had actually tasted anything like peanuts it might have been ok but that sickly sweet taste is just gross.  I'd rather just give up eating peanut butter altogether than try to replace it with this spread.

review/summary: Does not live up to the Walden Farms name
review/text: I use many of the Walden products and they are all quite good.  The salad dressings are especially tasty.  I know what I am buying and keep my expectations at the appropriate levels; however, this product does not live up to any expectation at all.  It is terrible and tastes like chemicals.  I am a forgiving dieter when it comes to what I am willing to eat just to get "the feeling" and this just doesn't do it and in fact leaves an awful aftertaste.  Better off just taking peanut butter or any thought of it out of your diet repetoire.

review/summary: Don't waste your money...
review/text: I recently received a half price offer for Walden Farms, buy up to 10 of their products and get up to five free.  The Peanut Spread is one of the items I tried.  While I was not expecting anything like real peanut butter, I was hoping it would be something palatable that I could use for a sandwich or to spread on celery.  IT WAS TERRIBLE tasting nothing like peanut butter and barely tasting of anything peanut related.  The aftertaste was terrible! I tried a bit on a teaspoon and it repeated on me for hours.

I tried to even after i refridgerated it....and it didnt help..there was some sort of watery stuff in it.  I am thinking if you mix some reduced fat peanut butter in it, it may help.  I have not tried that yet..but this is really gross....I think i am going to try PB2 and see how that is.  I guess i am being too harsh considering it is zero calories..but i cant really even tollerate the taste.  :-(

review/summary: It's a big box full of Equal packets
review/text: What more is there to say?  If you use Equal-brand artificial sweetener in the little blue packets, and you use enough of it to warrant buying it in bulk, then this is exactly what you're looking for.  It's just a big cardboard box filled with loose packets of Equal.  Nothing more; nothing less.  And it's actually Equal-brand sweetener, not some generic off-brand.  Supposedly there are 2,000 packets in the box; but, to be honest, I've never actually gone to the trouble of counting them all to make sure.  But, suffice it to say, there are lots and lots of them.  In fact, there are enough packets of Equal in the box to last me for about six months before I have to reorder; and I use a dozen or more packets of Equal every day.  (I've been using Equal in my coffee for as long as I can remember; so it's the only sweetener that tastes right to me.  And I drink a couple of pots of coffee per day on average.  So I use a lot of Equal.)  Anyway, if you're looking to buy a couple thousand packets of Equal, you've come to the right place.

review/summary: Good Clean Barley
review/text: Not much to say here.  The barley is as advertised.  The shipping was slower than I expected, especially since the state of origin isn't all that far from my home, but the price was better than I could find anywhere else.<br /><br />This is hulled barley, which has the bran intact, unlike pearl barley.  It takes longer to cook, but it also keeps better and that is what I want in a grain.  Also, of course, having the bran intact means having the bran to eat, which is more fiber in our diets.  I have cooked this whole in a stew, and it was the same as pearl barley in appearance.  I cracked it in a Corona mill and it then cooked up like rice in a soup.<br /><br />When we poured it into the storage bucket, the grain appeared clean.  There was no dirt or foreign plant material.

review/text: This barley is totally free of any inedible hulls. It cooks easily in a steamer set to 75 minutes and left to sit for an additional 30 after that. Once cooked it stores nicely in the refrigerator without losing it's flavor or texture. I find the texture to comfortably chewy with a faint nutlike taste similar to brown rice. The grains of barley do tend to be sticky so you're not going to get a one grain at the time Minute Rice experience, a good thing in my estimation.

review/summary: Huge Bag
review/text: Huge Bag of a very nutty, chewy and wholesome barley. Once I saw the bag I knew I was in for the long haul but it is no problem for it keeps well as long as you follow the storage guidelines. I immediately, upon receiving it, made a batch and was aware that cooking times required would have to be longer than the supermarket version. I mostly use it for soups of all kinds and also as an alternative to lentils, beans, garbanzos, etc. There is a recipe in the old country where you would cook them as you might cook most legumes until they are plumped and ready to go. Then you would add the required mix of onions or shallots or green onions, tomatoes if desired (can or finely chopped fresh) garlic, plenty of herbs and personal choice spices to add flavor to the mix. Then you would fried bananas and eggs and put one over medium egg on top and a couple of slices of bananas on the side, all this accompanied by brown rice or white rice. The healthy nature of Barley makes it ideal for regular involvement in the kitchen and even though 25 Lbs is a lot of barley, it is a great food. Prior to buying it I went and did some research on Barley and the results were nothing short of outstanding. Some people even use it to replace rice and I don't see why not, for they have almost the same texture. Anyways, once cooked on a seafood chowder I was glad I made this purchase for Great River Organic Milling, Organic Whole Grains Hulled Barley, 25-Pound Package is a much better bargain and a much better quality than barley found at most stores. 4 Plus Stars for sure!

review/text: This barley tastes great and it is so filling! The day this bag of barley arrived, I made a huge pot of bean-and-barley soup with a lot of mushrooms in it. I love the taste of mushrooms with barley. This grain has a wonderful, full-bodied, nutty flavor, and a terrific, chewy texture.<br /><br />I must admit that 25 pounds is a whole lot of barley. I've had trouble in the past with whole, organic grains without preservatives becoming filled with bugs, even when I stored them in a glass container in a cool pantry. To prevent that this time I immediately broke it down into 2-pound packages and froze them. That will definitely prevent any potential bug problems.

review/summary: Very high fiber; nice flavor
review/text: This product requires a bit of processing to unlock the flavor. Boil 1 cup to 4 cups water for 60 minutes, low heat. Then place in electric blender until uniform. If you like hot oat bran cereal, you'll also like this. It has a slight corn flavor. It is also good unblended, whole, in soups and rice dishes, but requires a lot of chewing. The unblended product is very chewy. Very very high fiber. 25 lbs of barley will keep me regular for quite a long time. I highly recommend this product for the person who needs bulk fiber.  UPDATE 6/26/2012: I tried the barley in the bulk bin at W-F Company and found that I am allergic to it. W-F barley is brown, whereas Great River barley is pale. It is also hulled, which is very healthy. I must reiterate that I like this barley a lot...mellow flavor, and I'm not allergic to it.

review/text: This barley was exactly what I expected - hulled barley ready for use without need of rinsing.  It's a whole grain, great for barley water, grinding into flour, making soups, or as a more-nutritious rice substitute.  It may take me some time to use all of this order, but I will be buying more in the future.<br /><br />An important note for those who want to malt or grow barley - this product will NOT sprout, so it is NOT what you're looking for.  Unlike other grains, barley is somewhat fragile and will not sprout once the hull is removed.  "Hulled barley" has had the hull removed, so it will not sprout/grow.  This is an excellent whole grain for consumption; buy it for that purpose!

However, when I opened the package I was disappointed as the barley definitely looks like pearl barley instead of hulled barley which is what I ordered.  I thought I would give it a try anyway and soaked 4 cups of barley for less than 2 hours before cooking it in the pot.  It took less than 30 minutes before it became soft and sticky.  I waited until the barley was cooler to taste it and it taste just like the pearl barley that I bought in the supermarket.  Certainly didn't have any aroma or chewy texture like I read in the review here.  Did I receive the wrong package????

review/text: It is not what I expected. Seems that germ was semi removed and bran is gone.<br />Grains are very small, size of the pearled barley and looks like it is semi pearled. Pearled barley is considered not whole grain and I did not want to buy that. I do flake my own oats and barley. Both seeds are similar in size and flakes beautifully. This barley almost becomes flour when I use my flaker. I guess I will have to use barley from Whole Foods, barley I purchase there has outer shell and germ.<br />Planning to return this item.<br />Shipping took very long. Amazon packed in the incredible size box and third of the box was empty. Likely will not do such purchases on Amazon.<br />Contacted seller for prices on other grains, but did not get my answers, or at least so far.<br />Disapointed.

review/summary: Delightful Flavor Packs a Wallop
review/text: Patek's is my favorite curry paste--no MSG and simple ingredients. For a great, easy meal on an evening when you are too tired to make a curry from scratch, saute some onions, throw in a can of tomatoes, some water, and a few tablespoons of Patek's Mild Curry Paste, and then you can take it wherever you like it--meat, tofu, veggies--as your fancy strikes you.<br /><br />Now this paste may say "mild," but there is still enough spice to make your mouth tingle pleasantly--just enough. When I serve Patek's mild, I take out some chicken or whatever before serving to my four-year-old--I don't think she could handle the "mild" spice level. Mom and Dad love it, though.<br /><br />The downside is that one little jar does not go a long way. If you use the paste in the concentration that it calls for (and I recommend doing so, for an authentic Indian taste), you will get two or three dinners out of it. But for flavor and ease of use and sheer delight, you cannot beat Patek's. The guests you serve it to will be amazed--and you can hide your little jar in the refrig and bask in all that glory.<br /><br />Amazon's cost is high for this item, at $5, but if convenience is important to you, then that's a consideration--having a powerful culinary secret delivered to your door might make the extra buck or two worth it. If you have time and are near an Asian/Indian foods store, then expect to pay $3 if you are lucky, or around $4 in most places. Stock up, because unopened, these last forever.

review/text: I tried this curry paste after I found it recommended in Pressure Perfect by Lorna Sass, a cookbook with recipes for pressure cookers.  Well, the first thing that I made with it was curry chicken.  It became an instant family favorite.  Since then, I have tried it in other dishes and I was never disappointed.  The flavor is rich and intense without being overpowering.  I have also used it in Hot and we like it too, but it would not be good for people who are not used to heat.  I find the paste to be much better than any powders that I have tried and it gives a more authentic flavor.

review/summary: Easy Indian food in a few minutes & Not too spicy!
review/text: Yummy, yummy!<br />This curry paste is now my favorite.  It is easy to use, store, and best of all it is delicious!  Pataks Curry is very mild....not super spicy like many others.  My husband likes flavor and a little spice so this is his favorite as well.  I can use the one jar for about 4 meals which is a great deal.<br /><br />I have found that is it so simple to make a "stir-fry"  with a protein like tofu, chicken or even salmon and then add veggies such as carrots, or potatoes.  There are many combinations and just about any typical veggie taste great in this sauce (love cauliflower).  I think it is best kept simple with 2 or 3 ingredients.<br /><br />This sauce is great for an easy meal with guests, throw the rice in the steamer, make the curry stir-fry, and add another side dish and you are set.  Our friends love it!<br /><br />Pataks also makes other great sauces but this is my favorite to keep on hand at all times.

review/text: This curry paste is great for putting flavor into something simple. I throw a can of diced tomatoes in the crock pot along with some chopped onion and garlic, a few tablespoons of the paste, a little broth and whatever meat I have on hand. Chicken, beef, lamb, it doesn't matter. I come home to a wonderful aroma and after steaming some rice I have a meal that tastes like I've been working on it all day.<br /><br />It is very mild but flavorful. In fact, a friend who absolutely hates spicey food loved this. I actually like spicey food and sometimes mix one tablespoon of the hot along with two tablespoons of the mild. Just depends on my mood and who I'm cooking for.

review/text: This curry paste is delicious.  I sauteed some onions and green bell peppers.  Added a half can of spagetti sauce (next time I'll try stewed tomatoes), half cup of water and about 3 teaspoons of the paste.  I let simmer for a few minutes, then added salmon, covered and let simmer for 15 minutes.  I served over a mix of hot brown rice and peas.  This was my first attempt at cooking with curry paste and I absolutely loved it.  Spicy and delicious.

review/summary: Best around
review/text: This is the best product I have tried for curry paste, unless you want to make your own. The flavor is nice and not so overwhelmingly spicy. You actually taste the flavor of your food. A little goes a long way, so don't over do it. This is the only brand I buy for Thai recipes.

review/summary: Vinegar Slop
review/text: I'm a big fan of authentic indian food, aficionado almost, but this is a far cry from anything I have ever tasted from that region, which makes sense because Patak's is NOT from India, but rather imported from the fish & chip capitol of the world... UK.  I have tried a variety of sauces, including the chutney from Patak and they all share a similar, unfortunate attribute : They all taste of vinegar, ketchup, more vinegar and more ketchup.  I am truly surprised that nobody has mentioned this abomination.  It was as if somebody poured salad dressing over my chicken, dumped out half a bottle of ketchup on top of it, soaked it overnight in a bag of vinegar, and then crapped over it with a can of manwich.  This company should be out of business.<br />If you want to try the most authentic indian food in a jar that I've found, try Tiger Tiger.

review/text: I was looking for a quick alternative to making Sujata's curry paste from scratch (as per Beth Hensperger's "Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Recipes for Two). This is it, for now.  Taste-wise it's a close second, however, it's way more convenient. You'll be rubbing it on long before you even find your mortar and pestle, or finish conducting your spice inventory. Shipping was the usual quick and efficient AMAZonING way.

review/text: I have used Patak's Curry Paste (mild) for years. I mix it in rice, stir frys, vegetables, and I love the taste of the paste. It has just the perfect blend of spices to add pizzaz for those who love curry.

review/summary: Personal Favorite Tea
review/text: This is my personal favorite tea. The floral scent is terrific and I love it for the aromatherapy effects. This is the only Jasmine tea that I've found that tastes like it smells. Other Jasmine teas I've tried smell nice, but disappoint when you take a sip. This tea delivers and the presentation is beautiful the way the blossoms fill up the sachets when brewed.
