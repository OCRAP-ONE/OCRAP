review/summary: I love these pretzels!!!
review/text: I recently discovered these at a local Walmart priced at about $5 or $6 a bag (about 4 servings).  I decided to check on Amazon and loved the lower price.  A case of 12 bags for about $31.  I have not been diagnosed with Celiac disease (so far), but I am very sensitive to gluten and to oats (migraines, intestinal pains, diarrhea).  These pretzels have never once caused a reaction of any kind , even if I pig out on an entire bag in one weekend.  The only negative thing I could say is that the fat count in higher than I'd like. 8 grams for 32 pretzels.  Salt content is moderately high at 540mg, but they are pretzels after all.  I highly, highly recommend these pretzels.

review/summary: BEST GF Pretzel
review/text: Christmas isn't complete without Party Mix. My mom started the tradition with a 1960's recipe from my great-aunt. Now I use that same recipe for my grown-up kids and their families using all gluten free ingredients. Glutino pretzel sticks are the best; they're light, with just enough salt, and none of that bitter after-taste that many gf pretzels have. They are my first choice.

I've been through every pretzel out there and nothing compares. I don't bother with "regular" pretzels. I put these out at parties and playdates and have been asked what brand they were as our guest noticed how tasty and fast they were going. Light, flavorful, and a satisfying crispy crunch. Awesome!

review/text: My daughter is gluten/casein free and these are our standard lunchbox snack.  Foods can be limited since most schools won't allow you to pack peanut products in lunchboxes due to peanut allergies in other children.  The Glutino Pretzels are the perfect thing.<br /><br />The taste is very close to a regular pretzel--perhaps more like a slightly stale regular pretzel.<br /><br />The subscribe and save option here on amazon makes these significantly less expensive than they are in stores.

review/summary: Where have all the pretzels gone?
review/text: I recently purchased the 20-pack of 2.6 oz. bags of Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists. They are excellent and my family agrees! The 2.6 oz. bag makes it easy to control portions for those who (like me) are on a restricted diet. Unfortunately, when I tried to re-order within the last week, they are not available or no longer stocked. Upon searching for other suppliers, I found a few who have these available. However, they are available at a higher price than on Amazon. I already consider these great tasting pretzels to be a splurge item - if you do the math you find they are a little pricey for a snack item, even at Amazon's price. I truly hope these Glutino gluten-free pretzels will soon become available. I had planned to buy them again and again. They are a good-tasting, crisp and crunchy, very satisfying snack food.

review/summary: Wonderful Formula, BUT....purchase it at Walmart!
review/text: I LOVE this formula.  I have 5 month old twins that have tummy aches that wake them up in the middle of the night so we started to use this formula on the dream feed and 1 night feed that they are still on.  We use the Costco (Kirkland Signature) formula during the day.  I has been awesome, they stopped waking up crying with gas, it is a huge relief for my husband and I.  It broke our hearts when our girls woke up crying with gas, highly recommend this formula- perfect price point!  I am normally not a Walmart shopper, but this formula in the 23.2oz size is only $15.47 with $2 shipping and the 33.2oz size is only $20.98, way cheaper than buying it here on Amazon.  Also I find that if you stir the formula with a spoon rather than shake it in the bottle it keeps it from foaming up, we have to do this with our Costco formula too; the foaming would be my only complaint.

It makes a robust and flavorful cup to get you going in the am, although it is good anytime you want a good pick-me-up.  It completely blows others, like Twinings, into the weeds for value.  Twinings is good tea, but this is better and half the price.  Each bag makes two good cups, too.

review/text: The tea was good, not great.  I'd have bought it again, but the bags came apart easily and/orleaked leaves making some bags unusable or leaving tea leaves in the cup which made the bottom of the cup undrinkable.  I don't enjoy having tea leaves in my mouth when I'm trying to wake up.<br /><br />They need better quality control.  I saw it here and thought I'd pass that along.  I'm ordering the Trader Joe's as it's a similar value and to me a better tasting tea with a good bag construction.  I'd also buy Twining's if the price was comparable.

Also lovely is the fact that it does not disintegrate in your mouth after chewing it for a while like some gums.  My only issue is that it has BHT, which I have heard causes cancer or something terrible and I have also heard this is a non-essential ingredient.

review/summary: Enfamil Premium Lipil ready-made formula
review/text: Hospital staff introduced us to Enfamil Premium Lipil ready-made baby formula in little 2-ounce "nursette" plastic bottles onto which you could quickly add a nipple to feed your infant. These were a godsend, since my wife couldn't produce enough breastmilk for our baby boy. We quickly realized we needed to stock up on these, and also discovered that this product was available in 6 oz. glass nursette bottles, 32 oz. tin cans, and good old powder.<br /><br />Once opened, though, nursette bottles need to be consumed within about an hour, and the cans need to be poured into a container, refrigerated and consumed within 3 days or, because its ingredients are milk-derived, it will spoil. The powder didn't taste as good (my wife taste-tests everything she gives to our child), and also produced more spit-up. The canned formula added a slightly metallic taste, but seemed acceptable to both mother and baby, which was nice as this was the most economical way to get the ready-made stuff.<br /><br />We primarily used the 2 oz nursettes for the first 6 months, which was incredibly convenient (but stinkin' expensive), until he started needing 3 or more at a time, at which point we introduced the 6 oz. glass nursettes. We still used the 2 oz. for when he woke up in the middle of the night and just wanted a little snack.<br /><br />Enfamil claims that their Premium formula increases IQ over other formulas, and his grandmother is convinced that he's a genius, but I'm not so certain; the kid sure does drool a lot and can't even take out the garbage yet! Obviously, there's no substitute for breastmilk but, if you can't keep up with your baby's appetite, this is the stuff to get.

review/summary: Enfamil ready to use
review/text: I love the enfamil ready to use formula. The probiotics are an excellent addition to aid in developing my baby's digestional system. It has significantly helped with her gas and constipation. She had such bad tolerance for the Similac.  It also contains many nutrients found in breast milk, which is truly reassuring for those of us who may be unable to breast feed.  Additionally, because of the thicker consistency she has less trouble swallowing. We live in NYC where space is VERY limited. Therefore, the ready to use formula is convenient for both time and storing constraints.

review/text: Enfamil ready-to-use was the only formula I used for my two children: my daughter now 3 year old who switched to regular milk at 2, and 4 month old son who is now 100% on formula.  When my daughter was young, the triple-guide was not available so I used regular LIPIL and it was just as good.  Both my child has been very healthy and full of energy.  I trust Enfamil totally and completed.

review/summary: Best formula
review/text: Hi I am using this ready to feed formula since 5 and 1/2 months. My son was given this formula in the hospital as there were some initial problems and he immediately liked it. Then I had switched him to the powdered one which gave him colic for one and half month which I did not realise was a reason until someone pointed out the same problems with her kiddo. I had tried the Similac and nestle Goodstart powder but my son would not take the Similac and had severe spit up with nestle good start. Once I switched him to this ready to feed formula he was a different person and had no more problems.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Easy to use as ready to feed and also helps when travelling.<br />2. No colic problems with my son.<br />3. Must be close to breastmilk as my son never says no for this one.<br />4. Also available in 6oz and 8oz sizes.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Expensive<br />2. Small shelf life once opened.<br />3. 32 oz cans do not come in a bottle or can that can be closed so I had to get the lids which I could only find on amazon so that I can put the open ones in the  refrigerator.<br />4. Very hard to pour into the bottle without spilling.

review/text: I love cheese, especially blue cheese. I was in the Military for 24 years and have seen much of the world. And in most places I visited I would try the local cheeses. Believe it or not the best blue cheese I have tasted is the Roaring Forties Blue from Kings Island cheeses in tasmania Autralia. It has been aged perfectly and has a robust flavor thats hard to find in most blues. I like to let the cheese warm a little at room temperature which allows it to be spred easily on crackers or my favorite, a good french baguette. This cheese is a little higher in price than others but if you want quality it is worth it. Try their website @ kidairy.com.au for more information on products.

There are what we call "flavor crystals" that add a slight bit of crunch every so often.  Something we have never experienced in other blue cheeses. We discovered this cheese in Australia and instantly fell in love with it.  So happy to know that we can purchase it through Amazon on this side of the pond.

review/text: I was introduced to this product in a little shop in Key West that sells hot sauces and canned peppers.  They had free samples and after trying this I immediately bought several jars to take home with me.  Since then, I have mail-ordered these peppers from that Key West shop several times, when I get the cravings for them.  You can buy a similar product by Trappy's at Wal Mart but these are much, much better.  Unlike the Trappy's hot and sweet jalapenos, which are neither that hot nor that sweet, and actually rather bland, these are terrifically hot and sweet.  The dissolved sugar gives these peppers an amazingly emerald green color and translucency that makes them look like candy.  If you can handle the hotness, you'll want to eat them right out of the jar like popcorn.  You just can't stop eating them until your mouth burns so bad you need to gulp water or beer to quench the burning.  If you cannot handle eating them right out of the jar, you'll love these peppers in your eggs, your nachos, with cream cheese--pretty much anywhere you'd eat regular jalapenos.  It's great to see Amazon carrying this product now.

review/summary: Review of Roastaroma, Cafix, Pero, and Postum
review/text: I recently gave up coffee and decided to try three different coffee substitutes: Roastaroma, Cafix, and Pero. Although Cafix tasted the most like real coffee (and it tastes *a lot* like real coffee), and all three products are pretty good, Roastaroma was my favorite.<br /><br />It is very similar to coffee, but it doesn't quite have the bitter bite of coffee. Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. Roastaroma actually reminds me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate--the cinnamon and carob flavors come through pretty strongly in the drink, giving it a cinnamon-chocolatey flavor. I used to drink coffee to satisfy my sweet tooth on low calories. This drink totally fits the bill for this purpose.<br /><br />The Pero is pretty good, too. Like Roastaroma, it doesn't have the bitter coffee taste, but it still makes for a decent imitation of decaf. I like to drink it with cinnamon-flavored powdered creamer. Pero's a good value, too: it's strong enough that you don't need to use very much to flavor your whole drink. I drink the Pero when I'm trying to ration the Roastaroma out to myself so as not to run out.<br /><br />So Roastaroma has the best flavor, Cafix tastes the most like coffee, and Pero is a good back-up.<br /><br />A quick note on Postum: I do not care for it. I find that people who like Postum tend to be people who were never coffee drinkers. It tastes nothing like coffee. If you try Postum as a coffee substitute, you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Coffee Alternative
review/text: I recently decided to give up coffee, including decaf, for health reasons. I drank coffee all day long, sometimes making a second pot in the early afternoon. I enjoy drinking a warm beverage throughout the day and wanted to find something to replace coffee. I buy a lot of things from Amazon.com and decided to start my search there. I found a number of products to choose from, and after reading the reviews, I decided on these three: Cafix, Caf-Lib, and Dandy Blend.<br /><br />The first thing you must do when trying any coffee substitute is to set your expectations. The reviews I read said these products tasted like coffee. They do not taste like any coffee I have ever had. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you are expecting a coffee-like taste when you try one of these, you will be disappointed. That was my experience. I drank my coffee black, and so that is how I prepared these. Perhaps with sweetener and/or creamer these do taste more like coffee.<br /><br />I ordered all three products from Amazon.com, and the first to arrive was Cafix. Thinking it was like coffee, I used a level teaspoon just like I would with instant coffee. It tasted like really weak coffee. I tried adding more to make it stronger, but it still did not taste like coffee, and I was disappointed. I finished the drink and put my cup in the<br />dishwasher.<br /><br />After I thought about it for a while, I realized what I really wanted was a beverage I could drink throughout the day like I did coffee. Whether or not it tasted like coffee was not important. It's not that Cafix tasted bad, it wasn't what I was expecting. So I made myself another cup, and when I finished that one I made a third. By the end of the day I decided that Cafix wasn't so bad after all, I actually enjoyed it.<br /><br />A couple days later I received Caf-Lib and eagerly fixed myself a cup. First impression was good. Caf-Lib tastes similar to Cafix to me, but has more flavor. Caf-Lib is also stronger, so I use less to achieve the same strength. After comparing Cafix and Caf-Lib I decided that I prefer Caf-Lib.<br /><br />The next day Dandy Blend arrived, and I fixed myself a cup right away. The directions say to use a slightly rounded teaspoon for a strong coffee like drink, so that's what I did. Dandy Blend was a little slower to dissolve, requiring that I stir it longer. Not important really, just observation. Finally I took my first sip. To my amazement I found the taste<br />reminded me of Caf-Lib and Cafix. I think the reason is because none of them have the bitter taste of coffee. They are all very mild. Dandy Blend's has slightly more flavor Cafix, but not as much as Caf-Lib.<br /><br />#1: Caf-Lib<br />The most flavorful of these three and my favorite. I used one rounded teaspoon per cup. Has somewhat of a nut flavor.<br /><br />#2: Dandy Blend<br />I used a slightly rounded (almost level) teaspoon per cup. It has somewhat of a smokey smell while stirring. More flavor than Cafix, but not as much as Caf-Lib.<br /><br />#3: Cafix<br />I used one heaping teaspoon of per coffee cup. The taste is very mild.<br /><br />There are many factors to consider when choosing a beverage. I prefer to drink them black, while you may prefer to use creamer and/or sweetener. Only you can determine which one would you prefer with your favorite snack. The reviews are good as a starting point, but I suggest you try all three to discover which one you will enjoy the most.

review/summary: Skeptic's Choice!
review/text: Over the years I've bought and disposed of lots of coffee substitutes that were supposed to taste "just like coffee", but didn't. So, I was prepared to add this one to the compost too! I like my coffee strong, aromatic, and with an edge of bitterness. Could a drink made from roasted barley, rye, chicory and beet roots give me that? Well, as a natural-born skeptic, and generally immune to hype of any kind, I have to say that Cafix has become my afternoon and evening beverage of choice. Does Cafix taste "just like coffee"? No, because it isn't. But its aroma and flavor are as good as and better than some real coffee I've known. And what's more, it lets me sleep at night without the eight hour half-life of caffeine buzzing around in my being!

review/summary: Pero, Inka, Cafix review...
review/text: I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest. I think I did like Cafix the best, but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee. There is little difference in all three, they look identical with only tiny coloration differences. All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker? Pass, because you will not be satisfied with the taste. It is very bland all by itself. BUT, if you like cream in your coffee? You won't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee. I am PERFECTLY happy with all three products and will continue to drink them;I will choose by PRICE due to the very similar make of them all. The cans all read the same ingredient wise.

review/text: I have not been able to drink coffee, or any drink with caffeine, for over 10 years. I miss the taste of coffee and having a warm cup first thing in the morning. I found Cafix, read the reviews and decided to try it.  I was so surprised how much I liked it! To me it tastes like coffee. I have a hard time telling the difference and it even leaves the same aftertaste of coffee in my mouth. Now, that being said, it doesn't taste like Starbucks or Peet's, or any other high end roasted and ground product. It tastes more like coffee you'd make in a 10 cup drip maker with a can of Maxwell House, but I am OK with that. I added two rounded teaspoons to a cup of water I stuck in the microwave for 1:30. I added some Truvia and a splash of half and half and was in coffee heaven without the health detriments! I can't wait to try it iced!! I highly recommend this product if you love the taste and ritual of coffee but can't have caffeine.

review/text: I agree, it's pretty weak stuff, using a rounded tablespoon in 16 oz. of water. I think it's bland even if I use two tablespoons. I regard the drink as hot brown water.  I'd like just a little more character / personality.<br />I'm going to try some Pero to see how it compares.<br /><br />UPDATE: Pero had more flavor, but it wasn't good. It's hard to describe.  Maybe like someone stirred it with a crayon?  And raw white flour?<br />Also, the powder didn't dissolve as completely as Caffix's crystals.  I had a lot of foam on top.<br /><br />I like Caffix better if I mix instant decaf with it.  A ratio of 2/3 Caffix to 1/3 instant decaf.  Much better.

Decaf coffee is ok but sometimes I still get the jumpies from it, my system doesn't tolerate carob or chocolate, and I was getting tired of tea.  What is a latte lover to do?  Finally found Cafix at my local store and my search was over!!  Yes, it tastes nothing like coffee but it has it's own unique taste - slighty nutty, a little sweet, also is smoother than coffee.  What I love is that it is quick to make, I make it with 1/2 almond milk, 1/2 hot water, microwave for 30 seconds, add a little cinnamon and it's my go-to morning drink.  As a famous commercial used to say "Try it, you'll like it!!"

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: I do not drink coffee, but I love the taste of it.  I am always on the hunt for a coffee substitute that will give me the taste.  I have tried Postum, Pero, and Cafix.  The first time I tasted Cafix I liked it, but to me it had a taste I was not sure about, but after drinking a few cups I started to really enjoy it.  I bought two jars of it and I am getting ready to start my second jar.  I am glad I bought it and will be ordering more soon.  I am not a fan of Pero and I am very disapointed Postum is no longer available so Cafix is now my choice.  I fix mine with a sugar substitute and half & half.  I have also used flavored creamers, which I like from time to time in Cafix. It disolves well in hot water and does not leave any residue.  If you are looking for a coffee substitute try Cafix and give it an honest try.  I paid $10.00 for two 7 ounce jars and I think it was well worth the money.

review/summary: I like this...
review/text: Bearing in mind that I wasn't trying to imitate coffee (if I want coffee, I will just drink coffee,since I don't have any issues with caffeine or coffee), so I wasn't expecting it to taste like coffee, that's not what I was going for. I must say, it's GOOD! It's got a much smoother flavor than coffee (some would call it "weak" but I don't like strong coffee, either.) Really nutty and grain-y (meaning, it tastes like grain, not that it has a gritty texture!) very little if any bitterness to speak of (maybe the bitterness comes out if you add more crystals). On it's own it has a nice sweetness and mild flavor- I'm not a black coffee drinker (yuck!) and I'll occasionally drink tea "black" (certain types of tea), but this is definitely enjoyable on its own. If you add creamer it really DOES taste similar to coffee- if you handed me a cup of Cafix with creamer and told me it was coffee...I would probably believe you (though I might think your coffee tasted a bit "off"). You definitely need to make it stronger for creamer though...unlike coffee, my flavored Coffee Mate completely overwhelms this stuff.

When I make my coffee I make it weak, I dont need a lot of coffee flavor to get the taste, so it wouldnt take to much for me to taste it, but this product is void of any coffee smells or taste.<br />I will never buy this again. I even tried adding some real coffee but not good.

review/text: My husband and I like good strong coffee, all day long, we like the smell, color, flavor, etc....except not always the caffeine.  The one thing I don't like is the effect of caffeine on the adrenal glands, so enters Cafix...it's not the same as coffee, but it's a tasty alternative for evenings or to mix with coffee (we'll brew one strong k cup then add Cafix in hot water, essentially making two cups of Half-Caf).

review/summary: Close but not Postum
review/text: I see my review is pretty much in agreement with another review here. But I'll put it here anyway.<br /><br />I ordered this along with Pero Extra and Roastaroma to try the three. I'm a former Postum aficionado and had certainly developed quite a liking to Postum.<br /><br />Really can't take Pero Extra very much. I keep trying it again and again, prolly 10 times now, to see if I can develop a liking for it and just can't. I'm sure some people may like it, but it's just not for me.<br /><br />Cafix is what I'll usually go for, but it has a certain sort of built in sweetness (very mild, barely distinguishable)which comes from the beets that are added. Over time I've found it just sort of fills in some of the void from lack of Postum, and while it's not a Postum replica it has certain Postum like qualities.<br /><br />The Roastaroma actually is what I think tastes the best of the three, but it's taste is just not at all like Postum, is however very balanced and has a nice maltiness to it. Often I'll put just a little bit of Stevia powder in it. (I could always tell if I've ingested aspartame by (or nutrasweet, whatever) by how I felt, and try to verify any food/drink I ingest doesn't have aspartame. I mean, an item which arose out of research into nerve agents for warfare, and itself found to be an effective weapon, really shouldn't be passed off as a food item. Stevia is ground plant matter, even less processed that sugar.)The combo makes a really nice morning or late evening drink.

review/summary: Don't Expect Coffee Flavor
review/text: I know some other reviewers have raved about this product stating it is mild, and is the closest thing out there to real coffee.  Well, let me tell you if this is the closest thing we're all screwed.  When I made it the smell was akin to someone who just had a cigarette and then came inside and sat down next to you.  Seriously, this stuff is pungent.  And if you are a real coffee drinker who drinks it black to taste the flavor of the bean you will be disappointed.  I understand this is a coffee substitute and realistically it's not going to taste exactly like coffee but this isn't even close.  I promise I'm not an angry, bitter person just a coffee drinker who expected more.  I did some research and found out about cold brewing which takes out approximately 70% of the acidity in the coffee which helps a GERD sufferer such as myself.  You can use your favorite coffee to do it too and it tastes great because it is actually coffee.  I used 12oz of coffee mixed in with 6 cups of water in a pourer container.  Let sit for 24 hrs in fridge and then used a super fine strainer to keep out the grit and poured into a second container to hold the coffee concentrate in the fridge good for two weeks.  I then used 1.5 ounces (a shot glass to the top) plus 6oz of hot water and it tasted exactly like my usual morning cup of coffee minus the heartburn and symptoms associated with GERD.  They do make a French Press called the Bodum Bean which I just ordered to simplify the whole process.

I couldn't face buying them by the 4 oz jar at the supermarket.  I figured that as cheap as these nuts were they may be low grade but good enough for pesto.  I tried them and they were delicious all by themselves, very strong flavor and not the least bit stale.

review/text: The nuts arrived very quickly and it seems to be good quality pine nuts. The only thing is that several people (not everyone) seem to have developed pine mouth after eating the nuts. For people who don't know, pine mouth is a phenomenen that one always has a bitter taste in one's mouth for a few days after eating pine nuts. Other people did not have that problem, so we are not sure what happened here. No one had pine mouth after eating the first batch of 3 LBS pine nuts ordered from the same shop a few month earlier.

review/summary: Use milk instead of water -  tastes better
review/text: I have low blood sugar, so I am always excited about trying a new product that is high in protein to keep my blood sugar levels stable.  I have been using Muscle Milk shakes for several years and have enjoyed good results, so I was very excited about trying Muscle Milk oatmeal.  I was soooooo disappointed by the awful taste.  Didn't want to waste the 6-pack, so I gave some to my Mother.  She said she loved the taste, but she used hot milk instead of hot water to mix.  Then I tried heating milk for 60 seconds in the microwave and then pouring it into the cup.  Wow!  What a difference.  The taste is so much better that I plan to add this product to my list of food staples.  Before I purchased, I read a few reviews that gave poor ratings due to the taste.  Try it with hot milk, and you might like it. Since I have low blood sugar, I need to eat a lot of protein which can increase cholesterol; this product only has 5mg of cholesterol per serving, so it is a great way to increase protein.  Also, I found the one cup serving to be a little too much.  So, I just eat 1/2 at breakfast and put the container in a gladware container and reheat the next day.

Since then I have been using them every time I need a good breakfast in a hurry (when I don't have time to make egg whites and oatmeal).  This stuff tastes great, and you can make it in about 2 minutes or less.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I love the Maple and Brown sugar flavor.  I tried the Vanilla flavor and I didn't like it.  I haven't tried the other flavors.

review/summary: PERFECT!!!!
review/text: I got for a Christas gift the Starbuckd three pack with the choch covefed espreson beans, choch coverev chrerries and the chock covdred alomod bars. while the later  was , least favofite, the former two blew my mind with all their chocholatey goodess. Needless to say when the season was over so were the chocholates; so I became a woman on a mssion. I found then! (NOT the brand, of course),Ghiradelli is next to perfect! I love them SO much not only did I order one order of three choch covered espresso  beans, but two of the choch covered cherries. Ok, so I love then SO much I placed TWO more orders, only this time with more of the cherries.<br />Now, that said, I've NEVER been a fan of the choch covered cherries, but these are NOT like the the traditional cordials with that gooey liquidy center that makes them too sweet for my taste. Needless to say I'll have enough to last me a while...at least a week or so, lol.<br />enoy!<br />OH, did I mention the packges are small...but dont all good things come in small packages?<br />Rachel

review/summary: made a nice gift
review/text: The chocolate covered cherries make for a nice gift idea if you have to purchase a gift for someone who is hard to buy for.  They come nicely packaged, and because they're Ghirardelli, you  can't really go wrong.  Nice gift idea for an inexpensive, but classy gift.

review/summary: So good.
review/text: These are just perfect. I was worried they'd be too chewy, but they aren't at all. They have just the right amount of sweetness without being overpowering. No complaints about the packaging either.

review/summary: It's hard to please her.
review/text: I liked them.  She didn't.  Since I was trying to please her I guess I can't give the chocolates more than 3 starts.  She and I both like Ghirardelli chocolate but this particular product didn't get me past first base.

review/summary: Ruined with "Sucralose"
review/text: I love Mexican Hot Chocolate, and Abuelita is no exception.  In fact I LOVE the syrup variety of the Abuelita.<br /><br />Unfortunately these powder packets are sweetened with Sucralose - aka SPLENDA.<br /><br />Splenda isn't bad, but why?  Why not use sugar?  The difference IS noticable, and I have had a 10-pack of these packets sitting in my drawer at work for WAY too long.  They actually give me a headache when I drink them.  I made up 3 of the packets (with about 2-3 weeks in between to allow the disgust to fade between each attempt).  None of them turned out to come even close to comparing with the real stuff.<br /><br />So if you can't taste Splenda then go for it.  On the other hand if you can't handle the disgusting aftertaste left by artificial sweeteners, then leave this behind and either get the syrup or the tablets.

review/text: this is thee best hot chocolate. reminds me of doing "las posadas" at christmas in school and, afterwards, having buns and mexican hot chocolate. my family begs for this as a treat - it costs quite a penny in stores - even at walmart. definitely cheaper here.  this is the same taste of the whole tabs, but without the work.

review/summary: Tastes great but VERY unhealthy to drink~!!!
review/text: Like the other reviewers stated, I found this cocoa to have a fairly rich chocolate taste but, after I received it, when I read that it had artificial sweeteners in it....I was very upset.  As one reviewer wrote....MIGRAINES cometh!!... after drinking this stuff.  Before I realized how unhealthy this stuff was, I found that it took 3 packets to make a truly rich, large cup of chocolate drink.  Any amount less and it was like drinking colored water.  And it was really very sweet...to my taste any way --> maybe that was the three packets I needed to get the rich chocolate taste.  Frankly, with the articial sweeteners and the small amount you get for the money, I will NOT be buying this product ever again!  I recommend you try it locally if you must ingest artificial sweeteners but I'll stick to Xylitol, truvia, and other natural, non-life threatening ones along with the natural 'dirty' sugars.
