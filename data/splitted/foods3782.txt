review/text: I've found that I like the milder white teas, but I'm not crazy about plain white no matter how well ranked. Just a hint of flavor like this one -- or pomegranate, ginger -- makes all the difference. This is a regular for me in rotation with some of the other flavored, organic white loose teas.

Some of the reviews on the Amazon site stated that many of the peanuts in the can were empty shells. I thought it might be just a random occurrence and decided to order them anyways but after trying all 6 cans I found that to be the case with all 6 cans! 40% of the peanuts were small, withered or empty. I just thought you should know.

review/summary: This displaced Southerner likes 'em
review/text: Living in Nebraska, if I ever want to munch on boiled peanuts without making them myself, I have to have them delivered, which I do on a semi-monthly basis. I've found folks are pretty particular about this briny treat and I am, too. What I like about this brand is the large peanut size, the slightly less salty flavor, and the fact they aren't boiled to a mushy consistency.<br /><br />My one complaint would be that I, like the other reviewer, have seen way too many empty shells in a can. But my last order seemed to have a lot fewer. For an easy way to get your boiled peanut fix, I'd recommend this one

Decent price with prime shipping, the others cost more to ship than the actual product.<br /><br />All in all very satisfied with purchase, will likely order more.

review/text: the few boiled peanuts that are good in the can taste great... beyond that, i can't find much positive to say about these. more than 50% of the product was rotten/mushy/empty shells/tiny undeveloped peanuts. they clearly put the absolute dregs of the peanuts they have in the "boiled peanuts" bin when they sort them at the processing facility. i bought a 6-pack an this was my experience with all 6 cans, so it was no fluke.<br /><br />also, i emailed the peanut shop about this, thinking that they might be concerned... sadly, they weren't! at all. all they would say was contact amazon.

review/summary: Not Scottish At All, Just Good English Tea
review/text: The last time I visited Scotland was 1999 when I led a couple of my Birmingham wrestlers to the Isle of Bute to participate in the Scottish Highland Games.  What I remember most besides wrestling upon slippery wet grass was drinking the best cup of hot tea ever!  So I was keen to relive those bone-warming memories and recently bought a box of Taylors of Harrogate Scottish Breakfast Tea via Amazon.<br /><br />The package arrived promptly from a seller in a neighboring state.  I carefully opened the tightly-wrapped package containing the box of tea, then opened the box near my nose in order to greet a nice whiff of tea scent.  The tea kettle was placed on the stove and the burner turned on high to bring the water to a boil.  A tea bag was placed into a 12-ounce mug and then the boiling water was slowly poured into it, stopping about 2/3rds of the way.  I then added regular whole milk, stopping at 3/4ths of the way.  Finally I topped it off with more hot water from the kettle. I waited 4 minutes before attempting to sip the tea, as attempts made earlier than that bring a risk of mouth and tongue cancer.<br /><br />The tea was exactly as I remembered warm and soothing tea, from - not Scotland, but England!  It tasted just like PG Tips tea that I drank in Birmingham, England. 'Perhaps it was the milk?', I thought. 'Maybe Scottish milk has a higher milk fat content than American milk?', I wondered.  What was it about that tea on Bute that I couldn't find in my cup of Scottish Breakfast tea?<br /><br />Then I began reading the box.  Taylors of Harrogate is in Harrogate - Harrogate, England!  Not Scotland.  This tea isn't Scottish at all.  That said, however, Scottish tea 'officionados' maintain that English breakfast tea got its start in Scotland.  It was invented in 1892 by a Master Drysdale of Scotland as simply 'Breakfast Tea' and soon the Queen of England and many other 'Southerners' were drinking it. Maybe all 'breakfast tea' is Scottish after all?  I don't know what distinguishes them, but I guess I'll have to make another trip to the Isle of Bute to recreate my best experience drinking hot tea.<br /><br />So there you have it, my cup of Scottish Breakfast tea was just as good as Tetley's British Blend; it just cost me a bit more.  :-)

review/summary: The only chocolate cake mix I will buy
review/text: This is my favorite cake mix to use!  Sometimes I follow the directions on the back, but more often this is what I'll add to the cake mix:  1 cup water, 1 cup mayonnaise, 3 large eggs, and 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract.  It makes it dark and moist, and people NEVER suspect I started with a cake mix.  Even my mother-in-law wanted to know how I got my cake so dark, and she uses cake mixes too (but another, cheaper, brand).<br /><br />Be sure not to mix/beat the batter for too long, as this will make the cake come out with a "tough" texture, instead of the tender crumb you get when you mix it just enough to blend the ingredients.  Don't worry about a few little balls of powdered mix in your batter, they will bake out.  If you're really worried about those little balls of powdered mix in your batter, run the cake mix (and *just* the cake mix, no other ingredients!) through a fine wire sieve, or a flour sifter.  This will break up those little clumps.<br /><br />If you love chocolate, this is the cake mix to buy.

review/summary: Maybe organic, but still refined!!!
review/text: Back in Germany I would buy organic sunflower oil from Rapunzel or another brand, but now in the USA, I am having a big problem to find an appropriate oil for the autumn months.<br /><br />In a local health food store 3 years ago I actually found Rapunzel Sunflower Oil, and I bought every single bottle they had. But last year I ran out, and the problem began anew. What to cook with potatoe dishes now?<br /><br />Then I saw this offer, and since I know their nut oils are really of good quality (yes really, no sarcasm here), I trusted them and ordered this set of 4 cans. Another reviewer mentioned the cute tins, but hey, what good are cute tins if the product does not keep what the ad promised???<br /><br />OK, maybe it was my own fault to assume the term "organic" must automatically mean "unrefined". Stupid me, I really did assume that! But this oil is refined!<br /><br />It has no taste nor aroma at all! It is just like all other refined industrial oils ("cooking oil") from any american supermarket, only more expensive. I felt betrayed here.<br /><br />I didn't return it, as there was nothing technically wrong with it. I mean, there was nothing spoilt or broken, so I just used the tins up during the autumn and winter.<br /><br />But I will absolutely not order this again, as "organic" is not good enough! It must be "unrefined", and that it is not.

review/summary: Great, healthly high-temp oil.
review/text: I have been experimenting with various "healthy" cooking oils. The obvious popular choice is extra virgin olive oil however, extra virgin olive oil has a rather strong taste which isn't suitable for all dishes and it has a rather low smoke point making it unsuitable for high-temperature cooking. I had gained some interest in high-oleic sunflower seed oil based on some research I had done on-line.<br /><br />High-oleic sunflower oil has an excellent mix of fats in terms of health, stability and suitability to high-heat cooking. The product description was not that clear if this was high-oleic sunflower oil or "normal" sunflower oil. After purchasing the oil, I was able to verify with the nutrition label that this is high-oleic oil.<br /><br />High-oleic sunflower oil is difficult to find "locally" and when found it is very expensive. Amazon's price is substantially cheaper than I am able to find locally though unless you are rich I still doubt you would be frying a turkey in this oil.<br /><br />This is an excellent oil for anyone looking for a relatively healthy cooking oil for high-temperature cooking or who objects to the taste of olive oil. The oil has a very mild flavor and appears to stand up to its reputation for having a high smoke point in the dishes I've cooked with it so far.<br /><br />As another reviewer pointed out the cans _are_ also rather cute and they do look nice in the pantry next to the home-canned veggies. I hope Amazon will continue to carry this oil.

review/text: We were given a bag of these from some college kids who were thankful we delivered something for them as they did not have a truck.  They sat on the counter for a while before I tried them and then - they were addictive!  There are 24 smaller bags inside with maybe a Tablespoon or two full of hot peas inside each.  They are spicy but not unbearably hot like Wasabi Peas.<br /><br />The only reason this got 4 Stars instead of 5 is because of the price.  Currently, $5.35 per bag is being charged plus shipping.  I purchase them at our local Asian grocery store and they are $2.59.  That is a pretty big price difference.  So, if you have an Asian grocery near you, try them first - if not, go ahead and purchase them here because you will love them!

review/summary: Awesome chutney
review/text: Mint is one of my favorite herbs so when I ran across this chutney in the supermarket the other day, I had to purchase a jar.  I was completely impressed by this high quality blend.  The taste is not overpowering.  While this chutney is made with serrano peppers and cumin powder, I did not find the chutney to be hot.  The heat provided from the peppers and cumin blends fabulously with the coriander and mint and the eating experience is marked by a progression of different flavors with the first taste being a sugary coriander and mint blend followed by the heat of the pepper and cumin powder.<br /><br />The first ingredient for the chutney is water but I did not find the blend to be watery.  I eat my chutney with poppadums (either ready made by Truly Indian or the cook your own version by Lijjat) and I had no problem with this chutney staying on the poppadum.  The second ingredient in this chutney is coriander and the user can definitely taste its presence.<br /><br />I purchased this product at my local Meijer supermarket (in the international foods section despite being made in the United States).  I paid about 5 dollars for a 7.5 ounce jar.<br /><br />I love this product and will purchase again.  Swad makes other chutneys, including a coriander chutney for those interested in other flavors.<br /><br />Amazon does not yet have the product ingredients posted. Here they are:  Water, coriander, mint, serrano peppers, coconut, salt, soybean oil, cumin powder, sugar, coriander powder, citric acid, guar gum, xanthum gum, FD&C Blue #1 and Yellow #5.<br /><br />There are approximately 12 servings per 7.5 ounce jar.  Each 1 tablespoon serving has 15 calories, 1 gram of fat, .5 grams saturated fat, and 260 mg of sodium.

review/summary: Nutrageous is the best
review/text: Nutrageous bars are THE best candy bar ever. The secret is in the nuts, they truly are loaded up with peanuts, not peanuts chopped to a paste but real actual nuts. That and the combination of chocolate and peanut butter is to die for. The problem is you cannot find Nutrageous anywhere anymore. So glad to find them here.

review/text: I got this as part of their sampler pack, to see if I'd like any of their coffees.  Many of the other varieties I am not fond of, as they are much too light and beany for my taste.  This one of the last ones I've tried and really, it's wonderful.  It's nice and rich and dark.  It brews a very satisfying cup of coffee.  It's close to Starbucks Verona coffee (the only starbucks beans I like enough to buy), but slightly less in-your-face.  I highly recommend it for people who don't like weak coffee.

review/text: This is VERY tasty coffee for the money- milk chocolate notes,mild acidity, every bit as good as Starbucks, Allegro etc. blends. Only downside is, direct from Coffee Direct it's roasted within 3-4 days, through Amazon it can be 6 weeks old or older so check the freshness code on your bag. Also whole bean coffee should ideally be used up within 2 weeks of opening or it deteriorates so we share our bag with friends. Really though we haven't noticed the flavor going off much in a month but I wouldn't let it sit around longer than that.

However, recently ordered Dark Roast House Blend and this is the best. Smooth, full bodied, excellent flavor, but not bitter. We mix it half and half with Great Value Dark Roast to stretch the cost.

review/summary: Decent taste - 5 servings per box
review/text: I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says: "10 bars" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars).<br />The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case.<br /><br />On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these).

review/summary: Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me
review/text: I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.

review/text: I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2" wide, 4" long, and 1/4" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away.

review/summary: Great taste, but not very filling
review/text: I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon.

review/summary: Overpriced! Not what you are expecting.
review/text: My main beef with this product is with the labeling.<br /><br />The box is labeled very deceptively. This goes double when inspecting the packaging from the Web (as you are doing now). "10 bars" is prominently displayed on the box. Lo and behold, once you open the box, only five bars are present. Upon further inspection, you see that printed in mice-type on the box is "5 two count packages". The net weight of the entire box is 7.4 ounces. That's less than one cup of granola. That's when you realize you've been had.<br /><br />You can buy a mega-size box of Nature Valley granola bars from a warehouse club for less money than the "Pack of 2" you'll find here. I mention Nature Valley because in a blind taste test you won't be able to distinguish that brand from these Clif bars.<br /><br />Seriously, if they are selling them for this much on Amazon, I'd be shocked and chagrined to see what they go for at the camping stores which is their retailer of origin.<br /><br />I consider myself embarrassed to have been duped so badly on this one. Clif has seriously damaged their brand credibility. Live and learn.

review/text: I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks. I find that I need something with me in case I get hungry. Fruit doesn't travel well. Granola bars do well in my bag. But chewy bars get too sticky. And most crunchy granola bars are so hard I am always worried I would lose a tooth or two. I saw these at Nutrition S'mart yesterday and picked them up. I tried one before I got home. They have a great crunch, not too hard, and a wonderful flavor. Now I want to try the other flavors but my local Nutrition S'mart only had 2.

review/text: the best part was the white chocolate, but you can buy that anywhere for cheap<br /><br />this crap crumbles into thousands of pieces when you take a bite, so you can't even anywhere with you. Gotta eat it over the kitchen sink as it is so messy<br /><br />avoid this at all costs. Buy the chewy counterpart instead

review/summary: Great taste but some drawbacks
review/text: These taste great but they are small bars.  My biggest complaint is that I have to eat these while standing over a sink or trash to avoid making a mess.  I've gone through 6 or 7 boxes and not one package has had two completely intact bars.  Most of the time there are just lots of crumbles from the edges of the bars but occasionally you'll find a bar that was jostled around enough to be broken into three or more pieces.  Certainly, this is a combination of the composition of the granola bar and lack of completely protective packaging.  But be warned that you will have lots of crumbled Clif Crunch bars if you order this through Amazon.

review/summary: a dark chocolate lovers' delight, a blueberry lover's disappointment
review/text: "Cocoa" is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly-sweet than many others.  They taste like they contain dark, as opposed to the easy-to-find milk, chocolate. I recommend them to dark chocolate lovers and ordered three more boxes, straight-away.<br /><br />On the other hand, the blueberry bars are a loser, in my opinion. There is only a faint blueberry flavor.  This blueberry-lover would just love one choc-full of dried blueberries, adding the appropriate blueberry flavor to these crunchy snack bars.

review/text: I came across these granola bars as part of the Subscribe & Save program.  Much to my dismay, the subscription service option was discontinued.  They are so good, however, I've continued to purchase them.  Even my children really like them and they usually only like granola bars if they are packed with so much sugar and covered in chocolate to the point you can't distinguish them from a candy bar.<br /><br />I like the Clif brand and what the company is trying to do, besides offering a more wholesome granola bar without compromising taste.<br /><br />The granola bars are certified organic by QAI and packaging is made from 100% recycled material.  Hey, every little bit helps when you're trying to reduce your carbon footprint.

The only thing I would mention is that these bars are crumbly and do not "travel well" compared to the softer bars out there.  So I think we will have some softer bars for travel and these bars when travel is not an issue.  Hope that makes sense!

review/text: I like Clif bars because they taste good but not great enough that you want to eat a whole lot of them. These crunch bars are no exception. I usually have clif bars in my school bag to stave off hunger during classes before succumbing to the call of a vending machine.<br /><br />The Chocolate Macadamia Nut flavor is a bit too sweet for my tastes which was a little surprising for a Clif bar (but it is chocolate). I like that each packet comes with two thin bars rather than one big granola bar - great for sharing or portioning.

It tastes good and it has better list of ingredients than the more processed ones from Nature's Valley, etc.  But the thing crumbles too much.  It doesn't hold together very well and from the moment you open the package, there's crumbs all over you.  Just be aware of it.  It's tasty and crunchy as they say on the package.

review/summary: Decent granola bar, but the packaging is a bit misleading
review/text: When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a "10-pack" has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella.

review/summary: Crunched Crunch
review/text: Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars.
