review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/summary: Delicious breakfast treat; also good deal from Amazon
review/text: I have been eating these for some time now and greatly enjoy them.  Unfortunately, the item is not offered in any of the grocery stores in my new home town and I was excited to find these via Amazon.  I now have these set up for regular shipment via the subscription service and its a great convenience and great value.<br /><br />Pricing is also good for package.  I buy the 6-count boxes and there are 6 boxes (36 oatmeal bars total).  My cost, including shipping is about $15.50 and I previously had to pay $9.99 at BJ's Wholesale for 24 bars. Regular grocery stores sell each box for about $3.25 so I figure the Amazon deal is a good one for me.

review/text: These are so darn yummy, they are out  of this world good and just are perfect anytime.  They hit the spot and really leave such a great feeling after you are done eating one.  They tate great just right out of the package but you can also microwave them to make them warm and they are amazing tasting that way.  It is the perfect on the go breakfast when you are short on time.  They are so sweet, love the amount of sweet.  The brown sugar is there but it is not overpowering like some brown sugar flavored bars are.  You will fall in love with these.  I have not tried the other two flavores but I dont like raisins and I dont much like bananas so this is my to go quaker bar of choice.

review/summary: Tasty, mildly spicy gravy for rice or roti
review/text: Mirch (or mirchi) ka salan is a dish from Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, in southern India, often served with the local biryani, and it is intended to be a very wet curry.<br /><br />Overall, this is another winner among the pre-packaged Indian meals:  a mildly spicy, beautifully-colored, creamy-textured sauce for rice or bread made with a base of ground peanuts, sesame seeds, and almonds.  The flavor is very complex: the onion, tamarind, and coconut give it a slight sweetness; the garlic, ginger, tamarind, and curry leaves add a bit of tangy bite; and the large chunks of chili peppers lend a very mild heat.  I like to add cayenne powder to increase the heat a bit.  It is also good with a few raisins and almonds sprinkled on top and I have added whole cubanelle peppers steamed in the microwave to bulk it up into a complete meal when served with brown basmati rice.<br /><br />The quality of this product is similar to what might be found in a standard Indian buffet restaurant here in the U.S.  Some people may not like the flavor of some typical Indian spices, especially coriander, which has a soapy taste to certain palates, but fans of Indian food who like coriander should enjoy eating this.<br /><br />There are no preservatives and the mirch ka salan is vegetarian but not vegan as it contains some ghee.  As is typical of these retort-packaged Indian meals, it is high in sodium and fat.  As others have noted, it is easy to pour off a spoonful or so of oil before serving.<br /><br />Nutrition facts:<br /><br />Note that each packet is 2.5 servings but realistically is the right amount for one or possibly two people depending on what it is served with so adjust accordingly:<br /><br />PER SERVING:<br />Calories 220<br />Calories from fat 160<br />Total fat 18g 28% RDA<br />Saturated Fat 4.5g 23% RDA<br />Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 3 mg 1% RDA<br />Sodium 650mg 27% RDA<br />Total Carbohydrate 9g 3% RDA<br />Dietary Fiber 2g 8% RDA<br />Sugars 3g<br />Protein 5g<br />Vitamin A 0% RDA<br />Calcium 20% RDA<br />Vitamin C 0% RDA<br />Iron 15% RDA<br /><br />In addition to lowering the fat and sodium, it would be nice if Kitchens of India would shift to printing or labeling the foil pouch and not enclosing it in an individual box for these case sales in order to reduce unnecessary waste.  The package also shows whole pepppers, and while there are large chunks, they certainly don't look like the illustration.<br /><br />The sodium and fat reduce the rating to four stars, even though the texture and flavor warrant five stars.

review/summary: A Mixed Bag
review/text: Some of the early reviews for this entree are pretty harsh.  I figured it couldn't be THAT bad so I bought a bunch at the blow out price.  It would have to be pretty bad to be worth less than a buck a box... unless it was inedible of course, and then I'd have wasted $25 or so.  I like Indian food so I took a chance.<br /><br />The first box had me thinking the worst.  I tried it alone, heated of course.  It was not a taste I was used to and, as another reviewer noted, it does look gross.  More importantly, there was grit in it, like sand.  Not a lot but enough to disturb. About every third mouthful I'd crunch on a bit of grit and think "yuck," to myself, "the bad reviews were right."<br /><br />But I bought a lot so I persevered.  The next box I mixed with rice.  Definitely an improvement.  More like a real meal and -- surprisingly -- no grit.  A relief.<br /><br />A box or two later I decided to add some cooked chicken.  Even better, and thankfully still no return of the sandy grit.<br /><br />I finished off the first tray (a 6-pack) this way plus with toasted hazel nuts mixed into the last 2 boxes.  Finally got it tasting just right for my palate.<br /><br />With add-ins of your choice this entree can be a pretty nice meal, filling and relatively healthy though high in fat and salt.  Alone as it comes I would only give it three stars, or "ok" as the star system rates. That assumes no grit.  I would rate my modified version higher but that's not the product as sold.<br /><br />One other thing I noticed as I started in on the 2nd tray of six entrees is that the spicy hot temperature rose steeply.  The 2nd tray may well have been from a different batch so quality control may be uneven.  At least the sandy grit hasn't made a reappearance.... yet....<br /><br />It turned out to be a chance worth taking for me but I can easily imagine that others may not find it paying off for them even at a rock-bottom asking price.  Your mileage may vary.

review/text: This product is marketed as a dinner or soup, and I can see how some people would be put off by it when consumed this way. Instead, I use it as a sauce for baked chicken. Simply lay out some drumsticks in a casserole dish, pour Kitchens of India Ready To Eat Mirch Ka Salan over the chicken (one package for every 6 drumsticks), cover and bake at 350 degrees for about an hour. Everyone who has tried it wants the recipe. They are always amazed at how simple this is to make.

review/text: Its that weird feeling when you try the same thing over again and feel different altogether. The first time I've tried them, they tasted bland. The second time, they tasted amazing.

review/text: I have curry pastes from this company that are outstanding...but this particular product just isn't good at all. My hubby loves Indian, too, and he is not a picky eater--but even he told me to find a new home for the boxes we bought of this stuff! I don't know how to describe it...it's kinda vinegary and sour and it has big hunks of banana peppers in it. It isn't creamy and the texture is almost grainy. I tried to rescue it with coconut milk and it really didn't help. The "curry" in it is very faint and it's just...well...you might like it but we sure didn't. As I said, we've bought many other items from Amazon in this brand of Indian foods, but this is just the opposite of the other items. It just isn't good.

review/text: This is an excellent brand, and I've enjoyed their other recipes, but not this dish. What you get is almost 100% sauce -- an extremely heavy sauce made of finely ground nuts. You will need to add your own vegetables to make a real dish out of it. The sauce is so heavy that even though it contains some nice spices, it still begs for more flavor.

review/summary: Good Flavor and Just Spicy Enough - Recommended
review/text: Kitchens of India "Mild Chili Pepper Curry" is an authentic Indian dish that has a great flavor and just enough spicy heat to make it interesting. We are fortunate to have Indian friends who occasionally invite us to dinner but since we can't always count on an invitation whenever a craving comes on one us, these pre-made packets are a reasonable substitute. Here are my observations:<br /><br />Pros -<br />+ Good Flavor; as noted above, this tastes very good to people that like Indian food (my mother hates it)<br />+ Mildly Spicy; this rates on low to medium of the spicy scale, might be too much heat for some since it "stays with you"<br />+ Low Carb; 22.5g Total Carbs - 5g Dietary Fiber = 17.5 Net Carbs in each packet (see serving size info in "Misc", below)<br /><br />Cons -<br />- "Not as Pictured"; the picture on the packaging shows nice whole peppers, but they are actually cut up in the sauce<br />- Oily; this has a lot of oil that will rise to the top when cooking in a pot (we skim some off)<br />- High in Calories; each packet has 550 calories (400 from fat - but no Trans Fats)<br /><br />Misc -<br />* Serving Size; package says 2.5 per packet, we find that two packets when served with rice and bread is enough for our family of four<br />* Filling; this is a very heavy sauce based dish<br /><br />While not really a standalone meal, this is a good entree that can be used as the main course. We recently put it out when we had a BBQ and found that it also made an interesting topping on Hot Dogs.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: Combined with white rice, each packet is good for 2 solid meals, perhaps 3 if lower proportions of curry are used.  Heated easily in the microwave or on the range; I recommend adding chicken if you favor a meat option.  However, despite my carnivorous leanings, I've found myself generally preferring not to trouble with preparing any meats.  It's good and spicy compared to most food in Indiana, but it seems most everyone here can take it just fine with a little extra rice.  It's not too sweet in my opinion, but be prepared for a some excess grease.  Good stuff overall, and super easy.

review/summary: Sorry, But Not Their Best
review/text: Out of all of the "ready-to-eat" offerings from kitchens of India this is the least tasteful I've had so far.  I absolutely strongly recommend you combine this with some other starchy food like rice, naan, potatoes, or anything.  Eating it combined with something else makes it at least tolerable while eating it alone simply isn't.  The texture can be a bit gritty, it's similiar to eating food with an excessive amount of turmeric - even though it's not an ingredient in this product.  I say "can be gritty" because the quality of the product seems to be a bit inconsistent.  A few will be better than others, a few will make you want to throw all of it out.  Definitely won't be purchasing this one again!

I use 1/4 head of green cabbage and a 1/2 cup of frozen peas per pouch. I heat/cook these in the pan with a small amount of oil until the cabbage becomes soft before adding the curry paste. then I just wait for the curry paste to heat up and then serve with rice. cheap, quick, and healthier than stuff that's not as healthy.

review/summary: Mild Chili Pepper Curry - an OK product
review/text: This particular product of Kitchens of India is much cheaper than their other similar products. Probably because it is not good. (It was eight USD when I bought it.)<br /><br />1) Product doesn't appear anything like as depicted in the picture. We have consumed two packets so far, but haven't seen a single whole pepper (like in the picture) in it.<br />2) If you are health concious, drain the floating oil by making a small opening in the inner packet before you heat the product. You will feel much better knowing that that much less oil has gone into your body.<br />3) Product taste is acceptable. We will definitely consume the remaining 4 packets over the next few months, but we definitely will not reorder this product.<br /><br />Since the taste is acceptable, much of the oil can be drained, and the product is cheap and eligible for free shipping, it is OK to order once and see if you'll like it.

review/text: I loved the taste of this preparation [so I'm ordering more]. However it has more calories in its 10 oz pack than any of the other ready-to-eat Indian dishes I've tried. One pack has a total of 550 cals [compared to the Tasty Bites preparations which have about 300 cal or so]. I think I'll try and drain out the oil with the next pack I heat up.

review/summary: inexpensive change of pace, greasy, a bit firy
review/text: To be honest, it looks like something that came out of a dog. Fortunately, it tastes much better than it looks. It's greasy. You will want rice with it, or bread, or something to soak up the oil.<br /><br />It's surprisingly high in calcium, which is good. It's unsurprisingly high in fats and salt but, hey, live a little. It's not seriously spicy but, it made me feel right warm after a package ("2.5 servings" or 550 Calories).<br /><br />Good emergency food. It's palatable, it will last a long time without refrigeration, and it can be quickly and simply prepared in a variety of ways.

review/text: I absolutely love Indian food and have tried other flavors by Kichens of India, but this one is pretty bad.  It has an overpowering sour taste and I couldn't finish mine.  Try some of the other flavors instead (curry mixed vegetables, kidney beans - I forget their complete names).

review/text: I've tried a number of Kitchens of India products and this one is now by far my favourite!  I use it as a sauce with chicken and vegetables.  I do add a few hot chili peppers to make it a little stronger.  The depth of the flavor is amazing.  I'm gonna buy a bunch more in case they run out.

review/summary: Tastes good, maybe a little too mild?
review/text: Tastes good.  The only problem I have with it, is that for how full of fat, calories and sodium it is, it doesn't have a very powerful flavor.  Meaning, you need to use lots of it for an average portion of rice.<br /><br />Probably best used as a gravy to cook meat or tofu in.

review/summary: Actually, not bad at all.........
review/text: ....but, for some reason there seems to be more oil in these entrees.  I love the KOI curry dishes, and this one isn't  bad at all.  A little spicy though even though it says "mild" so its not something I would eat often.  But, I thought it was pretty good and satisfying and have added it to my pantry for the days I want something a little different.  But, their curry and butter chicken meals are fantastic, and they are 5 stars for sure.

review/summary: Quick and easy
review/text: I like that this is ready to eat.  I used it over some sliced roasted chicken.  I ate it with rice, it was great like this.  I don't think I'd like it as much just right out of the pack.  It could be overpowering that way.  The heat is just right - warm really, not hot.  Less than a medium salsa but it definitely has some warmth.  It has a tad bit of sourness that combines well in the nut sauce.  It's really great for me because I like Indian food very often while my family does not.  There are Kitchens of India flavors that I like better, but I would order this again, definitely.  The color is more pale than the picture.  I like the taste a lot better than the color.  The texture, to me, is fine!  It's a nut based sauce after all.

review/summary: A bit hot, but OK on rice or pasta.
review/text: A bit hot for me, so I may have to stretch out my subscription.  I live alone, so I broke it down into 3 small servings and used on top of rice.  This helped tone the heat. Waring for some with a touchy stomach like mine; DO NOT take a mouth full without a little taste test first.  The spice can cause stomach upset in some people.  (I have stomach trouble and this was to much for me.  Cutting the serving amount and adding rice allowed me to enjoy some of the spicy heat without killing my stomach.) Curry is not everyone's "cup of tea" but it can be enjoyed in moderation. I am quite sure some people will love it.  But for me it is just OK.

review/text: I have really enjoyed these curries. I usually warm some in the microwave and dip pita or use bread to eat it. It's very healthy with lots of healthy oils in it.<br /><br />I do find it to be a bit on the salty side. To cut down on the saltiness, I saute cauliflower in a pan and warm up the curry over it. The fresh cauliflower adds a new dimension to this dish and makes it a lighter meal.

review/text: I was impressed by the list of ingredients.  No chemical preservatives were used, which is nice.  It tasted really quite good, a nice bit of spice despite the title 'mild'. (I'm not too wimpy when it comes to spicy food).  I sauted some mahimahi filets, added this sauce and some frozen spinach. It was a good combination.<br /><br />I would likely buy this, and try other flavors in the future, but probably only if I could replicate the deal I had on this (~$4/6k).<br /><br />Enjoy.

In order to eat more whole grains I decided to order Kashi and several of Kitchens of India items to mix with for a great tasting and healthy meal.  Kitchens of India will not let the "well seasoned" taster of India's cusine down and does offer the new taster a wonderful and varied experience.  I can't imagne going though a day without at least one portion.  If spice and taste are what you look for - look no more as you have found it with Kitchens of India.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: So I finally got a hold of this stuff at the Metropolitan Market in Seattle.  The color is bright neon orange, unlike this yellow in the product picture.  The first thing I noticed was the smell, which reminds me of sodas I had as a kid in the late 80's.  I can't exactly put my finger on it, it's like sweet-tarts with out the sour and a high quality seltzer smell. Maybe its the fact that it uses sugar as a sweetener? The flavor is quite good and it first tastes like a dreamsicle, creamy and orange, then a complex tingly tartness that finishes cleanly without being too sweet.<br /><br />Is it worth paying for shipping to try it?  I'd say try to find it in some of your high-end local grocery stores first to see if you can save the money.  If you're curious, I don't think you'll be disappointed and shelling out the dough to satisfy your curiosity.  It's definitely one of the best sodas I've ever tried.  I can tell why it's the #1 soda in Scotland.  It's refreshing and interesting without being over the top.<br /><br />I would prefer it over a Mexican Coke on a hot day, and would go great with any sandwich, especially something like a bagel with cream-cheese and lox, or turkey on rye. But if you're having pizza, a Coke would be much better.  If you're still reading, another one of my favorite sodas is Reed's Ginger Beer Extra, which is spicy.  Another good soda is Fentimans Victorian Lemonade, which is a satisfying sour soda, that washes down msg-laden Chinese food like bitter green tea can't.

And like KFC's secret recipe, supposedly the recipe is a secret that only 2 people in the world know and is stored in a bank vault in Switzerland? The Barr's soda company is so protective that only the chairman Robin Barr blends the unique combination of 32 flavors. Now that may all be marketing hype, but it tastes good and is hard to find in USA.

review/summary: Mate Tea is Great, Chai Tea is Great, Chai Spice Mate is So-So
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TNXSZG">Guayaki Traditional Loose Yerba Mate</a> is a personal favorite, as is Peet's Coffee and Tea Masala Chai. Both of them have their own unique qualities that are great in a cup of tea, Guayaki's Mate in it's own unique taste, and Peet's Masala Chai in its pungent and fragrant mix of spices and black tea.<br /><br />So, naturally, I thought that I'd like Chai Mate. Wow... was I in for a surprise. The resulting mixture was a disappointingly weak blend of Mate and other ingredients. Now, I believe a great cup of Chai to be one that you can smell from thirty feet away - and you absolutely will get that with a good correctly brewed cup of Peet's. Pour some cream into it, and the dark color of the tea blends with the cream into a delicious looking cup of tea. Or even enjoy it plain. Or just with sugar. And the same with Loose Yerba Mate, you know the taste, you want a strong cup of tea, and you want it's flavor.<br /><br />With Chai Mate, you get a weak tasting Mate taste and a insipid tasting Chai taste that overall smells way too healthy for Chai and way too weak for Mate. Overall these two don't mix - neither, incidentally, does cream... pour some of that into the tea and it will look watery, thin, and not very inviting.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, buy the Traditional Loose Yerba Mate and then buy a tin of Peet's Masala Chai and have two cups of GREAT tasting tea, not one cup of bland, insipid, and watery tea.

review/summary: Having just eaten this for dinner, I have advice and raves
review/text: First of all, don't be put off by the price. If you've kept track of grocery store receipts lately or the sharp increase in basic foods over the last year, you may see how this product could save you time, gas and MONEY.<br />At the time of this writing, it cost about $16.88 for four packages of this mix. EACH package easily serves 8-16 people with soup left over.<br /><br />While the instructions note to add 4 cups of water or a water and broth combo, we quickly discovered we had to double or even triple the liquid added. No problem there, because we had more soup!<br /><br />If you don't have fresh veggies or spices around, this will suffice as is and it is thick and satisfying. If you garden, you'll improve the taste by adding fresh chopped parsley, garlic and whatever veggies you want. A can of tomatoes (or fresh, chopped ones) does no harm. This is a mix you can play with, add ingredients and spices.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: this is not a salted mix. It is full of split peas, barley, lentils, whole wheat pasta, dehydrated spinach, tomato, onion, etc. If you don't use salt, consider adding a salt substitute. I also added basil. It was delightful, quick and is now a pantry staple.<br /><br />Nutrition: 330 calories (1/2 cup) only 20 calories from fat. Significant source of iron at 22% of the Daily Value. Protein: 20 grams.

review/summary: Superb soup that you can change umpteen times just by adding good things you like!
review/text: I must admit that I didn't read enough to know what this soup would be like. What I mean is that I didn't really go through the product description as closely as I should have. I expected this to have a lot of dehydrated veggies in it, but alas--no such luck! That, however, is my deal, not the manufacturers.<br /><br />This soup is mostly lentils, peas, and veggie pasta. Not a terrible combo, really. In fact, it's pretty delicious. When I saw the first bag I pulled out of the box, I thought, "oh, no. I'm going to have to WORK to make this soup taste good." I was wrong. Last night, I opened the first bag up and made a delicous soup with just the ingredients in the bag, some chopped garlic, some leftover sauteed chicken, and a chopped tomato. Talk about yummy! It was hearty, "clean" tasting soup. By that I mean that the flavors didn't glom up and become one huge mess. I could taste the lentils, the barley, the peas. And the chicken, which I used very little of, was enough to flavor the broth a bit. It was really the one tomato and the garlic that made everything come together, so my advice to you is to go crazy with what you add. My next batch will be made with onion/veggie stock and zucchini, carrots, and a bit of chopped spinach. I can't wait!

review/summary: Not only is it not vegetable soup, it's not even soup.
review/text: To begin, let me say that Bob's Red Mill makes quality products and this soup mix is no exception.  The ingredients are all natural and organic and this is unquestionably healthy food.  I've ordered a number of Bob's products and I think Bob's Red Mill is the kind of company that we should feel good about supporting.<br /><br />However, not only is this not vegetable soup, but in my view, it really isn't even soup.  It is a combination of lentils, split peas, barley and pasta alphabet letters made from some form of ground tomato & spinach powder or the like.  But these alphabet letters don't taste like vegetables.<br /><br />So, this is basically a mostly legume-based soup starter rather than a vegetable soup mix.  If you cook this "soup" as directed, it will have essentially no flavor other than the very bland taste of the legumes that are present.<br /><br />There is no seasoning whatsoever, no visible vegetables, and it does not taste like vegetable soup.<br /><br />Now others have noted that you can add your own spices, seasonings, vegetables and meat and that's true.  And once you do this, you might indeed have a very good soup, depending of course upon your cooking skills, or lack thereof.<br /><br />But if you're not a good cook, and/or are unwilling to add your own seasonings and ingredients, then you will likely not have a good soup.  Conversely, with most other brands I've tried, if you purchase soup mix and cook it, then you will indeed have soup.  With this "soup" mix, if you purchase it and cook it, you won't have what I consider to be soup.<br /><br />If you are planning on serving this "soup" to guests and you simply throw it in a pot and cook as per the directions, the end result will likely not be very good.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a good soup base.  But I don't think it should be called soup and calling it vegetable soup is even more of a stretch, because there are no visible vegetables or vegetable flavor.<br /><br />5 stars for the ingredients which are organic, fresh and very healthy.  But 1 star because most people would be unhappy with this "soup", if cooked as directed.  So we'll average the 2 and give it a 3 star rating.<br /><br />I can't tell you it's not worth buying, but if you purchase this, it's important to understand exactly what you are getting.

review/summary: Great for low sodium diets
review/text: Let me start out by saying that this is my 1st review, I have depended on other reviewers here on Amazon to help me with many purchases. I have rarely been let down. Thank you all.<br />My husband has congestive heart failure and is on a very low sodium diet (1000 mg. max. daily). We thought that he would never eat soup again until we tried this prouduct. It's really hard to make soup that tastes good without adding salt. It was easy and very tasty to accomplish this feat with Bob's Red Mill soup mix. I sauteed some onions in a tad of butter, chopped some carrots and added the left overs from a (low sodium seasoned) roast beef that I had frozen. I threw this in the pot with the soup mix and added a packet of Herb-ox sodium free beef bouillon per cup of water. My husband had soup tonight for the first time since he had heart surgery and he loved it. I enjoyed it myself but did add a sprinkle of sea salt for myself. It was so good that I just had to thank everyone for recommending it.

review/text: I absolutely love this soup mix!  It has become a staple in my diet.  It is quite easy to make, and it tastes great.  I also love how cheap it is.  I use 1 cup of mix per batch, and there are 4 cups (approx) per bag.  Each batch gives me 4 large servings.  So that means this box gives me 64 servings!  At the subscribe and save price that means $0.20 per serving!  I dare you to find a meal that fills you up this much, is this good for you, and only costs $0.20!!!!<br /><br />Here's my recipe:<br />1 cup of the Veggie Soup Mix<br />6 cups of water<br />6 TB of Vegetable Broth Powder (you can also use bullion or liquid broth)<br />1 can of Tomatoes (either diced, stewed or half of each)<br />season with Basil, Oregano, Marjoram, Salt & Pepper to taste<br />  Throw all this in a pot and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.<br />It's that simple!<br /><br />Try it, you won't regret it...

review/text: Bob's Red Mill Soup Mix is a nutritional powerhouse and a big money-saver. Add the chopped veggies of your choice, tomato paste, some extra brown rice or whole-grain pasta and you have a satisfying meal that you'll especially enjoy on a cold day.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, without the overpowering saltiness of other soup mixes. You can make it extra-hearty by tossing in chopped chicken and using chicken stock instead of plain water.<br /><br />Unless you're serving a crowd, you'll have lots left over. I like to freeze the rest and have a home-made meal in reserve for those nights when you're too tired to cook. (So much better than wasting money on take-out in a tough economy!)<br /><br />Love it!

review/text: I made just a single bag of this soup mix for my work lunches and added some fresh mixed vegetables, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar -- the soup came out more like a stew (because I used some starchy veggies) and I loved the chewy texture the barley added and the creaminess of the split peas.  I must have gotten at least 2 gallons of soup from this single bag and I'm still eating it a week later, having frozen some of it.  Very frugal and healthy!

review/summary: Great addition to other recipes, and a decent soup
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Soup Mix is a blend of unseasoned green split peas, yellow split peas, barley, lentils and vegetable pasta.  The instructions suggest using one part mix and four parts water along with your favorite seasonings.<br /><br />I first tried making it with just some dried dill weed, salt, and pepper.  The soup came out feeling a bit insubstantial because the mix doesn't have any big chunks of veggies or pasta.  The broth tasted great though, so I took out my hand blender and I blended the soup until it reached a consistency similar to a thick split pea soup.  I added some Tabasco sauce and cumin and the soup ended up really good.<br /><br />The mix is also really great for mixing in with rice.  If you use a rice cooker, try adding one cup of the soup mix for every two or three cups or rice.  Increase the amount of water accordingly, as if you just added another cup of rice.  For example, if you're cooking 2 cups of rice and 1 cup of veggie mix, fill the water up to the 3 cup line.<br /><br />Overall, this soup mix is a great addition for other recipes or if you're willing to modify it with your own ingredients and cooking techniques.

review/text: Made this soup last night. It was sooo easy and yummy! I was not sure how much doctoring would be necessary to make it tasty for everyone and was surprised to find that it needed little help. I followed the directions on the bag and mixed with vegie stock/water (I had to add a lot more than listed!) and some of the basic vegies on hand - onions, garlic, carrot, celery - that was it! I tasted and it was delicious the way it was.(with salt and pepper to tase). I did not add milk to make the creamed version as I really liked the clean simple flavors of the mix. It was so easy, required no special ingredients or trip to the grocery store. Love it!

review/summary: Best Veggie Soup Mix.
review/text: I will be the first to admit that I am not usually one to recommend any of the higher priced soup mixes.  Being a an old time soup maker from way back, I am not at all opposed to soup mixes for I have a couple of them I favor, and are even reviewed here on Amazon. Bobs is probably the most expensive out of the lot however.  I have never bought Bobs mix from Amazon for it is available locally, (and fortunately at the same price Amazon offers it for). Its easy to imagine that a veggie soup mix is just about the easiest blend of mix to come up with.  They pretty much all have the same ingredients as to peas, peppers, corn, etc.  Its just the stock that is usually the random element as to its real flavor and return factor.  Bobs red mill mix however has definitely broken the mold as far as freeze dried veggies.  They have to be the tastiest that I have ever eaten.  And believe me, as an old time camper and hiker with decades of experience with one pot dinners over an open fire, that is definitely going some.  I have tried just about everything that you can buy, and made everything that isn't.  Trust me, Bobs has proven to me that not all dried veggies are anywhere near made the same.  As for the stock, it is very flavorful.  I would have to say just a notch or two below my own stock.  (And trust me again, that is very much going some)!  The only item I should mention is the same thing many other reviewers here have taken note of.  This is a no salt soup mix.  Not low salt, but none at all.  I really think it is going some in the other direction to think someone could eat this without any salt at all and throughly enjoy it.  But considering how really fresh and delicious it tastes, adding your own level of salt is easy, and for some a very convenient alternative. If its variety you favor, consider this mix a base for anything you like.  I have added beef to it, hamburger, chicken, pork, and even Italian sausage and they are all remembered as some of the best meals I have ever eaten.  Franky I think this is the best soup mix I have ever had, plain, or doctored.  I recommend buying it here on Amazon if you can't find it locally.  And that you order enough of it to qualify for the free shipping.  Believe me after you have had this soup once, you will want it again and again.... Highly recommend.

review/summary: Good for using your own stock and other modifications!
review/text: (UPDATED -- see new info at end)<br /><br />Whenever we have meat with bones, we save the bones and scraps, including fat we'll later discard, and make stock (easy: just cover with water and add cut-up whole carrots w/ skin, cut-up whole onions w/ skin and cut-up whole washed celery with leaves and stems, several whole peppercorns, a few broken bay-leaves, and a couple of whole cloves; boil for several hours until everything falls apart; refrigerate until stock is solid like gelatin; remove ALL fat congealed on top of cold stock; heat again, to get one more crack at the flavors from the solids before discarding them; and strain in very fine strainer -- can now use as is, or clarify for bouillon by boiling 10 minutes with added egg whites & shells and/or other precipitates and then straining a few times through cheesecloth).<br /><br />It's wonderful to have this almost free stock.  But sometimes we don't know what to do with it or have extra stock we freeze, hoping we'll need it later.<br /><br />One frequent answer:  Bob's Red Mill veggie soup mix!  Add one cup of mix to 1 quart of fresh or frozen stock, simmer for 1 hour with or without additions, and we're set.  My husband tends to be very picky but absolutely loves this.  We both love that we control the amount of sodium and seasonings, either during cooking or individually at the table.  We also love that it takes virtually no time to prepare for cooking and is done in an hour -- "fast food", as long as we plan our rendezvous at table 60 minutes in advance!<br /><br />Frequent modifications:  (1) use instead of homemade stock any type of commercial stock, bouillon, etc. or just plain water, either in 4:1 ratio or up to 8:1 ratio; (2) add virtually anything from your pantry, fridge or freezer: cooked meat, fish or vegetables near the end just to get heated through, uncooked meat, fish or vegetables nearer the beginning to have plenty of time to cook, or grains or pasta in time to cook according to their package directions (but add extra water or stock to make up for liquid they'll absorb); (3) blend most but not all the soup near the end using an outside blender or food processor, or an immersion blender or potato masher right in the pot; (4) add fresh or dried herbs or other flavorings of your choice such as soy sauce or other ethnic sauces near the end; and (5) add milk, evaporated milk or cream near the end (or a roux or flour dissolved in water, as long as you simmer at least 5 minutes afterwards to cook the flour) to make a cream soup or gravy-like soup.<br /><br />But remember:  the basic soup itself, no modifications, is also great.  Have it your way, and enjoy!  A greatly appreciated staple in our house.<br /><br />UPDATE 7-23-12:  Our "new favorite" is to make this soup in a 4-1 ratio (4 parts stock to 1 part soup mix), add chopped raw onions, celery and carrots with the mix ("mirepoix", except you actually eat them "as is" at the end), also add with the mix some minced or chopped fresh garlic and a can of diced tomatoes with juice, add microwave-reheated frozen part-veggie meatballs or crumbled part-veggie leftover meatloaf plus any chopped fresh greens or sprouts from the vegetable drawer during the last 5 minutes of cooking, and top with rich, non-fat Greek yogurt (plain, of course) plus salt and pepper if desired when serving.  Delish!  It's now my husband's favorite soup.  So fast and easy, too -- five minutes of prep followed by 1 hour of unattended cooking and 5 more minutes at the end.  Incredibly fast, low-cost, low-cal and nutritious weeknight dinner or weekend lunch for family and lucky guests.  Leftovers are fabulous, too, for a second meal or for a reheatable lunch even days later!  Add even more flavor if you like by including one or two bay leaves during cooking and discarding them before serving.  :)

review/text: We are loving this soup mix , I agree with the other reviewer in that you do need to add a bit more water than specified , especially if you like your soup to have broth or are adding other ingredients like fresh carrots or potatoes .  We only added salt , pepper the first time making it and used vegetable boulion cubes to flavor the water  and it was good with just those ingredients .  The next time we made it we used water and vegetable broth and added some onion , garlic powder , salt , pepper and after the soup mix cooked for about half an hour added some thinly sliced fresh carrots and Potatoes (you can also cook the carrots for about ten minutes before adding them to the soup if you like them really soft ) it was very good and the kids even asked for seconds ! This is a great mix to have around , you can add any thing you like to the soup mix or use it by itself and it is still taste great .

I guess I could just as easily add my own beans and pasta, but for whatever reason I find it much easier with this mix, and I make soup much more often than I would otherwise.  My favorite: 1-2 sliced onions, potatoes, carrots, celery, curry powder, sausage (I use veggie), salt+pepper to taste.  Super easy and delicious.<br /><br />Watch out for small rocks though -- my wife has had a few close calls biting into hard objects from the soup mix.

review/summary: Quick and Easy Meal
review/text: This was my first time trying this product, as well as any product from Bob's Red Mill. After reading the reviews and information on the company, I decided to purchase this soup mix, along with the Muesli.<br /><br />Package arrived in excellent condition and 2 days earlier than expected. I poured 1 1/2 cups of the mix into 6 cups of salted water. Added garlic salt, parsley, and pepper. Let simmer for little over an hour, while adding water when needed for a thinner sauce.<br /><br />The soup had excellent flavor, with all the ingredients having the perfect contribution. I finished 1 mug of the soup and was satisfied. There is about 6-10 mugs of soup left, which goes straight into the fridge. The 1 1/2 cups of mix I used was about 1/5 of the bag, which is only 1 of 4 that come in the well designed box.<br /><br />The company's values, along with the product itself, including nutrition, taste, and cost, add up to an amazing product, in my opinion. I have stored 2 bags in glass storage containers, as the dry storage life far surpasses the time the mix will spend uncooked. This is another bonus.<br /><br />A thank you to all the reviewers of this product, Amazon for carrying the product, and to the founder himself, along with the employees, for bringing this healthy, positive product into my life.

review/summary: Excellent soup, easy to make and well worth the price!
review/text: This soup mix is amazing. My husband and I love it and so do guests. It looks like such a small amount, but it cooks up into a huge batch. It's exceptionally healthy, very easy to make, and well worth the cost. I am going to order a bunch to keep in our emergency supplies ince it's compact ans shelf stable.<br /><br />We did find that the soup it much more flavorful if you add a few things into it. Our favorites are bacon, onion, and carrots. I just saute them before adding the water and it helps give this soup such a great flavor. I personally like to oversalt things, so I add salt as well.

review/summary: Attention soup fans:  Try this delicious, healthy, and easy to make soup!
review/text: I came upon a bag of Bob's Red Mill Veggie Soup at Big Lots.  I am a fan of creamed soups and the bag had a very easy recipe for turning the veggie soup into a creamed soup. I simmered some of the soup mix with water for about thirty minutes and then added some sauteed celery, carrots, onions, zucchini and a squash.  I cooked the soup for a bit longer and then blended away with a bit of So Delicious coconut milk.  The result was fantastic.  With a piece of french bread for dipping, I was in soup heaven.<br /><br />This Bob's Red Mill mix serves as an excellent base for soups.  My creamed soup had a distinct celery flavor, but depending on the vegetables you have lying around, you could easily make the soup taste more like peas or carrots.  For a fall soup with a bit of sweet edge, I think I will incorporate some apples.<br /><br />The contents of the soup mix include lentils and peas and alphabet pasta pieces.  It's nothing you couldn't put together on your own but Bob's Red Mill has done the work for you and for the price of each bag, I don't know how much you would save by assembling your own soup.  Each bag yields impressive quantities, especially when vegetables are added.  My 1 and 1/4 cups of soup mix with some vegetables yielded over four cups. I like my soups thick, however, so other people could have gotten more out of my batch by adding more milk or water.<br /><br />I will purchase this again and recommend it for soup fanatics!

review/summary: Wonderful Soup
review/text: We loved this soup!  I cooked the whole bag and froze what we didn't eat.  One month later, the soup is there in the freezer when I need it.  I am not a big fan (I thought!) of bean soup but this has many distinct textures and flavors.  Of course, I did start mine a bit more complicated than Bob's directions because I was not necessarily looking for quick and easy and I was willing to invest a bit of time for a more classical approach.  Soup is best if you begin by cooking celery, onion & carrots, then add garlic if you like and perhaps a bay leaf.  I used lots of low-salt canned chicken broth (50% more than recommended) and finished with chopped parsley to freshen the color a bit.  Delicious!  Another bonus is the incredible amount of fiber that this soup has.  It really is a tremendous value for a very filling meal.  Will order more SOON!

review/summary: easy dinner
review/text: This soup mix is the easiest meal I make.  It qualifies as a hearty meal in my book, and it can be on the table and into a tummy that is headed out for soccer or football.  I discovered this soup mix from Bob's Red Mill last year and I have ordered it in bulk for my deep freeze.  It is like a bean mix except that it cooks much faster because all the pieces are tiny, but it still tastes like a real homemade soup.  There are even some weensy little whole wheat alphabet pasta pieces in there.  So cute!  You can dress it up any way you like.  There are several variations on the package, but it's also great just with broth.  Add some whole wheat bread and dinner is served.<br /><br />Here's a link to exactly how I cook a bag of it: [...]

review/text: Just had my first helping of this soup and enjoyed it !<br />For the reviews who find it tastless ....... this is a true soup stock and not something you might find in a can. Use your imagination to make it what you want.  Just added a few pork chops. onions and chicken stock.  Many possibilities to this product. Not something with a lot of salt and other fillers to it.

review/text: Bob's Red Mill Veggie soup is a great soup starter.  Just use 1 cup to 8 cups water in a huge crock pot.  It really expands.  I added some turkey sausage, veggies and a pkg of brocolli soup mix.  It was so yummy and lasted us for days.  It is a great value, and I will order more when I am out.

review/text: It only took an hour to make this soup and my kids really enjoyed it.  I didn't have time to add anything but a few spices, but the soup is good and very filling.  I didn't add enough water to the first batch, so it was very thick, but still very tasty.  Make sure you add lots of water.  I'm so glad I found this great healthy option.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is the first time buying and cooking this soup mix.  I put 2 cups soup mix to 8 cups water, brought to a boil, and simmered for 60 minutes with a tablespoon of "Better Than Bullion" soup base in chicken flavor (that's what I had on hand)s added onion and garlic.  When the soup was done cooking, I added diced, smoked ham and finished simmering a few minutes longer.  I served this with Bob's Red Mill gluten-free cornbread mix (added cheddar cheese and green onions to the batter before baking) and my guests and I both thought this was the best meal we've had in a long time....they said it was better than Anderson's Split Pea Soup.  I thought so too.  Would I buy this again?  I certainly will and would hate to be without it.<br />(Use caution for diabetics or carb watchers since it's split peas and lentils with a veggie based pasta...high carb all the way but so delicious)

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: I am so glad I purchased this soup mix.  In these economical days, you need all the assistance you can find.  This soup mix is really great in making soups and casserols. I just make a simple stock, pour this mix into the stock, let it simmer per package instructions, add whatever vegtables I want, simmer until they are tender, then add some precooked meat and serve.  I can really stretch my food budget using these mixes. They really do add a delicious, homemade and healthy touch to your meals.

review/summary: Makes the best soup and is very versatile.
review/text: I love this soup mix. I have made both reipes on the bag and like them.  Once I used a hand blender to puree part of the soup and it reminded me of split pea soup.  I have also added a can of diced tomatoes over and above the 4 cups of water.  I find I like it a little better with the 5 cups of liquid, unless I want a thicker soup . I also added a ham hock, and one time, kidney beans. I have used Bisto Beef Mix, plus whatever spices I like, extra fresh onion and veggies.  There are so many ways you can change it up.
