review/summary: Mmm!
review/text: Sweet and crunchy and hard to believe that it's gluten-free!  I like the variety of textures since gluten-free is often sort of lacking in the interesting texture area, and found this cereal great with milk, kefir, or yogurt.  It's also great plain with some roasted almonds as a very satisfying snack mix.  I also used it as a crunchy topping for oatmeal!  Yum!

review/summary: Visiting family enjoyed this!
review/text: As luck had it, this cereal arrived the week I had 6 family members visiting - running the gamut from ages 7 - 82.  Most had at least one bowl, and it was well received.<br /><br />I like the fact that it is quite light as cereals go.  Very flavorful, seemed to hold up to milk well, and did not leave an overly full feeling.  Once or twice I grabbed an handful as a quick snack and I enjoyed it dry as well.<br /><br />My sister liked the flavor and consistency - though for her she felt it was a bit lightweight.  So, she mixed in a bit of traditional granola and felt it was the perfect balance.

review/summary: Crunchy and delicious
review/text: Wow, I would never have guessed this is gluten free!  It is really quite delicious, not overly sweet, and is nice and crunchy.  It does contain flakes, but not too many which is a bonus for me because I am not keen on cereals that consist predominantly of flakes.  The taste and texture is a great combination and that it is gluten free is just a bonus.

review/summary: Great starter for your morning
review/text: Nature's Path has some wonderful products and I have to say I count this among them. I have had their "Leapin Lemurs" cereal (because I am a kid at heart & we call one of our cats a Lemur).<br /><br />Great price here on Amazon at 3.50 a box. The organic ingredients, gluten free nature, and Omega-3 content are all pluses. No fat, no cholesterol, low sodium and carbs & high fiber are all added pluses. The vanilla (natural) flavour is strong (and welcome to me) but as you chew it, it changes...less vanilla more a light coffee flavour--but that could just be my tongue and brain.<br /><br />The one drawback (if you see it as one) is the lack of added vitamins you get in processed big-company cereals. But let's be honest: if you take a vitamin with your breakfast, do you really need one IN your breakfast. And I guess the different shapes (grains) of the cereal don't stay mixed all that well--so a good shake before pouring helps.<br /><br />A good cereal if you like a sweet start to your morning that is still good for your OR for your young graduates from the cartoon-on-the-box cereals who balk at "healthy" cereals.

review/summary: Too Sweet.
review/text: I'm a big cereal eater. But as I have gotten older, I have strayed from things that taste cloyingly sweet ... and sorry to say this is one of those cereals that I just couldn't enjoy. I couldn't put my finger on the taste for quite sometime but now I know exactly what this cereal tastes like to me -- Crunch n' Munch. This cereal doesn't have a vanilla taste at all, it seems way too artificial and leaves a slight aftertaste. My husband doesn't agree, that is why I am giving this review four stars. He loves it thought it had a great balance and seemed very different and satisfying from the usual Raisin Brand that sits on our shelf. Another thing of note that we both liked is that this cereal does hold its crunch in milk better than most.

review/summary: Sweet, but not obnoxiously so...
review/text: This cereal has a nice crunch to it. When you soak it in milk, all the different parts soften to around the same level, so you don't have that one hard little kernel of a piece that sticks in your teeth.<br /><br />Further, it tastes good. Sweet, but not obnoxiously so, this is a mighty pleasant cereal.<br /><br />It's the kind of cereal that you would gladly introduce to a friend or invite to visit you in a cabin you've rented. If this cereal were music, it would be some early Elvis Costello, or maybe that "California" song they used to play at the beginning of The O.C.<br /><br />It's joyful in that same kind of way.

review/summary: Nummy, nummy, nummy!
review/text: I ***LOVE*** this cereal!....and I really don't even like cereal.<br /><br />There is no overpowering taste; it is sweet, but not overly sweet or sugary-sweet tasting like many/most sugar cereals, but it has that "naturally sweet" kind of taste. I've allowed two of my gluten-free friends to try it and neither have complained or had issues with it (one is borderline celiac). Anyone can enjoy it (including me: she who doesn't like cereal and who is not gluten intolerant).<br /><br />There is a nice crunch and when eaten with soy (plain soy) milk, there is a nice balance and it just has that perfect crunch....except if you forget about it for several minutes, then it becomes soft - but not soggy. I couldn't seem to stop myself from eating it. There is a bit of a variety of texture because of the multi-grains and shapes/tastes of the cereal itself (i.e. it isn't just flakes or "balls" of one kind of grain). I think that is why it tastes so great is because of the combination of what is inside, the mix...the perfect mix of flavours (along with the use of soy milk instead of cow's milk) that makes it a great cereal one doesn't want to stop eating. Seriously: if I didn't exercise self-control, I would have eaten through the whole box in one (maybe two days)....and that is saying something coming from me.

review/summary: Different textures makes this buyer weary.
review/text: The cereal leaves both soft and crunchy textures. Silly me didn't realize this on checkout, but I was nearing cereal depletion so I needed to replenish.<br />The taste is more bland than flavorful, and I don't think I'm digging the two textures very much. There are puffs mixed in with the crunchy oaty textures, and, honestly, the puffy portions could be left out for all I care.

review/summary: Very tasty, filling and stays crunchy in milk!
review/text: I love vanilla, I choose it over chocolate.  The vanilla taste is perfect in this cereal!  It's low cal, full of healthy goodness, and stays crunchy in milk, which I love!  My biggest peeve is when a cereal goes soggy faster than you can eat it.<br /><br />There is a nice ratio of different pieces to this cereal.  There are little corn puffs, flakes, Rice Krispie type pieces, and little pieces of buckwheat.  I can taste the Rice Krispie type pieces the most.  This stuff isn't too sweet, which is nice because I'm not a sweet breakfast fan.  I have actually used it as a snack as well.<br /><br />There are 110 calories in 2/3 Cup, which satisfies me.  With 3g of dietary fiber, it makes the carbs come out to 22g per serving.  There are no artificial additives in here, like high fructose corn syrup.  They use evaporated cane juice as the sweetener. Less than 1g of fat per serving makes this a wonderful breakfast treat.<br /><br />A gluten free cereal that contains .15g (11% of the recommended daily value) of Omega 3 and 2g of protein is a hit on my list.  I have tried several different kinds of cereal by this brand, and have enjoyed all of them.  I have found a new favorite!

review/summary: Sweet, pleasant taste. Crunchy but not gritty.
review/text: I eat a lot of high fiber cereals and am accustomed to the crunchy, grainy texture the healthy, whole grain cereals usually have. The Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise wasn't like that. No gritty, grainy feel. It had a sweet, pleasant taste with a hint of vanilla. I could taste the corn puffs more than the other grains. I eat my cereal with milk and this held up well and didn't get soggy.<br /><br />While I didn't mind the sweetness, at 7g of sugar per 2/3 cup (the serving size listed on the box), a normal portion probably has double that amount. The cereal provides 3g of dietary fiber per serving but no soluble fiber.<br /><br />Overall, I liked it a lot. Would I eat it again? If it were on sale I would buy it. I don't need to eat gluten free and wouldn't spend the extra to buy a product that was. For those that need gluten free, this is a cereal I would recommend they try.

review/summary: Will Buy Again!
review/text: I'm usually not the type that enjoys the super-organic items that are heavy in flax seed and what not.  I try them off and on -- my girlfriend stocks our cupboards and I get hungry -- but I often don't turn back to the items, surprised at what I found.<br /><br />The exception is this cereal.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought that it tasted like a 'normal' cereal you might pick up that's not as healthy as this one.  The vanilla is faint but noticeable, and the cereal lacks the incredibly grainy taste that you can sometimes get by mixing in all of these types of things.<br /><br />On the other hand, my girlfriend said she felt that it was, "too sweet for a granola cereal."<br /><br />So I believe these two points best illustrate its use-case.  For someone like myself -- an individual transitioning to a healthier diet or looking to get a healthier cereal without all of the stereotypical 'healthy taste' -- it's absolutely delicious.  For someone how regularly enjoys bowls of just normal granola or granola cereal, it may come off as a bit sweet.

review/summary: Very good cereal.  I'm eating it as I type this review
review/text: This is a very tasty cereal.  I'm not familiar with Nature's Path cereals, but this is hitting a lot of high marks for me; there is, for example, cane sugar instead of the less desirable high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />It also has the bonus of not getting too soggy too fast.  I've had the cereal sitting in lactose-free milk for about 10 minutes, and there is (surprisingly) some crunch left in the cereal.  Although I'm not going to run the test too much longer; the cereal is disappearing faster than the crunch disappears.<br /><br />Altogether, a winner!  It's very, very good and it is something I definitely would get again.  I assume because of the careful attention to details on the ingredients, it's going to be in the natural foods department in the supermarket.  I'm going to look for it again.  It's that good and good for you.<br /><br />Solid recommendation for the Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise.  BTW, I threw in a handful of blueberries.  That made it even healthier.

review/summary: Organic, gluten-free and tasty?  Can it be?
review/text: As a big fan of Nature's Path products, I was excited to try a new flavor from them.  But gluten-free and breakfast cereal aren't a normal combination for me.  Further, the list of ingredients they were bragging about; "flax, quinoa, buckwheat, amaranth", did not exactly make me think "yum".<br /><br />But you know what- its super tasty!  If anything it reminded me of the breakfast cereals of my youth (probably because the second listed ingredient is "organic evaporated cane juice" (aka sugar)- so vanilla and sweet are the two dominant tastes.  There is a good amount of fiber (12% of Daily Value per 2/3rd of a cup- lol does anyone really eat that little?).<br /><br />Downsides are the tiny box (10.6 ounces!) that goes pretty fast (because its so tasty).  Also for those with allergies, the cereal is produced in a facility the uses peanuts, tree nuts and soy.<br /><br />But with the Amazon three pack, the size of the individual boxes isn't as much of an issue.  For a super sweet and tasty gluten free breakfast cereal, this one is hard to beat.

review/summary: Sweet & Crunchy
review/text: If you dislike sweet cereals, take a pass on Nature's Path Organic Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise.  My wife took one taste and pronounced it unpalatable.  Given that I prefer sweet cereals, I was surprised to find that a serving of CV Sunrise has over 4g less sugars than my favorite cereal.  It also has slightly more calories and more calories from fat, with over 1.7 times the total fat of "my" cereal.  Continuing the comparison, a serving of CV Sunrise has over 28mg more sodium, over 26mg less potassium, the same total carbohydrate, about .74g more dietary fiber, about .3g more protein, no Vitamin A vs. 15%, and 4% iron vs. 25%.  Although claiming to be "a good source of fiber", a serving of CV Sunrise yields only 12% daily value.  I agree with other reviewers that the suggested serving size is quite small for an adult breakfast.  I also agree with those who fail to detect much vanilla flavor, an impression supported by "natural vanilla flavor" appearing well down the listing of ingredients.  But CV Sunrise does not disappoint in the "C"!  This is one CRUNCHY cereal, and its puffs keep it crunchy through the last spoonful.  I find its combination of large puffs, small puffs, and flakes more interesting than distracting.  As with many cereals, the cost of CV Sunrise would deter my having it on a regular basis, but it's not bad as a sweet, crunchy cereal.

review/summary: This stuff is crazy good.
review/text: Unlike the Quaker Oat squares I recently reviewed (q.v.) (thanks, Vine, for giving me breakfast stuff!), when Nature's Path says vanilla, they MEAN vanilla. Bold, brash, and almost creamy, if you can imagine that in a puffed-grain cereal (I can't either, but it's the only way I can think of to describe the forwardness of the vanilla here). But then there's that "puffed-grain cereal" thing. You get to thinking that a puffed grain is a puffed grain, whether it's rice or quinoa. Lemme tell you something, bub: that ain't true. While the texture here is consistent despite the variety of grains, this has a lighter (forgive me for using this phrase, which I despise, but I can't think of another that makes sense) mouth feel than your good old fashioned rice krispies or whatever.<br /><br />[amusing note: Chrome's spell-check-error-on-a-real-word of the day: quinoa.]<br /><br />I powered through this box in two days, despite knowing that I wouldn't be having it again for a while (save these last Vine reviews of breakfast stuff I'm going low-carb for a spell). Been mulling it over ever since, and I can't think of a better-tasting cereal I've ever had. But to be on the safe side, since I don't remember all the kinds of sickeningly-sweet cereal I ate as a kid (as a yardstick, when I was growing up, we still had sugar smacks, sugar corn pops, and all the other cereals that compared to today were paragons of truth in advertising), I'll say this one's definitely in the top five. Were I not going low-carb I would be perfectly content to eat this stuff for breakfast every day for the rest of my life. It's THAT good. *****

review/text: My friend Kevin and I are root beer connoisseurs.  We must have tried over 50 different brands, some great, Salty Dog, many ok and a few horrid (who'd a thunk).  Meanwhile, we found the Boylan's brand of delicious root beer and, angelic voices singing, Boylan's Creamy Red Birch Beer.  Nuttin' like it.  Never disappoints.  Difficult to describe.  Not too fruity, not a false red taste.  Not root beer, not bitter, not overly sweet.  A satisfying taste, a unique flavor found nowhere else.  We immediately decided it was the champagne of root beer even though there's that sub-category of birch beer.  I gotta try more birch beers but have yet to get my hands on a creamy red birch beer.  There's undoubtedly some out there.  Lemme at them.  Meanwhile, for the last 6 or so years we've reveled in this beverage, happily purchasing it for about a buck fifty a bottle from one of two stores in town.  Now I see neither store carries it any longer.  A sad day.  I'm hoping to find another retailer in San Diego who does.  Meanwhile, I'm gonna order some from Amazon.  Drink hearty me maties.  Ain't nuttin' like it.  Everyone we've turned on to it recognizes the high quality, special taste treat.  Lovely.

review/text: I bought this for my son for Christmas.  He tasted this when we were away and loved it.  I could not find it locally so I purchased it here.  Sounds like an odd way to buy a beverage, but when you can't find it.....!  This product is true to the taste of Birch Beer. Arrived without any damage. A bit pricey for soda, but it was a surprise gift.

review/summary: Birch Beer forever!
review/text: I love this stuff; fortunately for me, it is available locally, so I drink some every week.  I've become very addicted to it.  I also love ginger beer, but when I have a choice, I usually pick up a bottle of birch beer.  I've yet to try the original flavored one, but I see it is available here so I'll have to try it.  This is a pretty good deal, as the only other online retailer I've found only sells 6-packs ($19.32 includes shipping) or 24-bottle cases.  Those cases cost $27.99 plus $24.12 S/H, so 12 for $30 and free shipping on Amazon is close enough.

review/summary: Root Beer lovers will like it, Birch Beer lovers will worship it!
review/text: I couldn't find this product anywhere in stores in CT or New York City.  That qualifies it in my book as really "hard to find"!  This has the distinctive taste of birch beer without the edge that can be found in some birch beers.  The taste is simply superlative!  As other reviewers have noted, it's slightly less carbonated than most sodas, but it's a full bodied, sweet, and glowingly red.  I love this stuff!  It doesn't have the mildly spicy taste of the Boylan's regular Birch Beer, which I also love.  This is different, it's a smoother but just as tasty a drink.  I give it 5 stars.  To me, and I've had a lot of these premium sodas, this is the best in class.  As another reviewer noted, and I agree, It has a "champagne" quality to it in that it's taste and precise carbonation give it a very refined quality you generally don't find in soda.<br /><br />It's simply the best tasting soda I have ever had.  Hard to pick between this and Boylan's regular Birch Beer which is spicier and slightly more bubbly, but also an outstanding soda.  Love it, love it, love it!  I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Health in a Bottle!
review/text: I rated SeaAloe a five because of the health benefits, the company is another matter. SeaAloe, previously named SeaSilver, helped get me back on my feet after back surgery and a rough time with Sciatica and Fibromyalgia. It was a miracle to me, after spending over a year in bed.<br /><br />I don't eat right, I admit it. This a terrific product, especially if you have poor eating habits. The taste of this product is tolerable (it's not great), compared to so many others I've tried. The company claims this is the exact same formula as SeaSilver but I have noticed a slight taste difference.<br /><br />When I first began taking SeaSilver (SeaAloe), I didn't really notice a huge difference in my health, until I stopped taking it. That was when I realized just how run down I was feeling. Now, I take it everyday and have noticed I have more energy and I'm able to stay up all day, without taking a nap.<br /><br />As for the company, they send me an email each time I order, trying to get me to subscribe to their automatic shipping service, which I've ignored. While I appreciate knowing when my product has shipped, I like ordering through Amazon because I trust them.<br /><br />SeaAloe arrived packaged well (complete with styrofoam peanuts, which isn't environmentally friendly) and arrived within four-days of placing my order.<br /><br />I really love this product and have found the health benefits to be worth the cost. After combining SeaAloe with plenty of exercise, I sleep better and my quality of life has drastically improved. I was in pretty bad shape, when I started taking it. I decided to give it a try because I had nothing to lose and everything to gain.

review/summary: Seaaloe
review/text: I have only been taking this supplement for a few days, so I'm not sure how helpful this review will be, maybe I will update it after taking it for awhile. First, the taste is really good, for a supplement. It taste like slightly sweetened cherry extract, with a flat (nothing there) aftertaste. I was suprised for a liquid supplement it has no bitter or mineral taste. I could take it every day easily. And I do like that it is a whole food and not a man made supplement.<br />  What I don't like about it is that it doesn't list how much of something you are getting or the daily percentage of RDA. I don't think it has been evaluated by consumer labs - I didn't see it listed, but then again I didn't sign up. I don't like how it is marketed, you can sell it yourself, and I tend to distrust home marketing businesses. I'm not sure I like that it has D'Arco in it, the lady at the health food store said that it has no known side effects or contraidictions, but I have seen online reports of possible effects.<br />  As for effectiveness, I have only been taking it for a very short time, so the review is not complete. But, I have noticed my skin is firmer, and I have a healthy pink glow to my face. This usually happens if I am taking a good antioxidant. I haven't noticed any increase in energy. There does seem to be a slight decrease in joint pain (D'Arco is supposed to be good for inflammation). My gums look healthier, but I have also been using Biotene mouthwash. So I guess what I am saying, is take at your own risk, or do more research. Maybe there are better liquid supplements out there, with no herbs in them. Even herbs that have no reported side effects, sometimes have bad effects for me.

review/text: This is an awesome product. A friend of ours supplied us with a case of it after my 7 year old daughter was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme(the most aggressive type of brain cancer. This type of tumor should double in size every 2 weeks. There was about a month break in between her 3 operations and the start of her radiation. During that month she drank 1 capful of SEA ALOE a day along with various herbs and suppliments. Her tumor actually started shrinking a little. Not bad for something that was supposed to be growing! And not to mention it tastes pretty good.

review/text: SeaAloe is a must have for me! Without it I'm tired and feel run down and like I've got cob webs for brains. When I take SeaAloe I think more clearly, have amazing energy and my skin looks beautiful. If I had money for only one thing, this would be it! I really can't say enough about how it's changed my life. I first heard of SeaAloe after my Mother was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer and given 6 mos to live. The home care nurse said she'd seen it's remarkable effect on patients she visited and that we should look it up online. We did, and Mother and I both started taking 1-2 cap fulls every day. My Mom used every treatment the Doctors recommended for her condition and took SeaAloe throughout her treatments and recovery. She tolerated the treatments better than other patients and has lived 14 more years to the good old age of 82! I've shared the website with friends who complain of feeling tired and lethargic and they always thank me for telling them my secret.<br />BUY IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF! Give it two weeks to really see the change. It took you time to get so run down, it may take a week or two to build back up.

review/summary: Love Sea Aloe
review/text: Have been taking it since mid 2002 and have been extremely happy with it.  It might not have the same effect on everyone but if I miss a day - I don't feel as peppy and normal.  One of my (good) side effects has been that mosquitos don't eat me alive any more.  I have seen them fly right past me.  In 9 years - I have had maybe 3 bites versus being chewed up all the time most of my life.  Even when I used Skin-so-soft lotion - they bit me on my head.  Thinking that Sea Aloe has changed my smell and they aren't attracted to me as much.  My skin color is better than ever and I do think it helps me sleep better too since I have more energy during the day.  Great stuff that everyone should try for a couple months to see if they have good results too.  Swear that my hair even shines more now.

I am temped to do some Angry Bird cupcakes now.  These eyes are great.  And the fact that they are "looking somewhere" rather than straight ahead is great.  You can make some really comical faces with them!  Glad I got these eyes.

Organic is a huge plus, and I will continue to purchase/stock up on this. I do think that this is a product that I will begin to use more and more, simply because of its quality. The taste is more mild and pleasant than typical pickled ginger that you receive with sushi. It has a refreshing bite to it, not a weird chemical-biting aftertaste like what most everyone is used to. If you are looking for ginger for your sushi, you will not regret trying a bottle of this!

review/text: The description is misleading when it claims that each packet makes a pot of coffee. I should have known that when they don't claim that each packet makes a standard 10 or 12 cup pot of coffee, it probably doesn't. We, it does make 10 cups, if you like your coffee like tea.<br /><br />The package states:<br />Mild - 10 cups  (like tea)<br />Medium - 8 cups (like Denny's)<br />Strong - 6 cups (coffee shop quality)<br /><br />Be warned for a 12 cup pot, it takes 2 packets, costing nearly as much as a trip to Starbucks.<br /><br />Just be warned, it is JUST a sample. You should NOT expect a full, robust pot of coffee with each packet. Other than the price per cup, the coffee is just OK, nothing spectacular. You can and will do better buying the fresh ground boutique coffees in your local grocery store.

review/summary: Settle for Nothing Less than Topo Chico
review/text: Being eight miles from the border of Mexico, I grew up with Topo Chico. Going to college in New Hampshire, however, has made it a bit difficult to get.  If I am willing to pay the shipping for a bottle of Topo Chico, just think about how good it must be.  It's worth it!  Other mineral waters are good, but they don't compare.  Really!  You won't regret buying it.  It is definitely the best mineral water I have ever tasted. Don't settle for less! Oh and don't forget a bit of lime and a lot of ice. :) Serving it chilled is the best.

review/summary: THE BEST WATER EVER!!!!!!
review/text: I've tried many different mineral waters to help me to quit drinking sodas. I'm a cola drinker and i needed something really strong. All the other mineral waters went flat not long after drinking. This water held its strength after being open for a few days. Truly unbelievable. What i really like is that this water is in a glass bottle which is a PLUS....Will NEVER DRINK ANY OTHER BRAND......

review/summary: Topo Chico is the BEST!
review/text: Growing up in a border town, my grandma used to give me Topo Chico instead of coke when I visited her in Mexico.  I grew up drinking it and when I moved to Austin I stopped b/c it was hard to find.  I am so glad that I am able to buy it locally now and I always buy 2 to 3 cases.  I love it with Buchanan; and it also makes GREAT mojitos if you add a little rum and some mint. Grapefruit juice with topo chico is a refreshing, non-alcoholic beverage and definitely great after a work out!  For a hangover, try topo chico with lime, salt and ice! ;)

review/summary: Refreshing and not bitter
review/text: I tried this product for the first time today after buying it from Jewel-Osco's clearance item section for dirt cheap.  I have been a fan of mineral water and the benefits of drinking mineral water for quite some time, but don't buy it frequently due to cost.  My typical mineral water purchases in the past have been Perrier or Pellegrino, but this one really does taste better to me.  It's not bitter like the rest and really does have a refreshing taste to it.  I'm glad that I bought the last three, as I will enjoy these for the next several days.  After opening the bottle, I noticed that the beverage is highly bubbly, it was quite pretty to see the beverage "bubble-up" as much as it did...almost like a champagne.  I bought the 1.5L (50.7FL OZ) for $.49 so I have no idea what this costs normally, but for such a large bottle, I'm assuming it's quite expensive.  I read online that this is supposed to be a premium mineral water, and I am enjoying it as such.  Hope you can find it in your area.

review/summary: Topo Chico is Tops!
review/text: How can something as simple as water be so refreshing?  This is the perfect blend of water and minerals and bodacious bubbles.  It is vibrant and tingly and quenches thirst better than any other liquid I have ever consumed.  Try it!  I've had mineral water all over Europe and none of them (though very good) can touch this stuff.  I am fortunate enough to live in a city where I can buy it by the case. My "beer Fridge" in the garage has more Topc Chico than any other drink.

review/summary: Decent heat, okay flavor, fast delivery
review/text: I really am a fan of hot sauce, in general, and was hoping to find a new sauce to add into my rotation. Having sampled most of the stuff at the local supermarket, I turned to Amazon to find a new sauce. So since this sauce was well reviewed - though I think some of the other reviews are the result of turfing - so I figure I would give it a shot.<br /><br />The sauce arrives the next day, even though I didn't order next day delivery. It is shipped from within my state though, so it may take longer elsewhere. Even with the Prime's free 2 day delivery, it was a nice surprise to receive an unexpected Amazon package at my door.<br /><br />Adding a fair amount of the sauce will bring a nice heat. I have a pretty decent tolerance to heat, but I don't think that the burn is such that you'll need to contact an ambulance after having some if your tolerance isn't. Just a nice amount of heat that gets your forehead sweating without requiring you to drink roughly a fourth of your body weight to stop your mouth from burning.<br /><br />Now the flavor component is much less successful, in my opinion. It is not terrible by any means, but it has sort of an odd vaguely fishy mixture of stuff that doesn't really mesh well with anything I've tried it with. I used it with lunch for the better part of a week, and it didn't enhance anything. I was back to an old standby sauce by the end of the week. If you've had a Cambodian sauce before and enjoy it - I don't know if this is an accurate reproduction of it or not, but it may be worth your time. Obviously, flavor is subjective, so you may enjoy it even if you've never had a similar sauce. I do not think I would order it again, but you may like it.<br /><br />Lastly - one of the ingredients listed is fish sauce so this probably isn't vegetarian/vegan friendly.

review/text: This sauce has a great flavor as others have mentioned. Although the picture suggests it to be a red/orange sauce, mine looks to be more on the olive green side. Its flavor comes closest to a salsa verde. There's really just a little heat to it. It's pretty mild. I'm talking like a 4/10.

review/summary: A Fresh New Taste In A Stale Market
review/text: I'm a hot sauce nut. I was blown away with this stuff. Every time I walk past hot sauce in a grocery store, I stop and look for something new and intriguing. I'm constantly buying sauces only to be let down as they're the "same old same old". This stuff arrived in the mail today, and I've got to say it's the first time in a LONG time I've been really impressed and refreshed with a new flavor in the hot sauce market. I haven't been this pleasantly surprised since I found Pickapeppa Hot Mango sauce, or the first time I tasted Sriracha. I've been purchasing from Amazon.com for as long as I can remember, and this is the first review I've ever posted.<br /><br />Buy it. You won't regret it. I'm going to purchase everything else from Black Market Hot Sauce. Pineapple Habanero is on deck.

review/summary: Awesome sauce!!!
review/text: I'd like to add my voice to the several reviewers who raved about this sauce. I was skeptical at first, and I was a little put off when one  reviewer said this sauce tasted fishy. But I ordered it and have not regretted it one bit. It's HOT....probably about a 7 or 8 on a scale of 10, which is what I like, and there is a bit of a fishy taste to it, but it is in no way overwhelming and in fact it actually adds to the flavor instead of detracting from it. It also has a bit of a sweet gingery flavor, which is about what I expected from a sauce from this corner of the world. In a nutshell, this sauce is awesome....nice flavor, nice heat, and it goes well on pretty much everything, whether it be beef, chicken, fish, or veggies. This is a great all-around sauce that will now be a staple in my kitchen.

review/text: Tired of all the "heat" without the important ingredient called "flavor"? Look no further, Black Market Hot Sauce has what you have been looking for. I like them all, but by far, Cambodian is my favorite. Fermented, not cooked, it brings an Asian zing to everything you put it on, with just enough bite to make it satisfying to those that want some heat. I use it in place of mayonnaise for tuna salad or deviled eggs.<br />Ordering is easy, delivery is fast. You will become addicted to it, but that is not a bad thing.

review/summary: AMAZING!
review/text: Being a lifelong connoisseur of hot sauce I stumbled across Black Market Hot Sauce company. Unlike so many of the other "unique" hot sauces I have tried, Black Market has found what I deem to be the utmost PERFECT blend of heat and flavor in this Cambodian Blend. Anyone can make a "burn your bunghole blaze" sauce however<br />Black Market has unlocked the age old problem of having the right amount of heat without sacrificing the loss of flavor in this offering. (They offer a mild sauce, a medium sauce a habanero and pineapple blend as well which are also excellent choices but this one is my absolute favorite amongst their offerings)This flavor however tantalizes the palate with not only heat but nuances of ginger, citrus, cilantro, onion and garlic with just the right amount of pleasant burn to go along with it. It comes in an aesthetically pleasing 12 oz flip top bottle (not the tiny 5oz glass bottle that gives you uncontrollable glops) that easily delivers just the desired about of sauce with an easy squeeze without having to shake or slap the bottle. I have tried this sauce on just about everything from burgers, to dogs to beef stroganoff and it never disappoints with the flavor enhancement it provides all foods you're wanting to bless it with. It also makes a GREAT Marinade for meats you plan to grill! I actually used it so much I went through 2 12 oz bottles in only 1 week as I said, I literally put it on EVERYTHING and did not encounter 1 food it didn't make better. I especially like it on raw fresh vegetables like broccoli, carrots and cauliflower. The price of this is also a delight as it is far cheaper than many of the other "gourmet" specialty sauces that I have paid 3 times as much for that did not come NEAR the flavor of this divine sauce. The ingredients are all natural with no corn syrup and the peppers are actually grown by Black Market as well. In summary this stuff is AMAZING and I can guarantee you that you WON'T be disappointed with this sauce. I know I won't be buying any from any other companies in the future!

review/summary: Surprisingly impressed
review/text: I purchased this product on a whim. It happened to be a gold box deal so I went ahead and purchased a case. As a college student, I sometimes find myself staying up late to study. I also find myself researching and testing various energy drinks. 5 hour energy, 10 hour energy, monster, venom, bawls, red bull--nothing I've had compares to this product.<br /><br />Hansen's Energy Pro Citrus has a fairly smooth taste, with a little bit of bite. It's not overly sweet and I don't like drinking pure sugar anyways. Speaking of sugar, the ingredients list on the can mentions NO high fructose corn syrup or fructose of any kind--only sucrose and glucose. Amazon needs to update their ingredients information. An interesting ingredient is ginkgo biloba leaf extract, which I've never seen in other energy drinks. The benefits of ginkgo biloba are fairly well researched (google it).<br /><br />Effects may vary, but I noticed an immediate improvement. I no longer felt tired and my mind was ready to go into action. Other energy drinks that I've had will get your body going, but your mind is still tired--not the case with this energy drink. I didn't feel jittery or have trouble concentrating.<br /><br />The cans are the same size as a red bull (not the larger 12oz cans), but the taste is so much better than a red bull. If there was such a thing as a "healthy" energy drink, this would be it. The price is not bad at all either, especially if you subscribe--which I will be doing before I run out.<br /><br />If you're looking for a new energy drink and happen to come across this--give Hansen's Energy Pro a try.

review/summary: TGTFI (Thank God For The Internet)!!
review/text: I have horrible luck...everything that I like is either discontinued from the store, is no longer available for purchase, or they just stop making whatever it is I like. My boyfriend recommened I try and order my favorite energy drink (Hansen's Energy Pro) online...and holy cow I could!! The previous week, Whole Foods (the only store I could find this product) told me they discontinued it (along with the cereal I liked) and I was disappointed. But, come to find out I could order this through Amazon!!! I placed the order and within a day or two recieved half of my shipment!! It was a really good ordering experience and I get to enjoy my favorite energy drinks everyday!! Thank God For The Internet! I would recommend this enery drink to anyone who loves a great tasting Hansen product.

review/text: Ordered this for my Husband back in June and he said they were all flat.  It taste as if the cans had been opened and left in the frig.  We are going to try one more time, maybe we just got a bad batch.  Will come back and let you know.  I don't know how long they stay in the warehouse, we'll see.

review/summary: Non toxic energy-Good stuff
review/text: I have been drinking hansens energy pro off and on since the 80s.  It always gives me and energy boost. I have never had a negative reaction to it even when I have had two on the same day which I do on ocassions when my energy level goes down from exertion or bad eating practice.  I usally start my day with one as a substitute for coffee and a jump start for my morning workout at the gym.  Good stuff.<br /><br />gsr

review/text: Used to drink it then all of the local stores stopped carrying it so I assumed they stopped making it, glad I stumbled upon it on Amazon.  Great price too.  I wish Hansen's would bring back Energade, that drink was great.

review/summary: a healthier version for an energy drink
review/text: my 2 cents- this drink gets my creative juices going and not at all bad on the wallet. Overall hansen's is a great product and once again they nailed on it-offering us "health freaks" an alternative soda. I hope they keep ENERGY PRO in production!

review/summary: The lemon lime flavor suits this 'natural' energy drink well
review/text: I switched to a job where I work nights so I've been trying a bunch of different energy drinks, having kicked the coffee habit many years back.<br /><br />Hansen's, so far, is the least toxic tasting of the bunch. I find it quite tasty. I've tried Red Bull, Guru, White Lightening, and Blue Sky so far (only the ones that come in an 8 oz can). All the drinks give me a caffeine kick and work similarly for me, so I have to go with taste. And how nauseated the drink makes me. For Hansen's Energy Pro, it's not at all nauseated. And when I look at my fridge full of little energy drink cans at 4am, this is the one I want to reach for the most, having tried them all. The next in line has been the two Blue Sky products, which are worth checking out, but much more flavored tasting, which is not necessarily good.<br /><br />The flavor is very mild. It's sort of like squirt or another sweet lemon lime soda. And it's not very carbonated. It's almost flat. But for some reason, that seems more natural. Natural as a descriptor is pretty meaningless. I don't mind buying energy drinks that market themselves with that theme, despite it probably being self-delusion that any energy drink sold in a little can could be from nature.<br /><br />Anyway, I had to order it from an Amazon vendor (when I order almost everything from Amazon using Prime) and it took forever to get it. Unfortunately, since I like this product a lot, I'll probably have to order it and wait and pay shipping again. Why do I have to make it so difficult on myself?<br /><br />If you want a lighter tasting energy drink, try this one. If you like Sprite or 7-up, you'll probably like this too.

review/summary: Great Taste, Good Price
review/text: This is the only energy drink that works for me. It has a great taste and is affordable. I also like the size of the can; it's just enough for one drink. I wish it was more accessible in local stores. However, I appreciate Amazon for offering a free delivery service for a minimum order. I highly recommend this drink over all the other energy drinks that I have tried...and I've tried many.

review/summary: A Great Energy Drink That Won't Leave You Shaky
review/text: Hansen's is a company that makes all natural products, so I'm more inclined to lean toward their products than others on the market anyway.  However, this drink is great no matter who makes it.  It doesn't have all the other additives in other drinks, and doesn't leave you shaky like other energy drinks. It's the only energy drink I will use, and this is the cheapest way to get it!

review/summary: Best Energy Drink on the Market
review/text: By far the best energy drink on the market.  May not be as strong as some of the others on the market, but it does not make you nervous, or give you that fast rush.  It seems to just wake you up enough to give you a positive clear mind for work.  I love this product.  I wish it was easier to find in stores.

review/summary: Hansen's a quality product
review/text: Since their inception, Hansen's all natural sodas have been the standard by which all other sodas are judged.  The energy version is quite the same:  similar to other energy drinks but with natural ingredients, all in perfect balance.  No jittery rush, no sudden crash.

review/text: My husband and I both love these energy drinks.  They are fairly light and have a citrus flavor that we both like without tasting like you are drinking syrup.  I wish they weren't so hard to find!  We have to have them shipped to us and can really only find them on Amazon now.
