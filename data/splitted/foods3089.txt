review/text: This is a great product. It is very healthy for all of our dogs, and it is the first food that they all love to eat. It helped my older dog lose weight and my 10 year old lab gain the weight he needed to be healthy.

review/summary: Great food!!
review/text: I was so ecstatic when I purchased two 44lb bags of canidae dog food.  We have used this food for years and my dogs love it. They have  beautiful coats. On  August 15, 2011 for 41.99 each with free shipping from amazon. The actual shipper was Petcare RX. Since I am feeding 4 large dogs (including a rescue) we go through a lot of food. Its nice to have it delivered to your door. I just signed on to reorder and noticed that amazon increased the price from $41.99 to $55. In theory, there goes free shipping. They rolled it into the new cost of the food. Now, it is no cheaper for me to purchase it on amazon since my neighborhood pet store sells it for $54.00 and I don't have to order it 7-10 days ahead just to make sure I get it before our current supply runs out. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!

review/summary: Fantastic food!
review/text: My dogs have always been on a high quality diet and recently I decided to give this food a try. I was a little hesitant at first due to the price but figured my dogs were worth it. Since making the switch my rescue yellow lab has made vast improvements. No matter what she ate before, she was always itching and scratching. Especially at the base of her tail. She used to get so sore at times that she would actually bleed. Her coat and skin now are perfect!!! No more itching, scratching and chewing. All of my dogs are also eating less and maintaining their weight nicely. Less food means less waste in the yard. All in all I couldn't be happier with this food and my dogs will stay on it as long as they continue making it. I also just switched my cat over to their grain free Salmon cat food.

She told me that because German Shepards have sensitive stomachs and also prone to hip problems is why this product is so beneficial to their dogs. Ever since a puppy my dogs been on Canidae. I have tried others when I couldn't find Canadie, like now and noticed a differance in various ways. I am happy to see I can now buy the product online to get my dog back on tract.

review/summary: Was a little nervous trying it, but my dog does well on it
review/text: I was a bit nervous trying this kibble after reading all the negative reviews, but I decided to give it a go since it's one of the only reasonably priced wheat & corn free "premium" kibbles available where I live.<br /><br />The ingredients list looked respectable (first 3 ingredients are human grade meat meals), as did the nutritional information (meets AAFCO profile for All Life Stages).  Also, all the ingredients are apparently from the U.S.A, so no worries about melamine (the two recent melamine scares were from Chinese wheat gluten and Chinese milk powder).<br /><br />We're on our 3rd bag now - my girl thrives on it, and likes it.  She's hard to keep weight on, but this food is good for that as it has a very high energy content compared to most kibbles.<br /><br />I do feed partially raw & partially kibble,  not just Canidae, so perhaps that makes a difference to how well the dog does on it.  But I can honestly say I've had no problems with this kibble at all, & will keep feeding it.

review/summary: Affordable Premium Food
review/text: We adopted a mastiff mix puppy last year, and after some research, I threw away a 90% full bag of Puppy Chow because it's just not good for dogs.  We tried a mid level food (3 stars from Dog Food Reviews) and it did ok, but it was too high in protein for the giant breeds.  When we decided to get a Great Dane this spring I started looking for a food that would be good for both dogs and found this.  We tried it out and after the initial adjustment (necessary with any food) both seem to be doing well on it.  With a giant breed and a large mutt, we go through about 90 lbs a month, so I wanted something affordable but quality and this fits the bill.  In the large 44 lb bags it's usually a bit over a dollar per pound, which is comparable to the big box brands.  We were able to get our Dane to a proper weight on it and keep our mutt from chubbing up too much, so I'm very impressed.  I'd love to feed them Orijen or Taste of the Wild, but they are very cost prohibitive.  I'm glad this one fits the bill without draining my bank account.

review/summary: Made 1 and 2 dogs sick - make that 1 and half
review/text: Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.<br /><br />Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.<br /><br />The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.  She seems fine today, but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae, I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well.

review/summary: WARNING!!!!
review/text: I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.<br /><br />After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong. Probably on the advice of their attorneys.<br /><br />You don't need to take my word for it, please read up... http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/canidae.html

review/summary: Good food for our dogs
review/text: I see a lot of negative comments from other reviews but when I look at the ingredients, the cost, and the value, this is the best food I have found.  We have two dogs and this food does them well. I gradually switched over from Blue Buffalo who raised their prices. The Canidae is a better product in my opinion anyway.  I asked the pet supply store owner, and she said in her years despite the negative reviews, there maybe 2-3 bags have ever been returned in her store.  I'm happy with the product and price, and the dogs like it too.

review/text: My dogs started on Canidae 3 years ago. All of them had a dramatic change in energy and coat. They have done wonderfully on the food since. There has been a lot of negative attention recently with the formula change but I have yet to have any trouble with my 4 on the new formula. They continue to eat it and do well. They had no stool problems, itchiness, vomiting that others have suggested. I am still quite pleased with Canidae and will continue to use it for all of my dogs.

review/summary: Canidae Lost Another Loyal Customer!
review/text: Canidae was the best food for my lab for the last 5 years until they changed the formula in June.  OMG...what a disaster from the very first bowl with the new formula(which I did mix with some of the old stuff to transition him).  I'm so disappointed...and no notice on the bag about the new formulation????  The old stuff worked GREAT, but I'm sure to save a few bucks, they've changed to cheaper ingredients.  Well I'm DONE.  My dog has had the worst gas and runny stools.  I now need to find a food that he can handle which is not an easy task since he's got skin allergies...and I won't buy just anything...it's got to be topnotch.  Canidae was ideal with the old formula...not so anymore...  Any suggestions out there on what I can transition to???

review/summary: New formula (Aug, 2008) is no good
review/text: This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it.

review/summary: Great dog food.
review/text: I've tried different foods with my puppies. This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time. However, I've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago. They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price.

review/summary: CHANGE IN FORMULA MAKES DOGS SICK!!!!!
review/text: If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the "customer service representative" if you can call her that, simply said "if you don't like it then don't buy it." And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any "stickers" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it.

review/summary: Despite Title- this item is NOT Beef and Ocean Fish Formula
review/text: Upon receiving my order for the Canidae Beef and Ocean Fish Formula 30 lbs I found I instead received ANOTHER formula (the original formula with chicken, turkey, etc.).  If you look at the picture and ingredients you'll see that Amazon has a picture AND the ingredients for the formula I received.  The bag I received was 35 lbs and not 30.  Clearly Amazon made a boo-boo here somewhere.  My dogs have eaten this formula and I believe Canidae is a pretty good and nutritious formula so I'm not sending it back.  However, for folks who must have the beef and ocean fish formula may not be happy.  I've ordered from Amazon for 10++ years- never a problem.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to notify Amazon of this without returning the item, hence the review.  Many folks are critical of Canidae's big mistake of changing their formula a couple years ago without going public with the change and have skewed their reviews to reflect their dissatisfaction with the product.  I've found it good palatable food for the money, and I'd bet Canidae won't make the mistake of a secret formula change again.

review/summary: serious diarrhea - I would like to rate even lower
review/text: I am very involved with dog rescue - in fact I am a founding board member of a large and active rescue group that adopts 500 or more dogs per year while keeping very high standards with the placement standards.  We (as a dog rescue) have used Canidae for years and recommended it to many adopters, but recently we (personally) have seen problems with our dogs', as well as dogs throughout the rescue, stools.  We have had many cases of serious diarrhea, and when talking to local Veterinarians we use, have found that many have seen recent issues with Canidae causing their client's dogs to have similar diarrhea as we have experienced.  I know Canidae has in the past changed their formula causing problems and it appears to have happened again.  It is a shame because we have had good success with the food, but we (both personally and as a dog rescue) will no longer use this product.

review/summary: Great Food!!!!
review/text: I bought this food for my adult male chiweenie and two female chiweeniepom puppies. I researched for a while before finally deciding to get this particular brand. I'm glad I did get this brand. My dogs absolutely love it. Before buying canidae my puppies were on purina puppy chow and my adult was eating kibbles n bits brand. They were "healthy", but their poop smelled horrible and I knew there was much healthier food out there for them. I gave this to my adult to see if he liked it and indeed he did, I attempted to try and feed him his last bit of "junk" food he had left and he would not touch it. The only dry food he will eat is canidae and nothing else and the puppies love it too. I read all the bad reviews and chose to still buy it and hope for a good outcome and it was good. My dogs are healthier than ever, they haven't had any diarrhea, vomitting, weightloss, unhealthy weight gain, or anything that I have read on the other reviews, but my dogs also have no allerges that I know of either. Another plus is that their poop doesn't smell as bad either, I mean in still stinks but nothing like before. I started feeding them canidae on Thursday July 26, 2012 and two months later they are healthier than ever with no adverse effects and my veterinarian likes it too.

review/summary: Great deal on quality chia seed!
review/text: I'm so glad I found the folks selling this chia seed. It's such a good deal that I can't imagine buying it from anyone else and I sure hope they continue to make it available at this price. Don't believe the hype that chia seed varies much in nutritional content -- I've done the research and according to Dr. Wayne Coates from the University of Arizona all the commercially available chia seed today is from a single genetic source. Dr. Coates wrote a book reviving interest in the value of this traditional food source and in making it available to more people. I am not affiliated with the company that sells this chia seed, and the reason I did this research is that I was recently told about a "miracle" product made from a specific variety of chia seed, and it was outrageously expensive ($30.00/pound). It is only available through "vendors" and I was told it was the only chia seed that is nutritionally beneficial, not like the black chia seed used for chia pets. Well, it's not true, folks. Like anything that's grown, chia seed can be affected by growing practices, soil, etc. But it's a plant that demands very little and normally grows on very lean soils. It also is not bothered by pests, so no pesticides are needed for its cultivation. It is, however, sometimes grown in rotation with other crops like corn and maize for which pesticides are used. For this reason, organic chia seed has not yet been available. Some companies are promising that they will make organic chia seed available soon. But for now -- chia seed is chia seed, and this is perfectly good chia seed at the best price I've found.

review/summary: Inaccurate product description
review/text: I bought this product towards the end of 2010. I have no problem with the actual chia seed itself, it is no different than other chia I have bought on Amazon - I have tried out a few different brands.<br />But what irks me is that the product description claims that it is organic. Once I received the product I scrutinized the product packaging and ingredients carefully and nowhere does it say it is organic. I paid a price premium for this brand over other cheaper ones available on Amazon simply because it claimed to be organic on this website. That was deceptive.<br />I will not buy this product again. I can find other sellers, both organic and non-organic, who have accurate product descriptions.  I realize that the Amazon disclaimer says not to trust the descriptions and to check with the manufacturer. The problem is that (like in my case) I cannot do it till I buy the product. I did use up the full bag because, like I said, there is nothing wrong with the Chia. They just are not selling what they claim that is all.

review/text: I ordered this product because my Dallas supplier for Salba is closing His store. I received it quickly and the resealable ziploc bag is good. I was paying $26.00 for the 16 oz. bottle, so this is a real bargain. I know it sounds impossible, but this stuff lowered my blood pressure in just two days, and the other benefits are a great bonus. I recommend using a coffee or spice grinder to process the seeds and make it easier to consume, and assimilate, without getting them stuck between your teeth.<br />I love this product and recommend it highly.

review/text: This is good for about 40 gallons of a half/half gin and All Sport mix. If you've never had gin and All Sport, then you have never truly played soccer as a child. With gin and All Sport, you can truly play soccer as a child - as an ADULT. It is unclear whether laws of physics or laws of society apply to those who drink gin and All Sport. Richard Gere drinks gin and All Sport. Has he ever been arrested?! Don't you think he should be?!<br /><br />All Sport is becoming rare and expensive for a reason. It is too powerful to be granted to just anyone via shipment of 13 lbs of powdered mix. It's not only good for *some* sports. It compels you to excel at *all* sports. Even ones that don't exist. And all - AT THE SAME TIME. If you can't save $34, you simply can't handle 13 pounds of this powdered delicacy. You can mix your gin with Powerade and die like all the rest.

review/summary: This is a Strong and Flavorful Oolong Tea
review/text: I like oolong tea, but everything I could find locally was either mixed with black tea or was very weak and came in compressed nuggets that wouldn't expand properly in water.  I even tried several local Chinese import stores to no avail.  Extreme Health's oolong tea, however, is exactly what I was looking for; a bold oolong tea, like I used to find in Japan, with dried bundles of leaves that expand to fill the tea pot.  When I first bought this tea, I thought the price was a little high, but you can steep the leaves multiple times to get quite a lot of tea.<br /><br />I liked the tea well enough to sign up for a delivery subscription.

Well I ran out of my stash and did not want to drive 3 hrs to get more,so I took a chance on this one. Bad move. It smelled a little stuffy when I opened it. I brewed a cup per instructions. It poured out clear with greenish tint. I figured well maybe it will have more of a green tea taste, which is cool. I like green tea as much as oolong. It tasted about like I would image sod tea would taste like. Would like to get my money back on this one.This bag is going in the trash

review/text: Just the best maple syrup in the world, period.  1/2 tsp. and  2 cups sugar in 1 cup of boiling water makes a pint, and the 2 oz. bottle makes THREE GALLONS of syrup!<br /><br /> I am dead serious when I say that it makes better maple syrup than any pure maple syrup I've ever had, and it puts the bottled syrups--Aunt Jemima, Mrs. Butterworth, etc. (as well as the other maple flavorings)-- to shame.  Perfect consistency, incomparable flavor.  And the concentrate seems to last indefinitely on the pantry shelf with no change in flavor.

When I get a craving for sweets, I make a cup of hot tea, one artificial sweetner and add a 1/8 t. of mapleine. It smells soooo good and tastes better. My husband usually comes over and swipes a few sips.<br /><br />So, great product, but I couldn't find it locally. I had to get it from the internet. I hope they don't quit making it.

review/summary: They Still Make It
review/text: What our grocery store has available as a maple flavoring has eroded to the point that it's pathetic; and while the quality has gone down the price has gone up.  (Eight dollars for a one ounce bottle of stuff with no flavor?  No thank you.)<br /><br />So I started looking around for an alternative and found that Mapleine is still available.  I didn't know they still made this stuff.  My parents used to use this in the 50s; I grew up on it.<br /><br />Use the recipe on the box to make your own maple flavored syrup.  The end result, you wind up with something that tastes at least as good as store bought (I'd say a lot better) and you actually know what's in it.  Want your syrup a little thicker; add some corn syrup to the mix.  I like a little stronger maple flavor so I use a little more flavoring than the recipe calls for.<br /><br />You have to buy a box of six bottles, that's a lot, but the stuff has a long shelf life and it doesn't take up too much storage room.  I can do that.<br /><br />Bottom line: great stuff, I'm glad they still make it.

review/summary: Amazingly Good, And A Bargain!
review/text: I've been using this for years on my camping trips to the North country here.  One of my favorite things to do out in the wilderness is cook really tasty meals over an open fire.  Breakfasts being a real favorite, especially pancakes, which I don't allow myself the luxury of at home all that often.  For some time I just brought along a small bottle of a commercial brand maple syrup.  But then one year I forgot it and used some from a fellow backpacker that turned out to be this Mapleine mix.  I was quite simply astonished at how delicious and flavorful it was.  I actually thought it was something he collected and cured himself.  I have been buying it ever since and mixing my own for not only my camping trips, and for use in the wilds of my own kitchen as well.  Before leaving on my hikes I just mix a pint as per the easy directions, (using just a tad more flavoring as others here have mentioned for an extra flavorful syrup)and pack away some in a glass medicine bottle I have and I am on my way.  Seriously, I know that the thought of using something imitation in this area can really be repugnant sounding to many folks.  Especially if you're a true syrup aficionado.  But honestly, if you just go by pure taste and try and  forget that its a mix, this truly is delectable stuff.  And its cheap this way too!  You gotta buy 6 bottles at once but it will last for years. And I get 20 pints of syrup even using a little more flavoring. Truly great maple flavored syrup that is very hard to find and delicious.  Highly recommended...

review/summary: Continuing the Tradition
review/text: My mother was not a master chef.  We had our fair share of home-cooked meals growing up, but they were all quite basic.  When I grew older and finally left the house, I would return on occasion, and would be asked what I wanted her to make for me.  The answer was almost always the same, pancakes and homemade syrup.  The pancake recipe was I think out of a Swedish cookbook, and I have yet to have a tastier pancake at a restaurant (made best with spoiled milk, trust me).  And the syrup?  Made with Mapleine, the first recipe.  I sometimes seriously consider taking this syrup with me when I go out for breakfast.<br /><br />My mother passed away earlier this year after a long fight with leukemia.<br /><br />This last Sunday, using my mother's hand-written copy of the recipe and the bottle of Mapleine my father gave me for my birthday (he's not dirt poor or anything, it was one gift among a much bigger gift...but he knew I would appreciate it), my wife and I made a batch of pancakes and syrup.  My wife does not cook much, but was sure to follow the directions as well as possible while I made the syrup.  Upon putting the two together for the first time in a great while, it took about 30 seconds to sink in, and I burst into tears.<br /><br />Our first born will be arriving in a couple of months.  And you best be sure the first solid he's going to get is Grandma's pancakes.<br /><br />And now I hear it's getting harder to find Mapleine.  As soon as I'm done with this review, believe me I'm going to find out why, and order as much as I can.

review/summary: Jury is still out...
review/text: I am a regular consumer of NuGo bars, and these Chocolate Banana bars in particular, due to the higher protein content. I would normally go to the local supermarket and purchase them individually, but found them online for a good price and could get a box delivered... I ordered 3 boxes and setup a subscription to get another 3 boxes in 1 month.<br /><br />The first 3 boxes arrived in the next couple of days...so far so good... I opened the box and had a bite of the first bar... it was very hard and tasted really stale... I looked at the lot number printed on the package, and it was still a year away. I opened the other 2 boxes, and the lot date was the same for all 3 boxes. I tried one bar from each of the other 2 boxes and had the same experience... hard, dry stale tasting bars... When purchased individually, I would very occasionally get one like this, but it was so rare it didn't really bother me... I would return it the supermarket next time I went.<br /><br />I decided to try the next batch the following month, they were better than the first 3 boxes, but were still a bit stale tasting compared to the other flavors... Maybe NuGo changed the recipe for these...<br /><br />I emailed NuGo through their website, but never heard a word back... Not good NuGo!

review/summary: Great tasting and good amount of protein
review/text: I've ordered mutiple boxes so far and both have been great with no stale issues that some other customers have complained about.  When I first ordered the bar I was a bit worried about the banana flavor as I'm pretty particular about banana flavoring, I really don't like the fake banana candy flavors out there.  This bar, while it still has a little bit of the banana candy taste to it, is actually pretty good and not over powering (natural banana flavor is the last ingredient). This bar is on my subscription list as well as the Clif Builder's Bar which is also great.  I wish the PureFit protein bars were less expensive, they're also really good, but just too expensive.

It has just enough chocolate to satisfy my sweet tooth without dumping empty calories into my body. Even my personal trainer gives it the thumbs up!

review/summary: Weird Flavor, Expensive Price
review/text: I ate a Berry SoyJoy bar the other night, and it wasn't that good.  It had an odd taste.  I have had other SoyJoy bars before, so the dense and dry texture wasn't an issue.<br /><br />The berries used aren't your typical strawberries or blueberries, but rather hawthorn berries and wolfberries (goji).  I don't think they carried that much flavor into the bar, though, because it didn't taste that fruity.  And despite the high sugar content (12g in a 30g bar) it didn't taste that sweet to me.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy a whole box unless you've tried it before and liked it.  Get a single first because it really is an odd taste and I disliked it.<br /><br />I can say the ingredients are good as far as nothing artificial, so that's always a plus.

review/summary: Not as flavorful or generously sized as other snack bars
review/text: It's hard to review something like a snack bar because a lot of time it comes down to things like personal taste and preferences, but I'll try to do it as much justice as I can<br /><br />The strawberry soy joy bar has a texture that reminds me of a dense version of a nutrigrain bar, minus the filling.  It's full of fruit chunks and has a strong, fruity floral flavor.<br /><br />What I like most about these bars is that their 130 calories make them perfect for a snack, unlike many bars that are higher in calories and fat and more of a meal replacement.  It also has 3 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein which I consider sufficient for a snack.  They do a relatively good job of tiding me over until the next meal or beating the afternoon munchies.<br /><br />That said, there are some things I do not care for, which are the reason I give them 3 stars.  The first is that visually they seem incredibly tiny for the calorie count, which makes them less satisfying in a way.  I compared them to my typical Luna bar and was surprised to find it was only 50% bigger (weight wise) than the Soy Joy bar.  Visually it looks much bigger but I'm wondering if this has to do with how dense the Soy Joy bar is.  The second is that I didn't really care for the flavor.  It was too sweet compared to things like a Luna, Odwalla, or Lara Bar, but probably on par with something like a Nutrigrain bar.  I also couldn't really tell that the flavor was strawberry.  It mostly just tasted sugary.  There were also a lot of ingredients in the bar that I couldn't taste at all.  The label mentions chocolate chips and pineapple but I couldn't taste these at all, just a generic kind of sweetness.<br /><br />Another thing worth noting is that it is not enriched with any vitamins like a lot of meal and snack bars.  This isn't a concern to me since I attempt to eat a varied and balanced diet, but does make this bar different than something like a Luna Bar that is typically enriched with a lot of vitamins and minerals.  Overall this just wasn't a bar I cared for very much.  It seemed so small for the number of calories and just tasted generically sweet and dense.<br /><br />The bottom line is that taste is subjective and you may like these bars even if I do not.  However, in my opinion I find the flavors of bars like Luna and Odwalla to be closer to what the description says and more satisfying overall.  However if you don't care for those bars and are looking for something different this may be closer to what you are looking for.

review/summary: Chewy, earthy... you probably develop a taste for these (or not...)
review/text: SOY JOY (berry) is an "all natural fruit and soy bar."<br /><br />What does this mean?  The first ingredient is "whole soybean powder" (doesn't this mean that it should be labeled "all natural SOY and fruit bar"?).  Then there are raisins, sugar, butter, dried hawthorn berries, dried wolfberries, brown sugar, eggs, beans, yada-yada.  It is gluten-free.<br /><br />What exactly ARE hawthorn and wolfberries, anyway?<br /><br />A bar (approximately .75 in x 4.0 in x .60 in) is one serving size, with 130 calories, 40 of which (about 30%) come from fat.  There are 12 grams of sugar (see the ingredients.. raisins, sugar, brown sugar).  A bar has 3 g of fiber.<br /><br />This Soy Joy bar had a "really baked" look and texture, and is not real hard, but not crumbly either.  I liked the texture.  It looked like it had been baked then sliced into a bar, not pressed together in a milling machine.  It was chewy, with a slight "berry" taste, but overall the flavor was one of light molasses.<br /><br />It seems expensive for what you get, but we are, as the CDC says, in an obesity crisis.  Keeping those snacks below 130  calories may not be dollar efficient, but it probably won't put you over your daily caloric needs, especially if you exercise at all.<br /><br />There seem to be dozens of energy/breakfast/power bars.  This one adds to the mix, and will be especially welcomed by those people looking for hawthorn and wolfberries!

review/summary: SoyJoy Berry Bar
review/text: Since delving into the world of Nutrition bars I've come across some good ones, and some not so good ones.  This was one of those not so good ones.<br /><br />Berry was the title of the flavor and while it tasted like berries, it wasn't that good fresh berry taste.  In fact, even though I know there is real fruit in this bar, the berry taste was almost artificial.  The rest of it didn't really taste like soy to me, but it didn't taste like anything else either.  It was kind of dry and crumbly and the texture left much to be desired.  It was like chewing on nothingness with a hint of sickly sweet berry.<br /><br />The ingredients in this bar really weren't too bad.  They were whole ingredients without a lot of additives.  But I was surprised to see butter and egg in a shelf stable bar.  Makes me wonder how they did that.  The berries were Hawthorn and Wolfberry, both dried and they also included some natural flavors, so maybe that's where the fake berry taste came from.  The sweetener was brown sugar and perhaps the raisins that were included.<br /><br />This bar is gluten free, which is something, and it uses whole soy.  But for the bar being so tiny (it definitely didn't work as a breakfast substitute for me) it still had 130 calories in it.  Which seemed like too much for how little and unfilling it was.  There was also 12 grams of sugar and a few vitamins, but not many.  I would hesitate to recommend this bar as a snack, just due to the high calories, but it definitely can't be a meal replacement.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't buy more of this brand.  I think I'll stick to the other, better ones.  This one just didn't satisfy.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Like a bar cookie
review/text: They were passing out samples of these the other day and so I took one and brought it home to try.<br /><br />It looks like a bar cookie, browned on one side, and smells sweet and fruity.  It tastes a little bit like a cross between a cookie and bread pudding with coconut flavor while the papaya, mango and pineapple combine to taste just about like dried apricot to me.  The flavor combination is not bad at all.  I wouldn't guess that it had soy in it instead of another type of flour and the texture isn't bad, just the right amount of chewiness.<br /><br />However, the bar is fairly small and a little dry so I probably won't be buying any.  People who like this sort of snack or have some special reason to choose them like avoiding wheat products will probably enjoy them. If I were offered other flavors to try I would taste them so my rating is neutral.

review/summary: Everything You Expect from quality Cheese Straws!
review/text: I am a "cheese straw connisseur," and have purchased many brands before.  These are by far everything I expect from a quality product.  First of all they have "ALL NATURAL" ingredients, with real Cheddar Cheese being the first listed ingredient.  The taste bears it out.  The other thing is that they have just the right amount of "bite."  A bit of cayenne pepper to make the taste terrific.  I can't stand real hot foods, so this is perfect for me.  The last time I had cheese straws this good was from Sam's Club (a Christmas special),  and Geraldine's taste equally delicious.  The price here on Amazon is really good.  Other brands are more expensive in the store and the quality is not quite as good.  I'll definitely be back for my cheese straw fix!

review/text: This is actually a flavoring agent that starts with an aftertaste.  Is is the hideous taste of cheap candy, maybe OK for a three-year-old but an assault to the palate of an adult.  After the flavor develops it gets worse.  I bought two bottles and threw them away after the first taste.

review/summary: Danish Butter Cookies
review/text: We have loved this particular brand of a truly delicious Danish butter cookie.  They have other products, but the "Kelsen" Original Danish Butter Cookie is by far, the best! The Tin itself is awesome!  We love it all!!  You get a true buttery taste in every bite!  Also sold at Costco, around Christmas time.  If you miss the chance of getting them through Costco, you can rely on Amazon!!<br /><br />Thank You for such a quick delivery!!

review/summary: The Absolute Best!
review/text: Anyone that has lived in Germany knows the Asbach Uralt brand and they make the very best cordial cherries in the world! I purchased the box for mom. Her comment is "they're delicious and go too quickly!" As a former resident of Germany I can highly recommend these delicious brandy filled cordial cherries to anyone in need of a cool gift idea. Any Asbach Uralt product makes a great gift.<br /><br />I used to be able to purchase these in a German grocery store in Orlando, but was unable to locate them anywhere, and the store is now closed.<br /><br />Even in the holiday mail rush, and using standard shipping, the box from Niche Imports arrived quickly. I ordered on December 5th and it arrived on December 10th packaged perfectly in a larger box and cushioned with styrofoam pieces.

review/summary: Perfect bombs of flavor
review/text: I hoped with this product to be reminded of my mother's handmade chocolate-covered cherries, which she too made with brandy. Her memory doesn't allow me to say they're as good, but they are very, very good, the play of the dark chocolate against the liquid sweetness and the bite of brandy making the modest quantity unproblematic because each is a perfect bomb of flavor.  A worthy purchase.
