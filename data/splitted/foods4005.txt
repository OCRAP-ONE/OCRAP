review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

review/summary: Buy This But Buy Somewhere Else
review/text: This is a great tea - I've had it before and it was wonderful and complex - but the box I received from Amazon through their vendor must have been very old because the tea bags had hardly any flavor. I had to use more than one bag to make a decent cup of tea. And yes, the water was hot enough, and yes, I steeped it long enough. There was no expiration date on the box though there is a place for one. Even using two bags, it was practically flavorless. At more than a $1 a bag, that is ridiculous. Buy this delicious tea directly from Kusmi.com or if you are fortunate to have a Kusmi store in your area and leave these for the bin.

review/summary: My favorite tea in the whole world. Period.
review/text: Now, I don't presume to say that this is a tea for everyone. I don't quite get it, but obviously, considering the reviews on the t-bag version of this item (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AR14WO">Numi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, 16-Count Full Leaf Tea Bags (Pack of 2)</a>), many people don't like it at all. (I gave t-bags to 2 co-workers, after raving about how wonderful this is, and their lack of comment 6 weeks later tells me that they didn't like it, either.) It's up to you whether you want to risk disliking it, or missing out on something truly amazing. (Rule of thumb: If you like pu-erh, you might as well try it; if not, this might not be your best introduction to it.) But for godssake, try the small size before buying 1 lb of it!<br /><br />When I'm having a horrible day, when things have turned sour and the world seems to be against me, this is my cup of comfort, my security blanket. It soothes me, calms me with its sheer deliciousness. (Give a child a big bar of chocolate, and he'll stop sulking in no time. That's my equivalent.)<br /><br />Now, this tea is amazing, but far from perfect. I wish there was more pu-erh itself than condiments (chocolate nibs, orange pieces). When I peak inside the bag I really see more pieces of this and that than tea (and chocolate + orange should never cost $43/pound; this is what it comes down to). This works better for re-steepings than the t-bags, but it doesn't go as far as most cooked pu-erhs.<br /><br />In fact, these shortcomings annoy me a bit, and I've been looking for other chocolate teas (pu-erh and non-pu-erh) to substitute it. So far they've all failed. It is next to impossible to find *good* chocolate tea; most are terrible. See: I hate rooibos, so that plus chocolate equals "eeew". I like black tea, but haven't found a good combination yet. Green tea and chocolate sounds gross; I haven't tried it yet. Same for white and oolong. I've only found another brand of chocolate pu-erh (Mighty Leaf) but the flavor just wasn't there.<br /><br />But I found a way to make this perfect: I mix it with regular pu-erh! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5L0I">Rishi Tea Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha Loose Tea, 5-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> or a Camel's Breath tuo cha works beautifully. This way I can steep it 3-4 times, and I get the super yummy flavor in a much stronger version. Heavenly!!!

review/text: I ordered this tea along with the Mint Puerh, and my review holds for both.  While this tea is a good value, it's way too bitter for my taste.  There are no brewing instructions on the bag, so I've tried different amounts and different times, but the result is always bitter tea.  Unless I can figure out how to brew it without the bitterness, I won't be ordering this again.

review/text: I bought this tea because I loved Numi's Chocolate Puerh tea in teabag form. Having tried it loose I think I'd recommend getting it in bags unless you are considering making this one of your staple teas.<br /><br />The tea settles in shipping so it's hard to get a proper mix of ingredients when you are brewing a cup. I really enjoy this tea... when I can get the right ratio of leaves and spices.

review/summary: Don't bother with the tea bags -- go for the full leaf!
review/text: Pu-erh is a tricky tea to talk about.  It is part of an ancient tradition of health-giving teas that isn't discussed or researched in the west. It comes from old (reallllly old) tea plants/trees.  It's aged in caves (natural or more lately, man made -- though purists will probably break out into cold sweats and loud fights over that one.)  This is the tea whose long tradition is of being given as a wedding gift -- like the envelopes of money in the Godfather movies.  Everyone brings pu-erh from their own stash, and contributes it to the newlywed's new stash.<br /><br />Pu-erh comes in green and black varieties -- this one is black.  Green is usually milder in flavor, and has less caffeine.  Black is considered more potent.<br /><br />Well -- this is very mild and smooth.  Delicate, in fact, like the best pu-erh touchas I've had.  The chocolate is an added bonus (who is ever going to argue with chocolate -- either for its taste -- or its own healthy attributes!)<br /><br />The chocolate and the pu-erh are both so complex that your best bet is to just dive in.  It tastes good -- especially with a little milk/half and half and a tiny bit of sugar (don't muck around with chemical sweeteners on this one. -- go for natural.)<br /><br />And go for the loose tea over the tea bags. I've had both -- and there's a depth of flavor in the steeping of this loose tea that really makes a difference.

review/text: I usually buy Pu-erh tea at a store about 40 miles away, it comes in an orange box for less than 1/4 of the price of this (per pound). I haven't been able to get to that store for a while, and was having Pu-erh withdrawal, so I decided to try this. I don't know if this isn't aged, if it comes from inferior trees, or it's something else in how it's processed (or a combination of all of them), but this doesn't even begin to compare with the wonderfully complex and slightly pungent "real" Pu-erh that I've been drinking for the last twenty or so years. A real disappointment, I hope that Amazon gets the "real" product from China for sale someday - until then, I guess I've got a drive to take.

They also make wheat soba noodles that are excellent.  I have not found any product from this company that I have not liked.  These noodles have great texture and flavor.  Be sure to cook al dante for best results.<br /><br />Now the problem with this order.  These were purchased through Amazon from RED TAG, Natural Health Formula, Inc.  They were extremely expensive to ship, took forever to receive and they were shipped in only the manufacturer box that contains the six packages of noodles.  Given the price paid for shipping, they could not event put it in a shipping box with some protection for these fragile noodles.  As it were the boxes were smashed up pretty good when I finally received them.  I will never buy ANYTHING from RED TAG again.

review/text: I ordered this product thinking it would be similar to the rock sugar I was using all over Germany this past winter.  They also sell it at Teavana but at an extremely high price compared to what I brought back from Germany (obviously there is a big expense on bringing sugar to the US).  I was excited to find these online and the picture looked like what I had brough back from Germany.  I'm not sure it was the same thing.  The crystals weren't the same color as the German rock sugar, it was cloudy in color and was more like pebbles vs. rocks.  The order took an entire 2 or 3 weeks to actually process and ship, come to find out, the place it shipped from was in my state.  I thought it was completely ridiculous how long it took and when it arrived it was poorly packaged.  It came in a white box (similar to a shirt box but a bit smaller) and the rocks were all falling out of it and pressed up against the box (between the it and the worn and dirty looking plastic wrapping that enclosed the box).  When I opened the plastic liner, the box was so flimpsy the sugar was going all over my counter despite how careful I was seeing how damaged the box was.  Never again.

It dissolves slowly in hot tea, leaving a treat of sweet for the last couple of sips (like the lovely last bite of a Drumstick Ice Cream Cone) without the tea overall being too sweet.  I had ordered some other "crystal sugar" from Amazon and it was more like granulated on steroids, all one size and dissolving far too quickly for my taste.<br /><br />If the stuff from your trip to England or the Continent is what you want, this is it, quintessentially.  Just be careful opening the box.

review/summary: Yes, the box is odd, a bit messy, but tastes great!
review/text: Sugar crystals are nearly the same as those from another provender, a bit more "sugar dust". (I think this might be due to the packaging.) I opened mine by putting it into a 2 gallon bag and transfered it to an air-tight container.  A few crystals got loose, but not too bad. I had taken the tips from our other reviewer friends to heart. Many thanks to you all!

review/summary: Great Value but It is Just Coloring
review/text: This is a great value you what you will find elsewhere.  Yes the packaging is terrible but it is a box within another box.  The inside box is poor and there will be sugar spilling into the outer box but not in large amounts.  After just taking the inner box out, leaving the spilled sugar crystals in the outer box it was still over 5 lbs so who cares how its packaged.  With that said if you are hoping this sugar will have a different or deeper flavor than normal sugar it won't.  There is more 'raw' sugar or even sugar with more molasses but this is just colored sugar.  The description is not misleading but it may not be a direct comparison to some of the alternatives.  The crystal size was pretty large any larger it would take forever to dissolve in your drink (if you care about that).

We haven't been able to find this in stores here so I decided to look on Amazon for it.  I was so happy to find it at a decent price that I signed up for the automatic delivery every 2 months.

review/summary: Dryden/Palmer Sugar Crystals
review/text: I simply thought I would give this rock sugar a try as an experiment of sorts.  Although it is labelled as "rock candy" on the box, it really is good sized rock sugar crystals.  The sugar was literally shipped lose in a box but fortunaely not too much of it "leaked" out - at least a plastic bag inside the product box would have been useful.<br /><br />I primarily intended to use this sugar in "special occasion" coffee for which it has proven to be outstanding.  The crystals desolve readily and provide a wonderful mellow sweetening that does not overpower the rather more delicate coffee flavours I am fond of - excellent with Hawaiian coffees like Kona.<br /><br />Some forms of rock sugar - even significantly more pricey versions - can be hard to desolve and require significant amounts to achieve the desired level of sweetness, also sometimes imparting other strong flavours.  Not this one.<br /><br />Excellent product at an attractive price.

review/summary: Found a Cheaper Alternative to Store-Bought Rock Sugar
review/text: My wife and I love our tea.  We have a Teavana account and often purchase their 'German Rock Sugar' because it dissolves really well in our tea without over-sweetening it.  I have also used this is in my coffee, and baked products that require yeast to activate in water for 10-12 minutes.  In all cases, this sugar is perfect.  Compared to the outrageous price at Teavana and my local gorcery stores, I am saving over $3.00 per pound when I buy this online, and the quality is easily equal to, or greater than what we used to get.  There really isn't much to say about this product besides it is perfect, does everything I need it to do, at a much cheaper price.

review/text: I buy these crystals instead of the teavana german crystals.  I like the color variations equally well and the flavor even better.  From the ingredient list you can see they kinda cheat the process but the end result is fabulous and the cost is less so who cares.  Note, they have improved the shipping process a bit by adding a plastic bag around the box.  You don't lose any sugar anymore but some of the sugar leaks from the box making use of the box to store the sugar a bit impractical.

review/text: After reading the reviews concerning the poor packaging, I purchased this and felt it would be worth the savings. It's not. Aside from the terrible packaging, it tastes awful. The German amber sugar from Teavana or TeaForte are all natural and delicious. This is just rock candy colored brown. NOT all natural and it shows in the taste. The description on these is "Amber Sugar Crystals". The box I received says "Old Fashioned Rock Candy. Amber crystals made from Pure cane sugar, caramel color." Do yourself a favor and pay the extra cash to have REAL amber rock sugar.

review/summary: petroleum derived FD&C Blue 1 = extreme GI distress :-(
review/text: Over the years my parents would send me to school and I was just fine until usually either lunch or a snack time with the school or a well-meaning room parent providing grape or fruity colored sugary drinks... or bright colorful candies.. or maybe mom splurged on those bright colorful cereals for breakfast. YUM!  Every kids dream, right?<br /><br />Well each  time I consumed some of these brightly colored cereals or pastries or drinks or candies, over the next few hours I would develop at least mild stomach pain. The deeper the color or the more I consumed, the worse the experience. Eventually it ended with me locked in the bathroom, doubled over in pain, for hours on end, as perplexed school officials called my parents to come get me, as I was AGAIN being sent home from school.  I was soo embarrassed. Pity the few subs who refused me a hall pass - I remember vomiting at my desk more than a few times to the stunned sub who hadn't realized how seriously I had GI issues. If I say I need a hall pass, I meant I *needed* a pass.<br /><br />Growing up as a teenager, dad remarried and my stepmother didn't buy much colorful "kids" drinks n such anymore. Wow, what a change, I even managed a year of perfect attendance! Me?! The kid who averaged 20+ days out sick from school had perfect attendance! My grades improved! I felt better....<br /><br />Then as a young adult, I was trying to kick the soda bucket and went back to the colorful sugary drinks of my youth. The abdominal pain and diarrhea was unreal. I began missing some college classes and my grades slipped. I was having some difficulty at work with a male boss who did not understand, he even implied I was lazy. Really? I was going to college full-time while working in a factory with forced overtime and tutoring on the side. It wasn't my fault I had a sensitive stomach....<br /><br />...until one day I was at home with one of the really bad episodes, doubled over in pain with diarrhea again and it suddenly hit upon me. GRAPE KOOL-AID.  I had consumed a whole pitcher of GRAPE KOOL-AID that day before getting ready for work (2nd shift). I read through the label... RED 40 and BLUE 1 stuck out...  so I stooped drinking grape Kool-Aid and went back to Pepsi for awhile. Symptoms stabilized... until one day when I had a tuna lunchable. A small attack convinced me to read labels- there was BLUE 1 again.<br /><br />I was 25 years old when I made the "BLUE 1 DISCOVERY". I am now in my 40s. I have since learned to avoid lotions, mouthwash, dish soap, GRAPE KOOLAID and even "white marshmallows".  Since learning to avoid BLUE 1 including GRAPE KOOL-AID my life has significantly improved.<br /><br />I discovered very serious and relevant information about BLUE 1 from the FDA website... the term "BLUE 1" and "causally linked to fatalities" was significant enough for me that I wrote to the medical doctor who issued the press release; we shared a number of interesting email exchanges.<br /><br />I  have learned some "natural" brands of "children's cereals" are made with elderberry juice for coloring. I wish KOOL-AID would change to natural colors! (If using colors at all...) Oh and I kicked the soda bucket, too. I learned what fresh squeezed lemons mixed in a glass of water with d-ribose could do for both taste AND for energy. I feel so much better!

review/text: I'd Ordered 7 different flavors in bulk.  Most of them have been fine - the pineapple has actually been fantastic - I'll have to order more. : )<br /><br />The grape tastes good going down, but about 10 minutes after drinking, I start to get a horrible taste in my mouth, and nothing I do can get rid of it.  After reading some other boards, I came across a number of other people also talking about it, and the consensus (non-scientific) is that some component is getting absorbed into the bloodstream, and we're basically tasting it from the inside.  Which I take with a very disturbed grain of salt, but would explain why I can't get the taste out of my mouth for hours afterwords.<br /><br />Given that I bought this as a tasty diet drink, I'm going to be junking it.  Regardless of the science, I really don't need a diet drink that encourages me to put other things in my mouth to get rid of the taste . . . . : P

review/summary: I USE A LOT OF THIS STUFF
review/text: Sifting back through my memory I cannot think of a Weber product that I have been dissatisfied with; as a matter of fact, I have been delighted with them all.  The N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning I am reviewing here is no exception.<br /><br />I started using this stuff some time ago and the reason for my first purchase was one single dish I wanted to prepare - broiled fish.  A good friend had given me a recipe that her family loved; an overall healthy recipe and one that was extremely easy to make.  (See below...I have shared.)<br /><br />Anyway, I did use it on the baked fish; we loved it and since then have been using it on not only fish, but beef, chicken, various stews and soups.  It is simply a workhorse in my kitchen.  I say kitchen, but I also use this quite often while grilling.<br /><br />This particular blend of spices includes dehydrated garlic, "spices," salt, paprika for color, Dehydrated onion and red pepper.  Unlike so many mixtures, blends and potions you find on the grocery shelf, this particular blend does not leave any strange after taste; not chemically twang to it at all.  It simply tastes good.  The serving size indicates there is no fat, and no calories.  The sodium (65mg) is set at 3 percent and there are zero carbohydrates.  The one and only problem I have with this product is the sodium.  While low, it is still present and if you are on a low sodium diet like I am suppose to be, then this needs to be considered.<br /><br />Now this combination does have a hot bite to it but not overwhelmingly so.  You know there is pepper in the stuff but it does not overwhelm.  When I want to add more zip to the dish I am preparing I simply shake a few hot pepper flakes to what ever I am making.<br /><br />The cost here on Amazon is quite competitive to that of our local stores.  I have no complaint in this department.<br /><br />As promised; here is my quick and tasty baked fish recipe:<br /><br />Fish Fillets - Flounder, catfish or what ever is available...your choice.<br />Plain Bread Crumbs - I like the Progresso Panko<br />Two lemons<br />-Squirt Butter<br />-Salt - if desired.<br /><br />I thaw the fillets completely.  I squeeze the fresh lemons on them while they are in a bowl; covering them nicely.  I then squirt the liquid butter on them and then sprinkle a liberal amount of the Weber Spice on them.  The fillets then go into a bowl of the crispy bread crumbs and covered liberally.  The fish is then put on the broiler thingy and placed in the oven.  I cook one side for about 6 minutes, turn them, and cook the other side for about five minutes.  The crumbs will slightly brown.<br /><br />The dish is ready to go.  I served with a mess of slaw and a side of what ever veggie I have on hand.<br /><br />It does not get easier than this and you have a very fine meal ready is less than � hour.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: Seems to help
review/text: My son has been taking Alimentum since he was about seven weeks old.  He has reflux, and also takes a prescription medication, which seems to help.  Because of the cost of Alimentum (which, to me, is mind-numbingly high), we once tried to switch him to the much less expensive Similac Sensitive.  Unfortunately, his reflux symptoms came right back, and we had to resume the Alimentum.  We use the ready-made liquid (in cans for travel and plastic bottles at home) because the taste is milder than the powder, making it easier for our baby to take.  I gave it four stars instead of five because we are spending $300 a month on this stuff!  I have to wonder, does this formula really cost that much more to manufacture, or are we being gouged because we are so desperate to help our kids?

review/summary: Has some BPA
review/text: Based on another review, I explored the website and talked with their customer service to find out the right information. First, they are working on making it BPA free, but for right now there is some BPA in these cans - according to Abbotts 50 times less than regulated limits, but it is not BPA free. We are keeping these for emergencies but primarily relying on the 32 oz container, since we do not want to take any risks with BPA.

review/summary: Great for travel
review/text: As with the other reviewer, this is the only formula our baby can handle also.  This product, for us, is perfect for taking with us in the car.  No need to use one of those lousy car charger bottle warmers.  However... unless your baby is eating a full 8 ounces, you'll have left-overs that you'll either need to store in a bottle and keep cool, or throw it out.<br /><br />This fomula, in and of itself, has been wonderful.  While it didn't eliminate our baby's colic, it did reduce it.  In addition, other formulas caused him to have major difficulty with bowel movements.  This formula had a significant impact on that as well.  It does, however, cause him to be seriously gassy. LOL<br /><br />We have noticed that our local Toys R' Us carries this product also.  However, with Amazon Prime covering the shipping, it is just as cheap to get it through this site and save a trip to that parental Hades of a store.

Ours did!<br /><br />Many doctors don't know this, so they don't know to give a prescription for the formula. Call your insurance company today!

review/text: I started using the cans once my son started eating more at each feeding; it is hard to save the unused portion if you are out for longer than an hour. Prior to using the cans...I would travel with powder.  He would only take small amounts of his bottle and get fussy, making my trips very difficult. Now, these cans make my trips out a delight.  I did find the cases cheaper at BabiesRus and it did take Amazon awhile to deliver.  I could have used express deliver, but trying to save as much as possible these days. Will try the store first next time, but will keep Amazon in mind...just in case.

review/summary: Chocolates might be great; shipping was less so; customer service is great
review/text: While it was shipped to me insulated in styrofoam, no cold packs were included in the shipment--which was heading to Atlanta in early September (the American South in the summer).  I assumed that since I was paying over $20 for shipping--the absolute fastest time, greater care would be taken to ensure that the product arrived intact.  Unfortunately, the chocolates I received were largely melted.  I do not recommend the purchase of this item to be shipped to any region experiencing temperatures above 78 degrees.<br /><br />UPDATE: Received an e-mail, which read (in part) as follows: First, my apologies for not answering you earlier... I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem.  Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens.<br /><br />The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order.  I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction.  I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part).  I am *very* pleased with this level of service.

review/summary: Perfectly Delicious
review/text: If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's R�verie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

I've had many different types of chocolate from Belgium and can guarantee - Leonidas is the "Mercedes-Benz" of chocolatiers.  The general assortment is an outstanding sampling of ivory, milk and dark chocolate.  If you love dark chocolate then go for the dark chocolate assortment.  You will not regret it.  Also forget Godiva - it's medium grade quality.

review/text: The Leonidas chocolates being peddled in the USA bear little/no resemblance to those available in Europe. After enjoying Leonidas in Germany (Aachen and Munich) for many years I placed an order here in New York State. What I received was (a) crudely presented boxes of (b) thick, hard-shelled (c) anonymous flavoured cream centres. With the exception of the coffee creams (which were more or less as I remember them from Europe) the rest of the box seemed to consist of two undefinable centres. Extremely disappointed with this order. The Godiva selection my mother received for Christmas was FAR superior in every respect -- packaging, presentation, appearance, texture, taste. I won't buy Leonidas in the USA again.

The chocolates themselves melt in your mouth and their coffee-hazlenut pralines are to die for! The hazlenut is just that-pure, unadulterated nuts-that said, some people might expect ferrero rocher like taste-its very different, and for some people, even distasteful. But I love it! There are around three layers in the box, and each layer has around seven pieces. Pretty good value actually, and makes an excellent gift!

review/summary: Good but not THAT good
review/text: After sending these chocolates as Christmas presents in the last two years, I have decided to sample them myself.<br /><br />If one includes shipping, these chocolates costs around $1.50 per piece. That is not the highest chocolate price but still a premium price.<br /><br />As others have noted, the packaging is very well done. The box itself is wrapped in a stryofoam box. The ribbons add a nice touch to the presentation.<br /><br />The taste of these chocolates, however, is merely good. As a comparison, I think the Dove chocolates one can get at a grocery store is about 80% as good at about 1/5 the price.<br /><br />I think Godiva chocolates are about as good.<br /><br />But no one gets credit and thanks for sending Godiva (non-box kind) or Dove chocolates for Christmas and they certainly don't come in a nice box with a ribbon and a Belgian chocolate brand.<br /><br />I have tasted better chocolates.<br /><br />If you want the most premium tasting chocolates possible, then these will somewhat disappoint. Nonetheless, no one will dislike these chocolates especially when given as a Christmas present.

review/text: O,K. Leonidas is one of the best Belgian chocolate makers. Alas the "pralines" they make in Belgium are not for export (too much whipped cream and perishable ingredients). What they sell in America is the not so perishable stuff (hence the nuts and chocolate cream). That may be why so many reviewers evoke Nutella. I sent a box to my brother who spent time in Belgium as a teenager. He was very happy, but pointed out that there is more to Leonidas: white marzipan with a wanut on top, strawberry marzipan and, of course the pistacchio whipped cream, etc..Leonidas remains a good option if you like chocoalte.<br />Somehow my previous review was taken off. Hope this one stays.

If we had to choose, the hazelnut was the best in the box, followed by a white chocolate that was good.  For the price, you can find better chocolate elsewhere.

review/summary: poor shipping & handling
review/text: Shipping was horrible. They claimed they couldn't keep it cool for delivery to  NY in the summer (How come Godiva can?)<br /><br />Chocolates good, but........  (others can be better-maybe these were just handled & shipped so poorly that they were no longer good).<br /><br />Gave as gift, I think I can probably do better.

review/summary: Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment
review/text: I ordered a Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment. I had to pick up the box at a local UPS outlet one day after the first attempted delivery.  The weather here is mild, not very hot or very cold.  When I opened the box and sampled the chocolates I immediately noticed a stale and unpalatable taste.  I recognized this taste from what occurs when chocolate is frozen or exposed to refrigerated air.  I responded to an email from Amazon asking for a review of my purchase.  I recounted my experience.  I received an email from Leonidas claiming that to their knowledge the product was not sent damaged.  Leonidas stated they would replace my order.  They have not.  I emailed Leonidas again asking about their intentions to replace my order.  I have received no reply.  Amazon attached a statement to the email I received from Leonidas disavowing any responsibility for Leonidas' product or the delivery of it.  So, here is my response: I will make no more purchases of food stuffs from Leonidas until a refund or replacement is forth coming.  I understand Amazon's position, but as a consumer of many items purchased via the Internet, I think that Amazon needs to review their policy regarding 3rd party vendors.  This is the first time any product I have purchase from Amazon had a problem.  I am somewhat shocked that their attitude towards my problem is: you're own your own.

review/summary: Okay, but.....
review/text: I've read reviews of different chocolates on Consumer Reports awhile ago and Leonidas was given a good rating; I was curious as to how this would taste.  So, I ordered it for the family (I just sampled..).  The packaging is really nice.. it would make a great gift.  As for the chocolate itself, well... it is better than most store brands, but not as good as Godiva.  I would rather pay a little more for better quality, or pay a lot less for a bar of Cadbury.

review/summary: Very delicious!
review/text: I ordered these chocolates for my girlfriend a few weeks ago. The only problem I had was that Amazon said it would take 3-5 days to deliver, which was great because I could receive the chocolates and give them to my girlfriend and surprise her, but they delivered them the very next day.<br /><br />Other than that, great product. Beautiful packaging and great taste. I would recommend these for sure but be aware of the shipping time and expect them faster than 3-5 business days.

review/summary: Will never buy again.
review/text: I bought one box after reading the nice rating/reviews. My hubby gave it a so-so rating. I tasted it, and was ultimately disappointed. I felt that I had to write a review to tell others. The chocolate is simply okay, comparable to $10/lb chocolate I buy at local produce. But the fillings were horrible (most of them). Given it is $36/lb + $18 for shipping, I am sure I will never ever buy another one.
