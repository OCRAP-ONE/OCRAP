review/text: As with all the Ryvita Crispbread's I've tried, these are very filling, taste great and you can eat them with absolutely no guilt.  At 35 calories per crispbread and no fat or sugar, you can eat three and be completely satisfied without having blown your diet.  I eat them with some fruit as an afternoon snack.  They perfectly balance the sugar hit you get from the fruit and keep you going for hours.

review/text: If you like black tea you'll love Typhoo. I saw it mentioned on an English show and as always thank you Amazon for carrying things no where else does. This is a really strong black tea that you have to make correctly (read: can't just leave the tea bag in like most Americans do...) and goes best with a little milk. My roommate (who has given me a hard time for having an unreasonably large quantity of tea, with good reason) has even fallen in love with this tea and steals at least a few bags a day from me so it is that good. If you're even on this page looking at it I say you pick up a box or three and give it a spin, it's way better than any black tea I've come across state-side.

review/summary: A great option for vertical sprouting
review/text: These smaller sized Sprout Master sprouters are great for smaller batches of leafy sprouts or bean sprouts. The optional tray dividers makes it easy to make small batches of as many as six different sprouts at a time. The larger tray would be better for big batches, but using these trays in concert can achieve the same effect. For most people (not feeding too large a family), I would suggest starting out with these and evaluating whether you often want to make larger batches than you can manage in a single smaller tray.<br /><br />There are four "lids" that come with this set and are all exactly the same. Put one below to catch any water and use the one on top if you want to block off light (this helps prevent the growth of green leaves, which is usually how bean sprouts are grown).  With four lids and three trays you'll find it necessary to stack the trays if you want to cover more than one at a time. The Sprout Master's drainage holes allow excess water to drain off very effectively.<br /><br />If you've sprouted in a jar before, you'll probably find this to be much easier. Hold the tray under running cool water two or three times a day, then allow excess water to run off before putting the tray away. The sprouts should be thoroughly rinsed to prevent spoilage, kept moist at all times, but not allowed to sit in water. (By comparison, with jar sprouting you'd need to fill and drain the jar of sprouts repeatedly to rinse the sprouts well, then it's more difficult to get them properly drained.)<br /><br />One minor complaint is that some of the smallest seeds can get caught in the drain holes. In my experience, broccoli is large enough to be safe, but with alfalfa or clover you might get a few seeds stuck. When you're cleaning the tray after use you may need to get a small poking instrument to knock one or two out again. The "Easy Sprouter" device doesn't have this problem, but allows slightly less light to reach your sprouts because of it's shape. Neither is a very significant complaint, and I find that the Easy Sprouter gets sufficient light for most purposes.

review/text: I germinate 2, not 3 tablespoons of broccoli seeds in one container (undivided). I allow the roots to extend into the drainage hole. I can easily hydrate the roots by spraying water across them, whenever I happen to be in the kitchen.<br /><br />Once the sprouts have matured and greened, I find the following helpful: Two to three times a day, flip the container over, and immerse the greens in a container of water to vigorously shake the seed caps loose. The roots will help keep the sprouts anchored in the box. I don't find the few seed caps that remain a problem - I simply eat them along with the greens.

review/summary: Great for certain uses
review/text: I find the trays are good but the smaller seeds plug up the holes and slow down drainage. This defeats the purpose so I got the hemp/flax bags and start the smaller seeds in those and then after they sprout I transfer to the trays so they receive more light. They I can also drain quickly by tipping on side and holding the sprouts in. I also keep the trays in the fridge after they mature. They stack and breathe so they are very effective. I plan on buying the larger trays as well for greater farming capacity. Also more hemp bags. I also plan on trying the nut milk bags for sprouting. My only complaint on the hemp ones is they smell a little musty, like wet rope. I am going to try a little H2O2 on them to see if that lowers the smell. To their defense, the smell rinses right off and they work like a champ! I am going to get another batch of three as well. The bags work excellent for bean sprouts all the way to maturity.<br />If anyone has doubts about the power of sprouts, give them a try, they are the apple of my eye!<br />I am now a sprout convert and a farmer in my own house.<br /><br />Cheers to living foods!

So far..., I've found them to be dishwasher safe when placed on the top rack without a heated drying cycle.<br /><br />It's somewhat inconvenient that it has 3 containers and only 4 lid/bases.  You can't keep two containers in the refrigerator and 1 on the counter without making your own lid/base.

review/text: I love fresh sprouts, but the problem with my old sprouter was simply that it was to big to use for just one person.  Since my wife died I more or less quit growing sprouts because of this issue, so when I saw the smaller set up I thought I would give it a try.  Works great!  And the tray divider makes it even better since different sprouts can be grown at the same time, but still in small enough batches that they are eaten instead of thrown out.  But, since there are three trays there is enough capacity to grow larger batches if the need should arise.  If you like sprouts, and are at all interested in fresh ones, this set up is perfect.

review/summary: Not what it was cracked up to be, for me
review/text: I've used the European style drip sprouters by Bioset, now called the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N03EK0">Victorio VKP1013 Round Three-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, for over ten years, with good results. There was room for improvement, but overall I was content enough with the experience to lead me to expand my sprouting adventure, and now I also grow micro-greens and baby greens in trays. When I decided to take the Bioset on an extended trip and it cracked (silly me), I thought I'd "upgrade" to this one, on the advice of one of the various sprouting websites out there, which maligned the Bioset-style sprouters and anyone benighted enough to rely on them. The Sprout Master was billed as the best sprouter in the world, a breeze to use, handy, yadda yadda yadda. The best thing since sliced (sprouted-grain) bread.<br /><br />This was not my experience. I guess it boils down to the fact that the set up is not much different than the drip style, with the exception of increased inconvenience. The Sprout Master requires hand rinsing the seeds and sprouts rather than the pour-and-drip system. This did not bother me in and of itself, however, as I enjoy the process of working with the seeds and sprouts as much as eating them. I was happy to put in more work for better results. Also, with this sprouter, you have to soak your seeds first, which the European style ones get around by taking advantage of the varying surface tension of the water of unsprouted and sprouted seeds. When they are unsprouted, a bit of the water sits in the trays, allowing a mini-soak. Once they sprout, more of the water continues its process from tray to tray to the receptacle. If you are really concerned about too much water sitting there (one of the complaints from the sprouting site), you just give it a few quick shakes, and off goes the water. Here, again, I was unperturbed: I like the process of nurturing my sprouts. Nevertheless, I began to wonder whether the results would be much improved.<br /><br />They weren't. It seems there are operational differences as well as the design distinctions. First, the holes for dripping, which I really did like at first to allow for good clean rinsing, are too large to hold alfalfa, mustard, and similar small seeds, even after soaking overnight. You lose even more as you rinse them for the first day or two. Then, unless you mist the seeds, rinsing tumbles them all around, in addition to pushing some through the holes in the early phase. This means that you don't get nice vertical sprouts unless you are uber-careful. Were that not enough, my first batch just got rotten, moldy, and nasty--something that has never happened to me in over a decade of using the drip sprouters. So I resolved to try again, thinking that maybe I didn't pay attention to placing the lids on properly (necessary in order to allow for air circulation). But first I had to pry sprout roots out of the holes without breaking the the sprouter (the build quality is not encouraging), and to poke out the seeds that had wedged into the holes when small and begun to grow, which I'd also never had to do with the drip sprouters. The second time around I got somewhat better results, but they still did not begin to compare to my standard Bioset crop, even ignoring the extra effort and loss of seeds. Far fewer seeds sprouted (and I'm using the same mix as ever), and they were a knotted mess. I could get equally uninspiring results from a mason jar and cheesecloth.<br /><br />Perhaps this sprouter does well with larger seeds or sprouts that you do not intend to grow vertically. It may be, too, that a little perseverance and a few good new tricks for the smaller seed crops would have made this sprouter useful to me, but I did not see the point. I knew I could do better, and the 30-day deadline for returns was glowering. So I sent it back, and am now trying Victorio's updated drip sprouter, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FVPP04">Victorio VKP1014 4-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, which, though still not ideal, I much prefer to the Sprout Master. The new model is BPA free, made of crack-resistant plastic, does away with the little drain spigots of the previous version (an admitted nuisance), and comes with a lid you can use to store the sprouts in a tray in the fridge. At half the price of the Sprout Master. So far, my first set of sprouts (again, using the same mix) did just dandy, without loss of seeds, mold, rot, tumbled sprouts, marauding roots or seed-clogged holes. Plus it looks oh so pretty with the sprouts all green and alive and vertical in there. (The Sprout Master is opaque, so you can't see the sprouts once they've grown--nor would you necessarily want to, unless you have the patience to pamper your seeds so they grow vertically.)<br /><br />In sum, I really wanted to like this sprouter, and feel like a "real" kitchen gardener. But I just didn't. In the end, what sets a real gardener apart is a harvest, not a name brand.

review/summary: Sometimes Small is Better
review/text: I have a large Sprout Master. I purchased it when I first got interested in sprouting based on great feedback. But sometimes it seemed like too much. Since there are only two of us, I used the divider and sprouted two different kinds of seeds at once. Yet, it still was more than I could use in a week. Then I came across the mini sprouter! How cool is this? Each tray has a divider so if I want, I can actually sprout 6 different types of seeds at once. They stack on top of each other and take up such a small footprint on my counter. Even better, is that someone asked me to sprout some seeds for them and I was able to give them the "layer" with their seeds already sprouted and ready to finish crisping in the fridge. When they are done eating them, I will take the layer back and begin another sort of seed. The mini is the perfect size for one or two people. The larger is great for families or sharing. Quality construction, easy to clean and again, each has a divider you can use or take out when not needed. This would be a great gift with organic seeds for a newlywed couple or someone wanting to bypass the store purchased sprouts that are causing many health problems. I heard Kroger is no longer selling sprouts at all. Eat healthy and use a no fail product to sprout. This fits the ticket.

I tend to forget about my sprouts on day two, so far i have only sprouted various beans and wheat berries, some cashews and sunflower seeds. I have tried quinoa, and the quinoa is so small it just got stuck in the holes of the sprouter. Other than that, this is an awesome little system. I have sprouted in jars and this is more convenient. I like that I can add onto it when I get more adventurous with my sprouting, and that this is still small enough to take camping.

I highly doubt the expensive automatic sprouting trays could be any easier to use than these. I spend MAYBE 1 - 2 mins rinsing my sprouts a day--and thats it.

I will definitely purchase this over and over again. Much healthier and better than drinking sugary soft drinks with empty calories and yes, even fruit juices (even the natural kinds without artificial chemicals and corn syrup, etc) as those are just high quantities of sugar regardless.

Instead of being packed in the standard 18-count boxes that are sold in stores, this item is packaged as a dozen individually wrapped packs of 10 tea bags in a specific flavor.  Each tea bag is sealed in its own flavor-saving pouch, just like the retail packaging, but this bulk version takes up much less space in your cabinet, while still keeping each tea bag fresh until use.  Buying in bulk like this is a great way to stock up on a favorite flavor while saving a little bit of money.  The tea itself is full flavored; a perfect selection for those who enjoy fruit-flavored herbal (and caffeine free) teas.

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Soothing Tea
review/text: The Stash Tea Company's Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea is soothing for a stomach that feels a little "off", as when you've eaten too much of a good thing or have discomfort from heavily seasoned foods.  This is not to make medicinal claims for the tea--but only that it eases and soothes.  It's also a tea to relax with for no particular reason, as are most herbal teas.  In my experience, Stash teas are of excellent quality.

review/summary: Unhealthy ingredients
review/text: We looked forward to receiving this product because it was no longer carried in our local store, however, when we received it, the name was the same, "Gold Kili Ginger Drink," but the ingredients were completely different.  I still have a couple packets of the Ginger Drink we used to buy and the ingredients are, "Ginger and Honey."  When we received this product, the ingredients were high fructose corn syrup, among other additives.  Upon seeing this, we promptly returned the item.

review/summary: wonderful!
review/text: While in Thailand for 3 weeks many years ago I discovered "ginger tea" which was (to me) a tasty and warming beverage that calmed my stomach. It took a long time to find an equivalent drink once I got back, but this seems to be the same thing. (ginger tea in tea bags is not the same product, and I could not seem to re-create it by boiling fresh ginger) This stuff is great for stomach problems, but I drink it for the taste even when I am fine. I was surprised to find it here on Amazon - I used to have to search larger Asian stores and odd corners of the internet to get it. I am pleased to see that it has become more available.

review/summary: FOR COLDS, AND FLU... AND MUCH MORE
review/text: I have started to drink this drink and giner latte one too during the September seasons, and believe me i hardly had a cold or flu during the winter times. One time a Chinese friend told me if you drink this drink in fall you won't have to worry about the rest of cold months. She advised me to drink it for 2-3 wks straight, every day, than stop and drink only occassionally. I have followed her advice and yes, it worked for me. I use to buy these only in Asian Stores, but since Amazon have them now available I am stocking up and giving it to all my relatives for winter. I love this tea and the latte even more (lol)...thanks Gold Kili, you have made me fight my cold, flu and sore throats!!!! GREAT PRODUCT YOU HAVE TO USE! Tastes strong, but does the job and you would love to drink it every day. I promise you that! As for being a mom, with kids and children around this prevents me from getting too many sicnesses during winter and stay on my feet... i just wish my kids would drink this as much as i could so we could be Free of sniffles all season long!

review/summary: Juicy, tasty.
review/text: Before I tried a 'Juicy Pear Jelly Belly' jelly bean, I'd never tasted anything like it, except real fruit. The flavor that explodes in your mouth right away is of a juicy pear; I kid you not. Buying a pound of them finally gave me a chance to keep them around for awhile, because I've always had a hard time not eating them all. I love the licorice beans too, and I really love all the fruit flavors: green apple, peach, cherry, lime, grapefruit, lime, grapefruit, lemon and tangerine, but nothing wows my taste buds like the "juicy pear". I would order more if the shipping cost weren't so high.

review/summary: Just excellent!
review/text: As someone who has been actively involved in improving my health over the past few years, my research has shown the positive effects of sea and other high quality salts in a healthy diet (Suzanne Somers, health experts and Doctors have written about the benefits in many of their books).  I have tried many products and most are very good however I find the salts from "Salts of the 7 Seas" to be the best I have ever tried!!  The quality is evident in each of the different flavors.  Who knew I needed 6 different salts in my pantry? Growing up with regular table salt, a gourmet salt never crossed my mind.  Once I tried these products, I found different uses for them on almost a daily basis with incredible results.  I will continue to buy these fantastic salts for many years to come.  Thank you, for such an excellent product.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400053285">Breakthrough: Eight Steps to Wellness</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845979125">Salt: Cooking With the World's Favorite Seasoning</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R8ZTGK">Salt: Your Way To Health (This Book Will Show You Why Salt Is The Most Misunderstood Nutrient)</a>

review/summary: Finally, a good canned chili
review/text: This chili is great. I've tried a handful of major-brand canned chili, you know the ones I mean, and always walked away disappointed. Needing something meaty that could be eaten as a meal, I was determined to find a decent canned chili. Normally I would have passed over this brand because it contains no meat, but I made a mistake and ordered it without realizing this. I'm not a vegetarian and have only found out since ordering it that Worthington is a vegetarian-only brand name. Well, it's a mistake I don't regret, because the absence of meat in this chili is not a problem at all. The company replaced the meat in an otherwise-excellent chili recipe with what I believe is mashed tofu along with some other natural stuff that congeals and even looks convincingly like meat. Thanks to the natural heavy spicing of chili, the taste of tofu is camouflaged, and only the taste of the delicious beans and spices comes through. The consistency is perfect, being just watery enough to not require added water, but still being solid enough to not be a tasteless soup. Bottom line: I find myself, a perfectly contented meat-eater, to be craving this chili at least once a week.

I also added 6 slices of jalepano with a tablespoon of the juice.  This is really good, and stays true to its intent.  Very healthy choice.<br /><br />For those of you who don't like the salt, just take a half of a small potato. Let it simmer and that will take care of the salt.

The mix of beans and vege-meat is just right, the moisture and the seasonings are quite nice.  Add "heat" (chillis, etc.) and a variety of condiments and you have a very nice, healthy meal.

review/text: I am too wimpy for spicy foods, so often rely on this chili. It's not bland, though, don't get me wrong.<br /><br />I can serve this to non-vegetarian friends (though I'm honest with them about its soy meat substitute content) and they love it! A couple friends will add some Tabasco but otherwise nobody tinkers with it.<br /><br />I've used this as chili with sour cream, on tostadas, as part of a Sloppy Joe, and even as a dip for crackers.<br /><br />The sodium content is a bit high but I'll take the tradeoff. It makes a wonderfully comforting hot meal on a cold fall or winter evening.<br /><br />Kids like this chili too!<br /><br />I generally serve two to three people with each can.<br /><br />It's also good with cornbread.

review/text: It is really hard to find good vegetarian chili that has a nice balance of seasoning, beans, and textured protein. Worthington does it just right. We turned to this brand after Health Valley stopped making our favorite chili and went to weird flavors including Mango. Dennison's veggie chili was fine, but is also no longer sold. Thank goodness we found Worthington. From the first taste we were happy. This one is chunky enough to be spooned on veggie dogs or veggie burgers or be used for chili mac. These are large cans, so two of us split one for lunch.  Thank you Worthington!

review/summary: Good chili
review/text: This chili is very good, my family loves it. This chili is mildly seasoned, not too spicy. You can also use it as a starter and add a can of your favorite chili beans and if you want it not as thick add a small can of tomato sauce. It will go farther with less expense. Tastes great and makes an easy meal. Goes great with cornbread too.

review/summary: Great Veggie Chili
review/text: The texture and taste of this chili is very much like, say, Hormel chili con carne.  Worthington has chosen not to go heavy on the heat, so I simply add some Louisiana Hot Sauce, to bring it up to my requirements.  This is also a great chili dog topper with Loma Linda Big Franks veggie dogs.  Add some sauteed onions and peppers and you have a real treat.

review/text: I grew up eating this, so for me it's a comfort food. BUT my (meat-eating) family can't live without it! Don't see anything interesting in the fridge? Open a can of Chili! My adult children still bring their friends by to ask 'Hey mom, where's that website you buy this?, s/he wants some too!' If you're unfamiliar with this vege stuff, try it first with tacos. The beauty is that the chili has no heat- you add your own preference.

review/summary: Waaay to salty to enjoy.
review/text: I tried really hard to like the product (it comes in a case of 12 after all) but I just could not take the taste. It looks like regular chili, has some fat like regular chili, has a texture like regular chili, and it almost tastes good, if you can get past the salt.<br /><br />This is the second, and last, of this brand and type of veggie product I will try. They rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat. A much better, IMHO, veggie chili can be made with some diced onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, a hot chile of your choice, garlic, oregano, chili powder, a little masa, tomato paste, and one or more types of beans, like pintos, kidneys, mayo coba, etc. Just a pinch of salt and your done, or add your own meat or substitute if you have to.<br /><br />I hope there are some vegetarians at the food bank.<br /><br />Edit: I'll add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me, so we don't eat too many of them. I will say that compared to other canned chilis I have tried, vegetarian or not, this compared favorably. But, I can't take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt. This was the deal breaker for me, as it is with other prepared, canned chilis.

review/summary: Salty, yet bland. You have to add seasonings to make it better.
review/text: As I've found with most worthington products, they don't come anywhere near having the correct texture and taste of meat. I also thought it was too salty. But I don't think I've been vegetarian long enough to forget what meat tastes like entirely. (been veg for 3 years) My fiance however loves it (raised vegetarian) The flavor of the actual chili was okay, (kind of bland) so I needed to add more chili powder, onion, garlic, and hot sauce to make it better. Cheese and sour cream were good additions to help what it lacks in flavor.

review/summary: Don't be fooled
review/text: If you are looking for the Broadway rolls you knew as a kid, these look like them and have the same name but don't be fooled.  When I found them (and I have been looking for a long time) I was excited so I ordered a 24 ct box.  I sat on the edge of my seat until the package arrived a few minutes ago.  I brought it in, opened it right away and prepared for a walk down memory lane for my taste buds.  The first thing I noticed was that they lacked the nice red color and when I got the individual package opened they were stiff.  Not at all like before when they would come out of the package smelling wonderful and the sections would come apart easily and pliable.  Wish I could show a picture here so the difference between the item picture and what I got could be seen.  Perhaps the boxes that are being sold came from an old warehouse where they have been sitting for 25 years because that's what they look, feel and taste like. So Very Disappointed!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U0O0X0">Broadway Strawberry Licorice Rolls 24 Ct Box</a>

If you are looking for a very tart strawberry flavor and gummy consistency, then this is your kind of licorice.  If you are looking for the subtle taste and firmer texture of the original Delfa Roll you had when you were a kid, forget it.  This will disappoint you.  Obviously, there was some demand for the company to attempt to bring it back, but if they went to the effort to do so, how come they did't obtain the recipe patent?!?!

In fact we held onto the final packet for his recent trip to the Grand Canyon--it needed an epic place to be finished.  This is almost the same, not quite, but delicious in its own way.  It is even a little richer than Milkman was.  Am so happy to have a wonderful milky drink for backpacking.  It's a tad spendy, and you can cut it with fat free milk to save money.  But backpacking, you don't mind as much about cost, since your perspective on life changes to what matters, such as delicious creamy decadent milk! This milk fits the bill!

They are tiny tablets that add a wonderfully smooth flavor to your coffee, or hot chocolate.

The 6 tins arrive on cardboard cards which stand upright in a molded plastic tray perfect for storing on the pantry shelf. Our favorite is hazelnut, but I keep all of them on hand.

review/summary: Best yogurt ever
review/text: Yogurt made with this starter and organic whole milk is simply the best I have ever tasted. It does not have the thin, sour taste that most of the single-culture starters produce. The taste is instead smooth and full-bodied. It is also thicker than most when a little dry milk is added. The process takes a bit longer, since the milk must be heated to 180 degrees, then cooled to 75. The cooling requires an ice-water bath, or the temperature would never get that low in our kitchen. After 12 hours in the Yogourmet Multi, which starts at room temperature and very gradually increases to 112 degrees, the yogurt is perfect every time. It is so good that it makes a good dessert all by itself, and is even better mixed with fruit. Combined with mayonnaise, it makes a fine potato or carrot-raisin salad. Smoothies are really smooth. Give it a try in your favorite recipe. You will love it!

review/summary: yogurt starter
review/text: We eat yogurt regularly and I have found the yogourmet brand to be very reliable,resulting in a good food product.  This particular item has additional probiotics so I got some of this to add to the regulart yogurt starter from yogourmet.  I used one packet of this, one packet of the regular as well as one packet of another brand that I bought on Amazon (some little green packets) and made up a new batch of yogurt.  I used a little over two quarts of fresh farm milk, added a packet of each of the above mentioned starters, along with a little powdered milk to make a little thicker product (this is optional) and the resulting yogurt was so delicious and a good consistency! I take out a sample and put it in the freezer and use it for the next batch.  This way I don't use up my packets of starter very fast.  They keep indefinitely in the freezer.  The only time I use a new packet from the box is if for some reason my starter that I take out of each new batch starts to develop an off flavor from some stray bacteria that got in.  This rarely happens as long as I keep my sample in the freezer.  What a delicious, healthy food.  It's so good for you.

review/text: This starter makes delicious yogurt. I like to use it with whole milk. You must first heat the milk up to at least 180 degrees and then cool it to 73-77 degrees. As the previous reviewer stated, you must use an icewater bath to cool the milk down. This works wonderfully. I let my yogurt incubate 15 hours and it is extremely thick and delicious! It has a bit of a tart taste, which is very yummy. I alternate using this yogurt with the Yogourmet freeze-dried yogurt for variety. I eat yogurt every single day and have been using Yogourmet starters for a couple of years now. I won't use any other brand as I've tried several and the ones from Yogourmet are the best.

review/summary: Expensive, but great results
review/text: Bought this along with the Yogourmet yogurt maker.  (In retrospect, I probably didn't need to buy it separately because there was a package deal that included it).  The starter makes amazing yogurt, but it seems like it takes a long time to get going when starting with the starter, rather than saving yogurt and using that as a starter.  So, I'd recommend using this to start the culture, but then using yogurt from then on.  The probiotic blend does take longer and you have to start at a lower temperature, but the flavor is great and the health benefits are even better.  Oh, yeah, it's important to note that for 2 quarts of yogurt, you have to use 2 packets--something that isn't really mentioned, but each packet is only 5 grams.

I have found for myself, that the key to making great yogurt is to heat the milk to 185 degrees and continue cooking it at this temperature for 10 minutes. Cooking at this temperature kills any harmful bacteria in the milk that remains even after pasteurization. It also breaks down the proteins in the milk insuring a great yogurt SET. Apparently, the proteins are easier for your body to digest in this broken down state as well. Cool the 2 quarts of milk to 112 degrees, add starter, (10 grams freeze dried starter or 1/2 cup leftover yogurt from original batch) 1 1/2 cups optional powdered milk, up to 1 cup optional sugar and up to 1 tablespoon optional flavoring extracts. Incubate until desired tartness is reached. My kids prefer the maximum sugar so the yogurt tastes more like store bought. Although with this much sugar, the milk takes longer to turn into yogurt - up to 24 hours. Try using honey extract, vanilla extract, raspberry extract, etc.

review/summary: Infallable
review/text: I used two of the 5 gram pouches for a gallon of milk (one sleeve for a total of 10 grams).  I do not have a yogurt maker and used a stainless steel pot on the stove.  After the heating process, I put the cultured milk in my oven to incubate over about 8 hours (longer than suggested).  Periodically, I'd turn the oven on for a minute or so to get the mixture about 100 degrees F, but I bet the temperature fluxuated quite a bit.<br /><br />I then strained the yogurt through cheesecloth for a few hours (while sitting at room temperature).  The yogurt is far tastier and smoother than Fage brand Greek-style yogurt.  It's about the consistency of very thick mayonaise or sour cream.  I doubt I will ever eat mayo or sour cream again.<br /><br />The starter is very forgiving.  Now that I have cultured yogurt, I'll probably use the mother instead of the starter.<br /><br />If you are interested in instructions or a recipe, although I did not follow this book exactly, it's a great reference:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931498237">Wild Fermentation: The Flavor, Nutrition, and Craft of Live-Culture Foods</a>

review/summary: The easy way
review/text: In one of the reviews of the Yogourmet incubator someone wished for a yogurt maker that was more like a toaster.  They wanted to put the milk in and take yogurt out.  This can almost be done with the Yogourmet Machine and the CBA culture.  Here's how.  Purchase two quart boxes of Organic Valley Whole shelf stable milk.  You find these not in the Dairy case but out on store shelves.  Then purchase a package of Organic Valley Non-Fat dry milk.  Are you good with this so far?  The only tricky part is warming the shelf stable boxed milk up to 77�.  I took a big cooking pot and put it in the sink and set the two closed boxes of milk in the pan and filled it with 80� tap water.  Around a half hour later the milk was the right temperature.  I ran some scalding water into my Yogourmet batch container for a mini-sanitize and to warm it slightly.  Then I added the two boxes of shelf stable milk.  Into this I mixed around 3 ounces of powdered milk using a hand mixer.  Verify that your milk is the correct temperature and put 4 ounces of the milk into a cup and mix in the two packages of the CBA starter.  Now pour and stir this back into the batch container and put the container in the Yogourmet incubator and add sufficient 77� water around the batch container and plug in the unit.  In 12 hours you will have your yogurt the easy way.  No heating, no cooling just making Yogurt the easy "like toast" way.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: Like others have mentioned, yogurt made with this is much tastier than store bought.<br /><br />Be sure to use the right temperatures - heat to 180 degrees, the cool to 113 degrees<br />to add the starter. The high temperature changes the protein in the milk so the yogurt<br />sets better, just like when making custard from scratch.<br /><br />I use a yogoutmet model T yogurt maker, which is cool. and run it for 10 hours. This<br />converts most of the sugar, making the resulting yogurt nice and sour, the way I like it.<br />At this point you can use it in place of sour cream, and it will also stay intact better at<br />higher temperatures. If you thicken it bit more, by removing some of the whey, you<br />will have the thickness of Greek-style yogurt. You can also thicken it more to use in<br />place of cream cheese.

review/summary: superb taste!
review/text: Once you master the technique of processing yogurt, using this starter will yield a smooth, firm and wonderfully tasteful product that will keep you from ever buying store yogurt again. I generally use the starter to make 2 liters and then use the resulting product as starter for 8 to 10 generations of yogurt. With three family members eating yougurt daily, making 2 gallon batches at a time, the first 6 count of starters lasted for 8 months.(Partly due to trial and error on my part, perfecting my recipe) No "Yogurt Machine!....I heat the milk in pyrex, cool in sink water bath and let the mix mature in styrofoam containers in 115 degree waterbath. Somewhat crude, but consistently effective for a superb product that amazes all that try it. I make converts to the taste and texture of hand crafted yougurt every time some one samples the product and the health benefits are tremendous. Now store yogurt tastes like drywall paste and I can never go back. Like good coffee and good music, once you try the best, mediocre is no longer acceptable.<br />ps: you can also (very easily) use the yogurt to make a cheese that is incredible.

review/summary: Always the Best
review/text: I have been making yogurt using the Yogourmet machine and this CBA starter since 2003.  It was very easy to make successful yogurt consistently so I never switched to any other products.  It is good for both non-fat and whole fat milk - although personally I prefer whole fat since it tastes original.  I use 1/2 to 2/3 of a small bag for each 1/2 gallon container of yogurt.  It always comes out right after 11 hours of "cooking" time. I will definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Raw tangy, cooked tasteless
review/text: Disclaimer: I have this on subscribe-and-save.<br /><br />I make yogurt with raw milk and this product, when I don't have any yogurt lying around it makes for a very tangy yogurt that is fairly runny. (Milk heated to 110F and incubated at same for 12 hours.)<br /><br />If I "cook" the milk to 180F (then cool to 110F before adding this) then it makes for a very firm yogurt that is bland.<br /><br />So, if I had to make a recommendation, it would be to buy this if you're wanting bland yogurt that will be mixed with various fruits. Otherwise just use a dollop of an otherwise edible yogurt as a starter and chance the result.<br /><br />It does contain sucrose so if you're attempting to be paleo/primal you will need to weigh up whether that's acceptable or not.<br /><br />Bland and firm vs runny and tangy. Your choice.
