review/summary: I think this is the best
review/text: I have purchased about 12 of Keurig coffee makers for friends and family as presents.  I really enjoy the coffee makers.  All my recipients do.  My favorite variety of coffee is Caribou.  It is bold yet not harsh or bitter. I have tried a lot of varieties and find this the best.  Orders take a day or so more to come but the wait is worth it.

review/summary: Just a good cup of coffee
review/text: Tried several different flavors at this point...this is flat out the best.  It just has a good coffee taste, not too strong or too mild.  I can get away with two little french vanilla creamers and no sugar (even considering I tend to like the sweeter side of the coffee spectrum).  Everyone in my office likes too.  I picked up at Sam's Club one time for $33 for the 108 count that I think they are offering here currently for $59.

review/summary: My favorite!
review/text: I just bought the Keurig B70 for my husband (and myself!) for Valentines Day. We opened our brewer and chose the Caribou blend for our first ever K cup. We were surprised at how incredibly good it was! We both enjoy a good cup of medium/dark roast coffee, and this one is definetly our favorite.. I will be sending for more Caribou blend soon.. way to go Caribou!

review/summary: Truly Disappointing. Product Changed. Not for the better!
review/text: We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well. Goodbye Caribou Coffee.

review/text: I've loved Caribou Coffee's Caribou Blend ever since my parents got me a Keurig for my birthday a year ago with a sampler of coffees to go with it.  Caribou was my favorite next to Newman's but I find the prices at some places rather off-putting.  When I saw Amazon's deal on them, I had to act.  And I'm glad I did.  The shipping free super saver shipping was really fast and I didn't have to break my bank to get it.  Will definitely purchase again!

review/summary: A very good middle-of-the-road blend for those who just want a plain old cup of coffee...
review/text: The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done.  We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild.  I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma.  It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste.  This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried.  We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.

review/summary: Go Caribou!
review/text: OK, so I'm a high school English teacher and a total Caribou addict.  There is not one in my city, but whenever I travel to Minneapolis, I hit a Caribou at least three times a day.  My school librarian got a Keurig coffee maker and made me a cup of this stuff.  I was immediately hooked!  I started buying boxes of these K-Cups so I could enjoy Caribou coffee all day long while teaching, and now students see a smile on my face, cup in hand, and my coffee-fueled lessons have been taken to a whole new level.  While I'm brewing my coffee, I communicate more closely with the librarian, and this has resulted in some collaborative efforts between myself and the librarian, particularly concerning research, which in turn positively impacts the education of my students.  I savor every delicious drop of my Caribou coffee while the other teachers choke down the weak and bitter rat pee in the teachers' lounge.  Guess who looks forward to coming to work every morning?  Thanks, Keurig, for making Caribou a part of my daily life!

review/summary: Good entry in the K-cup portfolio
review/text: Caribou makes a series of coffees; my current favorite is Mahogany. However, this, too is nice on the palate. The package describes the taste thus: "Caribou blend begins with a delightful heaviness on your palate and finishes with a relaxing balance of bittersweet chocolate and fruity flavors."<br /><br />For tree huggers and environmentalists, Caribou--as a company--is a member of the Rainforest Alliance, designed to "protect ecosystems and the people and wildlife that depend on them. . . ."<br /><br />The coffee? I like it. It is not my favorite K-cup product, but it is tasty. I would have preferred a bit more boldness to the taste, but it is smooth and has a nice aftertaste.<br /><br />If you've entered the Keurig world, this might well be worth trying out. . . .

review/text: There is not much to say about this Caribou medium blend coffee.  It has an unremarkable flavor with a hint of bitterness.  A bit of cream and sugar will cover it up, but that shouldn't be necessary given the coffee choices available.<br /><br />Drinkable, yes.  The coffee isn't so bad that I must throw it away.  I'll finish them off, but I won't be a repeat purchaser.

review/text: I tried this k-cup in a sampler pack. Is full-bodied and tastes good but has an aftertaste (more like afterBITE). I like my coffee smooth, so that was a minus for me, but definitely not a deal-breaker. Made this flavor more than once, and the taste was consistent with each cup. Also, I can use the 9oz setting on the Keurig and the coffee does not taste watered down.

review/text: I used to enjoy coffee from my local Caribou cafe. When I moved to a location that didnt have one I tried the Caribou blend K-cups.  Caribou blend was never my favorite, but it was all the store had at the time, so I gave it a try. The flavor is incredibly flat, one dimensional, with a bitter aftertaste, and generally unpleasant aroma (sour).  It was so off that I checked the expiration date, but found out it was still months away.  I wont buy this flavor again.

review/summary: Anytime of day coffee
review/text: I tried this for the first time today and I enjoyed it. It had a mild but bold enough flavor for me that I could drink it in the am and have an afternoon cup  when feeling sluggish. No bitterness to it and the smell in the house when it was brewing was as if you were in a Caribou coffee estanlishment.I normally lean towards a more italian or french blend but I really like this. So a great medium roast if that is what you like.

review/summary: First coffee I drink without sugar and milk
review/text: I started drinking coffee at the age of 2 when my grandpa would sneak me some in my cup. Ever since, I've required milk and sugar in my coffee as that's how I knew coffee. Drinking any coffee black was not the most appealing experience, until Cairbou. I've had Caribou coffee before the K-Cups and I'm a fan of their flavor, which is captured very well. Brewing this in 8-10oz cup sizes will give you the best flavor, and best of all, you won't need to have milk and sugar around all the time.<br /><br />There's no argument against the convenience and quality of a Keurig, and the Caribou Blend may be the best available, meaning little slices of heaven in each cup. The only downside is cost, which exists with all K-Cups. However, even at about $0.66 every 10-11oz, it's still cheaper than my neighborhood coffee shop AND it's in my own kitchen. Worth every penny.<br /><br />There are other great brands out there, but this flavor is the first to really stand on its own merits with me, and I feel like I need to pass that along.

review/summary: A very good middle-of-the-road blend for those who just want a plain old cup of coffee...
review/text: The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done. We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild. I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma. It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste. This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried. We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.

review/text: I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but purchased this flavor for my husband. He is normally a "bold" taste coffee drinker, but says that this is now his favorite. He says it is not too strong and it's not too weak. It's just a nice "medium" blend of flavor. Because he was such a bold coffee drinker prior, I stocked up. I keep trying to get him to drink the bold stock and he only says: "Do we have any more of that Caribou?". Well, looks like I'll be ordering much more of his new favorite coffee soon!

review/text: Well i was a little hesitant due to the price, and because i wasn't sure if i wanted that many bottles in one go. Shouldn't have worried though, as the taste makes the price worthwhile, and the amount is convenient since i keep drinking it non-stop.<br /><br />Although it says it's ok to leave the bottles out of the refrigerator if not opened, i stored mine in the fridge. Since it taste exactly the same way the first bottle i tried when i received them, i'm thinking it's better this way.<br /><br />This may be a little TMI, but they might be people like me who have the same trouble, so i'll say it. If you have trouble with constipation or hemorrhoids, this is perfect way to regulate yourself and make it easier. Sure you could stuff yourself with a bunch of fiber pills everyday, and probably accomplish the same results, but if you hate taking pills this work as a natural alternative.

review/summary: Finally a hard Chorizo
review/text: Being raised in Tampa Fl. in a section called Ybor city which has a large Cuban and latin population, cherizo was used in many meals even breakfast. It was always "sliced" about an 1/8 inch about big as a half dollar. Thirty years ago I moved to Texas and looked for cherizo to make  cabonzo bean soup, I found it readily avalible at most larger grocery stores but to my dismay it was soft and muschy and would not slice but just crumble and the taste was .......well different. Moved to Oklahoma 15 years later and just never thought about cherizo until I was back in Texas visiting a HEB grocery and found Hard Cherizo by the Columbus Salame Company.....WOW what a surprise just fantastic texture and taste, I found that I was able to order them on amazon and even with shipping was less expencive than the HEB store sold them for.Now I think I'll go slice some up to add to my scrambled eggs for breakfast........

review/summary: Dilmah is one of the best Sri Lankan Teas
review/text: We were drinking Dilmah tea from long time and we love them. When we went to visit Sri Lanka we received as gifts from 2 tea plantations, loose black tea. After we finished those Dilmah Ceylon Orange Pekoe is the closest we could get here to suite our busy live style[Tea bags]. It has a good aroma and a rich taste which we enjoy in a cup of tea. I would love to give 5 stars but reduce one for false advertising. Tea bags are not foiled wrapped and package does not say that any where. I think the seller is insulting the Dilmah company with misleading advertising. Hopefully, the seller will take steps to correct it. Today is Jan 19th 2012.

review/summary: Always one of my favorites!
review/text: I don't know why, but none of our local supermarkets carry this particular item anymore. I can get get Lipton Onion Soup, Beefy Onion and Savory Herb, but the Onion/Mushroom has disappeared from the shelves. Ask the managers - well they're not much help and claim they have no idea either. Yet it's always been a favorite in my family for not only soup but also as a seasoning in meatloaf, stews, etc. not to mention the teriffic gravy it makes. Another favorite of ours - onion/mushroom soup mix stirred into sour cream for a dip. Absolutely delicious! I had ordered these from Amazon before and the shipment of 12 boxes goes a long way. Just happy they're still available and at a reasonable price, which is always a plus. This time I put it on "Subscribe & Save" and even it it's only a small saving, I'm hoping that it will still be availabe in the future. I'm anxiously looking forward to my shipment of 12 boxes in just a couple of weeks!

review/text: I always used this in making beef stew combined with lipton onion gravy mix. My local store don't carry this and as always amazon save my day. In every box there is 2 packs of mix. Now, I know where to find it next time I run out of it. Thanks amazon.

review/summary: New Favorite Cheese
review/text: This Sharp Provolone cheese is soooooo good. I have always been partial to the provolone cheese when I buy it at the deli in the grocery store, but that is Mild Provolone. When I saw that 'For The Gourmet' had Sharp Provolone on their list of available purchases, I was intrigued. I tried it, and boy, am I glad I did. I think it is much better than Parmesan in the tangy-ness and strong-ness you can get from just about any cheese. I think I even like it better than an extra sharp, or seriously sharp cheddar cheese. Although, those are really good, too. It ads so much flavor and you don't have to use much of it. That is why I like Parmesan, but Pramesan is so much harder and dryer. This will melt much better. Don't hesitate to try it. It is really delicious.

review/summary: Provolone vs. Provolone
review/text: This is an incredible business. Or at least Brian Cardinale, the Director of Sales and Customer Support, is incredible. I ordered a cheese that was not to my liking, I made comment of it, and quickly received a response from Mr. Cardinale with a wish to rectify the situation. Mr. Cardinale provided me with options and one of them was a replacement with a product that hadn't been introduced yet. After my agreeing to this replacement I quickly received the product and it was indeed what I was originally looking for. While I haven't tried many of the products from this company before, this experience will certainly have me returning to them in the future. Terrific customer service!

review/text: I bought these as something of a pig in a poke, so to speak, and was delighted to discover that they're OUTSTANDING.  Tasty, great sesame flavor, physically well-sized, and in a generous package.  Wonderful alone, and also when mixed into a nut assortment.  Can't say enough good about them.  A tiny bit spendy at $1.50, but in my view well worth the expenditure.

review/text: I am a lover of Sloppy Joes. I have tried them everywhere I could find them.<br /><br />When a friend of ours told us about Bennett Chili Sauce we picked some up at the local grocery<br />and loved them. For the next 15 years I have been enjoying them. All of a sudden I couldn't find<br />Bennetts any longer. I finally found it on Amazon.com and not only bought a couple of cases for<br />ourselves but also sent a case to California to my son.

review/text: Overall it is decent coffee - it is not over-burnt and it smells good. Unfortunately, I purchased it to use with my espresso machine and it is ground too coarse to be of any use for espresso. The hot water just flows through the coffee no matter how hard I pack it. In a french press - it tastes good. I guess my 3 stars mean that product should have been described better, so that I would know in advance that it is not suitable for espresso.
