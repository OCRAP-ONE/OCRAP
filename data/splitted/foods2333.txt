review/summary: wonderful Ramen, and SO CONVENIENT!!
review/text: If you're like me, you eat Ramen noodles in cycles -- none for a while, then several Ramen-based dishes over several days, and so on.  But if you prefer the non-meat-based flavors i.e. Oriental or Mushroom, they can be hard to find locally, and I have a habit of starting my consumption cycle when my supply has already dwindled and then being frustrated when confronted with only Beef, Chicken or Shrimp at the grocery store when trying to restock in a hurry.  Amazon to the rescue!!  This is a case of 24 of the regular Ramen noodles you see on your grocery store shelves (my favorite is Oriental, but this Mushroom version is also great).  Versatile, because the choice of meat hasn't already been made for you, so you can combine with anything you choose to stir-fry or any leftovers you're adding to a soup or noodle dish.  And ALWAYS IN THE PANTRY!!  At a GREAT price, too.  This is now a regular purchase at my house!

I saw a picture that said "Chicken Mushroom," which is what I wanted to buy.<br /><br />Yeah, the title just said "Mushroom," but so many of the product descriptions are a little inaccurate, so I didn't think anything of it.<br /><br />So I ended up with a whole case of the wrong ramen. Don't make the same mistake I did - this picture is not worth 1000 words!

review/summary: One of my guilty comfort foods...
review/text: I still have over half of my recently purchased stash.  My consumption, too, runs in cycles.  I have to be in the right mood for it, but if I'm in the mood and caught without it, heaven help my poor husband!  Late at night when hubby's fast asleep and the cats are busy chasing one another, I grab a pack of noodles from my hiding place in the computer room, grab my special noodle bowl from the shelf behind the ramen, sneak into the kitchen, and three minutes later I'm in heaven.<br /><br />I never share my ramen.  Take my coffee, take my chocolate, I'll give them up without a fuss.  Just stay away from my mushroom instant ramen.  Best tasting of the bunch, in my opinion.

review/summary: Always love ramen noodles, but all the salt is a challenge
review/text: Grocery stores are usually around 20 cents per package; however, the selection is less than stellar for Nissin and Maruchan.  Amazon's price is sometimes a little higher, but considering there's a better selection of Maruchan than I can find elsewhere, it is definitely well worth it.  I can't even find the Maruchan mushroom nor the Nissin mushroom in grocery stores.  I got these Mushroom noodles on Amazon for around 22 cents each.<br /><br />The Maruchan mushroom tastes different from the Nissin mushroom, but both brand's mushroom is really good.  No matter which flavor, they're a bit too salty.  I sometimes will use one seasoning packet with one noodle package, because it tastes so good, but once in awhile I'll use half of the seasoning packet for one noodle package.  I usually eat two noodle packages, so I just put in one seasoning packet.  I put in about half of the suggested water in the frying pan to cook the noodles and all the water simmers away with no water leftover.  I add the seasoning packet at the very end of cooking, so the flavor of the seasoning is still prominent, even with half the suggested seasoning.<br /><br />I like the noodles in various ways.  I sometimes will add one or two eggs while cooking the noodles.  Other times, I'll mix in a half cup of mixed frozen vegetables while it cooks.

Perhaps it's because they are a German product, while the others are Canadian and U.S. sources.  Although this is a small purchase, the price, including the shipping, is worth it, especially since 18 cans should last me a few months.  A healthful and nutricious snack for fish-eaters like me.

The fish has a much smoother texture and the taste is excellent.  I panicked when I saw Polar was no longer available at the same store so I'm very glad that Amazon offers this product.  If you invest in this product you'll be glad you did.  Its just right for those times when you're hungry but don't want to eat heavy.  I use a small squirt of mustard on a cracker, close my eyes while I'm chewing, and have a heavenly experience.

They were a really nice deep purple. The stick is a plastic and not card board.  The stick lengths where not all the same but they were close.  Overall they were perfect for the homemade cards we made.  They were from the oriental trading company but a better price on amazon.

I realize many hard-core coffee drinkers who like extremely dark roasts might not like this one, but for medium roast drinkers who like an extra bold that will hold up to larger size settings I think this is an excellent choice.

review/text: In the quest for the just right blend of extra bold K-cups I decided to try this Organic blend. I love Micky D's Newman's Organic but found that blend a bit weak in Extra Bold K-Cups. I figured that maybe Timothy's Nicaraguan organic might pack a bit more punch since I find that coffees from Latin America can be a bit stronger (at least within those countries). Anyway, this is a pretty good coffee. I did find it a tad weak for my particular taste but for somebody who prefers a milder coffee this could meet their expectations. Personally I won't be buying this blend again but if I were at someone's house and they served me this coffee it would be quite acceptable.

review/summary: I like this one a lot
review/text: Since I got my Keurig Brewer I've been going through sample boxes of lots of different K-Cups to determine which will be my "go-to" brew. I always brew my cup using the setting for the least amount of water on the machine because I like my coffee strong. The Timothy's Nicarauguan Fair Trade Organic is strong but really smooth and low in acid. I really enjoyed drinking it and even wanted a second cup, and I am usually done with coffee after my one big early morning cup. This variety is definitely a candidate for my everyday brew.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: This coffee is good...tasty, even. But it's not nearly as good as the Green Mountain Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve (Extra Bold), which have been by far the best K-cups I've tried. Timothy's has nice flavor but the body is lacking in depth and richness. It feels a bit thinner, and not quite as complexly flavored.<br /><br />Given a choice between this one and the G.M., I'd choose G.M. -- but given a choice between this one and any non-fair-trade coffee, I'd always choose this one. It's a great buy, and it is a good choice for someone who doesn't like their coffee too bold or too dark.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: We were especially happy to find a fairly traded K-cup to order. We like this a lot. My dad and husband are both very into "good" coffee that is strong. They both find this to be "good" by their standards. I am less picky, but like it just as well too - I just like to dilute it with quite a bit of soy milk and sugar since it is a bit stronger. In short, coming from an average coffee drinker, I like these. Coffee gourmets may be able to provide much more detail about the strengths and weaknesses of the coffee, but really, most people who use K-cups just want a regular old cup of decent, fresh coffee and that is what this is.

review/text: Timothy's Nicaraguan Fair Trade Organic, Serial Number 15 15 PL 35, outright exploded in our K-Cup coffee maker. It damaged our coffee maker and made a terrible mess. Our coffee maker has not been running normally since. Obviously, we had to throw out all the Timothy's Nicaraguan coffee because we could not risk another K-cup blowing up. My advice - stay away from this k-cup. It's not worth the risk.

review/summary: Finally, lasagna again!
review/text: This is a great product. Not only is it as satisfying as wheat lasagna, it actually has a more tender quality  - more like hand made pasta. One caveat, however. Use it as you would no-boil lasagna and just increase the amount of sauce you use. I pre-boiled it the first time I used it and it fell apart. The second time, I used it right from the box and it was perfect. Cover it with foil and bake at 350 for an hour and a half. Then uncover & add cheese and bake for 10 minutes until the cheese melts. Yum!

I was very disheartened when I realized I could no longer eat pasta.  I read the reviews on this tinkyada pasta, and with prayers and hopes ordered a bulk package.  AND WOW!  It is great.  I didn't preboil it, because several reviews said you didn't have to, and it was wonderful!  As long as you bake it for a while and use a little extra marinara, you have a fabulous lasagna waiting for you.  We couldn't tell a  difference between this and regular old wheat lasagna.

review/summary: Tinkyada's the best!
review/text: Need gluten free pasta?  My suggestion is to try the other brands of corn or rice pasta first, satisfy yourself that they're better than nothing but not like the "old" "real" pasta you used before having to go gluten free.  Then try Tinkyada.  After years of other brands, and reasonable satisfaction with them, I tried some Tinkyada.  I can still remember what "real" (wheat based) pasta tastes like, and this was very close to the real thing.  It's so good that my wife stopped making two batches - one gluten free, one "her" kind (wheat-based).  She says even she can't tell the difference.<br /><br />I'm not going to try to make up a different review for each of the Tinkyada products we've tried - because this fits all of them.  These folks really have done the gluten free community a huge favor.  And Amazon's prices are as good or better than anywhere else I've found this (once you figure shipping costs and possibly state/local sales taxes).  Either buy something else to get your order up to $25 (free shipping), or just stock up on Tinkyada all by itself to get 25 pounds.<br /><br />Also, don't forget about Amazon's subscription program for food - it lowers your cost an additional 15% and shipping is also free shipping.<br /><br />Bottom line: nothing else in the gluten free pasta world equals Tinkyada, in my opinion as well as my wife's (and she doesn't even NEED to be gluten free).

review/summary: The BEST HEALTHY LASAGNA
review/text: This is the only way to make healthy lasagna.  Typical Italian Lasagna is delicious but loaded with Fat and Fast digesting Carbs.  Using Brown Rice Lasagne and a few other healthy substitutes you can make healthy lasagna.  The best part is, you don't need to cook the noodle separately.  I just put it in the casserole dry and it comes out perfect.<br /><br />Here's some ideas for healthy substitutes for the rest of your lasagna:<br />Lean Ground Turkey or 90% Lean Ground Beef (Reduce the Fat)<br />Nonfat Polly-o Ricotta Cheese (Reduce the Fat)<br />Low Fat Mozzarella (Reduce the Fat)<br /><br />These little changes make a big difference and don't sacrifice taste.

THANK YOU Pasta Joy! :) Use them as you would no-boil lasagna noodles.  For a crockpot, simply break the noodles till they fit in your pot, and layer with your favorite lasagna ingredients as usual. I cook mine on high for about 4 hours.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Great lasagna, but cook it less than the box says
review/text: When I made lasagna with this brand of pasta, I cooked it, and rinsed it exactly per the directions in the box. So many of the lasagna pieces stuck together permanently, and could not be separated, that I had to send my husband out for another box of it in order to complete the recipe. Ultimately the dish was delicious. However, next time I will probably not cook the noodles before assembly, and simply let them cook in the casserole as suggested by others.

review/text: Easiest Lasagne I have ever made.  I order all gluten-free products from Amazon.com because of free shipping and no time or GAS wasted and the reviews are an excellent way to help make a good choice of foods.  My grandson loves this lasagne and takes it in his lunch for school.  I don't precook the noodles, I layer all ingredients as usual with the uncooked noodles and make sure I have plenty of sauce or liquid (sometimes I add water to the sauce).  I took a pan of lasagne to work one day and after all my employees had eaten, each one commented on how they loved the lasagne.  I then told them it was gluten-free.  They then tried to guess what had made it gf. They guessed everything except the noodles.  They were really surprized. I will diffently order Tinkyada brand again.

review/text: Good gluten free products are hard to find.  I really like the Tinkyada products, especially the lasagne noodles.<br />They have a good texture and hold up well in sauce.  I can hardly tell that it is gluten free!<br />The only problem I have with this product is that the noodles often get broken and arrive damaged.  Not sure if it happens while in storage or during shipping.  I would suggest buying at least 2 boxes to make sure you have enough full sized noodles for lasagne or roll ups.  I purchase by the case and save the severely broken ones to cook separately as pasta pieces.

review/summary: The ONLY gluten-free pasta brand worth eating
review/text: Since I developed a wheat allergy I've tried every gluten-free pasta out there. Most are gross- they either have a strange taste of corn or beans or they get mushy or have some other weird texture. The leftovers have a tendency to turn to a weird sort of paste. Yuck!<br /><br />This stuff, however, is fantastic! You must follow the directions correctly but if you do it has a great texture that is close to regular pasta. While the flavor is obviously slightly different than regular pasta I've served it to people with a properly seasoned sauce who said it was better than regular pasta. It holds up, covered in sauce, as well for leftovers as regular pasta.<br /><br />I especially love the spaghetti with a homemade marinara sauce and the lasagna noodles made in the best lasagna recipe EVER ([...]) though I alter the recipe a bit by making extra sauce, baking a little longer, and don't bother pre-cooking the noodles.<br /><br />I'm LOVING that I can buy in bulk from Amazon, at a much cheaper price than my local health food store.

review/summary: Truly Satisfying Lasagna!
review/text: After being diagnosed with Celiac, I tried many, many brands of pasta. They were all a disappointment. Grainy, squishy, and if they even got slightly cool they'd harden up. Or they'd just fall apart in the pot if they weren't carefully watched.<br />Then an online friend recommended Tinkyada.<br />I bought a package. Just one. I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. My non GF'ers in the house couldn't even tell the difference from their regular pasta. The taste, texture, and ability to be al dente unlike most other GF pasta's makes this pasta the King of All GF Pasta's in my house. We've tried all the various pasta's that Tinkyada makes by this point and not a single one has disappointed us.<br />I'm especially grateful because my 15 yo GF daughter looooves lasagna. And was so happy to find that these noodles freeze well! We just cut them in serving size portions and then she microwaves the pasta for a couple minutes at school for lunch.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend this pasta to anyone struggling with a gluten-free diet. This pasta absolutely replaces all gluten containing pasta's, especially with how very many varieties Tinkyada makes! No more feeling sorry for yourself or your child with yucky pasta.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: Given the positive reviews posted, I thought I ought to give this sausage a try, particularly given the higher cost of salami I had purchased from other companies (Columbus Salame Company and Fortuna). The Bridgford salami was kind of a disappointment-fibrous and greasy with a somehow duller taste. Kind of like a Slim Jim with less heat and more sawdust (I'm not implying there is really sawdust in it-it just has a different texture that what I'm used to). My wife took a bite out of her slice, then put it aside and didn't nibble on it further... that is actually not a common outcome in encounters between my wife and bits of food. I did bake it with some cheese in some soon to expire canned pizza dough and it was pretty decent-my son really liked it. All in all, I'd say go a little upmarket if you are going to use the salami to snack on with fresh fruit, olives and whatnot but this product is probably fine for cooking.

Once you taste it, you are hooked. Since it is cured and doesn't need to be refrigerated, it's perfectly safe to order by mail.We had to mailorder, since the supermarkets in this area don't carry it anymore.

review/text: Well, what can I say?  I regret this purchase of Bridgeford Italian salami (I didn't buy the hard salami).  The quality of the salami is just so-so, not terrible but not comparable in quality to slightly more-expensive salamis available at my local grocers.  The taste?  Not bad but not great either, a walk on the mild side (in other words, bland and a bit rubbery-tasting).<br /><br />Stick with Hillshire Farm, Genoa, Gallo, etc...Bridgeford makes good pepperoni but their salami is sub-par and not worth the money.

review/text: I just tried Bridgford Hard Salami for the first time. I'm no salami expert, but I have been eating food my whole life, and this tastes really good in my opinion. The texture isn't grainy like some of the more gourmet brands I've wasted my hard earned dollar on. Surprisingly it isn't very greasy, no gristle bits, no bitter aftertaste, and it smells good for a salami. Their use of salt and spices are well balanced. You could eat this with a sweet beverage and there is no conflicting flavors. Overall I rate this 5 stars and will be ordering this from Amazon again.

review/text: To be fair, I didn't purchase this product.  But I found it outside of someone's home as I was wandering the streets.  What I found to be exact was 3/4ths of one of the salami, in some sort of pet food dish as if left for a pet or some wildlife.  Well, since it was left outside, I decided that the owner might not care if I went ahead and ate it.  So I did, and it was wonderful!  I am only giving this product four stars since like "Mntijo" here with his review it was a bit greasy, and I also had stomach distress after eating it.  But this product is still delicious!  I do hope the owner of the home that placed this salami outside orders more, I'd love to get more free food of this caliber.

I prefer to buy and use organic productes in hopes of consuming better quality, safer, and more healthy foods for my husband and I. The bottles came packaged very well. I personally did not care for the taste of this honey and would not order it again. That is a personal preference and does not speak to the quality of the product which seems to be fine. I found this honey to be good in quality, mild tasting, but not orange flavored enough for my tastes. I would not recommend this product to a friend.

review/text: While it's a bit on the pricey side, Puremiel Organic Orange Blossom Honey is rich enough that small doses will likely satisfy. My personal favorite way to eat it is with fine cheese and crisp crackers, but it's also amazing drizzled on apple slices or good bread. It's not overpoweringly orange-flavored, but has nice delicate citrus notes -- just the way I like it. I prefer my honey to taste like honey and not lavender or oranges or the like, which is almost assuredly a very personal preference.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned it was worth the full bottle fee, and makes a fantastic addition to cheese plates in particular. Delicious!

review/text: dont let the above reviewer's 1 star throw you. sorry her shipment was past expiration (which btw, I'm not sure that powdered hot chocolate can go bad,.. but whatever)<br />this wicked hot chocolate is really good. I'm not a big fan of spicy stuff, so the description at first didn't sound so hot (pun intended)... but my wife likes spicy things so we thought we'd give it a try. its hard to describe: yes, its spicy, but its not like a chocolate covered jalapeno or something like that -- its definitely, first and foremost, a rich chocolate, but there is just a bit of a spicy bite at the end.. though, again, not like the lingering "heat" after you have some hot salsa or something<br /><br />I also like that its a little bit thicker than normal hot chocolate when you make it . I don't have the box w/ me right now, but I'm pretty sure I remember that it has cornstarch, and it would make sense; you have to heat milk to boiling and stir constantly, much as you would w/ a gravy or any other thickening protocol w/ cornstarch.. the point being that it is a nice thick hot chocolate and not just like a powdered cocosugar you dump in hot milk.<br /><br />highly recommended. we've bought multiple tins of it and will continue to do so.

About a year ago I tried drinking Rooibos (south african red tea) and I'm completely hooked. But this tea is the absolute best of all of the rooibos flavors I've tried from Teavana (I'd also recommend Adagio's Rooibos Jasmine and Green Rooibos Citron if you're looking for more flavors). It is incredibly floral due to all of the flower petals (including whole dried rosebuds) and fruity at the same time from all of the strawberry, with a slight sour kick. I drink this tea every day and it always cheers me up.

review/summary: Most dissapointing rooibos I've tried
review/text: At home right now I have the following rooibos teas:<br /><br />Salada Green Tea with Red Antioxidants (strawberry-orange)<br />Equal Exchange Wild Rooibos<br />Port Trading Cape Rooibos<br />Zhena's Gypsy Red Lavender<br /><br />These are all bagged teas.  In addition, I have some loose rooibos from a local tea specialty store called Virtuous Teas.<br /><br />Of all of these rooibos (or rooibos-containing) teas, the Teavana Tropica is the worst by far.<br /><br />Firstly, it is difficult to even tell if it contains any actual rooibos; any such flavoring is completely overwhelmed by citris.  Given that the tea is actually *called* a rooibos tea, I find this completely unnacceptable.<br /><br />It would be another matter if rooibos was simply listed as one of the ingredients.  For example, the Salada green tea I mentioned doesn't pretend to be a rooibos tea.  "Rooibos" is listed as a constituent (along with lycopene, anthocyanins and vitamin C), but the tea is called "Green Tea Fortified with Red Antioxidants."  Although the Salada tea is not called a rooibos tea, it is much richer in rooibos flavor than Teavana's so-called "Rooibos Tropica."  Teavana's tea should simply be called "Tropica" with rooibos listed as an ingredient (if there is any actual rooibos present ... I'm not convinced).<br /><br />Secondly, the tea's "tropical" constituents manage to produce a cloying experience in a tea that is otherwise too weak.  I have not been able to brew a pot that had any satisfying tea impact whatsoever -- it has always felt too weak regardless of how much tea I've used -- yet making it stronger simply imparts more of the bad tropical mix.  And the tropical mix *is* bad, as if I steeped some orange peels and random flower petals in hot water.<br /><br />This tea dissapoints on multiple levels.  Also, the fact that it is marketed as a rooibos tea will make me wary of any other Teavana offerings.
