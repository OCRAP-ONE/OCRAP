review/text: I first found this sauce on a trip to St. Lucia. I put some on a chicken sandwich and I thought I had died and gone to heaven! I _hate_ hot sauces that are just "hot", there's no point. This sauce is spectacular at bringing out flavors from food that you've never tasted before as well as adding multi-dimensional heat.<br /><br />Buy the big bottles, and use it on everything!

review/text: I bought this on Amazon a while back on a whim and I'm loving it.  Personally, I wouldn't consider it so much of a hot sauce, to me hot sauce is an ingredient whereas I LOVE this on my burgers.  I'll definitely be buying a couple bottles of this for the grilling season this year.

review/text: As previous reviewers have mentioned, this is one of the most flavorful (if not THEE most flavorful)of all the hot sauces I've tried. Very original taste and much more of a kick then the generic hot sauces. I've yet come across a house guest who hasn't raved about it. On that note - if you don't like HOT it might not be for you.

review/text: We tried this popcorn after the local grocery store had it on sale.  We loved it.  Not salty, and chemical tasting like others.  reminded me of the popcorn we made in the hand popper.  I checked with the manufacturers website and if you let them know you want it, they will let your retailer know. However, it is bag for bag cheaper here.<br />We had no problems popping it using the 3.0oz popcorn button on our 1000 watt micro.

review/summary: Popcorn consistently scorched beyond usefulness
review/text: Jolly Time's "Homemade" popcorn comes in a clever bowl-bag that's supposed to tear open along one side to form a convenient bowl.<br /><br />It's a clever idea, but it certainly didn't work in my 1000 watt microwave:<br /><br />1. Popped kernels burn quickly during popping due to the way the unusual bag unfolds.  The popcorn was hopelessly scorched, even if I followed the instructions carefully.  I eventually managed to minimize scorching by stopping it so early that only half the kernels had popped, although a few kernels were still scorched at the top of the pile.<br /><br />2. The bag doesn't really open into a convenient bowl.  The opening is just a narrow slit.  Any effort to open it wider causes gaps to open at the ends, causing popcorn to spill out.<br /><br />3. The bottom of the bowl is searingly hot, so you can't rest it comfortably in your lap after popping.  It was too hot to rest on wood furniture.<br /><br />So the bowl-bag has serious problems, and precious few advantages.  It was a nice goal, but this product just didn't deliver.

review/summary: Wow
review/text: I actually purchased 2 sets of this tea. One for myself and the other box for my friend in Saudia Arabia. I decided to try drinking more tea and less coffee and wasn't sure if the switch was really going to happen. I had already purchased several brands of teas from my local suppermarket but nothing was convincing me to give up the coffee until I got this selection.<br /><br />This ain't your mothers tea!!<br /><br />The first one I tried was the Jasmine Flower Tea. The directions say to let it brew for 1-2 mins but as soon as i poured the hot water you instantly get an aromatic hint of things to come. Just a little milk with this tea and your tastebuds are dancing a jig.<br /><br />Pay close attention to the brewing direction of each variety because some require a longer brewing time.<br /><br />I have replaced 3 cups of coffee with these teas and cut down on my sugar intake(not putting as much sugar in the tea as I did the coffee).<br /><br />There is one problem though...I do not know if my friend in Saudia Arabia is going to get the box I bought for him.

review/text: I bought this brand because my favorite brand was sold out and I thought I would try something new.  What a mistake.  This "peanut butter" is not entirely peanuts!  Its peanuts mixed with oil.  So what if its Organic.  If I want Organic peanut butter, I want it made out of peanuts.  I got crunchy, because I love the nuts in crunchy peanut butter.  But this is really smooth, slightly peanut flavored oil with a few nuts mixed in.<br />Dont waste your money.  This stuff is gross!  Gross!  Gross!  I will never purchase it again.

I'm skipping this shipment and I'll keep my fingers crossed that the price returns to its usual level for next month's shipment.  FWIW, my dogs love the food, so I'm giving it 3 stars.  I'd give it 4 stars if the price were reasonable.

review/summary: Rich tomato flavor
review/text: I picked up a container of this on a whim at the grocery store and really liked it.<br /><br />The soup is nice and thick and has a rich tomato flavor. It's a thick, creamy soup--much more filling than the regular Campbell's condensed tomato soup. There are actually little chunks of tomato in the soup.  It also tastes like it has a lot of black pepper in it.  I like that as I usually add pepper to my soup anyway, but some people might not care for it.  The container is a nice size.  It has enough for two servings if you're doing a soup-and-sandwich type thing, but it's large enough for one good meal sized portion if that's all your having.<br /><br />You should note, though, that the container says specifically NOT to microwave the soup in the container.  This makes it a less desirable option for carrying to work, unless you're also willing to carry another container.  Though it loses points on the convenience factor for the non-microwaveable packaging, it has a great flavor and I'll probably buy it again.

review/summary: I love this soup!
review/text: I have never been one to like Tomato soup...at all! I sampled this at Walmart a few months ago and my only regret is that I did not pick up more coupons as this soup is a bit on the pricey side. As the other reviewer stated, you cannot heat the soup in the container which is a bummer but other then that, I have no complaints. The soup itself is very rich and the flavoring is wonderful; one minute I think it is spicy but the next bite seems sweet, it constantly changes. I try to purchase a few at a time when they are on sale. I have only tried one other flavor so far, the mushroom bisque but this flavor wins me over every time!<br /><br />EDIT: Be careful of the pull top metal lid. I have yet to be able to pull it off without splashing the soup on something..or someone.

review/text: The first time I had White Chicken Chili was in 2007 at one of my favorite restaurants in Virginia. I saw "White Chicken Chili Nachos" on the menu and I am so glad I ordered them. The next day I was in the Supermarket and discovered this seasoning pack. I have made this chili over 100 times since then, and there is never any left! I always use cannellini beans and corn. I also mix in a little or a lot of shredded white cheese at the end and let it simmer. I don't add tomato, but you can. I have made this with ground turkey, ground chicken, diced chicken breast, and shredded chicken cooked with diced onions. It tastes good either way. I am a big fan of this stuff and you can even make it as Nachos or Enchiladas! Add a dash of crushed red pepper flakes if you like it spicy. There are many ways to make this chili, and they will all be great!

They are known around my office as "the best candy ever."  The bag of candy comes in a clear package that is sealed so the candy stays soft.  Even when open to the air, the candies stay soft for around 2 days (though they won't last that long).  One drawback: the price is a bit steep for 1.5lbs of candy.  Despite the price, I keep coming back for more.

I tried O Zinfandel red wine vinegar a few years ago after it had placed first in America's Test Kitchen's Gourmet Red Wine Vinegar taste test. I've also seen Jacques Pepin use it on his cooking shows. It's a sweet vinegar, which Americans tend to prefer, very different from harsh super-acidic European vinegars. This is vinegar, though, so it's not sweet in the syrupy sense. It has a sharp, well-balanced flavor that is unusually rich by vinegar standards, with hints of cherry. This is how O Olive Oil describes it:<br /><br />"Handmade in small batches in the Orleans method and aged in oak barrels for over two years. Smoky spice and voluptuous cherry notes emerge from old vine California grapes in this artisan vinegar."<br /><br />The description of the flavor is about right, but it needn't be as pretentious as it sounds. Use O Zinfandel in anything that calls for red wine vinegar, or just drizzle it on greens or vegetables. It's especially good in dishes that contain onions, as it balances out the sharpness. In case you're wondering, the Orleans method of making vinegar was the first commercial method developed. A small amount of vinegar containing the mother bacteria is added to a cask of red wine. After a few months, the vinegar is moved to another barrel for aging. O Zinfandel is aged in oak barrels for 2 years, at which point bing cherry juice is added, before aging another 6 months. Ingredients are: aged zinfandel vinegar and bing cherries. Acidity is 6%, and it contains sulfites.

review/text: I like the crunchy better than the creamy.  I just found that it harden in the fridge.  I didn't dare keep it out like normal peanut butter and couldn't find anywhere that said it.  If it doesn't have to be in the fridge, then it may stay creamier longer.  It's nice not having the oil to mix in, but it has more of a bitter taste than other brands.

review/text: This brand has been implicated in the big "Chinese chicken" dangerous dog treats disaster. That's enough to condemn these treats. But I'll go ahead and discuss *all* their issues.<br /><br />First thing I noticed: they REEK. Oh goodness do they smell terrible. Rancid.<br /><br />Also, despite being called "cowboy steaks" these are CHICKEN. So if you think you're avoiding the dangers of Chinese poultry products, beware!<br /><br />They are made of chicken and rawhide and are steak-shaped choking hazards. Excitable dogs who don't chew would run into trouble with the rawhide part of this "treat".<br /><br />Even if there was no controversy surrounding this brand, I would not give these to my dogs. I'm annoyed by the misleading name, disgusted by the product, and worried about safety. Minus, minus, minus!

review/summary: I was disappointed in this can of fruit!
review/text: This is just one of two types of canned fruit from Roland that I do NOT like.  It's like they picked totally unripened  pineapples and just sliced and packed them in the unripened fruit juices.  They are really quite awful!  The one and only can I opened... I ended up throwing out 75 % of it.  The remaining 11 cans I plan to use in making smoothies or on top of hams being cooked or anywhere that pineapples are just a secondary article in the cooked product.  When I bought other company's products, I use to love just opening a can and eating several slices for a sweet, delicious desert.  You can not do that with these tasteless, hard, bitter, totally unsweet cans of fruit.  I will not be buying this particular canned fruit from Roland ever again but they do make many other canned fruits that are scrumptious so, along with the awful Kiwi, I will add this to my 'DO NOT BUY' list!!!  Maybe they were having an "OFF" production cycle but it does not justify selling this crap to us consumers.

review/summary: Sweet/Tart natural flavor
review/text: Roland has a winner with this product. No heavy, sugary syrup, just fresh tasting tart yet naturally sweet flavor. These slices make a lovely lettuce, pineapple and grated cheddar cheese salad that tastes just like my mom used to make using fresh pineapple. I have also used it for pineapple upside-down-cake which came out moist and flavorful. If you are accustomed to canned fruit in heavy, sugary syrup and prefer that, then this product is not for you. According to the label, the only ingredients are pineapple and pineapple juice, no added sugar. 0 fat, 0 cholesterol, 10mg sodium, 1g protein and 17g carbs. 70 calories per 1/2 cup. Each can is a hefty 1 lb. 4 oz. For a quick healthy snack try slices of red delicious apples, topped with a pineapple slice and sprinkled with a little brown sugar. Bake or broil for a few minutes and enjoy.

review/text: These brown rice cups solved my dilemma about eating Chinese take out at lunch time. I prefer brown rice and the nutrition it offers over white rice, but the Chinese take out place near my office only has white rice.  I had thought about cooking brown rice at home and freezing it in small containers to bring to the office, but I don't have appropriate containers and really didn't want to purchase containers only for this use.  I was pleased when I saw these rice cups at my local supermarket. I was more pleased when I followed the package instructions and I had the perfect amount of real brown rice. I expected a Minute Rice type of precooked rice, but this is the real thing. Not as good perhaps as the organic brown basmati I cook at home, but it's convenient, steaming and much better than the white rice from the Chinese take out place. Now I feel like I'm eating a healthful lunch when I have my favorite veggie stir-fry.

Maybe I've been using it for so long that I can't tell the difference between this and regular pancake mix.  Maybe it's that I use coconut oil in the mix instead of other oils.  (Sometimes I also add about a teaspoon of melted butter into the mix if I want my waffles more crispy)and other times I'll add half milk and half water or substitute the water for milk completely.  My brother adds sugar to the mix to sweeten it- but to me that not only makes them too sweet it also defeats the purpose of having the low carb mix in the first place.  I think it tastes just as good as the regular stuff.

review/summary: Giraffe - Chocolate + Peanut Butter
review/text: I love the endagered species bars, everyone I have had is so yummy.  The only reason I give this one 3 stars is because there is no peanut butter taste to this chocolate at all.  It makes for a very smooth rich milk chocolate but there is no peanut butter flavor found.  Still a great bar, but dont expect to taste peanut butter.

review/text: My fiancee and I tried out various flavors of Endangered Species chocolate in the hopes of giving them out as wedding favors. I tend to only review items I think are pretty good, but in this case I have to say that the Endangered Species Peanut Butter bar was the worst chocolate bar I ever have eaten in my life. It tasted like plastic was melted in. Truly horrible.

review/text: This is one of my favorite teas aside from green tea.  It is smooth and rich in taste and yet caffeine free.  I would recommend this tea to those who are not big on tea drinking because it doesn't taste like black tea, has no caffeine, yet it has the texture and richness of black tea and none of the fruity flavors or herbal tea.  You'll be hooked the first time you drink it!<br /><br />The package arrived quicker than I expected. Just be careful when you open the package: the container is a paper bag and mine had a small crack that I didn't notice right away, so some of the tea spilled out, but it wasn't a big deal at all because there is so much tea in the bag, you'll be enjoying it for a long time.<br /><br />African Redbush Tea benefits are explained here:<br />[...]

review/text: Satisfied customer.  The product arrived promptly and was as advertised.  It tastes at least as good as the rooibos tea that I used to buy locally.  It is no longer available locally, which is why I had to buy it on the Internet.<br /><br />I was first introduced to rooibos a few years ago while I was on a bicycling tour in New Zealand.  The owner of the farm hostel where we were staying invited us in for tea.  Rooibos does not have a sweet, flowery taste like most herb teas but is more robust.  Savory rather than sweet.  Sometimes I drink it with milk and sugar, other times just plain, depending on my mood.

review/text: I've recently discovered the joy of brewing whole leaf tea.  I was intially dismayed at the prices I was seeing per ounce for different teas.  I went to Teavana and bought a few ounces of flavored teas, but was cringing at the price.  I found Davidson't bulk tea here and I won't be back to Teavana except to visit!  I got tons of tea at a fraction of the price I would pay anywhere else.  Plus, this Rooibos is delicious!  It's got such complex flavor and depth.  I won't be running out of tea for a good long while, but when I do, I'll buy this again.

Place a heaping teaspoon in a travel mug, add a bit of water to moisten (it helps reduce floaters), slosh about, fill it up and away you go! Yes, the tea does settle on the bottom of the mug so you don't get a mouth full of attractive bits sticking to your teeth.<br /><br />The flavor is nutty, full bodied, and leaves no blah aftertaste like most herbal teas. The flavor stays consistent. No bitterness from this cup of Red Bush tea!

review/summary: best rooibos I have tried so far
review/text: I have tried many rooibos teas over the last two years.  I made a decision to take most of the caffiene out of my diet and this has so far been the only non-caffienated tea that I have liked.  A mild taste, nice color.  I will of course keep searching but no bagged rooibos I have tried has come as close as this loose version.  I make it using three cups of hot water, 1/3-1/2 cup of loose tea, in a coffee press.  Two things I like about this tea are: 1) it is very hard to make a brew which is too strong, 2) not being a "leafy" tea, it contains no tanins which means if you brew too long that is OK, you don't get the wicked bitterness from tanins which you would find in other teas that contain them.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!

review/text: Order came and on inspection the tea is clean and pure.  On brewing, my impression was that it was on the bland side.  I realize that all the rooibus that I have had before was in blends so I am not sure if the tea is old or if this is the nature of the product.<br />So I use it for the basis of my own blends.  It is good with mint, citrus peel, hibiscus, roses, and candied ginger.  I like just a little sugar or stevia with these blends.  Anyway, use your imagination.

review/summary: Best rooibos tea money can buy
review/text: This is my first time buying a Davidson's product.  The weight/price (overall value) was what ultimately convinced me to buy it.  I also wanted a red tea that was Organic, and this one's USDA Certified - what a consider a bonus.  Like others before me have suggested, the packaging is decent, but probably for long-term, I would advise putting it into something more air-proof like an metal canister (since zip lock bags allow air to pass through over time).<br /><br />With regards to flavor, it's exactly what I've been looking for.  My previous favorite was the Kalahari Rooibos-Honeybush tea, which had a distinct but natural and not overbearing sweetness.  Davidson's matches that flavor for me perfectly, without any additives which is a BIG deal to me.  Also, if you're an environmentalist like me, I would suggest using tea infusers (not strainers, because red tea is very light and tends to float atop of the water), which fully submerge in your teacup.  You'll save on teabags and all associated wastes!<br /><br />Red tea quality tends to be measured in terms of "leaves" to stems ratio.  Since stems don't really carry any flavor (they are considered "fillers" - company's use these to sell the product by weight rather than quality).  The higher quality red teas will therefore have a greater leaf:stem ratio, but this is something that you'll most likely have to check for yourself after purchase.  As a quick and rough estimate of this, you can gauge the redness/darkness of your tea based on one teaspoon - you'll see different tea spoons of different teas will offer a different color and taste strength.<br /><br />Overall, I've been sold on this tea, and you will be too.  Will definitely buy again (and soon too).  Subscribe and save!

review/text: I'm a fan of Alexander McCall and Mma Ramotswe, so when I saw a chance to try her bush tea, I couldn't resist.  When you open the bag, it smells a little like aromatic pipe tobacco.  The flavor is surprisingly delicate, especially compared to green tea, and it's much easier on my stomach (green tea upsets it).  I drank 6 cups or so in place of coffee at work today and hope to make a habit of it.

I purchased tea regularly and probably have about 6 or more cups of hot or cold variations of white, black, and green tea. this was my first attempt at trying this kind of tea. I was instantly reminded of growing up in New Jersey and falling in a pile of leaves on a rainy winter day. This tastes like a mixture of wet leaves and stale cinnamon. It could be the healthiest in the world, I don't know, but it doesn't taste good at all.
