review/summary: Sugar - I knew I was making a mistake
review/text: I remember buying Ragu a few years ago and never buying it again, but I could not remember why. Just look at the container, its tomato sauce, what could go wrong. Everything about it is wrong for me now that I tried it once more and I am writing a review to remind me later. This contains sugar and sugar is same as poison for me, the taste just makes me mad. The container label says there is only 10g of sugar per 1/2 cup/128g serving, but when I eat it it feels like 50g. There is no tangy tomato flavor, it feels like I am eating juice or jam or something too sweet, not pasta sauce like. I compared it with a can of "Del Monte Chunky garlic and herb" sauce and Del Monte is so much better. It contains 9g High Fructose Syrup in place of Sugar but I felt it was much more satisfying, tastier, less sweet and more tangy than Ragu and its cheaper too. Did i miss to say Del Monte is Chunky while Ragu is not!, even when labelled Chunky. If you want to buy Del Monte sauce online with fast shipping try Amazon's grocery site "soap" dot com. Ragu is America's worst tasting sauce not like advertised at all, more like America's favorite Tomato flavored jam/syrup.<br /><br />Also double checked ingredient list on the bottle and it says sugar while amazon says corn syrup. Amazon should have said sugar and helped me save $18, so 1 star for amazon too.

review/text: I purchased this mix on a whim as we had just purchased one of those cute little Cake Pop/Donut hole maker.... I was so impressed by it!!! I was worried that it was just going to turn out like cake but they had a true donut like texture, and the icing was fantastic.  Great for those of us who like the gourmet taste without all of the gourmet work.  We frequent the Stonewall Kitchen store in York Maine every year, we've never received a product that wasn't top quality.  Im wondering if the other reviewer purchased the mix from a retailer who had it sitting on their shelves for too long.  I can tell you we loved it!

They are loaded with fiber and satisfy you for hours.  They're great to have in an emergency when you can't or don't have time to eat.  I haven't had any flavor that I don't like, but the chocolate chunk raisin is my favorite.  At Christmas time, there's a wonderful version with cherries in it.  They're even great warmed in the microwave for a few seconds.  Just love these cookies!

review/summary: Breakfast cookies hit the spot!
review/text: I first tried these cookies years ago and loved them.  However, there was a problem with the nutritional information listed on the wrapper, and I learned that they were much higher in calories than I'd thought.  I stopped eating them and actually forgot all about them.  Recently I was getting coffee at the local mall and they had the cookies for sale.  I bought one and rediscovered how good they are.  They're moist & chewy, with large pieces of whatever fruit, nut or chocolate is in that particular flavor.  They're delicious right out of the wrapper or heated in the microwave for a few seconds.  They're pretty filling and definitely satisfy my craving for the occasional sweet.  I can eat them without feeling like I indulged in empty calories.  I have to say that my daughter doesn't care for them at all -- she says they taste "oat-y", like a horse treat!  I understand what she means, but I don't mind what I think of as the 'organic flavor'.<br /><br />I've purchased 3 different flavors: Chocolate Chunk Raisin, Fruit & Nut, and Double Chocolate Chunk Cherry (seasonal flavor).  They're all delicious!  Because they're high in calories, I reserve them for a special treat, usually as a bedtime snack.  I appreciate that there is no high fructose corn syrup in these cookies.  Obviously since they're individually packaged there is built-in portion control.  They're pricey, but in my opinion they're worth it.

review/summary: A great way to start your day
review/text: These cookies are a life saver in the morning!  I am busy chasing my toddler around as soon as her tiny feet hit the floor when she gets out of bed.  I take one of these out of the freezer and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds while I chop up fruit for Tiny's breakfast.  When she points at my breakfast asking for a bite, I feel good knowing these cookies aren't frankenfood and give her few pinches to share with her.  They are a great way to start the day; paired with a cup of coffee, a bit of fruit and a glass of water -- I am totally full until lunch.<br /><br />The chocolate chunk raisin flavor is great, plump raisins keep the cookie moist and the large chunks of chocolate are very good.<br /><br />These are such a deal at less than a buck a cookie with S&S on amazon; the ingredients and consistant product quality make it money well spent.

review/summary: Excellent chocolate taste
review/text: One of my favorite candies is rasinettes. This is the closest cookie I have found to that taste. It also has one of the best tasting chocolate tastes of any store bought cookie I have ever had. Add to that, they are invididually wrapped and a substantial size, this is a very good buy. Especially if you like soft cookies like I do. There is a good amount of rasins in the cookies, but they do not overwhelm at all the chocolate but compliment it.<br /><br />I know Erin also sells just a chocolate cookie. If it is the same used here, I would highly recoomend that as well if you are not particularly fond of rasins or raisins or don't want them to get in the way of your chocolate.

review/text: I purchased two of these cookies when in Seattle and went looking online to buy them about 2 months later.  I have purchased 2 dozen on Amazon and had them shipped cross-country to me.  I followed the suggestion to freeze them to keep better.  They are very good and give a "hearty meal" feeling anytime of the day.  It says they are toaster friendly but I have only warmed one up in the microwave.  I will probably re-order although I have been searching the internet for a recipe that might bake up as good as the real thing.

review/summary: Safety Instructions for coca tea
review/text: All NovoAndina Products ( Produced or distributed) do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />NovoAndina products do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All our Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store NovoAndina products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Our teas are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea.

review/summary: Cute Little Gift Set - Just Not For Fans of the REALLY Hot Stuff!
review/text: I picked up one of these little "spicy 12-packs" last year from a hot sauce shop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I've long been a fan of the Dave's range of sauces and was very taken with the little miniature sampler bottles and the chance to try out so many of their sauces for a relatively good price. The bottles live on my desk at work and I've been merrily sampling my way through them for a while now.<br /><br />This is a great little set that will ensure you always have something slightly different to try depending on your mood, but for the serious lover of outrageously hot sauces like myself, there is nothing new to discover here. That's not a bad thing - these sauces are all as flavorful and complex as you'd expect from this company, and with such a wide range of flavors there's something to match just about any meal. If you're already familiar with some of the hotter sauces in the Dave's range, though, what you won't find here is anything new in the way of sauces that will give you that endorphin rush that comes from a sky-high Scoville rating. By far the hottest of the bunch here is Temporary Insanity (a "mere" Insane on the Dave's Insanity scale), and I already had a bottle of that lurking in the fridge.<br /><br />I'm not knocking this set at all, though - it's something that will be appreciated by anyone who likes things slightly on the hot side looking to sample a few and find a new favorite. If you're like me and find yourself going out to eat and wishing the place stocked some decent hot sauce, these little bottles are the perfect size to stash in your bag before you go. I polished off my mini-bottle of Rowdy Red Chile within a few days and refilled the bottle with Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce. That bottle now lives in my purse and comes with me everywhere I go, so never again will I have to endure a breakfast that fails to blow my head off in the expected fashion!<br /><br />I'd love to see a similar set featuring all the REALLY hot sauces in the range (as Dave's is, after all, famous for these!) - that would be something I'd pick up in a second.

This box also contains: Coconut, chocolate covered peanuts, caramel, chocolate covered almonds, chocolate whip, pecan and English walnut cluster, molasses chew, messenger boy, cashew cluster, chocolate truffle, toffee, cherry cordial and toffee. The product description says this is sugar-free but I beg to differ. These are some of the sweetest chocolates I've ever eaten. Some of the ingredients include: Chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, whole mik, milk fat, soy lecithin, almonds, cashews, peanuts, walnuts, pecans, sugar, brown sugar, condensed milk, butter, dairy cream, cherries, corn syrup, palm kernel oil, coconut, molasses, white chocolate tapioca flour, honey, natural and artificial flavors and preservatives. Some of the chocolates are dark chocolate and some are milk chocolate. Everything is delicious.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Very tasty black tea with peach
review/text: The peach flavor is what I would characterize as 'a hint of peach'. Not a strong peach flavor. It is a nice balance with the tea, but perhaps could be a little stronger peach flavor.<br /><br />This is a good tea to make peach iced tea. I heat the water to 180�-190� and brew it for 3-4 minutes. I've had better results pouring the hot water over the tea leaves. I use 2 TBSP in 1 liter water. Stirring half way doesn't produce any noticeably different results. I then pour through the infuser into a pitcher of ice.<br /><br />Will definitely buy again.

review/text: I love this oatmeal because it has the most protein of any oatmeal out there. I love the cinnamon flavor best, tho the others are great if you like banana bread and maple sugar.  I just wanted to get the cinnamon individually and this company provided it. Has been discontinued, I hear, but it's coming back--yea, Quaker.

We stir in some frozen blueberries after it's cooked and it's an easy, delicious & nutritious breakfast that the whole family will love.<br />Don't mistake it for the apples & cinnamon though - we tried that one once and had to throw the rest of the box away.

review/text: A friend brought some of these over & I LOVE them. Normally with mints I tend to be wary because most mints have no flavor & the mint it way too strong, but these arent like that at all. They are sweet but not overly so, & you can actually taste flavor because the mint isnt beyond strong. I really like these, would recommend these, & will buy these in the future :).

review/text: Truvia is the only brand of stevia sweeteners I've found that doesn't leave an aftertaste. Yes, Truvia is stevia, but they use only one part of the plant so the sweetening effect is concentrated. Packets are convenient to take with you to meetings, conferences, or on the plane. I've tried everything else: agave is now a no-no due to it mimicking a high glycemic load, coconut nectar is messy and it doesn't taste very sweet. Truvia is a great product - and no artificial chemicals. Plus, the packets are portable - take anywhere. No, it's not sugar, but it's the best all-natural product I've tried and I've tried many.

Well the answer is kinda, sorta.  Truvia has three ingredients:  erythritol, rebiana, and natural flavors.  Rebiana is made from the stevia leaf by soaking it in water.  Although Cargill whitewashes the process as similar to making tea, the truth is revealed in Coca-Cola's patent where it outlines a 40+ step process that includes the use of acetone, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, and isopropanol.

I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.<br /><br />This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! However, you may want to try one of the smaller box sizes before purchasing a larger quantity, just be sure that you like it.

review/summary: Kitty crack!
review/text: I wish I could buy these on subscription like other groceries on Amazon.  I start getting nervous when we get low on this stuff.  The moment I touch the bag, my two cats and two dogs line up in a row and wait in eager anticipation for treat time. When we are out of them they all just wander around the kitchen scowling at me.  By a long shot, this is everybody's favorite treat.  And I love the fact that there's nothing else in these except chicken.  I know this product is designed to be sprinkled on top of food and when we get down to the bottom of the bag we use them for that, but for small dogs and cats, these make a great treat.  A big dog would probably devour the whole bag in a matter of minutes so I wouldn't bother for big dogs unless you wanted to use them as a training treat.  The chunks are small, but for my chihuahuas and cats they are practically a meal.<br /><br />If they seem pricey for the amount you get, remember that dehydration removes the water and without the water meat weighs about 1/4 of what it weighed when fully hydrated.  These aren't cheap by any measure, but they aren't ridiculously expensive either when you consider that one 4oz bag is made from about a pound of meat and unlike most treats they aren't packed with fillers.

review/summary: Two Reviews:  The Salmon and The Chicken Breast
review/text: The salmon toppers are one of my cats favorite packaged treats or meals, wet or dry.  It's healthy, grain-free, and to a large extent, shelf stable.  I'd highly recommend it for finicky eaters.  It works as as a stand alone meal with water or, as it's advertised, a topper to add some good nutrition to other cat foods and improve its flavor while doing so.<br /><br />The Salmon has has always been fresh on my subscription here. I mention this because the chicken breast toppers were not and I notice another review has mentioned the same.  Not only was it thoroughly stale, but there was no expiration date on the package where it normally is. I find both those things happening concurrently suspicious. I'm familiar with this product in Salmon, Chicken, and liver varieties. I've ordered it from another pet supply company for years then noticed the two pack price at Amazon was lower.  It's worth if for the salmon which has always fresh with clear expiration marked for the four times I've received it on subscribe and save, but not for the chicken breast which I canceled after the first month.  It's not the product itself, as much as some company involved in missing or just pawning off -expired pet food- through Amazon.<br /><br />While I think Real Food Toppers make the best freeze-dried Salmon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CL5S">Halo Liv-a-Littles Natural Treats for Dogs and Cats, Freeze-Dried Chicken Breast Protein, 2.2oz</a> is the best brand for Chicken in any case. It's much less sinewy and comes in larger chunks.

When they don't want to eat their food, I crumble some toppers on their food and "presto" all of their food is gone.  I have made the mistake of leaving the Toppers in a place that a smart and resourceful pair can get, only to wake up in the morning to a chewed up empty bag of Toppers!  This treat will bring them out of hiding when I can't find them.  All of that and it's pure and nutritious.  Toppers are freeze dried chicken (or beef, salmon). Nothing else.  No added ingredients.  Try them.  You and your pet won't be disappointed!!!!!!

review/text: My cat and dog both love this salmon treat!  My dog is part shar-pei and needs to eat a special kind of sensitive skin food which he never really liked until we were given a bag of the salmon treats for our cat.  Well, of course she loves it because it's freeze dried salmon but what surprised me was that my dog loved it too!  Being that it is high in fatty-acids like he needs for his skin, we began mixing crushed treats into his food bowl.  He now gets excited for dinner time and eats his entire bowl (before he used to only eat when he was so hungry that he had to).  I love that it's all natural and is only one healthy ingredient: salmon.  The only downside to this product is the smell.  But that comes with anything fish flavored.  But if it makes my dog and cat happy than I am happy!

review/summary: Unacceptable quality--Real Food Toppers Chix Breast Treats
review/text: I have purchased these freeze-dried natural chicken breast treats in the past from a few different suppliers so I know what to expect in terms of product characteristics & quality. I have a dentally-challenged senior cat who is diabetic (in remission), has a hyperthyroid condition & mega colon. He has lost several teeth so it was important that I find a treat for him that he likes that not only is natural, without additives or sugars but also has a soft, tender consistency that is easy for him to chew. These Real Food Toppers freeze-dried chicken breast pieces were the perfect solution & my cat loved them. They even print "soft to chew" right on the packaging. I found this 2-pack listing on Amazon with an outstanding discounted price so I decided my next order would be from Amazon (I also decided to make it an autoship subscription as well so saving even more $). Unfortunately, when the 1st shipment arrived I was quite disappointed to find chicken pieces that were dried up & hard -- maybe 15% of the pieces were soft enough to give my cat. In fact, because when I offer treats to my cat I normally have to break the large chunks into smaller bite-sized pieces, I found the majority of the product in this order to be so hard I could not even break them apart with my hands. If I attempted to cut them up into much smaller pieces with a knife so he could maybe chew those, the product simply disintegrated into crumbs. All 4 pouches in my order were the same unacceptable quality. I also determined that not a single one had a "best by" date on the packaging. Since every other package I'd ever purchased regardless of who the supplier was always had dates on them I figured these pouches must have been very, very old. Because I opened all 4 pouches thinking I'd eventually have to find some acceptable pieces I was unable to return the order. When I receive the 2d shipment if there are no dates on any of the pouches then I'll be returning the order (unopened) otherwise I'll open a pouch & if I find the contents unacceptable I'll return the shipment & cancel the remainder of the autoship subscription.

review/summary: $36 for 21 lbs of bad dog food? You can do a lot better!!!
review/text: Look at the first three ingredients of the following products (the first ingredients on the list are the highest in the makeup of the food):<br /><br />Product A: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal<br />Product B: Chicken,chicken meal,whole grain brown rice<br /><br />Does a product primarily composed of corn and "by-products" sound as healthy for your dog as one whose first two ingredients are chicken and followed up by rice, a quality grain? Do dogs feed themselves on primarily corn in the wild? Of course not.<br /><br />And what if I told you that Product B is sold for $30 per 40lb bag at Costco, while Product A is being sold at $36 for 21lbs worth of inferior food? Which sounds like the better deal to you?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and save yourself some cash while also providing a healthier meal for your loved one. I'm not here to push Costco's Kirkland brand dog food, which is Product B in this comparison and is clearly a better value then Beneful. Blue Buffalo, Taste of the Wild, Canidae,etc are other examples of much higher quality foods that can be had for a lot cheaper. For once you can eat healthy AND save money.

review/summary: Worse dog food on the market!!! Don't buy this stuff!
review/text: My dog was on this food for a while because i like many other people thought the veggies on the bag meant it was healthy but what it really means is their is no substance just corn and wheat gluten and dyes to color the food to make it look like vegetables. Please take it from me, my dog was chewing holes in his skin because of this food,i spent $700 at the vet for anti-histimine shots and creams and visits only to find out from my groomer that it was the food i was giving her. She was allergic to the dyes in it. I started giving her California naturals and she looked like she gained 3 years of her life back. Shiny coat, healthy glassy eyes, good energy and happier than she had been in a while. She is 14 now and i will never buy her anything but wonderful food like Nutro, California naturals, Merritt.

review/summary: Do not feed your dogs beneful
review/text: For everyone on here that says your dogs love it, there is reason they do. It contains sugar and sorbitol (another sweetener). I like Kruspy Kreme donuts...but I wouldn't eat them everyday. If I did, I'd turn out like my dogs who ate beneful....riddled with diabetes and other health problems. Try to imagine the pain of seeing your dogs go blind and eventully have their lives shortened. After finding out (too late) what was in beneful, I have no doubt that it was behind their health problems. I have yet to come across a single other dog food, even other poor quality ones, that have sugar. You are playing russian roulette with your dog's life if you feed them beneful. Trust me.

review/summary: Our dogs have eaten this for years
review/text: When one of our dogs was diagnosed with Cushings, Which caused significant weight gain, we tried to find a dog food that would meet her needs as well as that of our much older tiny chihuahua. This is the one they chose as the best of the batch.<br /><br />For several years, both our 4 pound and 12 pound chihuahuas used this as their regular food, both were very happy with it. Eventually, we lost our older dog, and now the younger one is an old lady. We have switched from the weight control to regular, particularly since she has recently lost 30% of her body weight.<br /><br />In the meantime, we have added a younger chihuahua to the mix, and she enjoyed both the weight control and the regular.<br /><br />While some of the ingredients (like beef tallow and chicken by products) sound gross to me, I have to remember I am not a dog, and living in a rural area, I have seen what they think is appetizing. I use cornmeal in many of my own recipes, including tortillas, corn muffins, breaded chicken, and cornbread.<br /><br />Both have remained healthy and required very little dental work.

review/summary: Horrible Dog Food
review/text: We believe it's no coincidence after eating this food for a few months that 2 of my dogs started losing their hair and one died of having (0) blood pressure that was only 6 months old. They were ALWAYS so hungry, beyond normal. We got rid of it, gave it away. One dog eventually grew her hair back, the other one didn't. When you see the beneful food stacked up in Wal-marts you can appreciate what a mass productive product this is.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/03/2012: Finally after a few years one of our min pins started growing her hair back at (11) years of age after losing it a few years ago from this food. We fed her ORIJEN brand (6 fish) from Canada for a while then switched to something called Orgainix from PetCo (Made in USA) which is like $35 a bag, about the same price as the #1 rated ORIJEN. We now have 4 min pins with shiny coats that are healthy and playful.<br /><br />dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/beneful-dog-food-dry/ also rates this as one star<br /><br />Ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, water, animal digest, sorbic acid (a preservative), potassium chloride, dried carrots, dried peas, calcium propionate (a preservative), L-Lysine monohydrochloride, choline chloride, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 2), DL-Methionine, Vitamin E supplement, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, Vitamin A supplement, calcium carbonate, copper sulfate, Vitamin B-12 supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin D-3 supplement, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.<br />Fiber (estimated dry matter content) = 4.7%<br /><br />The first ingredient in this dog food is corn. Corn is an inexpensive and controversial cereal grain of only modest nutritional value to a dog.<br />For this reason, we do not consider corn a preferred component in any dog food.<br />The second item is chicken by-product meal... a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste. It's made from what's left of a slaughtered chicken after all the prime cuts have been removed.<br />In a nutshell, chicken by-products are those unsavory leftovers usually considered "unfit for human consumption".<br />In addition to organs (the nourishing part), this stuff can contain almost anything... feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs... anything (that is) except skeletal muscle (real meat).

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/summary: This is a life saver!
review/text: I just got a new puppy about 2 weeks ago. The breeder used to mix canned dog food with hard dog food. When I got my dog home I wanted to get him off the canned dog food, this was not as easy as I thought it was going to be. He just didn't want to eat and was losing weight and seemed very tired. The breeder had gone away to Europe for 2 weeks so calling her wasn't an option, after exhaustive research I found this canned dog food. It is very healthy; they put nothing but real chicken and ingredients into the food. The price may be a bit higher than most canned dog food, but my dog's health is the only thing that matters. I add one Tsp and a little water mix it around to get the taste on the dry food and he devours this stuff. I was so grateful I found something healthy that he loves. I am using Fromm puppy dog food plus this and a bit of water it works really well. I would highly recommend both of these if you have a small breed dog. I hope others find this review useful!

review/text: We started to mix Blue Buffalo Chicken Dinner with our puppies kibble.  I noticed a can was full of water when I opened it.  I called Blue Buffalo customer service and she told me that there should not be any water in the can.  She told me to bring it back to the store where I purchased it and was not interested in a lot number to see if there was a problem in manufacture.  I shook the other cans that I has and some of them you could hear the liquid in them and the can were swelling.  I just threw them out and will not purchase another Blue Buffalo product since the company was not interested in a problem. If I had given the food to my dog I am afraid that the chicken dinner would have made him sick.  The cans use by date were 1/5/2015.

review/summary: Not for My Pup
review/text: We gave our dog Wellness puppy food, and she didn't really like it. Then we switched to this, and at first our dog ate it. Good, we'll stay on this. Then my dog didn't want to eat anymore, and we had to feed her with a SPOON. Ridiculous, right? Well, we just thought she was lazy. We switched her to Fresh Pet, she devoured it, BY HERSELF, every single time. Now our 1 year old chihuahua is on a raw diet, and she couldn't be happier. Avoid if you have a pick eater. 3 stars just because it is actually one of the HEALTHY food on the market.

review/summary: Switched to this food because it has NO BYPRODUCTS
review/text: I didn't realize Byproducts were actually pieces of anything off the floor,including chicken feet and beaks. I have a 4lb Chihuahua, and a now 9lb Chihuahua mix,who was 5 lbs when I got him from a rescue 2 years ago. They really like this food,though my Vet said it's high in fat. I think she was implying that's why the one dog weighs so much now, but he was skinny when I got him lol. Of course it's about 3x more than the food I used to buy at the grocery store, but if I have to pay more to feed my dogs better, in the hopes that they live as long as they can, I'm willing to do that. This food also comes in lamb flavor and a small breed formula. My dogs liked the Lamb,and then I switched them to the Toy breed,thinking it may be less fattening. When this current case of Toy Breed is gone, I'm switching back to lamb.

review/summary: Don't Buy Waste of Money
review/text: I should have listened to the reviews I read on other sites when they said it tasted like water with weak chocolate flavoring.<br />Don't let anyone fool you. It tasted like a spoonfull of chocolate suryp stirred in hot water. I and my family found it undrinkable after a few sips and poured it down the drain.<br /><br />Very dissapointed in the Milka Corporation (who makes wonderful chocolate bars) to allow such a crappy product to bear their brand name.

review/summary: Whoever recommended this should be ashamed.
review/text: After trying this for myself, I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, the Jacobs Latte Macchiato isn't bad if you add sugar. This morning though, I drank it after I tried the Voluptuoso and my mouth has a metallic taste to it. Not sure which one is responsible. Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there. For the 2nd decent beverage, you can take the Kenco Crema with some Coffee Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount) creamers, with enough sugar, and have a nice smooth cappaccino. I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee, as well as, having your mouth taste like you just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the coffees I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema and Jacob's Macchiato. After finding one inferior brew after another, I've given up looking for a good cup of black coffee and/or cappaccino, for the Tassimo. Don't do what I did, which was believe all the positive reviews and downplay the critical reviews. My curiousity has been appeased after spending $34 in Tassimo beverages. Thankfully, 2 packages were free. Now I can either spend more money in S&H to return them, or drink all 56 cigarettes...coffee I mean. Oh by the way, for a tasty hot chocolate beverage, try Celestial Seasonings "Tuscanny" 1 bag made strong, followed by 2 pkgs Carnation Instant Hot Chocolate, with mini marshmellows, and hot water in a tall to-go insulated mug. Amazon sells both, but you can get the chocolate mix on sale for about $1.50 in a grocer.

review/summary: Cats weren't thrilled at first
review/text: My cats weren't real thrilled with the "new" canned cat food. But I believe over time they will learn to like it better, since it does have real ingredients that cats truly need, and not all the fillers and junky stuff that is sold in the supermarkets. I believe they will be even healthier in the long run, eating this cat food.

review/summary: Great in cake mixes or peach smoothies!
review/text: If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />This flavor is good for baking low calorie muffins or cakes. You can buy a Pillsbury no sugar or reduced sugar yellow cake mix to add this flavoring to.  We also blend 8 ounces of skim milk, 4 or 5 slices of frozen peaches (From your grocer's frozen food department), a tablespoon of Splenda, a vanilla protein diet mix, two tablespoons of instant vanilla pudding, 6 ounces of crushed ice, a tablespoon of Da Vinci peach syrup for a great tasting peach smoothie. (Blend well)<br /><br />It jazzes up the flavor without adding calories or a lot of salt. It only contains 5 mg of salt. I have attached a photo of the label for your review. You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!
