review/text: My daughter loves the A1 Steak Sauce flavor of this particular Jack Link's beef jerky.  With Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, I can make sure that she receives a care package of her favorite beef jerky at school every month.  I get a reminder that it will ship, the shipping is free and I get a discount to boot!  I can't beat it, especially since this flavor can be difficult to find in stores.

review/summary: If you like Jerky this is the best deal I could find
review/text: I know its not the healthiest snack, but there's nothing as satisfying as a nice quality piece of jerky.  It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.<br /><br />I have order this double package in both Original and Teriyaki, and is the best price I have found when you figure it down to a per oz price.  It's even cheaper if you add it as a "subscription" to be shipped every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months...which you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />One other use I have for this is an extra special treat for my dog.<br /><br />Anyway, this is always high quality jerky.  Only negative is these large backs end up with a bunch of small crumbled shavings in the bottom--guess what then gets poured onto a plate for my dog!!!

review/summary: Over priced but good flavor
review/text: I would like to see this a few bucks less then it seems like it would be more inline with the value.  At least I can save some money and buy it on the internet  instead of at the store. This is also the best flavor based on the other ones I have tried.  in their line-up. I have tried several of them, and this is the best. As long as I can keep getting this flavor, I will keep sticking choices. This is the best beef Jerky I have ever had. I have been eatting it for years now, and another positive is that it is made in Wisconsin. My only wish is that you could buy this stuff in better quanitity discounts. The small bags are nice for day trips, but it would nice to be able to buy in larger bags for additional discounts.

review/text: Pepper adds a nice kick to beef jerky, and Jack Link makes a nice line of beef jerky. Some of the slices are a bit thin and tough, so personally I like the peppered jerky that is sold at Aldi's grocery stores, but if you don't have an Aldi's in your area, Jack Link's makes a good product, with a nice jerky/peppery taste. Yum.

review/summary: Wish They Were in China
review/text: I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same. Fortunately my mother-in-law and wife gift me with Jack Link's beef jerky on a regular basis. Jack Link's uses premium cuts of meat that are seasoned and smoked in a way that you will find to be delicious. Once you open the bag, be sure to put it in the fridge unless you want your beef jerky to grow some white fuzz. An opened bag of beef jerky that is refrigerated can last for months. I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes.

My only wish is that you could buy this stuff in bigger bags. The small bags are nice for snacking, but it would nice to be able to buy it in 2 - 3 lb bags for taking camping or on deployments.

review/text: The wonderful flavor of Jalapeno's in this zip locked bag fills the air once it is opened. I originally purchased this package of Jack Link for snacking but found myself munching until the entire bag is empty. I first across them on store shelfs in Toledo, Ohio and have not been able to find them in any stores in the Fort Worth,Texas area (until my only other source amazon.com). I love the flavor of the Jalapeno and it is spiced just right. Jack Link is great but Carne Seca is one of the best.

Some of them are pretty good (especially Golden Valley products) but overall none are better than Jack Links. Reliably you get tender, tasty and fresh jerky. I like their original flavor the best. It's not too salty, too sweet, or too hard. It's 'just right' in my opinion.

If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.

review/summary: Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH
review/text: I'm normally rather "meh" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g. slim jims and their ilk), but Jack Links are always good, and the sweet and hot variety, for whatever reason, is AMAZING.  So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of.

Since the economy went down the tubes, I think Entenmann's has lowered the price at the supermarket since every place I've bought these at recently they've been priced at $2 a box, for 8 bars per box. I think I have also bought them at Walmart for that price too.

Dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life (I believe they are good for up to 2 years).  A one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh.  They need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using.  The water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor.  It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor.  Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned.<br /><br />The Porcinis have a more bold earthy taste.  They go very well in soup, stews and pasta sauce (be sure to add the hydrating water to the pasta sauce, yummy!).<br /><br />The FungusAmongUs is a high quality brand that I highly recommend.

review/summary: Mostly Stems
review/text: I ordered these last week and when they arrived I took a quick look at them and they seemed fine. This morning I opened one package as I was planning on making a nice mushroom sauce for my pasta later. I set them to soak and when they re-hydrated the first thing I noticed was that this particular package is mostly stems with very few caps in it. While all dried mushrooms include stems I was surprised to see more tough stems than caps, usually the mix of stems to caps is about equal, not so with this package. The flavor and aroma of them after reconstituting was fine. Guess I'll keep looking for a better quality dried mushroom.

review/text: I used this brand of mushrooms to make a delicious and "meaty" mushroom bourguignon. These porcinis added a very rich and complex taste to the dish and the soaking liquid is a great mushroom broth. The texture of the reconstituted mushroom is good. I originally bought these at the supermarket but this price on Amazon is about 30% cheaper. Great deal, good product.

review/summary: Very bland flavor, weak soaking liquid
review/text: Sorry that I purchased such a large quantity that I now have to use up, will never buy again. The quality and variety of the pieces are not bad but they are rather flavorless. They seem like they may have been pre-washed as they look cleaner, less rustic, with practically no grit, and this may have washed away a lot of the natural goodness. Much prefer naturbosco Funghi Porcini Secchi which are much more robust and yield a deeper soaking liquid. Even dry just the difference in color tells you not to expect too much.  If you're looking for "subtle" for a recipe these may work for you but if you're looking for the real deal this isn't it.

review/text: Have you ever dehydrated mushrooms? I have, and wow, they pack a punch of flavor when dried.<br /><br />I tried one of the dried porcini as is, and it tasted a bit like chocolate, it was so rich. Please try drying your own (on a paper towel will work, in a dry climate), and taste them in stages. If you can't, try FungusAmongUs brand 'shrooms--they are really good! I would put these in a trail mix or snack pack, as they are, dried.<br /><br />Organic is becoming more important as GMO infiltrates all our edibles, so please, support organic providers like FungusAmongUs!

I would have rather you kept your integrity and raised your prices then do this. It pains me, but I will no longer buy your products.

review/text: If you close your eyes and try really hard, you *might* be able to pick up a feint hint of candy corn flavor in these Oreos. Otherwise, they just taste like overly sweet frosting and cheap cookies. (And let's face it, that's what Oreos basically are.) Despite all the Internet hype, these were a huge let-down. I hope the good people at Nabisco decide not to give these a repeat appearance next fall.<br /><br />It should go without saying, but don't pay the absurd prices resellers are charging for this these. Heck, don't even waste your money if you see at them at Target (the exclusive distributor of this product)... it's just not worth it.

review/summary: You will need rice!
review/text: I picked this up the other day out of sheer curiosity. I needed something to bring to work to spice up my normal meal time. After all, Hot Pockets & Healthy Choice does get kind of old after a while.<br /><br />While this was a tasty meal, it just didn't really appeal to me that much. The food is a little on the spicy side for me, about medium spicy. (I usually go for the mild stuff.) The box recommends serving this with rice or something to that extent & I really wish that I'd purchased some instant rice to serve with it. It would have made for a better meal- while this was tasty enough, it got to be a little overwhelming after a while.<br /><br />The biggest flaw of the meal isn't the spiciness or lack of rice-ness, but that parts of the meal just made me feel like I was eating something put out by Chef-Boyardee or Taco Bell. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but just disappointing.<br /><br />I probably will try some of the other stuff put out by Dona Maria, but I don't think that this will become a staple in my diet anytime soon.

review/summary: Nice strong ginger flavor
review/text: Prince of Peace Ginger Honey Crystals<br /><br />Unfortunately I got these on the last day of a local tea shop -- and I say unfortunately because I became instantly enamored of the product.  A single packet produces a decidedly strong 10-12 oz cup, very nice and gingery, reminiscent of the hot ginger tea sometimes served on cold winter days at a Haitian restaurant I know.  The honey adds a nice complexity to the cup, but I'm also looking forward to adding a few cloves and cinnamon stick.  Many other uses for the crystals come to mind as well as simply dissolving in water -- I've been using it to sugar tea, both black and green, and I'll definitely try another reviewer's recommendation for strawberries or other fruit.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish the packet had somewhat less sugar (but with the same ginger and honey strength).  One packet, at 17 g, is getting a bit close to typical desert levels (I checked some sorbet in my frig, 23 g).<br /><br />That aside, I prefer this to the ginger tea I've been getting at a local Korean market, a kind of marmalade or jelly with ginger slices in a jar.  Not only does this product have a stronger, hotter ginger flavor, but it can be used in place of granulated sugar.

When I go on a cruise, I bring one dose a day and I do not need to get the behind the ear tabs that I had used before.<br /><br />Before I found this, I would have to go get the ginger root, peel, slice, and steep to get a good tea for my stomachache, but this is tons more convenient.  Besides, who wants to do all that work when you are sick.<br /><br />The flavor is very strong so I found that I like it a little more watered down than it recommends but 1 or 2 "doses" when I am feeling queasy and it is gone.

review/summary: Good but too much sugar
review/text: The first time I drank this tea I almost gagged. I'd prepared it according to the directions but it was too spicy. I then had the good sense to add more water and a chamomile tea sachet to break down the spicyness...and it was wonderful. I then discovered that eating the ginger crystals by themselves was quite pleasant as well. I know it sounds weird, but the crystals are tasty, probably because they're so sweet...which leads me to my next point. Although sugar TASTES good, im not a fan of consuming too much of it. It's 17 grams per packet, which I think is too high for a cup of tea. It makes my teeth feel all gritty afterwards (no bueno). If they made a sugar free version I'd be sold :)

review/text: If you're into hot, spicy gingery tastes, you'll like this drink. It's intense, also because of the honey. I find it delicious, and I know some people who dilute it (using half a package per cup) to make it milder. Either way, it's yummy and satisfying. Very soothing on a winter day, and also if you have a cold or are suffering from nausea or stomach upset. It's also versatile. I dissolve a package into plain oatmeal--what an easy way to add unique flavor. I like that it's instant, and also that I can take along the sachets to work or on a trip. Highly recommend this!

I love the flavor and I don't get acid kick-back anymore.  I drink the honey ginger tea hot for a sore throat. It is wonderful in apple juice or other fruit juices as it give a punch to the drink.<br /><br />I also make a drink from green veggies and some fruit. This ginger honey really livens it up and makes it delicious. When I make shortbread cookies, I sprinkle this ginger on top before baking. I won an award for the cookies at a Scottish festival.

It doesn't last long around here.<br /><br />It is great to sip on the front porch with neighbors and can be served hot in the winter and iced in the hot summers.

review/summary: I was looking for Jamaican Ginger Beer
review/text: I found lots of spicy ginger beers at Amazon, but the best price in the lot was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB04N8">D & G, Soda Ginger Beer, 12-once (24 Pack)</a>; while $30 [$45 shipped] for 24 hard-to-find sodas isn't the worst pricing in the world,  it's still not going to be in my budget as an everyday beverage. This stuff is plenty affordable in the 30-count bag, and the flavor is exactly the spicy & sweet combination I remember from my youth in the South.<br /><br />It just arrived today, so I've not had the chance to try it with club soda in place of water, but I expect adding some fizziness will make this drink perfect! Look for an update to this review.<br />UPDATE: almost finished  with bag one, ordering more. Mixing the bag with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBRS12">Blue Sky Natural True Seltzer,  12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> does make a nice refreshing drink (I mix in a little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WX5J9I">Tang Orange Powdered Drink Mix (Makes 22 Quarts), 72-Ounce Canister</a> for a citrus-ginger soda), but it's not as close to the Jamaican Ginger beer that I remember as I'd hoped.<br /><br />However, if I add it to store-brand ginger ale, it IS the flavor clone I'd been looking for! Five stars!<br /><br />Further update: There are many recipes foe home-made ginger ale on the web, and the process looks very simple...I'll keep a stock of these packets anyway, but I think I'll try fashioning my own brew this weekend!

Luckily, this product was very reasonably priced so I won't feel too bad about tossing the remaining bags if I can't find someone to give them to.<br /><br />I can't fault the seller here. The product was reasonably priced and arrived on time. I would purchase another item from them, but not this one.<br /><br />Just my two cents.

review/summary: Love it. Plain and simple.
review/text: It's great stuff. Really simple to use, and really good tasting -- I only sweeten it with a spoonful of honey or two as far as additives go. I used it all throughout my pregnancy as an all natural solution to my all day sickness. Sometimes it was all I could keep down.<br />I've recommend it to a LOT of my friends, pregnant and not, who are tea drinkers like myself, and I continue to thank the person who introduced it to me. It's good and soothing, not too harsh, like other ginger products I've tried, and it's good at any time; hot or cold. Hell, at the first sign of a cold, I start guzzling it down like nobody's business , an more often than not, it keeps my cold (especially sore throats) from getting any worse. It's something I'll swear by for life, I'm sure.

review/text: This product was amazing during my pregnancy.  I packed it everywhere to aid in my nausea.  It worked beautifully. I haven't used it much since, unless I have an upset stomach, because I'm not a huge ginger fan.  But hey ... if you're suffering from morning sickness or suffer from nausea, this may work perfectly for you as well.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: As Ginger is good to settle a stomach and, when I eat a Larabar Ginger Snap or a few Ginger cookies, it seems to satisfy my hunger, I had great expectations! I tried this cold and hot. I got a BLAST of Ginger heat in the back of my throat (expected) but no residual Ginger after taste,just an odd taste from the sugar (we use very little sugar so maybe just me). I had hoped to satisfy hunger but it doesnt seem to do that at all & seemed to MAYBE upset my stomach a little. Packaging quality & content uniformity is very good & dissolved quickly. I will be throwing the rest away partly because it is made in China and I am nervous about food items from there.

review/summary: Too much sugar
review/text: I have been making ginger tea by grating fresh ginger, mixing it with honey and lemon and adding boiling water. The qualities and effects of ginger on the body are quite remarkable. My husband and I have been battling the flu for 10 days, and the ginger tea really helps. It was getting tiring doing that by hand, so I found this product and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts:<br />Pros:<br />It's quite tasty, although very sugary. For me, as I love the taste of ginger drinks (ginger beer, ginger ale) I like the combination of ginger with sweetness, although I would prefer it to be artificial sweetener. I found that I need more than 6 to 8 ounces of water due to the concentration in each of the packets.<br />It's very nice that each packet is individually sealed, which keeps it fresh for quite a while.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's very high in sugar. It's a peppery, sugary drink. I believe it will supply you with the necessary amounts of ginger to affect your health in a positive way. Here's the but though, because it's high in sugar, it's something that someone like I, who have higher than normal cholesterol would not want to consume too much off.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I liked the taste, but would prefer less sugar, or artificial sweetener. Perhaps sweetened with honey?

review/summary: Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets
review/text: A nice healthy cup a...ginger crystals?...Yep! This stuff is great! I found this when I came across it somewhere on clearance once and althoug it's very strong (I only use 1/2 packet per cup); depending on how strong you like ginger, you might use more :)  For winter or fall this is a wonderful thing to have around.  Remember how I said it's strong, well, I get 2 cups per packet (I like my tea very strong, but I like this the way I described). The value here-wow, you just can't go wrong.  And no, I am not getting any compensation here for saying all this, I just found a product I like and it's hard to find for such a great price. I can't do dairy either or much coffee, so haviing things like this just make life a little more fun.  Plus, it's so much better for you and chepaer than a drive-through drink :)

review/summary: Not for super sensitive stomach
review/text: I was so looking forward to enjoy this tea and was imagining how wonderful it would be to have a cup of hot sweet ginger tea in the coming winter....unfortunately my stomach was not up to the `task'.  I have a sensitive stomach and get heartburn and acid reflux if I drink coffee or most of the over-the-counter orange juice.  I thought it's safe to drink this ginger tea but I ended up having mild heartburn every time after I drank the tea (even use just half bag of the powder).  And the same condition occurred after all three attempts, so I had to give up...  I did find out that I am ok with drinking the home-made ginger tea (three slices of ginger in boiling water and some sugar).  I would still recommend this to people with no stomach problems!!

review/summary: Strong, but good
review/text: I ordered this product after a friend of my mother's told her about it. My mother's friend uses it because she gets nauseous on a regular basis and ginger, which this product has in spades, helps a lot.<br /><br />I have a brain tumor which causes me to experience vertigo, dizziness, and nausea - all on a fairly regular basis. I have medication, ONDANSETRON HCL 8MB to be exact, which works, but gives me an incredible headache as a side effect of making my nausea go away. As a result, I need to take Aspirin at the very least, with the medication to offset the side effect. NOT a pleasant experience to say the least.<br /><br />I've had ginger before as part of juicing, which I do from time to time after watching the movie FAT, SICK, AND NEARLY DEAD (available via Amazon Prime streaming video and Hulu). However, I don't have the energy to make juice as often as I would like.<br /><br />This tea allows me to get some ginger into my system much easier. The ginger doesn't have the side effects that the aforementioned medication does, so it's my first choice. This tea is WAY too strong as is though. Instead of using a whole packet in a large cup of water, I use a teaspoon, and go from there if I need more ginger to relax my stomach. At least this means that the tea will last much longer.<br /><br />If you have chronic nausea for whatever reason, I'd give this stuff a try, just beware of the strength and be prepared to adjust the amount you use, unless you want your throat to burn from the high concentration of ginger.

review/text: This tea is awesome! Authentic Ginger flavor. Certainly clears the sinuses.  If you like the stimulating, fresh flavor and aroma of Ginger, then this tea will please you.  Additionally, I don't have to add any sugar or other sweetener. Also, there are no tea bags to deal with as the crystals dissolve rapidly for the perfect cup.  I like it cold too.  I also add less water than recommended for an even more robust flavor.  I like it strong!

review/text: I bought this for the benefits of ginger and honey, and based on the high reviews. I enjoy hot teas and drinks in general. When I first tried this drink it was a little too spicey for me. I tried cutting it in half and that worked ok. The best solution for me is to add in a little cream or vanilla soy milk. It makes it creamy and just a little spicy like a chai tea. VERY enjoyable and soothing when not feeling well. It's also come in handy for morning sickness recently.

review/summary: I love Ginger any way I can get it.
review/text: One day my mother in law sent me over some of these packets.  I was hooked with the first Packet.  I have a hard time with hot things.  The rest of my family could not tell the burn it gives.  They even like to just pour them into their mouths and let them dissolve.  The more of It I drank I finally got to where I can drink the whole packet now.  My doctor has taken me away from cream so my morning coffee was just horrible.  I now put one packet of this in my cup then put in a K-cup of my favorite coffee and wow what a wonderful spicy wake me up.<br /><br />I am a diabetic, and someone who does not like to eat.  So getting that little boost of sugar and honey first thing in the morning gives me time to get my breakfast ready.  I have low sugar and my doc is trying to get me to eat at least 1000 kilo/calories to 1400 kilo/calories.  Which is hard to do when you mainly eat raw vegetables and fruits. So for me.  This is a fast way to get my blood sugar up and stay up long enough for me to get some food in me.<br /><br />I know one person complained about the calories.  It does have 18 carbs per packet.  But the Ginger is good and very strong which works very well for settling my stomach. I used to have to take phenergan for nausea now a cup of this and I am good.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this as much as we do.<br />Atheena
