review/summary: gourmet rich!
review/text: Although I didn't buy this cookie mix on Amazon, I needed to write a review and tell the world of cyberspace how outstanding the cookies are! The recipe couldn't be easier, and uses the common ploy of having the baker add eggs and butter that could have been included in the mix so they'll feel they're actually doing something. I tried to underbake them just slightly and they came out moist, rich, and flavorful, tasting and feeling like a high-end boutique bakery product. I stored them in a closed container and they still were moist 24 hours later, which is a real plus. Duncan Hines long has made good products that aren't unrealistically expensive; this is one to keep on your shelves in case of sudden guests or an unexpected potluck or other invitation.

review/text: This is a very deceptive advertisement.  They claim it to be Post raisin bran and even show a picture of a box with a Post label on it.  The truth is that what you get has nothing to do with Post.  It is simply Kirkland raisin bran.  Post is nowhere to be seen on the box.  Just a heads-up, because if you're like me, you bought it thinking it was Post brand.

review/text: Hey all-<br />This is probably the best espresso to come out of a Tassimo. That being said- NO T-Disk is worth more than 60 cents a pop, so this is overpriced. When you review an item and give it 1 star, you are rating the product as bad and it gives the wrong impression when you are simply upset about being ripped off. I agree with you though, this is currently outrageously overpriced considering I was getting three packs for something like 50 cents per serving.

review/text: Our 3 dogs love Dingo bones.  But these peanut butter flavor bones are an obsession of our smallest rat terrier.  He's only 5 pounds, so bones tend to last several sittings for him.  Give him one of these and he's occupied for as long as it takes to finish.  He'll still play with other bones, but he loses his mind when he sees me go for this bag.  I just wish they were priced as well as the other Dingo products and less difficult to find.

My only complaint about this bone is that it left a mess on the floor; the red color of the bone rubs onto the floor.  It did wipe up fairly easily.  Just make sure when you give the bone to your dog he's not eating it on a carpeted floor.

review/text: Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC.  I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red "meat" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Too big for my dog
review/text: I have a labrador retriever. He weighs 82 lbs. He loved the bone, but I made the mistake and allowed him to eat the bone in one sitting. It was too much of a shock to his digestive system.  The next morning he developed diarrhea. I' m not sure if the bone is the reason the diarrhea lasted so long, but to be causious I will not buy the bones again.  To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting.  I believe the product would be best for larger dog's than mine, or for smaller dog if the owner regulator the amount of the bone that is eaten at each sitting .

This is a tasty Teriyaki sauce with hints of cherry (DUH!!!) and garlic. Use it as a marinade, glaze or dipping sauce. I have used it for stir frys and ribs, pork, chicken and beef (both burgers and steaks) cooked on the grill, as well as for hams baked in the oven. It is delicious no matter how it is used. Your imagination is your only limit. I will be trying it on some shish-kebobs soon. I haven't tried it on any kind of seafood because of some seafood allergies.

review/summary: Reversed my baby's pancreatitis
review/text: After our Yorkiepoo had to be hospitalized because of pancreatitis I did some research on food. I thought I was giving him the best with Newman's Own. I was so wrong. He has been on the Verve for over two years and no longer has symptoms of pancreatitis. The garbage that the vets wanted us to feed him was awful looking and smelling and in cans which are terrible altogether. The Verve is so wonderful...it smells great and he loves it. We love to add fun things into it for him. We always add boiled chicken breast, but also add apples and some low calorie treats sometimes. The first few times he had Verve, his poop was dark and horrible smelling. After this detox stage, he has healthy-looking and smelling poop multiple times a day. We would do anything for our angel...he is a huge part of our family. With the Honest Kitchen, we are able to take great care of his health without having to prepare his food from scratch.

Our rottweiler Jammy is a slow eater for kibble - but she eats HK food so quickly you can just see her enjoyment.<br /><br />When feeding these dehydrated foods, I do still give raw bones a few times weekly to help with teeth cleaning, I can't imagine the gruel-type texture being good for their teeth.  Outside of the texture and the need to either supplement or brush, this is a well balanced food with great macros that my dogs absolutely love.

review/summary: Great value, great for your health
review/text: I'm not naturally drawn to any tea, but for health reasons I've been trying to pick it up for years, mostly trying green teas. I never could make a habit of it until I found a small box of this locally. In the past 5 months, I've averaged 4 cups a day and have officially developed a healthy habit. I'm still not in love with the taste, though I find white tea easier to stomach than some green teas that were grassier, but I do enjoy the experience of drinking white tea and I enjoy its effects. Rather than a caffeine buzz, teas have a balance of caffeine and l-theanine that provide mental clarity and aids focus, and the balance in white tea is just right for me.<br /><br />POP white tea brews darker than a more costly white tea I was given, and I do suspect that darker color means lower quality, but the price is right. The bags also brew more cups than an equivalent bag of black tea, furthering the value. I have no trouble getting 6 large cups of tea from a single bag, and arguably, the second cup is better than the first. I'm on my second box of 100 from Amazon, and having recently discovered this listing that offers subscribe and save, I'm likely to buy much more in the future.  Previously this was an $.08 per day, $.02 per cup habit, but now it could be a $.05 per day, $.01 per cup habit.  How many healthy habits are this affordable?

review/text: Our American bulldog has had terrible digestion issues for months.  After vet visits, meds, about a million different kibbles (including prescription food), finally we have found something he can eat.  Until now the only thing that hasn't caused vomiting and diarrhea was a bland food diet that I cooked myself.  This food is working wonderfully for us and is very reasonably priced compared to many premium brands.  So happy to finally have found something!!<br /><br />ETA: december 17, 2010  We have now had our three dogs (boxer, two american bulldogs) on this food since this initial review.  They have very soft coats and look terrific, also they have great energy.  I do have to say though, they poop MUCH more than they have on other 'premium' foods.  It really is horrid.  My sensitive dog does well on this so we will continue feeding, but if it wasn't for that we probably would try something else.

I bought a small bag of the Bison formula and within 2 weeks the yeasty paws have decreased eyes are brighter and her coat looks great. The Venison formula is easier to get locally so I am excited to try it next

review/summary: Excellent food for dogs with allergies
review/text: I had the good fortune of having a co-worker recommend this food to me.  I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback mix who has allergies which cause him to be forever itchy and compulsively lick and chew his feet. It seems a little expensive, but it's a very dense food, one scoop of it is quite a bit heavier than the same scoop of less expensive brands.  This 28lb bag lasts a month, for three dogs, 75, 45 and 12 lbs...really not bad at all, and well worth it for the allergy relief, beautiful coats, and less doggie smell. Amazon has the best price anywhere, I have Prime, so it's shipped quickly and delivered to my door - just can't beat it.

review/summary: The best dog food I've found!
review/text: We have a 90 lb lab mix and a 40 lb lab mix.  Both with there own set of issues.  When we adopted the larger dog and during the first year we had him he was on anbibiotics 5 times due to skin infections, not to mention he had soft stool.  We kept changing his food, Hills Science Diet, Hills special allergy formula, and finally ended up with Eagle Pack.  On Eagle Pack his skin cleared right up, but he still had the soft stool.  Then our other dog started having bladder infections.  The vet said the food we were feeding her could be too high in protein for her.  Here we go again, this time our vet recommended Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Bison or Fish.  We have been alternating the two ever since and ALL of our doggie health problems went away!  Plus their skin looks GREAT!!  This stuff is expensive, but you get what you pay for, and for us, its worth every penny!

review/text: This is some of the best dog food I've ever given any dog. Before I started giving it to my current dog, she was suffering many allergies. I switched over to the limited ingredient diet by Natural Balance and my dog has been extremely healthy since. I'm not sure if it was her previous food that caused the allergies, but the new food seems to have relieved her suffering. Her ears are also cleaner now that she is on this food.<br /><br />Natural Balance offers other flavors of Limited Ingredient Diet, so it is extremely easy to switch over the flavor for my dog.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on getting this shipped in a pinch. I'm extremely pleased Amazon and Natural Balance

review/summary: this one's juuust right
review/text: We have a 3 yr old beagle with a sensitive stomach. She also puts on weight very quickly and any food that she is on has to be low fat. Even though we feed all of our animals organic/no filler pet foods, she was still vomiting several times a week. We tried several different high end brands, but she was still vomiting at least once a week. The last food we tried was Eukanuba which is uber expensive, she vomited on it once a week, AND gained 3 lbs (who knew it had more fat than puppy food!) So we are very glad to have found Natural Balance. In the last two months, she's only vomited once. Also, she now makes huge soft brown poops (always an indication of a healthy pup).

review/summary: Simply the best!
review/text: As soon as we adopted our black labrador retriever, we switched him away from the cheap-o dog food the breeder was using to another natural dog food brand. His stools were unpredictable, he wouldn't finish the cup or so of food in his bowl at each meal... and then we acquired some sample bags of Natural Balance. WOW, is all I can say. Our dog LOST HIS MIND after trying it. Refused to eat what we were giving him before. He had the good stuff and wouldn't turn back. We switched him over to Natural Balance completely and he's such a healthy, strong, muscular, happy pup! We get so many compliments from other people at the dog park about his shiny coat, appearance and demeanor and we know it has to be the food. Good, whole foods make my husband and I feel great - so why would it be any different with our dog? Yes, it's more expensive than other brands of dog food, but you get what you pay for. We want our dog to live a long, healthy, happy life. We are Natural Balance customers for life! (The food rolls are excellent, too! Our dog goes crazy for them!)

review/text: I was feeding my Bulldog California Natural, but he had started having skin issues on that. I then learned they had changed the formula slightly when bought by Proctor & Gamble. After reading other reviews, I decided to try this food. He responded amazingly! His fur is not falling out in clumps. He is not licking his paws constantly. He is so much healthier. His stools are also more solid and don't leave a mess, so we don't have to worry about wiping him anymore. This food is great for an allergy prone dog!

review/summary: Healthy, and it Tastes Great for Picky Eaters!
review/text: I have a three month old German Shepherd puppy who is quite the picky eater. He only came into my home recently, and was on a wet food only diet at the breeder because he would flat out refuse to eat the dry kibble food his brothers and sisters had no problem with. It was becoming such a problem to try and get him to eat dry food. If I tried mixing in wet food, he would simply lick the wet food out of the bowl, leaving the kibbles behind. I tried several brands of dry dog food, from the mainstream to the holistic/organic brands, and he just wouldn't eat unless he was really hungry. It got to the point that the poor little guy would either have to be half starved in order to eat, or I would have to literally open his mouth and place kibbles in one by one.<br /><br />Then along came a free sample of this stuff, courtesy of my local pet store after a donation to some fund for homeless animals. I don't remember the name of the fund, because my store always runs these kind of things, and I always donate regardless, so I can't remember which charity gave me this heaven-sent trial bag of the sweet potato and bison formula.<br /><br />From the second I poured this stuff into his food bowl he was jumping all over, trying to get a peek at what's in there, which is something he has never really done before, except for treats. And he ate it all up, with no problems! I tried again at another meal, this time giving him a bowl of his most recent rejected food, Vet's Choice Health Extension holistic food. He didn't even glance at it. I emptied some out, and mixed in a half/half mixture of this new food with the old and he was back to jumping for joy until I put the bowl down!<br /><br />My puppy has no allergies; he isn't on a special diet, and he doesn't have any "special needs." I simply like giving my dog a higher quality holistic and/or organic dog food. The problem was that none of the other brands really tasted all that great to my little guy. However, he LOVES this brand. I have tried other flavors / types of food from Natural Balance, but this sweet potato and bison formula seems to be his favorite! Not only is it good for your puppy or adult dog, but it tastes great too! I highly recommend it.

review/text: We have two dogs, one with a sensitive stomach and another with skin allergies. I had them on another food as well as yogurt and Pepcid AC for the stomach and Zyrtec for the skin - but it was only making a minor difference. Dylan, with the stomach problems, was still vomiting several times a week and Kuma (the skin) was slamming her body against the walls, bed and anything else and dragging herself along to relieve the itching. After switching to this diet we began to notice a big difference. I was also able to stop the yogurt, Pepcid and Zyrtec. Also their fur is much more soft and shiny. To be clear, I haven't noticed Dylan getting sick since we've been well into the diet and Kuma no longer does any unusual itching. The dogs are about 50 lbs each and we go through roughly one large bag a month - not a bad price to pay for healthy, happy dogs!!

Turns  out most stores run out of canned pumpkin every summer and I had to start buying it online, expensive and a hassle. I was introduced to this with free samples and after the first few servings, no more soft bowels, in fact they're normal now.  I figure I'm saving a lot of money each year not needing pumpkin.

review/summary: Best food for dog allergies
review/text: My 1 year old pit bull was having alot of digestion issues (not to mention some serious accidents in the house) while she was on Canidae dry dog food, so after several visits to the vet we determined she was likely allergic to one or more of the ingredients in the Canidae.  The vet said food allergies are common among pit bulls, so she recommended a limited ingredient diet.  I purchased the bison and sweet potato blend, and my dog is loving it.  I've actually never seen her so excited to eat her food.  She is more lively, and her digestion problems have gone away.  Even though this food costs even more than Canidae, I am more than willing to pay the money to see my dog happier and healthier.

review/text: Love the brand, but this particular formula was not good at all for my dog. I assumed the Bison, because it is Bison, that it would be good for my dog. The first thing I noticed, after the first 24 hours, was more itching. Then after about 3 days I noticed his coat was losing it's shine, and it's natural wave. His hind quarters began to shedd hair. His belly, and paws had become red, and irritated. I knew I had to try another Formula, and I did. I went back to the first ever Formula, which initially gave him ridiculous gas. I felt after being on this brand for awhile his system should be now, accustomed to the sweet potato; and yes, we were successful.

review/summary: Formerly My Preferred Dog Food
review/text: Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Bison was formerly the food of choice that I bought for my dogs (along with their Sweet Potato and Venison food).  I have a five-year-old Boxer and this was one of the only foods I could find that completely agreed with him.  He has never had any allergy conditions with Natural Balance and, with the Bison and Venison formulas, his stool has always been solid.  I recently added a German Shepherd puppy to the house and he has had similar results with Natural Balance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Natural Balance recently decided to jack up their prices by over ten dollars a bag and I can no longer justify buying it when I go through almost three bags a month.  Quite simply, charging almost seventy dollars for twenty-eight pounds of dog food is just ridiculous, particularly when you're going through a bag every two weeks.  I barely pay that much for my own groceries every two weeks.<br /><br />As such, I guess it's time to move on to other brands.  The first on my list is Taste of the Wild.  We'll see how that goes.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't support a company that jacks up their prices without increasing their quality.

The result: My cache of ginger chews from amazon never lasts as long as it's supposed so!

review/text: I bought these at Trader Joe's in case I or anyone in my family has a cold. Unfortunately, they were sooooo tasty that I ate up the WHOLE package.  I've got to buy more! :-)<br /><br />Anytime my mom had a cold or other flu-like ailment, she sliced thinly some ginger into boiling water to make a tea which she drank thruout the day and it healed her the next day or days. Ginger stimulates the immune system and also has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Ginger also acts as a cough suppressant.  I also buy ORGANIC RAW honey at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's(and do NOT add it to anything hot like your tea since you'll be deactivating any beneficial enzymes) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ECQ04W">Burt's Bees, Natural Throat Drops, Honey 20-Count (Pack of 6)</a> since honey also helps in the healing of colds.<br /><br />The package says there's at least 8% real ginger in the product.  It's chewy, not too sweet, and sticks to your teeth and is initially very hot on your palate, so you should make sure you should readily have some water nearby.  Excellent product.

review/text: Ginger is a miracle herb in terms of calming a nauseous stomach.  I constantly eat this, and the crystallized ginger....while pricey for a small bag, these ginger chews are an incredible treat.  Keep an eye on how much you ingest-- ginger can spur heartburn for those with GERD or acid reflux.  If you're nauseous or pregnant or have constantly frazzled nerves (as I do), ginger chews and and crystallized ginger are some of the best remedies.

review/text: We feed this food to our almost grown kitten. He loves it.  Since cats are carnivores, this food fits the bill as it is mostly JUST fish, not fillers like corn and grains that really are not good for cats.<br />I really didn't like feeding the cat canned food because it grosses me out.  This food smells just a little fishy but is really not bad at all - compared to some cat foods which smell disgusting.  It's also very convenient and not messy.  You don't need to use a spoon to get it out of the pack.  Just rip it open and squeeze it out.

review/summary: Cats love the food (Hooray!) I hate packaging
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Slop.
review/text: Maybe my cat is spoiled. We've fed her "Soulistic" brand pouches since the day we brought her home. I saw this product when I last shopped for her food. It looked like a real gourmet scene, so lovely was the image of the food on the packaging. Now, I know there's always a disparity between the box image and the actual fare, but this has to be the most glaring, bald-faced LIE in the history of marketing.<br /><br />When I opened the package (which showed a expiration date well into 2012), I felt confused! Almost like I wasn't sure if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me! The entire brown, gelatinous mess slid out like a giant leech into her bowl. After some desperate prep work, mashing things up, I managed to get this glop to a state where it more resembled something that you'd see sliding down the wall in a monkey's cage.<br /><br />My cat took one sniff, and regarded me with a glance that can only be described as a "how dare you", and strutted away. Hungry, but with dignity in tact.<br /><br />I WILL get a refund for this gunk. Mark my words.

review/summary: The cats love the food, I hate the package (cats win!)
review/text: I have four cranky senior cats who never seem to enjoy the same food (picture an older, more crotchety male cast of the golden girls). One likes fish, the other eats it and throws up bright pink everywhere; one was open to trying a raw diet, the others wanted to eat canned food - though usually just the juice or gravy. Anyone who has cats knows that they will starve rather than eat something they don't like - just to prove their point. Because one of my cats is diabetic, I've been trying to keep them on a grain free diet, only, they don't seem to enjoy any of the fancy grain free canned food from the local yuppie pet store.<br /><br />I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef).

review/summary: Finally a food my finicky feline will finish!
review/text: My cat is 15 years old, and has NEVER liked a kitty treat in her life - the only non-dry cat food she would ever eat was REAL tuna fish juice, drained from the can (and never mind the tuna). She has also had what I affectionately call a "tender tummy", meaning that every few weeks, since she was a kitten, she has had vomiting episodes that last a day or so and then disappear again. No explanation. Basically, I've just had to find cat food for her that matches the carpet on the way back up. Ew.<br /><br />About a year ago, she stopped eating all together, and I was worried that she and I had reached the end of her long life. In actuality, she had just decided she no longer liked the IAMS senior she had eaten for 10 years, was going on a hunger strike that put her in the ER Vet with failing kidneys due to dehydration.<br /><br />Enter Wiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna (in the pack of ten, with the sardines and Whitefish/tuna mix). She instantly started eating again, and her health returned in a matter of days. AND, no more random vomiting!! She even deigns to eat dry cat food once a day to supplement the moist stuff - I'm using IAMS young adult (orange bag), and have had no problems there either.<br /><br />She has her preferences with the Wiskas, don't be deceived. She will ONLY eat the purrfectly fish, NOT any other flavor, and really doesn't prefer the sardines (neither do I). The tuna entree with the whitefish is often only halfway eaten, but the tuna entree alone is always finished, which is why I was so happy to see it for sale here by itself.<br /><br />One complaint, though. My kitchen now smells like dead fish. But, to save my carpets, her health, and my sanity, I'll sacrifice a little smell.

review/summary: Whiskas Won
review/text: My cat has developed an increased appetite since I changed her diet from ONLY dry food to moist food.  She is 17 years old and has lost so many teeth that dry food was becoming too difficult for her to eat.  After two years of serving her "wet food" I never made a distinction among the different brands of wet food until recently.  I always buy different brands of wet food, and she seems to enjoy the ones from a packet rather than a can.  However today, with WHISKAS, after devouring a whole packet,  she wanted another one.  Not only that, but she licked the plate entirely clean.  She kept begging for more and I finally gave in to her wishes. I was very surprised when I just went to look at her plate because she consumed an entire second package.  I better check this out with her vet.  She is not overweight, but I don't want to overfeed her.

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: My cats are 10 years old, and have eaten dry food their entire life. I would give them wet pouches once in a great while as a treat. However, about 6 months ago, the female started puking on a daily basis, and let's just say it was not a "normal" type. I tried different brands (they had been eating Cat Chow Indoor Formula), but she is no longer interested in dry food (the male will still eat it). So I started buying Friskies pouches, and they seemed to really like it, but I noticed that little by little, they started leaving more and more food. They would only lick the gravy and leave the food.<br />Finally I tried this Whiskas item, and they seem to really love it, and they eat every bite. I'm glad I finally found something she will eat, because she has visibly lost weight.<br /><br />Oh, and Amazon's price is more expensive than a grocery store, but unlike some other people who misuse these ratings, I am rating the PRODUCT, not Amazon. The 5 star rating is for the cat food alone.<br />I'll go to a message board if I want to discuss Amazon's business practices.

However i am NOT a fan of these pouches-i think they are a mess to deal with and no matter how careful you are to keeping your kitchen counter neat-some of the gravy always ends up there.A tip after getting the food out of the pouch with a spoon--add some water to the pouch and swish it around and add it to the cats plate to make a little more gravy. I wouldn't buy this again unless it was on sale. That said my cats do LOVE the whiskas fish pouches-you just open up the pouches and the food just slides out-no spoon required.

Once you peal back the top, the contents almost always spills onto your fingers, floor, counter, wherever you happen to be.  Then, when you are trying to pour the contents into a bowl, about a 1/4 to 1/5 of it get stuck down in the bottom and you have to dig it out with a spoon or cut the sides open and scrape it out.  Very messy process.  If they would fix the packaging, this product would be a real plus.  As it stands, I hate to use it because of the mess.

review/summary: Not Cheap, but Worth It!
review/text: While I'll acknowledge that shipping catfood can be a pricey proposition, with three cats, and an upper-floor apartment, the convenience of home delivery makes it a desirable option...and Amazon's excellent reputation for on-time deliveries makes it a far more reliable choice than the other 'autoship' providers I've used.<br /><br />Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree has been a favorite of my babies for over two years (surprisingly, it's the only 'seafood' item they like), and when you find something they love, you stick with it! While all the grocery chains in my area only offer it in a multi-flavor box (forcing me to pay for food the cats WON'T touch), through Amazon (and other carriers), the Tuna Entree pouches can be ordered individually for shipment, which is another reason I accept the increased price, without complaint.<br /><br />So consider what your options are, and if the 'pros' outweigh the 'cons', I recommend Amazon as your choice!

review/summary: If your cats like juice, this is the food for them
review/text: My cats love the "sauce" in the wet food I feed them, and this product is a saucy winner.  Each sack has quite a bit of juice and my cats devour them.  Other wet food products are a lot drier and I have to add water to them in order to get my cats to eat them.

review/text: Both my cats absolutely love this food. My one cat is getting up in age. And is having trouble keeping hard food to stay down. She really likes this stuff. And it has no problem in digesting. :)

review/text: A few years ago I bought a few packs of this at Walmart to give as a special morning treat for our 4 cats.  I would give them each a small spoonful and they were happy.  It quickly became a regular morning ritual with the cats sitting patiently in the kitchen each morning when I entered.  As time went on it became harder and harder to find The Tuna Entree at Walmart.  Sometimes I would drive to two different stores looking for it.  I tried some of the other 'flavors' and my cats let it be known they didn't like anything except this particular one.  They don't like any chunks of fish or whatever in their wet food.  In December when I was back in the U.S., after not being able to find this in the local stores, I turned to Amazon and I was so happy to not only find it available on here but we can get it shipped automatically  every 4 weeks.  Now, the cats always have their special morning meal and my daughter doesn't have to drive around looking for it.  I even haul 24 pouches in my carry on bag each trip back to Venezuela with me so my cat here can have her special morning treat.

review/summary: Whiskas
review/text: My cats love the food. The food is formed in the shape of the pouch so I do chop it up with fork to make it easier for them. The food looks and smells like fish. They like the snapper the best. Not to much moisture that had one cat throw up. No more wasted food. They eat it all. I wish it came all snapper but they probably like variety.  Price beats local stores. I buy the auto. delivery method and it saves even more. With auto ship the following deliveries come USPS.  They do notify of up coming shipmnt and you can postpone if need be. You can also get an early one.

review/summary: White meat chicken with dark bits
review/text: This product is made in Thailand with what appears to be really nice white meat chicken and some sort of dark bits.  The dark bits I guess are made out of chicken, but appear to be manufactured - like hot dogs - you know fillers and dyes.  Plenty of juice and chewy looking.  I purchased the cheaper pouches - Choice Cuts -, but those do not compare in quality to this one.

review/summary: yummy
review/text: We nused t6his product in our shelteer for sick cats that would not eat.When warmed up and smelly it was the best remedy for a cat with upper resporatory infection. When I rescued a tiny kitten from flea infestation and starvation he would only eat baby food. it wasn't until I brought home Whiskas chicken that he ate cat food. Now they all enjoy a Whiskas meal.
