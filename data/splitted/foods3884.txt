review/summary: Not Monkey King which the 'directions' and some 'reviews' indicate
review/text: I thought I was getting the Jasmine Monkey King green tea, because both the 'directions' and some of the 'reviews' mentioned it.  But, when I used the first pack, it didn't taste like Jasmine Monkey King green tea I've had before, and the box did not mention it being 'Monkey King' tea.<br /><br />It smells great before it is steeped, but after steeping, the scent is gone, and the taste is just ok.<br />I am disappointed, and I am stuck with 3 boxes of it, as it is not returnable.<br /><br />I wonder if Amazon posted REVIEWS of another Numi tea here by MISTAKE, because the box I received did not mention Monkey King.<br /><br />Not happy.

review/summary: Disappointing  Jasmine Tea
review/text: Numi's Jasmine Green Monkey King is the worst jasmine tea I have ever had.There's no sent of jasmine flowers upon brewing or steeping.If you love jasmine tea stay away from this one.If your new to green tea,never boil your water as it states on the Numi box it will only make your tea bitter.Don't believe me? Try it for yourself.  You want the water just before the boiling point (170-180)degrees Fahrenheit.They got the steeping time right 2 to 3 minutes.Hope this helps you.Beware of prepackaged teas. Buy whole leaf instead.

review/summary: My "go to" food now
review/text: My Siberian huskies are super sensitive to food.  One will vomit if the food doesn't agree with her, the other gets blood-tinged mucousy stool & vomit. No good, it's been a battle trying to find something that works for them.  Finally tried Eagle Pack and their problems went away.  My boy is also a really picky eater and he loves it.  I think this particular bag has grain in it, which they say not to feed your dog.. But mine do great on this.  I've tried all of the 'grain free' kibble and they barf it up. So, I don't know what it is about my dogs or this food.. but they are a compatible couple!

review/summary: on the watery side
review/text: Maybe these pods aren't compatible with my otherwise ESE compatible machine, a  Francic-Francis, but these pods make a watery espresso. If you like your espresso very long and diluted, these pods might be good for you. They don't seem to be packed tight enough. Same goes for Lavazzo ESE pods, btw. Only Illy's are really tight and work well with my machine. I believe the quality of this coffee is rather high, though, so I intend to try some whole beans.<br />Very expensive also.

review/summary: One of my favorite styles of Japanese ramen
review/text: For the longest time, I've found it difficult to justify blowing $3 on a bowl of instant ramen. Sure, the stuff's imported and most of what you're paying for is the cost of shipping from Japan. You can also get pretty decent domestic bowl ramen for around $1 a bowl. But since most of the ramen bowls coming from SoCal are Korean made (i.e., spicy), it's difficult to find a decent mild flavored Japanese ramen bowl. Menraku Shoyu is mildly flavored (just soy sauce) and not painfully salty like Nongshim, so I don't have to throw out half the flavor packet. The texture of the noodles has a nice bit to it. I don't get these very often since they're relatively expensive, but you get what you paid for. Highly recommended if you want a real Japanese style ramen and want a subtle flavor that isn't spicy.

review/summary: good for doggy with sensitive stomach
review/text: My mini schnauzer, Izzy, loves to chew. However, chewing has been somewhat of an issue for her and us, Pig ears are so greasy they upset her stomach, she broke a tooth on a hoof, and I don't even want to go into the morning I had to give her doggie Heimlich while she choked on part of a bully stick that had come off and she gulped. She won't touch the rubber stuff like kongs. My vet suggested lamb's ears, they are non greasy, easily digested, and won't set off her allergies (a whole other issue)<br /><br /> She loves her lamb's ear, and so far no digestive issues. They are not at all greasy and gave her a happy 15-20 minutes of chewing. I will be buying these in bulk.

review/summary: Red Barn brand Chew-A-Bulls
review/text: I purchased these at a big-box petstore locally and I was rather miffed to discover that these are not what they appear. I expected bull pizzles, but it seems all of the "Red Barn" brand Chew-A-Bulls are reconstituted and not real pizzles. They have gone to great lengths to make the product look like a real bull pizzle, but they are not the real thing and do not last like the real thing. I knew something was wrong when my dog had devoured it within minutes. Close inspection revealed flashing from the mold used to form them and the ends were smooth and uniform, unlike a real pizzle.<br />Bull pizzles aren't particularly cheap, and neither are the cheap imitations like these.<br />I truly felt like I had been deliberately deceived, enough so to warn others.

review/text: Move over other spreads- almond butter, peanut butter, nutella, etc. I don't know who invented Biscoff crunchy spread, but I want to give them a big hug. Im happy to easily find Biscoff at our Publix and World Market. Last week I saw the cruncy version (we'd only purchased the creamy before) and decided to give it a try. It's AWESOME! Of course I just grabbed a spoon and gave it a try and I wasn't disapointed. SO good. I've tried it on cinnamon french toast with a drizzle of maple syrup. Crunchy biscoff and jelly will replace the typical PB&J in our house. This spread is awesome with sliced apples, too. Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

review/text: Let's see...spreadable cookies... Yes! Bischoff spread is made by the European cookie maker and is available in smooth or crunchy (with cookie bits mixed in). Our favorite dessert these days is thin apple slices with a dab of Bischoff spread on them. Other than with fruit, it difficult to imagine other uses. Since it's made from cookies, it seems like overkill to spread it on toast - but it would probably be good. This stuff is so good that you'll want to grab a spoon and dive right in. Don't, it's a fairly pricy and calorie-rich treat. But for special occasions it's amazingly good.

review/text: Why would I call this the worst spread ever? Because it tastes too damn good. I saw this on the store shelf and took a chance. When I got home I wanted to taste it before I would try it on bread. One teaspoon: Yummy! Two teaspoons: Yummy! Three teaspoons.. let's just say three days later the jar is almost gone and the spread never touched a slice bread. This stuff is super delicious, but I can't see it being an alternative to peanut butter in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It's too sweet and would not counter the jelly's sweetness like peanut butter does.

review/summary: VERY disappointed--especially after buying based upon other reviews
review/text: While I don't often post reviews, I feel compelled to for this product as it was such an incredible disappointment. I was a food writer and food editor for a number of publications for many years and am happy to invest research time into selecting the right products, especially when you are buying multiples of a single item. This broth had some excellent reviews, and I find it hard to believe that the reviewers had tasted/evaluated the same product that I purchased as the broth tasted watery with little real chicken flavor and had almost an artificial flavor to it. While it may be organic, there is none of the savory warmth most of us would associated with even a somewhat watered-down version of homemade broth. I actually found that to use it, I had to prepare a "side order" of Better Than Bouillon chicken flavor to kick in some semblance of real, hearty chicken flavor. What's interesting is that perhaps this experience comports with a number of blind tastings of organic and free-range poultry wherein the organic and free-range birds often came up quite short on flavor as much as we all would like to think the flavor would be better from a purely philosophical perspective. When you also add in the price premium, I would say this is not a product that I would recommend at all.

review/text: I buy this Imagine brand or Kroger's Naturally Preferred brand organic free range chicken broth which is exactly the same thing (depending on which is on sale) at my local Kroger store in quart size containers - 32 oz.  I wish Amazon stocked it in 32 oz. containers at a competitive price.  A 16 oz. container would never do for us.<br /><br />It is absolutely wonderful for soups of any kind, from chicken noodle with veggies added to vegetable soup to bean soup or whatever.  Since we do not eat beef or pork I use this broth as the base of everything that needs broth.  I also use small quantities of it to 'quick saute' veggies, per the recommendation on whfoods.org and it works as well as oils which break down when heated.<br /><br />Heated in a pan by itself it is not so good.  However, since we don't eat "plain" anything, in my opinion this is THE best broth with no potato starch, bad oils or MSG.

review/summary: licorice chips
review/text: I ordered these because my father recently gave me one when we were visiting. I asked where he got them, and he told me the price, which seemed scary, but then he said he had had the bag for about 25 years, and still had some left (and they tasted fresh to me). I figured a product that could last that long, while being used (frugally, I suspect) and still be beneficial must be worth the premium price.<br /><br />I received the product on time, and I am not disappointed with it. I expect this bag may last me awhile, although I may share more of it with others. the chips have good flavor, are long-lasting, and soothing to the throat.

review/summary: This is a delicious, gentle but reliable laxative tea.
review/text: I have been using this tea for over two years.  It moves my bowels reliably after taking it for at least two days.  From then on one's regularity is consistent.I think it regulates the water in the system as well. This tea helps weight loss to show on the scale, if you are an every morning weigher when on a diet.<br /><br />Because the weight comes off slowly, one is not apt to crave sugar after about two weeks of using it.  For me, sweets became less desireable while I  was using American Ultra Dieter's Tea.  It is much better tasting than Laci Le Beau, in my opinion.<br /><br />It is not the whole answer to success while dieting, but I reccommend it as an adjunct to a good diet program.

review/summary: Nasty! Greasy! Plasticy taste!
review/text: We picked this up on a whim, thinking it would be nice to not have to dirty a bowl on the occasions that we pop popcorn. In my house, one less dirty bowl is a wonderful thing!<br /><br />This stuff is the most greasy popcorn I've ever had! Not only that, but the big is a pain to open as another reviewer mentioned. You have to hold it at the bottom of the side, then pull the plastic cover off, and even then you only have about a 50/50 shot of it coming off in one piece. Then once you actually get it open, the popcorn has a hint of plastic to it. The top and bottom of the "bowl" aren't paper like a regular bag of microwave popcorn - they're thin sheets of plastic - and that taste comes through in the popcorn.<br /><br />All that said, the popcorn is edible, but it's not as good as regular microwave popcorn. We'll eat this pack, but when it's gone, we'll be back to the standard microwave popcorn!

review/summary: Sprayed orange grease all over the inside of the microwave
review/text: The pop-up bowl sounds like a great idea, but evidently they rushed it to market before all the bugs were out.<br /><br />The first bag I cooked was fine, except the instructions for opening the bag are far from clear, and even after you figure out how to do it it's a lot of trouble and makes a big mess.<br /><br />But the second bag evidently sprang a leak - it sprayed bright orange grease all over the inside of my microwave, even into the tiny vent holes inside the top and side. I always watch popcorn carefully while it pops, but I could not see the grease spray until after it was done and I opened the door. Cleaning it all out was a horrible ordeal, and I'm sure everything I cook in the microwave will come out smelling like popcorn grease for weeks.<br /><br />They released this product too soon. It needs serious redesign. I will not buy it again.

You can't open it without encountering hot steam, there are a LOT of unpopped kernels, and I just had one explode in the microwave, spewing popped corn, unpopped corn, and oil all over. I never had so much trouble from any other brand. The traditional microwave popcorn bag has it all over these failure bowls.

review/text: I agree. I know they have invested a lot of time, money and resources into making the "new" Pop Up Bowl style popcorn and have implemented this feature on almost all of their product offerings as a benefit, but in reality it leaves a good share of the popcorn unpopped and burnt or leaves a burnt flavor for those kernels that popped correctly. I eat popcorn almost EVERY day and would compliment Orville R's popcorn as the best out there but now the experience and product satisfaction is less than desirable now that they've changed EVERYTHING in their product line to the new Pop Up Bowl. It is getting harder and harder to find a multi-pack (6 or 10) that does not use the new bowl. Please either change it back or at least offer the traditional "non-bowl" type of product for us true popcorn enthusiasts.

review/text: While the bowl may be a nice feature, the pop corn didn't cook the way it's supposed to.  I know from much experience how the popping is supposed to sound when it's done, but when it slowed down enough and I took it out, much of the popcorn was charred...really nasty.  And even the pieces that looked good, didn't have a good taste.  I think the old cook-in-the-bag way produced a much more evenly done popcorn.  Didn't anyone test this out??  If the old package is no longer available, I'll have to change brands.

Why go through that trouble when the bag conveniently turns into the pop corn bowl? It is very convenient. Tastes great too....just like Orville Redenbacher's always does. I highly recommend it. Did I mention 100% whole grain?<br /><br />Only con I see here is that there could have been a little more popcorn in each bag to fill the bowl up a little higher.

review/summary: Pop Up Bowl is Terrible
review/text: The bowl bag does not pop in the same amount of time as a normal bag so it makes your microwave's popcorn button useless. Additionally, about half of the bags are faulty and open when popping resulting in very little popped popcorn. Last, I have found it almost impossible to get the bag to pop completely even when watching it pop (since I can't use the popcorn button!). Overall, this new bowl design is terrible and I would recommend switching to another brand until they go bag to the old bags that work.

review/summary: too many bags explode
review/text: We like the flavor of the movie theater popcorn which is the only reason we kept buying it.  We used a box and then the next box we had, the bags kept exploding and made a mess.  The company sent us coupons for more free as they said maybe just a bad box.  We had decent luck for a bit and then more bags started exploding.  The last time my three year old microwave quit working after it happened, but I do think that is probably a coincidence based on complaints about the microwave.  The bags are also hard to open and messy.  We have been pouring it into bowls so really no advantage to the pop-up bowl thing for us. After too many explosions of late, I am no longer going to buy the product.

review/summary: Good movie-theater style popcorn without tons of extra greasy gross-ness.
review/text: Please note that I did not purchase this from Amazon, so I am not commenting on the expiration date problem that some people have had.<br /><br />The popcorn cooking process was not as actually described on the wrapper. It says to cook for 2-2.5 minutes on high. I have a 1200 watt microwave and it was done in a 1.5 minutes, perfectly. Granted there were some unpopped kernels but that happens with every popcorn, they are the dried out ones.<br /><br />The butter was, at the bottom, a little gloppy... But as a whole, not too much. It was salty and slightly greasy and delicious. If you want movie theater popcorn that is exactly like at the movies, you are obviously not going to get it from microwave popcorn that comes like this. But for what it is, it's great, and reminds me of the movies.

review/summary: Very convenient and tasty
review/text: I'm confused why there are so many negative reviews.  We love these.  We're on our 2nd box and have had no problems with the bag spraying or the popcorn tasting like plastic.  I did notice that the popping time seems to be less for this than other bags - maybe they are cooking them too long?  The bag is easy to open if you follow the directions - pull it on the side where there is a little cut, but just take it half way.  Then go to the other side's slit and pull it to the middle where you can then remove it.  I love not having to wash any bowls!  We've even melted butter and added extra to it - the bag supported the extra butter well without making any messes.  There are usually about a dozen or so unpopped at the bottom - but I found if I freeze the bag for at least 30 minutes before popping - that number really decreases.

review/summary: HOT, chunky and flavorful
review/text: Green Mountain Gringo makes the best jarred salsa. There are always chunks of tomato; it is not watery at all. It sits well on your chip.<br /><br />The salsa is also made from all natural ingredients. There are no preservatives, artificial flavors or colors. Really, you shouldn't need any with peppers this hot.<br /><br />And -whew- they are HOT. I love spicy food and this salsa is a bit much for me. After one bite I am sweating and my blood circulation has really picked up. This is not a complaint: if you label your salsa "hot" it better burn my tongue and turn my cheeks red.<br /><br />Finally, the jars are great for reusing. I use them as water glasses, a safe container to store my soup for lunch, and also great for fridge pickles. The lids do retain the odor of the salsa for a few washings, though soaking them in baking soda and water fixes this.

review/summary: Love these
review/text: These treats are huge, and they sell them at the boutique dog shops for $4.99 for one, so I'm happy to buy them in "bulk".  They work really well with my dogs because for some reason, my dogs don't like just plain old rawhide.  They like the chicken on top.  I don't buy the flavored rawhide because it usually stains.  And these treats last a long time.

review/text: When we received the gumballs the container they were in had opened and the gumballs were spread all over the box and something else must have happened to them because they were all stuck together and to the box.... a big mess and we couldn't eat any of them nor would we want to in the condition they were in.  I filled out the return form online but amazon.com gave no address to return them to and there was no address on the gumball coated shipping label so I went to a UPS store to send them back to the amazon address but there were so many different addresses we couldn't figure out which one to send it back to .  In the mean time it was going to cost me 17 dollars to send it back so I said forget it and took the loss.  Very bad amazon experience for this customer.  Dont order the gumballs or anything perishable from amazon.

review/text: im from nc...where the coastal plain meet the piedmont.  the triangle area.<br /><br />if one went to get barbeque (a thing, not something performed) it was chopped or pulled pork that was showered with a very, very thin vineager sauce, usually hot, with black and red pepper, maybe a bit ciderish flavor and sometimes only a faint red tint from some type of tomato part.<br /><br />it was a sauce sprinkled all over the pulled pork in a small shaker bottle.  the best there is.<br /><br />bbq discussions as a child told me that mustardy bbq sauce was fromm the sandhills (south south-east nc and south carolina.)  which is why i find the carolina blue label odd.<br /><br />but this sauce is pretty good on pork and some beef.  it has an ok tangy-zest and not too sweet and reasonably priced.<br /><br />a good alternative to all the red sauces.

review/summary: Best gum I have ever chewed.  Period.
review/text: I never chew fruit-flavored gum.  In fact, I'm not a big gum chewer at all.  I think the last time I ever chewed a flavor other than some mint-based thing was Bubblicious when I was ten years old.<br /><br />So I was completely blown away when I tried a piece of my coworker's Trident Tropical Twist gum.  My life will never be the same.  I feel like I've been sleepwalking all these years.<br /><br />It's not just me either.  I took a pack of this gum on a group trip last weekend and everybody who tried it fell in love with it.  They all bought packs of it and introduced it into their office environments.  And these are some of the smartest people I know.<br /><br />Not only is Trident Tropical Twist delicious, it lasts for a good 30 minutes without losing flavor.  Somewhere, some time ago, in some chewing gum lab, the scientists involved with making this gum uncorked a big bottle of champagne and received massive bonus checks.<br /><br />Is there such a thing as gum Nirvana?  Perhaps.  And if there is, it's Trident Tropical Twist.

review/summary: Xylitol Makes This One of the Best (Dental) Chewing Gum On the Market!
review/text: Trident uses a sugar-alcohol called Xylitol, a natural sugar that has no carbohydrate action, yet bacteria ingest the Xylitol and cannot metabolize it, thus starving the bacteria!  Thus, with consistant use, it rids the mouth of harmful cavity-causing, gum disease-causing bacteria!  This is truly a unique gum.  One of the few gums that all dentists can recommend!<br /><br />Don't use this product if you suffer from TMJ - it will only aggravate your sore joints.<br /><br />This is a great product for the average person, child or adult.  Chew two to three pieces a day and your oral health will improve.<br /><br />Jim Koenig, DDS

review/summary: Great Flavor!-But Beware Somewhat Misleading Xylitol Claims
review/text: The other reviews have mentioned the positive aspects of this gum, and they're true! The flavor is sweet but not overpowering. It lasts about 20ish minutes, which is good enough for me. And it's pretty inexpensive relative to a lot of other gum. So overall it's a great value, and I will continue to purchase it.<br /><br />Ok. Here's the Xylitol issue. Yes, the gum contains Xylitol. Accurate. But the assumption Trident is /likely/ guessing you're making is that the gum has enough Xylitol to actually have its highly touted positive effects. The answer is....probably no. Not really. Trident, naturally, won't disclose the amount it contains. This isn't a good sign. Take the following with a grain of salt but Trident isn't exactly trying to deny the claims-it's estimated by more than one source to have roughly .2 grams of Xylitol in a piece. How much should you get to acquire real benefit? At least 5 grams. You can do the math on how many sticks you need to chew every single day to get there. So if you just want a solid, inexpensive gum-go for it! If you are really looking for Xylitol related benefits, you can easily find other brands of gum on amazon that will get you there.

review/summary: Best gum flavor ever
review/text: I have never been a gum chewer.  I went through 40 years with rarely ever chewing gum. I started to chew once many of the new gums came out that were healthier and also helped with teeth, mouth hygiene etc.  The health of my teeth is very important to me considering the cost of dental work.<br /><br />So I started to search for a gum that I liked. Many of the mint ones I found I could only chew for 5 mins before it got unpleasant. I then found this favor and was totally blown away within the first 5 seconds. It is an amazing full flavor and so tasty. The flavor lasts for about 20-25 mins. I am still not much of a gum user and 20 mins is my limit. I use it to clean my mouth, especially after coffee or a meal.<br /><br />I find the sticks way to small to chew 1 at the time. Most times I use 2, some times 3.<br /><br />Best gum flavor ever :)

review/summary: Like the flavor...
review/text: After not chewing gum for many years I started again recently. First, I was very surprised that very few if any gum contains sugar now, they are almost all sugar free. Second, I specifically looked for gum with Xylitol as there are studies showing that it's good for oral hygiene, and surprisingly only a few contain it. Even Trident, only a few flavors contain Xylitol and not all of them. I'm wondering if Xylitol is expensive or what.<br /><br />Anyhoo, this is one of the few I'm chewing now. I choose this because it's relatively cheap, tastes good and contains Xylitol. Unfortunately, the package does not say how much Xylitol it contains and I'm starting to read on reviews that it doesn't contain enough. I bought multipacks of this and after I finish it I'm going to check out other brands to see if I can find some that contain more Xylitol.
