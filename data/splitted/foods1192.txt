review/summary: Starbucks is better when you buy at the store
review/text: I buy the best pre-ground on the spot coffee from my Starbucks, we have 3 locations in a town with 200,000 people.  The coffee that is on Amazon is SOOOOO expensive.  I pay around $11.00 for this coffee and have it ground in the store.  Why is this so expensive here on Amazon?

review/summary: Package Left in High Rise Public Entrance
review/text: I love Starbucks coffee.  This coffee has great flavor and body.  It' great to wake up to the smell of freshly ground, freshly brewed Starbucks French Roast Extra Bold Coffee.  What a way to start my day!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I did not know that I would have to go to the public entrance and carry my package to my apartment.<br /><br />Ship Carrier:  Ensenda<br />Status:  Delivered<br />Location:  Front door<br />Signed for by:  Released by Delivery Agent<br /><br />My package was not left at my front door.  It was left in the PUBLIC ENTRANCE.  I live in a high rise building and I'm totally disabled.  The Delivery Agent stood in the public entrance, and rang my bell.  When I answered, he stated, "Your package is here."  Since all of our packages are delivered to our apartment doors, I pressed the unlock public entrance button and waited for my package to be delivered to my apartment.  After a few minutes, I went downstairs and luckily found my package still sitting in the public entrance.  Anyone could have picked up my package and left.  Since I was unable to carry my package to my apartment, my neighbor had to carry it to my apartment.  THIS IS NOT PACKAGE DELIVERY!  UPS has Ebou deliver our packages to our apartment doors.  Even USPS delivers our packages to our apartment doors.  I'm really disappointed that Amazon has chosen such a poor delivery service.  I've been ordering from Amazon for years and never had this problem.  Please fire Ensenda for not actually delivering the package to my front door and misrepresenting exactly where my package was left.

review/summary: Stinky Beans
review/text: When I opened the bag of beans, couldn't believe the smell!  Smells like dirty diapers.  Thought the beans must be contaminated, but ground and brewed a cup, taste was good, not the greatest brewed coffee aroma, but not disgusting like the beans and grounds.  Too cheap to throw out the bag of beans, so will hold my nose and continue using and hope for no health side effects.

review/text: I have been drinking Starbucks French roast for about 15 years now. The coffee would get five stars except Amazon Subscribe & Save service sucks. I never used this service before, but decided to take advantage of it for the first time, since I drink so much coffee. Signed up for a once a month shipment on this item and Amazon canceled after my first shipment, WTF! Very dissapointed Amazon.

review/summary: Tastes great, wish it were healthier!
review/text: "Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Polysorbate 60"<br /><br />It's really good cocoa, and I make it every morning for my husband (he won't drink coffee); we even bring it along on vacation so he can have it. I just wish that list of poisons above weren't included.  I've suggested to Land-o-Lakes that they make a ... "Sweet Nothings" version or whatever they want to call it:  a *totally* unsweetened version, so we can add whatever sweetener we wish to add.<br /><br />The corn syrup is unhealthy in the extreme; the 'partially hydrogenated' means trans fats (and soy is *not* healthy, contrary to the "common" "wisdom"), and the polysorbate has been shown in cosmetics to cause problems (and why is a cosmetics ingredient in a food item?!).<br /><br />That said (er... written), until someone comes up with a healthy product that tastes as good as this stuff does, he's gonna keep drinking these poisons every morning. {sigh}

review/summary: Supreme Chocolate Makes My Heart Sing!
review/text: Instead of creamer and sugar, I add a packet of this to my eight ounces of freshly ground coffee each morning! For a mere 140 calories, I enter bliss! Comparable, both in yummy-ness and nutritionally, to a whole milk Starbucks Mocha Frappuccinoï¿½, this Supreme Chocolate mix comes in at 3 grams of saturated fat (30 calories, 14% DV, from hydrogenated soybean oil and coconut oil), 0 trans fat, and 24 grams of sugars (sugar and corn syrup solids). As for price, since I live three hours from the nearest Wal-Mart, the shipped price is actually a little better than I would pay locally, and it arrives practically overnight. The entire box of 72 packets is only 7"x7"x18", and consists of six smaller display type boxes of twelve packets each. These 6"x7"x3.5" display boxes will tuck neatly into the smallest kitchen upper cabinets, and will maintain the individually wrapped single serving packets in a neat upright position. All in all, this is a big luxury for a little price, which is something that makes my heart sing!

review/summary: An Excellent Cup of Hot Chocolate!!
review/text: Being a hot cocoa lover as I am, it's hard to believe I've never tried Land O Lakes Supreme Hot Chocolate until I received it as part of a gift basket. I must say, it was one of the best cups of hot chocolate I've had in a long time.<br />I've tried soooo many different brands....from the most expensive to the least expensive. This ranks up in my top 3...which is a hard place to get to in my eyes (or taste buds?).<br />At approximately $0.40 a serving, this is a great deal.<br />You'll find this hot cocoa rich in taste and quite creamy as well...even though it's simply made with hot water.<br />Make sure you follow the instructions on the packet....6 oz. of water per packet.<br />Go ahead...try it...you won't be disappointed!

There are several other delicious Land O Lakes cocoa flavors including French Vanilla, Supreme, and Caramel. It's yummo in my tummo ( I find myself saying this a lot when I'm drinking it!).

review/summary: Stubb's Spicy Bar-B-Que Beef Brisket Strips
review/text: I was looking for some beef jerky as a snack on a road trip to California. I found my first bag at a gas station in Nevada. I was very happy with the flavor and tenderness, and my bag was soon gone. Worse, I couldn't find it on the road back home or in my local stores. I did however find it on Amazon, much to my relief. They shipped it ASAP and it was as good as I remembered. I would advise anyone looking for some very tasty and softer jerky to try the Stubb's Spicy Bar-B-Que Beef Brisket Strips, it's way better than the hard jerky and very tasty.

review/summary: Decent (not-spicy) snack
review/text: Maybe it's because I've never had brisket strip "jerky" before, or maybe it was just the batch that I got, but these seemed much greasier than the usual products of this type.  I had to tear bits of fat from each strip before I ate and I could still feel my mouth coated with grease as I chewed.<br /><br />And again, this may have been related to my particular batch, but calling these "spicy" is laughable as I wasn't able to get a even a hint of a kick from any of the three bags I ordered.  If I'd known that these were about as spicy as ketchup, I would not have ordered tham and will likely not order them again because I prefer my jerky to have at least a little heat.<br /><br />Those complaints aside, this stuff is very tender and has a good and strong BBQ flavor (spicy or no).  I've never eaten Stubb's BBQ, but if this is a reasonable approximation of what goes on in his restaurants, then I wouldn't hesitate in stopping and eating there.  I'd just bring my own Tabasco.

review/text: I've loved this soup since I was a kid, and now my daughters love it, too!  It's a "light" soup, great for upset stomachs that can't handle eating much; unlike canned soups it doesn't have that "greasy" component to it that can make canned soups too heavy for an upset tummy.  Plenty of flavor on it's own, but not an overpowering taste so it's great to pair with a sandwich or something else to make a great light meal or snack.  My daughters ask me to fix this for them all the time.  Only bad thing is that Amazon seems to be the only place to get it these days, so I have to time my purchases right to have this on hand.  But I've never had problems with getting it promptly from Amazon.  Getting ready to order another case of it!

review/text: Lipton Ringo Noodle soup is the best packaged soup on the market for children and grown-ups alike! My granddaughters ask for it whenever they visit me. It doesn't irritate their throats like some packaged chicken noodle soups do. I will continue to purchase it as long as it remains available.

review/summary: Top of the Line K-Cup
review/text: I really love this k-cup.  It is my second favorite regular coffee K-cup (at this time), second only to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLILAW">Barista Prima House Blend</a>.  I agree with their text that states a more complex flavor.  The claim is that this is a premium line for those who expect a premium coffee more like a coffee shop.  I tend to agree, except you just don't get as much per cup.  I love the colombian blend flavor as variety to mix in between the house blend, which I absolutely love most.  The house blend is a very blended flavor without one note overpowering the others.  For a change, I like the stronger note that the colombia blend offers.  Both match my preference for medium or medium-dark house blend roasts from coffee shops, but not the very dark roast of Starbucks.  I really feel this is a complex blend that has well more than one note, but a slightly stronger note associate with colombia blends.  Most importantly, it doesn't taste burnt like a dark french roast.<br /><br />I have tried so many K-cup flavors, most of which I liked at varied degrees with a few exceptions, but this one is currently my second favorite (second to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLILAW">Barista Prima House Blend</a> in the same variety).  What is nice about K-cups is you can easy switch blends per cup or over time without having to exhaust a whole bag of beans or grounds before moving on.  And preferences change as you have the same day in and day out.  So I can say that at present, I love it over previous favorites (of non-flavored) which in descending order of current preference are: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGPK">Wolfgang Puck Chef's Reserve Colombian</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Dark Magic</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045IO37Y">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1GFN2">Caribou</a>, and a number of other decent ones.  I am just saying I prefer this over those right now.  But I will still have the others for variety.  Within this variety, I really like the house blend best.  But I prefer variety and usually have House Blend in the morning, and a Colombia blend in the afternoon.  On more rare occasions, I'll have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLKF6K">Barista Prima Italian Roast</a> when I feel like a dark french roast with very strong flavor.<br /><br />The Barista Prima tends to be more expensive, and depending on the sale price, can be only a little more expensive than other varieties.  For a little bit more, it is worth it to me.  For a lot more, maybe not.  Paying about 12% more yields about 30% more in value in flavor to me.  But paying 50% more is costly when there other flavors are plenty good too.

review/summary: enjoyed the kheer
review/text: While this kheer does not have a strong flavor, it was very good.  It comes with loose rice and 2 packets, one with sugar and one with spices and nuts.  The packet of sugar seemed quite large to me so I only used 1/2. I figured that I can always add more sugar if it needed it but it did not.  My family is trying to limit our sugar consumption.  In my view, 1/2 the sugar seems to allow the flavor of the spices and milk to come out more.  Bottom line, the flavor is good and you can adjust the sugar as it comes separate in a package.  I would buy again.  Directions say to add 4 cups milk and cook for 40 minutes.  Ingredients: rice, sugar, almonds, pistachios, raisins, spices

review/summary: Delicious! Similar texture to oat granola!
review/text: I purchased this product in the last week from a local store and was so suprised at 1.) How good it tastes and 2.) How much the texture is like real oat granola.  I had seen the GF granola before but did not get it because I thought the flakes would make it more like flake cereal.  I was definitely mistaken.  Not only does it satisfy my texture cravings, it has some great ingredients like flax seeds and dried fruit.  It actually had a good ratio of fruit to nuts and other contents, rather than having one or 2 pieces of fruit in the whole bag like some other manufacturers like to do.  In all, I totally loved this product and now that I see buying in bulk from Amazon will save me $2/bag, I will be sure to buy it here next time!

review/summary: My second-favorite gluten-free granola
review/text: Bakery on Main's Extreme Fruit & Nut Granola holds first place on my favorite cereal list, but this one is a close second. The cereal is very crunchy and flavorful, with a great mix of textures. The pieces of walnut are big enough that when you get one in your spoonful, you get a burst of walnut flavor.<br /><br />One of my favorite ways to eat this is on top of a "sort-of-Waldorf salad" - I cut up some apple and grapes, stir them into vanilla yogurt, and sprinkle a handful of Bakery on Main Apple Raisin Walnut Granola on top... YUM!<br /><br />Setting up the auto-ship order of 6 bags at a time through Amazon brings the price down significantly lower than I can get this in my local grocery stores!<br /><br />Thank you, Bakery on Main, for bringing the crunch back to my gluten-free breakfasts!

review/text: I had purchased Bakery on Main GF Granola from Whole Foods and was very impressed.  I was never a big granola fan, but since becoming GF, getting to add something different to my breakfast food list was worth a try.  And I loved it.  I usually have the granola with yogurt and some added fruit, like a banana or blueberries and mix it all together.  It's filling, but light -  Wonderful for breakfast or a quick snack.  Purchasing thru Amazon, in bulk, allows me to save too.  Purchasing separately, I would be spending approx. $1.50 or more, per bag.  Tho I get to mix and match at another market, the overall savings is worth it.  Gotta save every which way I can these days.

review/summary: Great Taste for any Chocolate lover!
review/text: I discovered the Monin Sugar Free Dark Chocolate sauce at a local frozen yogurt place.  I am currently on a weight loss diet and have a No Sugar Added / Non-Fat yogurt occasionally.  This Sugar Free syrup really makes the usual Vanilla Frozen yogurt a real gourmet treat.<br /><br />I purchased it and found that it works great in turning plain coffees into yummy mocha's. Add it to your milk and heat it slightly, then whip it to make a really tasty mocha latte.<br /><br />I gave it only 4 stars because it is sweetened with Maltitol, a "sugar alcohol" which can upset your stomach if you're sensitive, but I haven't had the problem, but I think if you use enough it can force frequent trips to the bathroom, if you know what I mean.  If it was sweetened with sucralose (Splenda) then it would get 5 stars from me.<br /><br />I look forward to trying their other flavors as this was a winner... I have since re-ordered in the "6-pack."  It is also available in a larger size bottle that you can use a hand pump to dispense.<br /><br />I recommend it for any chocolate lover who is looking to top ice cream, yogurt, even coffee drinks!

review/text: I absolutely love Matouk's West Indian hot sauce. It's got the spice AND the flavor, a great combination all around. I use it in everything I eat. However, amazon is tripping with the price! It went from $9 and change to $14 and change for a 26oz, and that is ridiculous! I'm going to have my local market order some with the guarantee that i'll purchase. If you like spice, get this!!!

review/summary: Great Taste, Easy to Use
review/text: I like this seasoning even better than McCormick's Buffalo Wing seasoning. Now I'm not saying it even comes close to real, honest-to-goodness barbecue because it absolutely is NOTHING like that, however it does taste really good- kind of a spicy bbq taste - and it's easy to use. You just coat the chicken pieces with it and throw it in your preheated oven.<br /><br />I put the pieces on a foil covered cookie sheet, spray the foil with a non-stick spray and clean up is super easy as well. I've used this with boneless chicken tenders, wings and legs and always had good results. However, as with McCormick's Buffalo Wing mix, this also tends to brown/burn easily if you try to use your broiler or your outdoor grill.<br /><br />Bottom line: This tastes good and is a great mix to use when you're in a hurry or don't feel like taking alot of time in the kitchen. You can do it in the oven which I think takes about 25 minutes or so (less with boneless)so you aren't having to hover over the stove or grill.

review/summary: Great! One of my favorite flavored coffees!
review/text: If you like other Green Mountain flavored coffees, especially if you like the other seasonal light-roast flavors, you will probably like this one.  I really liked the Green Mountain Blue-Berry and thought I would try this and am very pleased.  It seems like a great fit for the fall.  The flavor and aroma seem a bit stronger than in the blue-berry.  Like the blue-berry, this is a light roast.  At first I thought light would mean weak, but it seems like the perfect match for the flavor so that it is still coffee and nicely flavored without either over-powering the other.  It is nothing like a starbucks.  So if you want a strong coffee taste above all, then this isn't one for you, but if you want a nice flavored light coffee, I think it is great.<br /><br />Like other flavored coffees, you should only brew this on the normal default coffee cup size (6oz) on the Keurig brewer or you will water it down if you use the mug size or larger.

review/summary: I don't "do" flavored coffee...
review/text: BUT, I'm on a very restrictive diet that doesn't allow for the usual autumny, spicy, baked goods - one of the many reasons fall is my favorite time of year.  I was highly skeptical of the quality of this, since most flavored coffees are irritatingly perfumy with no real increase in flavor.  To top that off, I don't even LIKE light coffees and have always been a bold girl.  This coffee was purchased purely on whim one night when I was craving something with pumpkin spice.  Much to my surprise, this coffee has turned out to be a hit.  It's not a five-star, knock my socks off coffee, but pretty darn close!  The pumpkin and spice with the coffee aroma and flavor are perfectly balanced.  Not perfumy at all and neither one is overpowering the other.  It also holds up decently well to my usual heavy cream.  Drinking this is just like having a piece of pumpkin spice cake with a good ol' cuppa joe.  I'm thoroughly impressed.

review/text: One squirt of whipped cream is absolutely like a Starbucks coffee.  If brewing too large a size like most of the flavored coffees you can make it too weak so be careful in adding milk or cream not to add too much until you taste test it.  Tastes like pumpkin pie.  The wonderful holiday aroma hits your nose as you lift your mug and the taste doesn't disappoint.

review/text: I ordered this based on my enjoyment of the starbucks pumpkin spice latte.  The flavor is very light, I made mine light, over ice, with some half and half and equal sweetener.  The pumpkin taste is lighter and the spices are not over powering. I really enjoyed the drink.  It is like the starbucks drink but without all of the heavy cream and overly sweetened taste. I wouldn't use this as my everyday coffee, but I am going to enjoy this seasonally. I would recommend this to a friend.

review/summary: Pumpkin-y, spicy, no weird after taste, scrumptious!
review/text: I live for the time of year when Starbucks brings back pumpkin spice lattes, thick and creamy and oh so pumpkin-y. I am not normally a huge fan of flavored coffees so it was with scepticism and a bit of desperation and fear for my waistline that I tried Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice. I needed to conquer my cravings for a daily pumpkin latte (or two). The Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice has the same flavor! Of course it doesn't have the creamy thick lusciousness of a latte , but it doesn't have the calories either. Pumpkin, like coconut flavor is hard to pin down but Green Mountain does a great job with this flavor and I heartily recommend it. I do still get my lattes on Sunday mornings but this gets me through the week.

Pumpkin coffee is definitely now one of my favorite things about fall.

This one, hands down, is my favorite flavored coffee of all time now.  I just ordered 3 bags of the ground on Green Mountain's website since Amazon didn't have it.  If you call Green Mountain, you'll find out that this is their NUMBER 1 selling flavored coffee.  Highly, highly, highly recommend!

review/summary: All spice and no pumpkin :(
review/text: I ordered this product with careful consideration of other reviews. I got the 18 pack, the smallest I could find with free shipping. I have to agree with other reviewers that this is all spice and no pumpkin flavor, which is a big disappointment for me since I have a pumpkin obsession. When I made the coffee, I could smell the pumpkin and I was excited, but that's where it stopped. I could not detect any pumpkin flavor in this coffee at all. For me, the spice was overly strong when I tried the coffee plain. However, when creamer was added, it was tamed down quite a bit and perfectly fine. I would not buy this again though. I'm hoping to find some pumpkin creamer to get through the 17 k-cups I have left.

review/text: I have had the tarrismo coffee maker but was frustrated about my limited options so I bought the Tarrismo.  The Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice Limited Edition Coffee was worth making the switch.  I really enjoy the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte and would drink it year round if I could.  The Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice is not as good as the Starbucks version but it does give it a run for the money at half the price (I brew two cups as K-Cups really give you ï¿½ of a cup of coffee).  I find you just need a hint of milk to get the best taste.  Best of all the smell of the coffee brewing fills the whole house with a smell that is simply delicious.  All in all if I were never to try any other flavors but the Pumpkin Spice I would still be happy with making the switch to Keurig.
