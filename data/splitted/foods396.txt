review/summary: Altoid Mints
review/text: The local stores no longer stock the Spearmint flavor of the Altoids mints, so when I noticed the website on the tin can, I contacted the site and was directed to Amazon com., which led me to a resource for ordering a dozen cans. The package was sent promptly. I am a very satisfied customer.

review/summary: Altoid flavors I can't find in local stores
review/text: I was slightly worried when ordering because all the pictures shown of the "pack of 12 tins" were actually pictures of a pack of 6 tins.  But I trusted the words over the pictures and did receive packs of 12 tins (double what the photo shows).<br /><br />I bought packs of 12 tins in four different flavors, because I've found Altoids taste better when they are a different flavor than whatever flavor Altoid I had last.  Local stores have only the peppermint, which I like least.  The Spearmint and Wintergreen are surprisingly different from each other and from peppermint.  Spearmint is my favorite, closely followed by Cinnamon.  I like the Liquorish primarily for being so different from other flavors.<br /><br />Buying in bulk just saved a few cents vs. a local store price.  I bought in bulk because the multiple flavors are available and the packaging keeps it fresh a lot longer than it takes for me to finish them.

review/text: I just purchased some of these mints at the store. They don't have that great of a taste and they aren't strong at all until you bite into them, and then the mint flavor quickly disappears and doesn't leave your mouth minty in the least bit. I don't know where all these high reviews are coming from. They taste like cheap mints in my opinion. I've had better.

review/summary: Beats getting a DUI because of bad breath.
review/text: A friend of mine who also happens to be a Sheriff told me that if you drink and drive, the first thing the officer pulling you over will check your breath; if he senses the odor of liquor, wine, or beer, he then will have due cause to order you to perform roadside sobriety tests, etc. Many people mistakenly use Binaca spritz or other miniature mouth wash products -- but they all contain ALCOHOL and can actually increase your meter reading.<br /><br />He recommended that I keep a tin of Altoids in the car to at least get through the initial inspection by the officer. But if you're really drunk, no mint on earth can hide that fact.<br /><br />Since I find Altoids to be generally strong, almost too strong, I ultimately chose the Spearment flavor, as it actually tasts okay and leaves the breath smelling fresh but not overpowering.

review/text: This is the best true to taste mix for home made Shepherd's Pie. I've ordered this dish at many Irish Pub/Restaurants in NYC and find this mix comparable in taste. The Knorr "Mealmaker" seasoning packet, one pound of ground beef, 6-7 mashed potatoes and sauteed onions are all you need to create Shepherd's Pie that compares to restaurant fare. I add a small can of peas & carrots and an extra "shot" of ketchup to the mix from time to time; it works well for us!

review/summary: Good Halloween candy
review/text: You need to be careful of the source as the quality depends a lot on the shipper.  I usually order these by the mini-case.  Shippers will not guaratee against breakage if you order single boxes.  Mini-cases usually have special packing (I order from Bulk Foods and have never had trouble with breakage).  The better shippers will also ship with blue ice packs for an added charge (the blue ice packs can be reused).  Prices vary depending on the source.  Ordering by the mini-case, you can usually get a discounted price and free shipping, but you have to check around among the sources.<br /><br />The candy sticks themselves are the best variety that I have found.  The individual wrappers are all marked with the flavors.  Flavors are comparable with candy sticks from other manufacturers.  You can order specific flavors (orange, bubble gum, cotton candy, etc., depending on the source).  Orange is a good color for Halloween, or you can order red (cherry) and green (lime) for Christmas colors, or possibly the barber pole peppermint sticks.<br /><br />A mini-case may sound like a lot, but friends can combine orders.  Personally, I had about 400 trick or treaters last Halloween, and two sticks per child gives them a little variety and makes a good treat.  I ordered a mini-case of 12 boxes, gave one box to a merchant friend for her store, and had a few left for Christmas (they are colorful and can be used in stockings, gift bags, or added as ornaments to wrappings).

review/text: This product is normally sold at Target.  I have to admit that I tried these with trepidation.  Boy was I surprised at how terrific they were!  I really like dried apricots, but I love the ones that are chewy rather than dry.  These fruit strips taste just like the chewy ones I have loved since I was a kid without having to gnaw on the leathery ones.  I am a bit surprised at the price though...this is for one box??  If the price was for a pack of 4 boxes, then I would order these for sure.  As it is priced right now, I would rather just run to the Target down the street to purchase them.

How would potato chips do with this? Well, I am happy to say that these chips are tangy, they have a bite to them and it is actually a great flavor to try, if you haven't already. They are more savory than spicy.

The drink is made from splenda and plenty sweet, almost taste like a regular juice drink. One of the better tasting diet drinks out there as there are no funky after taste to this. I don't prefer this flavor as the as there is a strong acai berry taste to it. I hope Amazon starts selling the fruit punch version soon. The fruit punch version tastes like regular fruit punch but a diet version. I probably wont order this flavor again but no stores near where I live sells this. Other vendors sell this for close to $3 a bottle after shipping.

I am not a big cola person to begin with- so this was just right for me--no weird aftertaste that I can detect, and it does seem to fill me up and give me a boost during the day when I may be sagging and want to reach for a sweet, fattening snack! As to whether or not it has supported weight loss, that is hard to say. I am conscious of what I eat and have been reducing portions and increasing my physical activity- so that is where credit goes for dropping a few pounds, but I CAN say that the Celsius does seem to stave off the munchie cravings when they come along.<br />I never drink more than one a day, and it is usually in the afternoon. I have not had any ill effects from the caffeine. I do drink one or sometimes two cups of coffee fairly early in the morning, so by the time I have a can of Celsius I would imagine my morning caffeine is long gone.<br />This just happens to be the flavor I like the most-- you may not-- it isn't some kind of miracle elixir-but I enjoy the taste, the pick-me-up, and the fact that I don't grab a candy bar instead!

review/text: celsius is not for the faint of heart. It has 200 mgs of caffeine...I believe red bull has about 80. The wildberry is I think the best flavor, its vaguely like the taste of blueberry with other berry flavors mixed in to me, if you've had the berry flavored enviga I think the celsius is slightly better and more berry flavored than enviga's is. I can't comment on its calorie burning, but I know if I drink one of these I have enough energy to do a full workout that day.

review/summary: best energy drink i've found in a LOONG TIME
review/text: Celsius is the best energy drink that i've found so far.  i've tried a lot of them so far including monster, redbull, amp, FRS, 5 hour, etc.  this has the right ingredients that do not make you crash, has a good flavor (not chalky) and actually kept me alert for a few good hours.<br /><br />it speeds up your metabolism, hence the caloric burning..<br /><br />it doesn't give you a faster heart rate (not in my opinion), my blood pressure didn't spike, and i didn't have any jitters...<br /><br />just got the case of 24 (mixed berry flavor) and am 1/2 way through the case.  i am also considering investing in the company who makes them CSUH<br /><br />great job, great product...my hats off to them

review/summary: Good soda substitute
review/text: Began drinking Celcius as part of my Thrive Diet plan and as a substitute for drinking colas. There are different flavors but Wildberry is the best. I like the fizz. It also seems to give me energy which is probably the caffine in the drink but it is the only caffine that I use. I found I cannot drink it late in the day or it might keep me awake at night but it is a very refreshing drink. P.S. It also makes you burp great!!!

review/summary: Possibly effective, but sickening taste...try the orange soda
review/text: In general, I've liked the various Celsius flavors that I've tried, but this one in particular is pretty bad.  It's sickeningly sweet.<br /><br />I'm not convinced of the effectiveness of the Celsius, though after taking three a day for a month and a half while dieting, but not exercising, I did lose about 10 lbs.  Would I have done that without the Celsius?  Maybe.  My weight has plateued since I ran out and haven't yet re-ordered.<br /><br />The energy kick of this is pretty substantial.  Once you stop though, there's definitely a few days of sluggishness that I'm not sure I want to go through again, but I didn't notice any headaches or anything.<br /><br />I'm still debating buying more Celsius but I'm buying the orange soda, which is my favorite by far!

I bought 1 case each of berry, orange and coke and like them equally.  I had been getting up at 4:30 am to make myself walk a couple of miles on the treadmill but now I take one of these with me and by mile 2 I just don't want to quit walking.  I started this about 2 weeks ago and have lost 5 lbs so far, and that's even with partying in Reno for 3 days.<br /><br />I feel great, full of energy!  I'm up to 4 miles on the treadmill in about an hour. I will drink another celsius around lunch time and it keeps me going for the rest of the afternoon.  I highly recommend this drink.

review/summary: Tastes horrible
review/text: I never drink energy drinks since i don't really believe in them but tried the Wild Berry flavor because it was essentially given to me for free. Tastes atrocious. Kind of has a very "diet-y" flavor, mixed sith some sort of "pot-roast" flavor. As far as aftertaste goes, I guess there's no real "after" taste, but the "during" taste is bad enough. It did get me a little bit wired though, which you'd expect from an "energy drink" (and caffeine). All said and done, I personally wouldn't drink it again.<br /><br />More Reviews & Tips at GeekDrop.com

review/text: Thai curry paste with great flavor.  I like hot, but sometimes it overpowers the flavor of a curry.  This one I mix with coconut water (not milk) to keep calories low and simmer veggies and chickpeas in the sauce.  Instructions recommend adding oil - I just don't think it is needed.  I sometimes add extra garlic or chili depending on my mood. I have purchased this at an Asian Market for about $1 per can, however, where I live now the local Asian market doesn't carry it.

review/text: This is the absolute best organic milk chocolate bar I have had yet. It tasted very sweet, slightly creamy and had a really distinct Chai tea flavor. There were strong top notes of cinnamon and cardamon before fading back and revealing the secondary layer of mild ginger with tiny little gritty bits of the crystallized ginger at the end. All the flavors are very complimentary and not overpowering the smoothness of the chocolate.<br />I like to just let each piece melt in my mouth- it is so smooth and delicious! Very highly recommended!

So much better than non-organic chocolate.  You open the wrapper and the chocolate smells divine! The colour is a lovely dark chocolate brown.  And when you snap a piece off, it breaks off well.  Then, you put it in your mouth.  Oh my!  I need some more!  The best chocolate I have tasted - ever! Go on, just buy some!

review/text: I'm not a connoisseur of chocolate, but this flavor of Dagoba is fantastic.  Fine, crunchy Ginger and smooth, earthy chai are balanced nicely in a dark colored milk chocolate and leaves a nice aftertaste. I wouldn't say the bar is super sweet. Chocolate flavor is subtle hence it is only 37% cacao. I'm not a huge fan of chai tea, but I do enjoy it in this chocolate! I highly suggest Dagoba lavender blueberry if you are just trying this brand out. I'd definitely try one from a nearby health food store or what not first before buying a whole box. It's a taste either you like or don't like..

The chocolate was chalky, not at all smooth.  The flavor was absolutely horrendous!!  A expected a hint of ginger and chai.  The bar was so overpowered by the "hint" of flavors that it completely washed out any of the chocolate flavor.  I was so surprised by the nastiness of the bar.

review/text: I picked this chew because it has no ingredients that are unhealthy or irritate dogs with allergies.  I'm glad I did because i just saw the thing on the news about greenies maybe killing dogs because they dont break down and block up dog's digestive tracts.  I'd avoided other dog chews because the ingredient lists on them were full of chemicals i couldn't recognize.  The terrabone treats break down easily in water (so they will in my dog's stomach) and my dog just adores these treats.  I feel good because they arent high sugar or full of ingredients that would be bad for her teeth.  I havent ordered this treat yet from amazon but am glad to see I can because its very hard to find treats this perfect at local stores.

review/summary: Stale
review/text: There was a deal a while back to get 12 boxes of these taco shells for less than $8.  I got in on the deal, but feel it is money wasted.<br />Yes, I did receive 12 boxes for $8.<br /><br />I ordered these in Feb 2012 and when I received them they had a best buy date of May 2012.  Even still they were stale.  If you have ever used store bought taco shells like Ortega brand.  You know that the Ortega brand comes in a white plastic shell with a plastic cover that is vacuum sealed.  I've never had a problem with broke shells or stale tasting shells with Ortega.  With the Garden of Eatin shells, however, they are stale and a lot of shells are broken.  I attribute this factor to the fact that the shells are not vacuum sealed, and there is no protection of the shells.  The taco shells are sealed inside a light plastic bag that does not even appear to be vacuum sealed-or has lost its seal.  Then they are then placed inside the box, giving lots of room to move, which, I believe, is the cause of the high amount of broken shells.<br /><br />I dont recommend these taco shells.

review/text: These are light with a great flavor--perfect for the salad tacos I plan to make from my garden this summer. I've only opened one box, and the top shell was split at the bottom (no problem--I'll use it as a salsa scoop). The rest were intact. I assume the other boxes will be about the same.<br /><br />One caveat: because of their lightness, I'd probably NOT want to use these shells for heavy taco meat, although they're fine for the vegetarian tacos (using rice, lentils, and mushrooms) that I make.<br /><br />To the reviewer whose husband thought 144 tacos were a bit much, serve salad in them. They'll go fast!

review/summary: Great cake mix flavor base!!
review/text: The Duncan Hines Caramel Cake Mix is AWESOME as a base for cakes.  From this one cake mix alone I have created two custom recipes that in my opinion enhance the flavor of the mix and the ingredients combined.  I have made these two cakes a number of times and no one has been able to tell the cakes are made from a cake mix.<br /><br />First cake - Bananas Foster Cake; essentially I layer the bottom of a 9"x13" pan with sliced ripe bananas, create a caramel sauce (think almost as thick as caramel corn sauce) with dark rum on the stove and pour on top the bananas.  Then I mix up the cake mix per the directions on the box adding 1/3 cup more brown sugar plus 2 mashed bananas and a little extra baking soda for lift.  Pour the cake batter on top of the bananas and caramel.  Before I place into an oven I toast and chop pecans and sprinkle on top again.  Bake for about an hour and it is the most exquisite flavor.  The cake mix truly helps cut time and ensures the cake is moist and consistently made each and every time.<br /><br />Second cake - Apple Cake.  Again I make a thinner caramel sauce on the stove (think a caramel flavored sauce, so it wouldn't harden right away) using evaporated milk, butter, and brown sugar.  I peel, core, and dice 2 granny smith apples and let them pre-cook on low in the caramel sauce while I prepare the cake mix per the directions on the box (adding apple pie spice as well!).  I fold in the caramel-apple mixture INTO the cake mix and bake again in a 9"x13" prepared pan for about 40 minutes.  While the cake is cooking I have made a caramel drizzle or just a simple sour cream glaze for the top.  Again, the cake mix has not failed me here either!<br /><br />You think why not use yellow cake mix or white or something else?  I have tried, but the flavor of the caramel cake mix really does add that needed background boost for the fruit without necessarily creating the almost too sweet sensation that white cake mix instills.  I enjoy cakes that aren't necessarily chocolate or cream cheese flavored heavy and the caramel is AWESOME.  I would recommend this mix for anyone who enjoys doctoring up cake mixes like I do.<br /><br />As for the cake flavor alone without any add-ins, it is a little dry (again you are listening to someone who usually enjoys fruit in or with cake), but the flavor is still awesome and not too sweet.  It is a lighter flavor so if you are thinking ooey-gooey caramel you have the wrong mix.  If making the cake straight from the box, I would recommend serving it warm with a mug of strong tea, and also a dallop of your favorite cream (whether cool whip, homemade, or even ice cream).  Maybe rum raisin ice cream? :)

review/text: Don't know about you folks, but around here cake mixes normally retail for about $1.25 per box.  On sale I routinely stock up for about $1 per box.  I came on amazon and looked this particular flavor up cause my local stores for some reason quit carrying it, and it one of my favorites.  Always loved caramel anything, and this cake mix makes a very tasty cake.  I will offer this advice to anyone who does buy it, Instead of oil as the box suggests, this cakes flavor really benefits if you replace the oil with a stick of margarine. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because Amazon is insane if they think i'm going to pay that much for a cake mix.

review/text: We looked in all the stores in our area for the Caramel cake mix and nobody had it. Finally we saw that a third party was selling this case of 6 boxes for $6/box, including shipping. We passed. Then I stumbled across this page: $15/case ($3/box) and free shipping. We got it.<br /><br />The other review saying that they were out of date made me nervous, but when we got ours, they had a year to go on them, and we used half of them the first few weeks by popular demand from friends.<br /><br />Right after we got these, a friend called to say that she saw them in a store a few blocks from our house! We went to check on them and they were 6 months past the use-by date! We went to another store in the same chain and they had some unexpired ones in stock for about what we paid here.<br /><br />Anyway -- GREAT CAKE. My wife got a wonderful caramel icing recipe off the Web, but you can get canned caramel icing if you want the easy way.

None of cereal within was crushed, smashed, or broken in any way.<br /><br />I ordered the cereal in late October and was worried if the cereal would become stale/old by the time it reached me (some other people had said that their cereal was bad when the bought it from Amazon) but when it arrived, I saw that the "best if used by" date said it expired in 2011. The cereal tasted so good that I actually ate an entire box the same day it arrived...<br /><br />But yeah...Overall, everything came out better than expected. I suggest you buy this, especially when it is around 8 to 9 dollars (sometimes they sell it for thirty which is totally ridiculous).

review/text: We have someone in our house that likes these as a treat so i ordered them with subscribe and save, They arrived in perfect shape and over a year left before they expire. Very pleased to get them at such a low cost.
