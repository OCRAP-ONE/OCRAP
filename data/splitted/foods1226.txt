review/summary: Health Food for Dogs
review/text: I have an 8 yr old yorkshire terrier that has had problems digesting other foods.  Most of the store bought foods made him ill and he could not even tolerate Science Diet.  The vet recommended Canidae, telling me that it was the only food he feds his dogs.  Fortunately, there was a pet store in my neighborhood that carried the product.<br /><br />My dog started on Canidae when he was less than 1 yr old and the digestion problems disappeared. (I'm attributing that to the lack of corn and soy fillers, along with the addition of digestive enzymes in the food).  Recently, I moved to the east coast and Canidae is not available in local pet stores.  I put my pet on Iams and the digestive problems have resurfaced.  Blood tests now show that he has abnormal liver levels (but not cancer).  I am now giving him an antioxidant and vitamin e daily, as prescribed by his new vet.  I spoke to her about Canidae, which also has vitamin E in the formula.<br /><br />I truly believe that the nutrients in Canidae helped keep my dog healthy and I am switching him back.  Canidae is a wonderful product and my dog loves the taste.

review/summary: It's Sugar, In the Form of a Cube
review/text: You may think, "Wow, this tastes just like real sugar." Well, don't be surprised...it is. Using the magic of modern day manufacturing, they've taken common sugar, and turned it in to a cube. A cube made of fairly large sugar granules, bound together by sugar. You can put it in tea, coffee, your mouth, recipes, and pour cold water over it into your favorite absinthe. One box is enough for a lot of absinthe (which has been legal again in the US since 2007,) but if I ever finish the box, you can bet, I'll be buying more.

review/text: We fed this food to both of our cats after we got them from the breeder.  One 3.5 lb lasted about a month and a half.  I love the research this company has done.  I will be with them for a lifetime, and we are already looking at dog food with them too.  The cats' coats already started to get softer within the month.  After that babycat period, I put them on the kitten formula.

review/text: I started feeding this to Jack when he was a baby (we acquired him from a neighbor when he was still too young to leave his mama) he switched to this from being bottle fed. He loved it then and now as a 2 year old neutered male "fur baby" he will eat nothing else.  If I run out of this he will suffer while the other cats in our household eat other food. I finally have to break down and either rush order more or drive 40 miles one way to the nearest store that carries the product!

review/summary: Great Food For Newborn Kittens
review/text: I had to foster some very young kittens about 4 weeks of age and someone recommended BabyCat 34. It is perfect because of the tiny (chicklet size) kibble. My kittens were getting pretty tired of it by the time we switched to Kitten 36. I mixed canned cat food in it to get them to eat it.<br /><br />One great thing about it my kittens coats are shiny and very soft.

review/summary: Babycat  34 is in excellent product
review/text: I am feeding five kittens at present and offered them three different kitten foods and they prefer this. They are presently five weeks old and the babycat34 is an excellent and well thought out product. The kibble is tiny (much smaller than any of the others I've seen) and just perfect as a starting dry food....they can eat it much more easily. If you want to start young kittens on dry food this is the stuff. It is aimed at kittens age 1-4 months and is very age targeted. It is really really great that a company has focused on such a narrow (but vital) need in this age of mass marketing.

review/summary: I returned this!
review/text: althought the dimensions are clearly written out, I expected something different - my fault.  I had expected soemthing a little larger, large enough to hold my homemade loaves of bread; this would have been both too small to hold a loaf and too short to fold the top over to close.  I also expected something that would keep the bread fresh, like maybe a plastic lining, which this did not have.  Had I been looking for a bread basket, something to sit on the table and hold rolls or buns or short loaves of bread, this might have done the trick.  as it was, I returned the item; not through any fault or defect, it just wasn't something i thought I would find useful, after all.

review/summary: Worth the money
review/text: I don't normally write reviews but figured I'd give it a shot since no one else had.<br /><br />I have a Shepherd puppy (one year) who has a serious desire to chew. I was buying her those raw hide chews, the largest ones I could find but she was going through one a day and it was getting very expensive so I figured I'd give these bones a shot.<br /><br />I bought two brands this Redbarn and the more expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000633NXM">Smokehouse USA 100% Natural Meaty Mammoth Bone</a> also sold by Amazon.  The RedBarn was $8.37 the Smokehouse 11.99.  The Smokehouse was a little bit larger and had more crud/meat/fat on it so I thought she would like it better but she totally lost interest the more expensive Smokehouse bone and continues to work on the Redbarn daily.  I see the price of the Redbarn has also dropped to the $6 range now.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.

review/text: We have a lab mix that was feral for about a year before we found him. He loves to chew, so I bought him this bone as a treat since regular raw hides don't last. He seems pleased with it so far. However, it also seems to make him very thirsty. He gnaws on it for a little bit, runs to get some water, then comes running back to the bone. We are pleased with it so far.

review/text: I also pretty much never write reviews but felt compelled to do so for these as they ahve been wonderful. I have 2 Lab puppies that are now 9 months old. We were having big issues with the two of them getting into trouble chewing rugs, wood work, furniture and so forth especially when they were alone. I first got these when they were 6 months old and it completely stopped them chewing anything else.  Each bone has lasted over 2 months so far. This is with 2 puppies chewing them each and every day for hours on end. Only once or twice were they able to break off a piece big enough to be any concern and even then there was no problem.<br />I am ordering more now!

review/text: I purchased the 4 oz size, and it arrived with a few sample packs of other salts as well. This stuff tastes very good, and is hot, although in my opinion, it wont kill you like other ghost pepper oriented products might. I've been using it on eggs and also threw some in with my beer when making brats the other day. Both have been excellent uses. I would say use it sparingly, especially if you are sensitive to heat, but the flavor is good and the extra kick is nice. A definite winner IMO.

review/summary: Very impressed
review/text: I ordered a one pound package for my Dad this Christmas, so I can't really comment on the flavor yet, though my Dad has liked pepper flavored salt before.  However, I was very impressed with the speed with which The Spice Labe sent it.  I was also expecting to get a sigle large box or bag, like you'd see on a store shelf.  Instead, the salt came in eight 2oz. vacuum sealed, durable plastic bags, so I know that the salt will maintain its freshness no matter how long it takes for my Dad to get through it.  Very nice.  Also, they included several differnt little sample packets so I could try some of their different flavors of salt without having to order tons of it.  My package included a sampler of himalayan sea salt (larger chunks), french grey salt, himalayan salt (with crystals sized like table salt, hickory smoke salt, and haba&ntilde;ero salt.  Very cool.  I will be getting more stuff from them.<br /><br />ADDENDUM 12/26:  About flavor:  my Dad says this salt tastes better than other ghost pepper salt he's tried.  He attributes it to both a better product and better packaging (see my above comments).

review/summary: Single best seasoning
review/text: This is easily the best seasoning in my kitchen. You can add it to almost any dish. I'm a very good cook, with a very diverse repertoire, but one of my mom's recipes, a little Lawry's, brings me home. A quick recipe, slice french bread, butter it then season generously. Wrap in aluminum foil, bake at 375 for 25 minutes.

review/summary: Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts
review/text: I was disappointed with the variety pack and should have ordered the honey roasted or dry roasted macs. The chocolate covered macs have so much chocolate that I could not taste the macs, the kona flavored ones were bitter, and the onion and garlic ones were too salty. I love the flavor of macadamia nuts and was disappointed that it was overwhelmed by low quality ingredients.  Definitely not worth the price!

review/summary: THIS SAUCE IS GOOD!
review/text: My husband and I found this sauce in a bin that was for marked down items.  Now that may not sound like a good thing, but I am glad that we purchased it!  We usually make our own, or if we buy a bad batch, instead of tossing it, we take it, and tweak it to perfection. I am always searching for a good sauce on those lazy days where I don't have to make my own.  In the case of this Hoosier Daddy Sweet & Sassy, we were very surprised!  THIS SAUCE IS GOOD!  It was a lazy Saturday, so I made Sloppy Joe's and curly fries!  We put this sauce on the Joe's....it made the sandwich POP!!!  Me being originally from the South (no one can make BBQ like the people from the South IMHO), and now residing in the Midwest, I was very pleased with the flavor of this sauce.  They had this flavor and another called DEATH HOT that were left in the bin.  We went back and purchased them!  I have not tasted the DEATH HOT, but the SWEET & SASSY is the bomb!  If you enjoy a nice, tangy, sweet sauce (not too sweet, but just enough to make it on point!!!), then this is the sauce for you or as a gift!  I don't think you will be disappointed.

review/text: Been searching for great nougat ever since Callard & Bowser stopped making theirs.  This nougat is very impressive - best I have had!  Price on Amazon is the best.  We but the six pack and we slice up the bars as we need to eat.  The nougat is wrapped tightly in foil so it stays fresh - though it doesn't last long in our house!  The pistachio flavor is my favorite - unique but not overpowering with large pistachios in the nougat.

review/summary: Heavenly soft nougat
review/text: We first discovered this item in a shop in Atlantic City, NJ but only bought one, not knowing how good it is, which we only learned after returning home. Even though my wife and I did our best to ration the single bar we bought, it was done inside of a week and we were left with nothing but an empty wrapper and the memory of the most delicious, sumptuous candy with the perfectly sweetened soft nougat scattered with healthy dose of whole pistachios.<br /><br />Inside the outer paper wrapping, each bar is sealed in foil packaging to maintain the delicate softness of the nougat. These are best when you just open them, but are still plenty soft the next day, but I woudn't recommend leaving them exposed to the air for much longer as the nougat will stiffen.<br /><br />After devouring our only bar, we hunted for more at every local shop, Italian or otherwise, to no avail. That's when we found a supplier on Amazon who, after some trouble with shipping, mailed us a box of 6 of these babies almost 3 weeks later. These were well worth the wait and were exactly as we remembered our first bar.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend these bars more! Get them soon, but please leave enough for us!

review/text: We LOVE this Gingergizer and ordered it regularly, but the last shipment we got had something wrong with it...the color was lighter than usual, but we opened a bottle anyway and drank some and the taste was totally different and very unpleasant.  To be certain it wasn't just that one bottle that was contaminated, we opened a second bottle, but it was rancid too.  Since grocery items cannot be returned, I guess we are just out the $20+ cost.  I'd like to keep ordering it and would do so if I knew this one contaminated shipment was a fluke; we had ordered it many times before -- at least 6 or 7 cases, and never had a problem so I don't know what happened.

After the local store failed to restock several years ago, we began buying it on-line.  It has whole cherries in a thick base and a lovely, almost-tart taste that goes great with biscuits.  If you prefer your preserves to taste more like fruit and less like sugar and/or corn syrup, you need to try the Black Cherry Preserves. Not low-calorie, but a little goes a long way.

I grew up loving ginger snaps and when our go-to brand was no longer available at our grocery store, we gave these a try. Needless to say, I soon stopped eating ginger snaps. They are hard as rocks out of the box, yet when they get stale you can bend them almost in half before they fall apart. Stay away. I just picked up a different brand after all these years and now I'm reminded what I've been missing.

review/summary: A Matcha A Day Keeps The Doctor Away
review/text: So I am mightly impressed with matcha. For a few weeks now, I've been having a cup almost daily, and I have to say I'm seeing benefits. I don't know if it can all be blamed on the matcha, but the matcha is the only real change I've made recently. When a tea company makes claims about the healthiness of their teas and how this tea will make you skinny or that tea will calm your anger, I tend to just laugh it off. Just another marketing ploy, I mean, really, it's just tea. It's delicious and better for you than soda (if you don't weigh it down with tons of sugar and cream like I used to do), but it's still just tea, not some magic potion that's going to solve all of your problems.<br /><br />Well. Since matcha came into my life, I'm more alert (obviously) and my system seems...cleaner. I don't feel bogged down by the terrible foods I sometimes indulge in, and somehow my system seems less responsive to my dairy allergy. Don't get me wrong, it still makes me sick, but it's not the gut-wrenching "I'm gonna die" feeling I'm used to, it's more of a "Oh man, I forgot and ate dairy again". On the whole, I just feel healthier. Which is awesome. Everyone can afford to feel a little bit healthier, am I right?<br /><br />Anyway, this tea smells amazing. Like juicy Granny Smith apples, sweet and tart all at the same time. I want to dip this tea in caramel. The flavor is perfect. It's exactly what I expected this tea to taste like. It's very juicy, my mouth is watering after every sip, and it's tart without being stomach-turning sour. I am having a really hard time not adding some of my Red Leaf Tea Caramel matcha to this. They're just begging to be blended. In college, I was big fan of the Caramel Apple shot, which is basically one part sour apple Pucker to one part butterscotch Schnapps. This seems like a good alternative for me to take to work and not get fired! Though now I'm wondering about matcha cocktails...<br /><br />I love these matchas that are encouraging me to mix and match, play with different blends, bake...I love it! I wish I had the time to just lock myself in my kitchen with my matchas and experiment to my little heart's content.

review/text: I appreciate the service and quality of the company and the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFNCYE">Gourmet Organic Biscuits Carrot Crunch</a> product.<br /><br />We had just found out that our 15 year old standard poodle had terminal cancer.  The local chain pet store were insensitive about calling us back to answer our question about if they even had the product.  Three people gave me three different answers.  The 800 national number didn't listen to me because all they did was connect me to the same store where I wasn't getting any assistance.<br /><br />Dealing with the emotions of a dying dog shouldn't include people "in the field" providing poor customer service.<br /><br />I so appreciate Amazon and the ability to find what I need and receive excellent customer service.  This company was courteous, prompt and sent a fresh, quality product.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />You made my dog's final days more enjoyable.  I so appreciate the help.

review/summary: The best have-on-hand-always snack ever!
review/text: I'm so happy I found these pretzels after years of hoping Nabisco's Mr.Salty Veri-thin stick pretzels would return! I bought almost all the store had as it was a temporary item. The Stickletti pretzel is thin, with just enough salt. I keep a tray available for those times I want a little salty crunch without lots of fat. I eat them when my stomach is a little queasy to settle it. Sometimes I splurge and have some soft cream cheese or dip with them. I wish you could find them everywhere. I'd always have some on hand. They are that good!

review/summary: Heavenly butterscotch
review/text: I'll start with the good.  This flavor made me want to "swallow my tongue".  I mixed a few drops in my bowl of vanilla ice cream.  It took that bowl of vanilla to a higher level of bliss.  The very next time I ate vanilla ice cream I used the 'other half' of the bottle.  That's right, two doses and my butterscotch goodies were all gone.  That brings me to my only complaint--1 dram is way too tiny,<br />at $1.99 + $.99 for shipping and handling.  The manufacturer should think about a larger quantity.  I have therefore gone to another website and ordered a 2oz. bottle.  Oh, yes,  there is one other plus-- this is a flavoring and not a syrup.  So you get flavor minus the extra sugar.

review/text: I am so happy that Ener G Foods makes this bread since I need one that is wheat free, yeast free, gluten and dairy free. Downside is it has to be in a vacuum packed container and gets hard and crumbly within a week of opening the package, even if it is stored in a vacuum packed container. The taste is wonderful and the slices are light.

review/text: I purchased these for social studies simulation (on the caste system) that involved my students going through certain tasks.  I would pay them with these chocolate coins based on their caste and completion of the task.<br /><br />My students, aged 15-17 and mostly boys, worked so hard for these coins - little chocolate coins!!!  I was absolutely surprised.  They became very competitive over these and really loved them.<br /><br />I would definitely order these again - they were a much better value than I found in the party outlet stores, AND I was able to get the quantity I wanted.<br /><br />The chocolate itself was OK - nothing outstanding, but still a decent quality for the price.

But it is kind of expensive (it's about 1/2 the size of an average small bag of beef jerky.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the "no preservatives, no nitrates" claim is worth the money, but at least I'm not less worried to let my 5 year old indulge on it.

review/text: I like this stuff a who lot, the tenderest pieces, no visible fat or gristle, only visible spice- black pepper, sea salt, sugar; I have never gotten visible "lift" or "buzz"  off the guarana- (I buy the style that has no caffeine.) However, I do not eat this with any caffeine laden soft drinks or energy drinks- just plain old water. If you like red bull, that may be too much energy products and you may want to consider that.<br /><br />Compared to the regular mass market natural style jerky, its fantastic. I pay about 5-6 Dollars per 2 ounce bag at Target, so the price is commensurate.

review/summary: 1-oz not great
review/text: I was disappointed with these 1oz bags.  Before making this purchase, I had bought this jerky at a local store and loved the flavor and texture.  I havent seen it in stores again so I thought to order these on Amazon to take to work for lunch.  I had previously only bought bigger sized bags which I think is the way to go.  These 1oz bags didnt have significant jerky pieces, it was like they took just shreds or crumbs and stuck them in here.  I didnt find it very satisfying.  While the flavor continues to be excellent, the pieces were so tiny they didnt feel like you were getting much for a product that is not inexpensive.

review/text: My 11 yr old terrier lives to walk & play.  Several months ago, she stopped playing and refused to walk except to go out & take care of business.  She seemed to be in pain & could not jump up at all either.  The Vet couldn't say for sure what was wrong with her without taking all kinds of tests, but said she appeared to be having joint pain and was probably developing arthritis.  The salesperson in Pet Nutrition recommenced Happy Hips.  Within 2-3 weeks she was like a puppy again. I ordered several online since Pet Nutrition was out of stock my last visit.  I cut up 1/2 a treat and mix it with her food 2X a day.
