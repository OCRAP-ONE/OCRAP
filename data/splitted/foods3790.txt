review/summary: Why Starbucks..Do you need to be seen there??
review/text: Never could understand the fuss over Starbucks. Overpriced by most opinions and now the money could be better used for gas. Buy a Senseo Machine. Simple latte with great flavor from the Senseo pods..foam and all..Coffee from Belgium..beats all including Gevalia which is a rip off at more than 15.00 a pound? Senseo comes out to about .50 cents or less per 8oz serving. Only Dunkin Donuts Turbo might be as good, but again expensive. Buy some paper cups with lock lids and take it with you in the car. Some of you are spending more than $1300.00 a year on Starbucks. Forget about it. The Senseo machine can be found for half price (35.00) at some sites (NIB) and if you subscribe to the Amazon pod subscription, you will not find the Douwe Egberts pods cheaper anywhere. Makes great ice coffee, using the dark roast pods and the shaker with ice method...vietnamese style with sweet condensed milk...can't be beat...Decaf pods are medium roasted and perfect for the nightly ice coffee late in the evening. Try it. A Starbucks is a gallon of gas sometimes. Don't cry poor mouth while downing an ultra lite soy caramel grande something or other for 5.00 at Starbucks or do you need to be seen there and the coffee is of no importance. The medium roast is perfection but the dark for strong coffee lovers is strong and just below the bitter line where it should be. Brew a 4 or 8 ounce serving and drink it ASAP at the perfect temperature. If you are taking it with you, nuke it for less than 12 seconds on high. I use half n half...use what you like. I don't add flavors, liquid or powder..Coffee is the flavor I am looking for and it is in there naturally. Flavors syrups belong on ice cream or waffles, not in coffee. Just try it..You can even add scalded milk if you like. Remember scalded is below boiling. Keep the stir going until you see tiny bubbles.ok enough.

review/summary: Decaf Senseo Coffee Pods
review/text: I tested 7 other brands of decaf pods, some twice as expensive, but found the Senseo to be so rich in flavor. Some of the others were weak in comparison. Senseo ranked as high on my grading scale as one or two of the others, and at significantly lower price - definitely a good value. I need look no further. "I'm a happy camper."

review/summary: The advantage of subscription ordering
review/text: I'm not going to talk about the quality of the coffee; after all, that's an entirely subjective opinion that's impossible to form from reading reviews.  (For the record, I like Senseo coffee, including this medium roast decaf variety.)  However, if you decide to buy this, you should definitely consider signing up for the subscription service.  Here's why:<br /><br />First, the price is discounted 15% from the regular Amazon price, and the shipping is free, even if the order doesn't meet the normal $25 threshold.  In my area, I almost never see Senseo pods in stores for less than $4.50, even on sale, so the subscription-discounted Amazon price represents a significant saving.<br /><br />Second, you can adjust (or cancel) your subscription at any time-- even after only one shipment.  When you sign up, you'll get an e-mail explaining where to look on your account page for the subscription options.<br /><br />So, at an interval of your choosing, a package of coffee pods will arrive, discounted 15% than the normal Amazon price in effect at that time and shipped for free.  Your credit card won't be charged until each shipment date, and you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />Life is good.

review/summary: Great coffee - great system
review/text: Senseo makes it easy to have a very flavorful cup of coffee, as close to a latte as you can get without steaming the milk, in about 2 minutes.  This is a great device and the coffe I have used from Senseo has been very flavorful and quite good.  I usually use only one pod but make two cups - tends to keep it strong enough and flavorful enough without having to use two pods - and they last twice as long.  Can't go wrong with their coffee.

review/summary: Senseo Coffe Pods
review/text: This is one coffee brand where the decaf is even more flavorful than the regular. We get outstanding mugs of coffee when we use one decaf and one medium roast pod in our Senseo coffee maker. After years of using every imaginable brewer -- Chemex, French filtre, Capresso, etc. -- we just love the little blue Senseo and its ability to give us wonderful coffee one cup at a time. Our guests at dinner parties love it too, since they can each have whatever kind of coffee they choose without adding much extra time for everyone to be served.

review/summary: Great machine, lousy coffee
review/text: On a recent trip to Holland I had the opportunity to experience<br />your excellent Senseo coffee.  I liked it so much that upon my return to<br />Seattle I immediately checked for the machine's availability in the<br />United States and was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com.  Last week I<br />bought the Senseo machine along with four boxes of medium roast<br />decaffeinated pods.  I also received one package of regular medium roast<br />and one package of mild roast with the Senseo machine. <p> To my horror all of the coffee I received is a very poor<br />substitute of the Douwe Egberts coffee I enjoyed so much in Holland.<br />The coffee that was delivered to me is weak and tasteless.  In fact, to<br />get halfway decent coffee I have to use two pods for one four-ounce cup.<br />This is unacceptable not only from the point of view of expense, it also<br />limits the use of the machine to one four-ounce serving at the time.  <p> I request that you provide Senseo coffee machine users here with<br />the same quality coffee you sell in Holland (at $16.99 for a four-pack<br />of pods it is more than twice as expensive here, which I'm willing to<br />pay only if the coffee is of the same superior quality).  Starbucks is a<br />huge success in this country because it sells real coffee, not some<br />watered-down version of the real thing.<p> Until I receive quality coffee to substitute for the poor coffee<br />I now have, I will tell my friends, neighbors, colleagues and anybody<br />else who might be interested not to invest in the Senseo machine.  In<br />the meantime I would be happy to return the coffee to you because I have<br />no use for it.  Please let me know when and how you expect to remedy<br />this situation.  If I do not hear from you within a week or so I will<br />return the Senseo machine and the remaining unused portion of the coffee<br />to Amazon.com for a full refund.<p> I look forward to hearing from you.

review/summary: NOT for introductory food
review/text: The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.<br /><br />While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job.

I was very disappointed and frustrated when all 5 of our local stores stopped carrying these. So happy I found them here for my baby! The ppl here who complain about tuna oil added are dumb (no pun intended). They help with baby brain development.  It's not super easy to find the organic baby foods you want with DHA added in them (ellas kitchen, plum organic, etc don't have DHA) -- go buy those and quit whining about tuna oil added to The gerber organic green beans bc it's probably folks like you who complained to the stores that make it very difficult for many parents like me to FIND this food in stores! And if the complaining persists, gerber may stop making it all together and babies who love this product will suffer! Gerber, don't stop making these! I would give it 6 stars if I could!<br /><br />I bought 48 containers of gerber organic green beans from Amazon and can't wait to see the smile on her face when we eat  these again (she has been w/o these for 3 mo),

review/summary: Hard to find
review/text: I used to enjoy Joyva Halva when I was a kid. We had neighbors that always seemed to have food that I'd never heard of. Well they had halva and I really liked it. Years later , I saw it in the grocery store I work for and bought it for a snack occasionally. Then it was gone and I forgot about it again. A co- worker and I were talking about exotic foods one day and he brought up "Turkish Delight". That reminded me of halva and I tried to describe it. The best way was to get some so I found it at Amazon. Well, it was as yummy as I remembered. I gave several of the bars away to people who had never had them.The ones I received were huge! My only complaint is that now the nutritional info is on the wrapper and the darn things have 680 calories per bar!! Oh, well.

review/text: This Halvah is made from sweetened sesame seed paste. It is crumbly, moist, and delicious! I like both the marble halvah as well as the chocolate covered. They are both so tasty!<br /><br />The sesame seeds have quite a good bit of nutrition in them. It is not as good for a person as a piece of fruit, but it is better for a person than most other candy bars that are just empty calories.<br /><br />Try it. You'll like it!

review/text: I moved to the south 17 years ago from Los Angeles and missed having Halvah bars. The contents of ground sesame covered with chocolate may not sound good but it is worth trying. One recommendation I have is do not order chocolate covered during the summer because the chocolate will melt. You can freeze them and use them later.

review/summary: Tasty but is it safe?
review/text: This stuff taste so freakn' good...if you like vanilla.  It says it contains organic vanilla flavor.  I'm not exactly sure what that is.  If it was vanilla it would say organic vanilla.  Not flavor.  I'm a bit suspicious of that.  You have to watch it with the certified organic stuff, a lot of it isn't 100% organic & you are being robbed.<br />My package arrived damaged.  Seems the packer simply chucked the case of this inside another larger box & the smaller box bounced & slid around inside the larger box causing my bottles to leak.  Thankfully Amazon refunded my money.<br />Lastly, I've been looking into Agave & it may not be the safe healthy sweetener we've been lead to believe.  I am now doing my best to avoid it.  I have discovered that it is in darn near everything organic and Vegan.  Agave is highly processed to get the syrup.  Which is fructose.  It may not be safe for diabetics at all!  It is highly concentrated sweet stuff.  You can't just get syrup out of the plant.  It takes a massive process to get it.  I'm sure I'm screwing up the details a bit.  Go ahead and google it before you buy.  You might be glad you did.  I googled it because I noticed I had increased digestive problems after consuming yuccon syrup and agave.  If you are on the SCDiet agave is forbidden.

review/text: For all the trouble to take Metamucil, for its fiber content, the gram fiber count "ain't" much; 5 grams.  Fiber one is a crunchy, flavorful, bran tasty, cereal which, in  4 oz gives one 14 grams of fiber.  One cup of Fiber One equals 28 grams of fiber.  When I stop to think of the ordeal involved taking Metamucil for 5 grams of fiber, though ignorant of the existence of Fiber One, and its 14-28 grams of fiber, I could commit Hari Kari!  The cereal is as tasty as ones favorite cereal, a pleasant surprise, and by adding a pear to this morning cereal one hits the 30+ grams recommended by the medics.<br /><br />All hail to Fiber One; wouldst I had known about it sooner!  Fiber One is worth the price of admission!  All hail to Fiber One, the greatest product since sliced whole wheat bread!!!

review/text: By the end of a breakfast with Fiber One and some fruit, you could have already met 70-75% of your fiber needs for the day. (Fiber One by itself provides 57%.) It's 14 grams of fiber per 30-gram serving is 40% more than Kellogg's All Bran. Unlike some high-fiber cereals, this one (the "original" Fiber One) contains no sugar, but derives its sweetness from Aspertame. As far as I'm concerned, it's the tastiest high-fiber cereal on the market.

review/summary: GET YOUR FIBER (ONE) !
review/text: A healthy diet is important to me so eating whole grains and fiber is a priority. Of course, like a lot of people, my morning routine is usually scheduled with me spending as little time as possible on each chore.<br /><br />Problems: I want fiber and whole grains. I'm rushed in the morning.<br /><br />Solution: Fiber One.<br /><br />Fiber One is a whole grain, high fiber cereal that contains 14 grams of fiber per serving (60% of the daily value), 0 grams of sugar and just 60 calories.<br /><br />The taste of Fiber One is just fine, but I usually like a little more variety, so I use it half and half with my other cereal. I fill the bottom of my cereal bowl with Fiber One, then layer in my usual whole grain, high vitamin and antioxidant cereal. Just pour in some low-fat milk, and it's ready. With a glass of orange juice and a slice of 100% whole wheat toast, it makes for a tasty and healthy start to my stress-filled and difficult day!

review/summary: a Wagonload of Fiber and crunchy-good
review/text: I bought Fiber One cereal a couple days ago because (1) it was on sale at CVS; (2) I love the Fiber One bars, especially the Oats & Chocolate ("Fart Bars" at our house); and (3) I remembered the old Kellogg's All-Bran Cereal, whose tagline should be "Sticks to Mush in 30 Seconds," and wondered if Fiber One was better.<br /><br />Boy, is it ever better!  No surprise, since the top ingredient is corn bran (Anybody remember Crunchy Corn Bran cereal?  That was truly Da Bomb and I don't know if it's even made anymore), which packs a long-lasting crunch and gets you away from that ol' funky wheat bran "good-for-you" insta-mush thing.<br /><br />I do find it amusing that the cereal's size and shape (like a bacillum bacterium, a stretched-out Good & Plenty) is almost exactly the same as the food our youngest son feeds his newt.  "Human Super-Poo Sticks" doesn't have quite the same ring to it, but make no mistake - this stuff will clean your clock.

review/summary: Fiber One + Activia
review/text: Diverticuli and lactose intolerance resulted in this cocktail:<br /><br />1 cup Fiber One = 28g fiber( I call them rabbit turds)<br />1 cup serving of Activia Yogurt<br /><br />Stir both until all Fiber One is coated evenly in whatever random flavor Activia yogurt you happened to grab today. Shovel it in. Now you are done with your fiber for the day, and you can eat whatever you want the rest of the day. The yogurt also has the good bacteria which aids digestion. The flavored yogurt makes it interesting, and the Fiber One provides a granola-like crunch. Rather than look to the cereal itself for flavor and get less fiber with brands that offer maybe 10-15g per cup, you instead go for texture with the fiber and flavor with the yogurt and get much higher daily fiber. I'll probably be doing this daily combo for the rest of my life. My dad has hundreds of diverticuli and is 75yrs old, and has had zero issues with diverticulitis owing directly to his high fiber diet. The doctor cringes every time he looks at his colonoscopy.

review/text: I never liked fiber cereals when I was younger but now that I'm a bit older I need more fiber to stay regular, so I tried Fiber One & it tastes wonderful! It has a nice texture & flavor, stays crispy in yogurt or milk. It doesn't bother me that it's lightly sweetened with aspartame (though I can understand the ppl who are bothered by this), but it would have been better to leave it natural & unsweetened (or maybe lightly sweetened with stevia). But at least I'm glad it's not loaded with sugar or high fructose corn syrup like so many other supermarket-shelf cereals (including all other fiber cereals, both supermarket brands & organic healthfood store brands...shame on them!).<br /><br />High fiber content & pleasingly moderate in it's carb content (compared to most cereals, I consider this one low-carb). This tastes great in yogurt or even sprinkled on fruit salad.

review/text: Fiber One with milk is good.  Add thawed or fresh fruit and it's even better.  Try it with nonfat probiotic yogurt and fruit: perhaps a little artificial sweetener and you have a great breakfast or snack.  I like using nonfat plain yogurt and adding fruit and spices(cinnamon, anyone?).  All the flavored yogurts have sugar (empty calories) added.  There's no better way to get your fiber!

review/summary: I LOST 100 LBS WITH FIBER ONE SMOOTHIES!
review/text: I've battled with my weight since high school. I'm 50-something now and finally found a way to lose weight without feeling deprived, thanks to my Tribest Blender and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6GFZI">Fiber One Bran Cereal, 16.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>!<br /><br />I had reached an all-time high with my weight - 220lbs plus. I can't say for sure how much I weighed when I decided to start to losing weight (yet again), because I had stopped weighing myself once I hit 220. I didn't wanna know. However, my actual weight had to be 230 or more because I was wearing my 220lb jeans, but I could no longer zip them at all. So it was either lose weight, or buy a whole new wardrobe.<br /><br />I started trying to find a diet that I could stick to, but I had to face it - I had tried them all, and always failed because of my ginormous sweet tooth. After about a week or two of depriving myself of sweets, I'd wind up breaking my diet. I knew the only way I was ever going to lose weight was to find a way to do it with, somehow, including sweets.<br /><br />I won't bore you with the details, but I finally wound up creating a smoothie recipe that was so delicious that I didn't feel sweet-deprived. I substituted the smoothie for two meals a day and ate sensibly for the third meal. I LOST 50 LBS IN 6 MONTHS! Whoo-hoo!!! I haven't been this "skinny" for over 20 years!<br /><br />I'm still losing too (-60 lbs at the time of this writing). It's been slower going lately, but that's because it's winter and I'm not walking my dog in the park for an hour 4 or 5 times a week. Once the weather warms up, I plan on going back to my walking and I'm sure the weight loss will speed up again.<br /><br />I prepare my smoothies with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q5TIJS">Tribest Personal Blender PB200 Super Convenience Pack</a>. You drink using the container you used to blend, so there isn't an extra blender container to wash. Rinse the blade assembly with warm water immediately after blending to save more washing. I grind the Fiber One cereal in the small, 8 oz container first. Then, in the larger, 16 oz container or the extra-large 24 oz container (available separately), blend all the ingredients except Fiber One Cereal together, or just cover and shake, to make room for the cereal. Add the Fiber One last and blend thoroughly.<br /><br />The commuter lids are great for taking your breakfast with you in your car. You can make and store smoothies in the 'fridge overnight, with the included regular covers, for a super-fast breakfast. You can also get replacement parts and extra accessories (unlike similar as-seen-on-TV products). You can also get an optional carrying case for the blender to take it to work or on vacation.<br /><br />I like the mason jars for mixing and freezing both dry and wet ingredients with the Tribest, like ground flax seed and home-made veggie blends. You can get extra mason jars just about anywhere and also use them for freezing leftover or batch-made spaghetti sauce, soup, etc. Also dry ingredients like flour, rice, brown sugar (no more hard lumps!), bulk spices, etc. The dry products can store either in the freezer or on the shelf.<br /><br />As far as some of the complaints saying that their Tribest blender died after only a short time - it has a built-in, shut-off mechanism to prevent the motor from over-heating, which can happen if the mixture you are blending is very thick, which over-works the motor. If you just let the blender cool off for a few minutes, it will work again. Thin the mixture with a little more milk or a few ice cubes.<br /><br />There are several Tribest combo pack options for purchasing the blender which can save you money. Just type Tribest into the Amazon search to see them, and to see all the available accessories.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about me - if you've stuck with reading this to this point, you're probably hoping I'll reveal my secret recipe. So, without further ado, here it is.<br /><br />Basic Fruit Smoothie Recipe (makes approx. 14 oz)<br /><br />1/2 cup Fiber One Original Cereal, pre-ground if possible<br />6 oz skim milk<br />1 cup fresh or frozen fruit (nuke frozen for 15 sec. to make blending easier)<br />2 Tbs Sugar-Free French Vanilla coffee creamer (optional), I use powdered<br />No-cal sweetener, to taste (add last, after blending and tasting)<br />1-4 ice cubes, if necessary, to reach desired coldness or to thin a too-thick smoothie<br /><br />Frozen fruit works best because the smoothie will be very cold. Bananas can be frozen if you peel ripe bananas, slice into one-inch pieces, arrange on cookie sheet so that the pieces don't touch, place cookie sheet in freezer until bananas are frozen, put frozen banana pieces into zipper plastic bag, and return to freezer. You want to freeze the pieces on the cookie sheet first because if you just dump all the banana pieces straight into the plastic bag, you'll wind up with one giant frozen banana lump. You can use this method for other fresh fruit too.<br /><br />Suggested flavors: Banana, strawberry, blueberry (my fave!), raspberry, blackberry, pineapple, orange, lime, lemon.<br /><br />Suggested combos: Banana/strawberry, blueberry/strawberry, pineapple/banana, pineapple/orange.<br /><br />Use fruit juices in place of fruit too. Use 6 oz. of juice or, if using frozen concentrate, 2 oz. of concentrate and 2 oz. of milk or the equivalent in ice cubes. When buying juices, choose only those marked as 100% juice if you want to avoid sugar.<br /><br />I often use a few banana slices to sweeten, instead of no-cal sweetener. The banana will also add a little more thickness for the thinner consistency smoothies, such as those made with juice.<br /><br />Other variations: Chocolate (1 Tbs cocoa added to banana smoothie), mocha (1 Tbs cocoa, 1 Tbs freeze-dried coffee, 2 more oz. milk, banana or no fruit), pineapple-upside-down smoothie (sweeten with Splenda Brown Sugar blend - it's half Splenda, half brown sugar), pumpkin pie smoothie (cook and refrigerate pumpkin first and sprinkle in some pumpkin pie spice), sweet potato smoothie (same prep and spices as pumpkin pie smoothie), banana nut (blend in a few Tbs chopped walnuts).<br /><br />For those who want a bigger meal, add another cup of fruit and 2 more oz milk. Use the larger 24 oz container. You could also get all your fiber for the day in one meal by using a full cup of Fiber One Original cereal and a few more oz of milk, juice, or ice cubes.<br /><br />The main point of using Fiber One in the smoothie is that it makes the smoothie meal very FILLING and will keep you feeling full longer. You can't get much more filling in a 14 oz meal than 14 grams of fiber! None of the commercial diet liquid meals can't touch that - and you pay a lot more for them. With two smoothies a day, you're getting over 100% of your daily fiber, 4 fruit servings, 2 cereal servings, and 1 1/2 dairy servings. Fill out your food pyramid with your third meal. Doesn't hurt to take a vitamin/mineral supplement also.<br /><br />And, if you're really into veggies, you can make green smoothies with Fiber One too.<br /><br />I LOVE FIBER ONE AND MY TRIBEST BLENDER!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: As of Sept. 2010 the weight loss is 100 lbs! Only 15 more to go! WHOO-HOO! This recipe really works! I wound up making mostly blueberry and/or banana smoothies - they're my favorites. I also kept frozen OJ handy for if I ran out of fruit before shopping day. I can't believe the difference when I look in the mirror - not only do I have a waist again - I re-discovered I had cheek bones too! LOL<br /><br />Since I'm so close to my goal, and since it's been a year on this regime, I've eased up on the food restrictions for my 3rd meal and I allow myself a treat every now and again. Yeah, it'll take longer this way, but after 100 lbs, I deserve a break! Besides, all along I allowed myself to get one candy bar when I went grocery shopping. It helped me avoid other temptation knowing I'd be enjoying that candy right after shopping. I still lost the weight fast. I figured, allowing a little was better than getting to the point of utter deprivation frustration and quiting - which is what has always happened in the past. Cut yourself a break every now and again and do it without guilt!

review/summary: Really fake (warning: aspartame)
review/text: I thought I'd tried this cereal years ago, but either the formula has changed or I'm thinking of something else. I was excited to see it on sale on line, but now I wish I'd never stocked up. I think I'm sending the rest to the food bank.<br /><br />I actually like the natural flavor of whole grains, but this is something made in a lab and you can tell. My first impression on my first bowl was "wow, this is sure sickly sweet for a 'healthy' cereal". I immediately checked the label for sugar content and was confused that there wasn't any, since the flavor is overly sweet and a bit nasty with it. I quickly noticed all the chemicals and food derivatives in the ingredient list, including aspartame as a sweetener. Ick.

review/text: I have rotated between Fiber One and Smart Bran. Today I find that an ingredient in Fiber One is Aspartame. Uh.....No thanks Uncle Don (Donald Rumsfeld is responsible for getting FDA approval for Aspartame, after it's failure to gain approval....do the research, you'll see). I am sticking with Smart Bran. Just one man's opinion. No matter what, it's food for thought..:) Eat as you wish and be happy. May The Source be with you!

review/summary: It's kinda like Cheerios (the unsweetened Stuff)
review/text: Actually compaired to Psyllium Seed (a/k/a: Metamucil, Colin Clense, etc.), this stuff is really good. You don't need to just eat it as cerial. You can dress it up with fruit, stir it in yogurt, and use it for other aplications. What I think it tastes like is unsweetened Cheerios. Another good application is sprinkle it on salad as a crouton or bacon bits substitute. The review prior to mine has to be from someone that is under 40 years old. Speaking as a 52 year old, I really like this (and it's a lot better than drinking the gritty stuff).

review/text: This cereal is great- filling, low calorie, nutritious, and tasty (once you adjust your taste buds).  I usually combine it with Special K Protein Plus and plain yogurt for breakfast.  Or just snack on a handful of it is I get a craving for crunch during the day.<br /><br />The only downside is that Amazon is no longer offering it on subscribe and save, and since I live in a place where I cannot buy it directly, I am very disappointed.  But, that's doesn't affect the benefits of the cereal itself, of course!

review/summary: getting fiber the delicious way
review/text: A friend told me about a delicious cereal that is not only low in calories, but full of fiber. I ordered Fiber One cereal about a month ago & not only do I eat a half-cup for breakfast (with fruit) every day, but I have another half-cup before bed. It helps me with weight loss, keeping me fuller, eating less calories. A terrific product. However, I originally paid $18.26 for SIX, 16.2 ounce boxes, with free shopping & handling. When I went on to increase my order, the price now listed is almost DOUBLE at almost $32. for the same 6 boxes. I tried for 30 minutes to write directly to Amazon, but couldn't find any area to do so. This was the best I could find. A good product but not at $32 dollars, after paying less than $19 for the same product & amount. Feedback? Are you reading this Amazon???

review/summary: Fiber One, taste Great!
review/text: I'm a big fan of Fiber One. With 14g of fiber/half cup serving, it fills half my daily allowance. Though it only has 2g of protein/serving, I just make it up with something from lunch and dinner. I notice it taste sweet though it does not contain sugar at all. It's probably b/c I add some trail mix of my own when I have the cereal. The ordering was very simple when the deal for this came up. I missed a earlier deal when this came up and jump on this deal when it appeared. I had my package within 4 days.

review/summary: 14 Grams Of Fiber! Wow! I Hope They Never Change It!
review/text: I've tried all the Fiber One cereals. The one that tastes best out of the box is the one with raisins, but that one has more calories than the regular brand. That one makes a good trail mix if you're hiking. The regular brand is a little bland, so I add fresh fruit to it. Sometimes blueberries, sometimes raspberries, sometimes I cut up a banana. I also buy bags of frozen blueberries or raspberries, thaw some out the night before and add them to the cereal in the morning. I end up with a really great tasting cereal. I'm sure that the fruit I add makes the calorie and sugar count higher, but so what. I think at 14 grams of fiber per serving, it's got the highest fiber of any cereal on the market.<br /><br />A great way to start the morning!

I saw Fiber one recommended on the Instinct Diet (written by a Harvard nutritionist) and decided to test try a box. It is amazing! It is crunchy, delicious and does not taste like cardboard. I eat it dry with my tea as a snack and mixed with home made low fat yogurt and fruit as a breakfast. It keeps my stomach from grumbling, improves my digestion and is actually helping me lose weight. This is a product that truly works like its supposed to. I only wish they made a no-sugar or savory version that I could use to create savory snacks.

review/text: Fiber One has been a part of my multi-faceted, health-conscious lifestyle for years. Just like Cherrios, it can also serve as a bit-by-bit snack during a football game or movie. Sure, it takes some getting used to, but it's far healthier than the butter-laden, artery-clogging popcorn of my youth.  The only problem I have is that, just this week, Amazon.Com cancelled my subscription to both Fiber One and the big boxes of Cherrios.  I guess there are not enough fanatical health nuts like me to make it worth their while to stock these items.  So, it is back to the big-box, whole-sale warehouses.

review/text: When I received this I noticed that all the boxes of cereal were a month past their "best used by date."  I find this to be an unacceptable business practice.

review/summary: YUCK! Contains Aspartame. Alternative listed below.
review/text: It's a shame, because I really wanted to like Fiber One. The texture is great (nice and crunchy...though it makes me think a little of pet food XD ), and the fiber content is super. But the aspartame is a dealbreaker for me. I used to consume aspartame (in chewing gum and 1-4 cans of diet coke a day) and discovered that it was actually giving me migraines and hiking up my anxiety level (haven't had a migraine or panic attack in 4 years since quitting it). If I accidentally get some, I get headaches and start feeling nervous right away... So, while the studies on brain tumors is controversial, I avoid it like the plague.<br /><br />But I found today a wonderful alternative to Fiber One is Smart Bran. It has a whopping 13+ grams of fiber and tastes pretty good without the nasty artificial sweeteners. It also doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup. It would be lovely if General Mills changed their Fiber One to be healthier. 10-20 calories less in a cereal isn't worth headaches and other health impacts from Aspartame...plus it's nice when cereal has a decent aftertaste.

review/summary: unbelievably ridiculous addition to this great cereal: ASPARTAME
review/text: This used to be a favorite a few years ago. Raw taste, nice texture, stays crunchy in hot milk. I loved it! Then I changed to a different brand for a few years just for variation and yesterday went back. Didn't even look at the label. When I tasted it for the first time, I thought: "hey, the taste changed!"... and I glance at the label: last ingredient - Aspartame. WHY? WHY? It ruined it for me completely, not only the taste, but the AFTERtaste is horrible. that artificial sweetener - bitter chemical taste. What a shame! Shame on you, general mills!

review/summary: Read the ingredients
review/text: This one is probably okay if you don't have any problems with HFCS or aspartame, which I do.  They trigger migraines, for me at least.  Like a dummy, I bought a box based on the commercials, my bad. It has both sweeteners in all the varieties of this brand.  I'm not crazy about the taste of Kashi GoLean, but at least I know I'm putting a healthy fiber cereal in my tummy. The same with Ezekiel Flax cereal, seriously healthy, not a lot of taste, but hey, life is about more than a momentary sweet taste in our mouths.

review/summary: Aspartame is unacceptable as an ingredient
review/text: "Ingredients:<br />The list of ingredients can be found under the Nutrition Facts label. Fiber One Original contains whole grain wheat, corn bran, modified wheat starch, guar gum, color, cellulose gum, salt, baking soda, corn oil and aspartame. The use of aspartame is controversial. The Center for Science in the Public Interest has requested the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to review a recent study conducted by the Ramazzini Foundation regarding the occurrence of tumors in laboratory animals given aspartame. You may be better off avoiding cereals with aspartame, also known as NutraSweet and Equal, opting for ones with real sugar, or maybe no sugar at all."<br />--LiveStrong article<br /><br />The flavor was good, but some of these ingredients are pretty questionable from a health perspective.  I had to stop using it, sad to say.

review/summary: ALERT!! - CONTAINS CHEMICAL SWEETENER
review/text: BEWARE - This cereal contains a chemical sweetener called Aspartame (aka Sweet'nLow), which is a dangerous chemical food additive shown to cause cancer in lab rats.  In humans, the effects of Aspartame can be felt as either migraine, other headache, dizziness, nausea, anxiety, nervousness, or bloating.  PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ON ASPARTAME before you consume any product such as this.  ASPARTAME is rated by the governments as "GRAS - Generally Regarded As Safe" - The History of Aspartame is fascinating and you will find that the scientists at the FDA who tested Aspartame advocated it to be banned.  Donald Rumsfeld served as one of the influential political forces that successfully managed to get the FDA to overrule the FDA's own scientists' recommendation that this product be BANNED.  Aspartame's GRAS status means that the US Gov't will do nothing to regulate or prevent its usage.<br /><br />I first started experiencing problems with Fiber-One when I realized that eating a bowl of it without any other food would cause me to feel nauseous.  On occasion, eating a bowl of Fiber-One would give me a migraine along with a feeling of dizziness.  This is certainly not the way that I want to start off the morning.  There are people who can eat Aspartame-laced foods all day long and who are unaware of any side-effects, but they do creep up on you and if you are not as tolerant as some others, WATCH OUT.  You could become very sick eating this cereal day after day, the chemical builds up in your system.  The insidiousness of Aspartame being in Fiber-One is that, if you are health-counscious, you'll tell yourself that if you're not feeling well that you should maybe eat more healthy food - like the very same Fiber-One cereal that's making you sick!!<br /><br />It is unethical and unconscionable for General Mills, a staple brand in this country, to have resorted to using a dangerous chemical additive simply so their Marketing Exec's can push their cereal upon people who are sugar-sensitive.  People with Diabetes BEWARE - Aspartame is known to also cause aggressive insulin responses.  Just because their chemical sweetener contains no calories doesn't mean that your body won't react in that manner, and you may end up on the bad end of an insulin swing as a result.<br /><br />This product should be pulled immediately from the shelves.  I personally am ashamed that a large reputable company such as GM would target a health-conscious individual like myself and yet perform an underhanded trick as adding a chemical sweetener.  I really wish I had noticed the chemical additive in this cereal before I had experienced the headaches and nausea.<br /><br />SHAME ON GENERAL MILLS - BEWARE FIBER ONE CEREAL - I wish I would have been warned before becoming sickened by this "health cereal".

review/summary: Fiber: Good  ------  Aspartame: Bad
review/text: I became completely addicted to FiberOne. Absolutely loved it, until I read the ingredients label.  I didn't get hungry till lunch time and was losing weight, but I just didn't feel good about aspartame. I am trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKWTY4">Benefit Nutrition Simply Fiber, All Natural Crunchy O's 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> by Benefit Nutrition. Not as wonderfully crunchy as FiberOne, but the ingredients label is very short.
