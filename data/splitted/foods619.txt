review/summary: Ok but Miss Vickie's Are Better
review/text: Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.

review/summary: Do they have to "bite back"?
review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

review/summary: These chips are awesome if not best but....
review/text: I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

review/summary: A Rich Flower Garden in Bloom.
review/text: A Ming Dynasty (AD 1368 - 1644) creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity, jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves - usually green teas from Fujian province, which is also home to the semi-fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong - scented with jasmine flowers. Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom.

review/summary: Fantastic!  I LOVE this stuff! (so does my daughter!)
review/text: My just turned 4 year old daughter will NOT, I repeat NOT, eat fruit of any kind.  The last time she ate fruit was baby food.  No joke.  She has food aversions, texture issues, temperature issues, pickiness issues, and has been in feeding therapy for 1.5 years.  She won't drink water unless it's purified (she can tell the difference). I mean this is serious stuff.<br /><br />I bought one of these and gave it to her, explained that it was baby food consistency but wasn't baby food, and was fruit (didn't lie to her) but wasn't a cold smoothie like the kind Mommy makes (which she does NOT like).<br /><br />She slurped the whole thing down!  Tears came to my eyes I was so shocked and excited.  This whole feeding drama is very trying on my patience and I worry so often that she will have long-term problems.<br /><br />She has been devouring them ever since!  This as well as The Red One.  I cannot believe that she is "eating" fruit!!!  I am forever a loyal buyer of Ella's Kitchen products.  When my son is ready for solids, I will feed him Ella's baby food.  I cannot tell you how thankful and happy I am to finally get fruit in my daughter's belly!

And the packaging is BPA free!  They are sweet as many of the blends have banana included, but I still find them to be a very useful and nutritious food.  She especially loves the broccoli, pea, pear blend.

review/summary: Great dairy and soy free snack!
review/text: My kids love these!!  We have tried the red one, yellow one, and purple one and they love all 3.  My 11 month old is allergic to milk and soy, so trying to find him portable snacks has been a challenge, but he adores these.  And he has learned how to suck them down by himself, which is a big plus for me. My 4 1/2 year old loves them too, the challenge with her is keeping her from eating them all at once!  Amazon has a better price than our store, too, plus the only 2 stores that sell these in my area are 30 mins away.  Love Amazon for saving me the gas and delivering to my house!

Ella's Kitchen has an excellent product, and we love everything we've every tried from them, but I just cannot justify the significant difference in cost.

These aren't available in all stores yet, so subscribing keeps them on-hand at all times.

review/summary: Delicious, Healthy, Easy for Kids to Open Snack!
review/text: My kids have tried all of the Ella's Kitchen "smoothies" and love them.  (By the way, they make baby food ones, too.)  This is a real blessing for any busy mom who has her hands full.  Or any on-the-go mom.  We brought these on a 4-day roadtrip and they were a lifesaver!  Everytime our kiddos got hungry, we'd hand them back one of these.  They could open and close them themselves, it was a very healthy snack, and it was not at all messy.  Ella's Kitchen pouches are notably easier than most squeezable fruits we've tried and we've pretty much tried them all--the tops are nice and big and easy for even toddlers to unscrew and screw back on. This one is a mix of currants, blueberries, bananas, and apples.  The other flavors are The Green One, The Yellow One, and the Red One. So yummy!

review/text: This is my daughter's favorite Ella's fruit flavor.  Not only do they come in smoothie fruit for toddlers and bigger kids (and grown-ups, wink-wink), but they come in baby food, too!  This is a real blessing for any busy mom who has her hands full. Or for an on-the-go family.  We used these during a long, 4-day road trip we took.  When my youngest got hungry, I could just lean back and hand him one of these.  He was 3, could unscrew the lid himself, and it was a healthy, non-messy snack.  I highly recommend!

review/text: I love Ella's because there are so many great mixes of fruits and vegetables for my baby to try.  The best way to prevent a picky eater in the toddler years is to give a wide variety of flavors and textures when they're still babies.  I love all the pouches, because I don't want to get jars with BPA in the lining of the lid and I also don't have time to make baby food either.  Ella's says they hope to introduce recyclable packaging in the next year or two, but that right now, this is the best way to protect the foods that are made without preservatives.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a different flavor profile to introduce to their little one.  '

We have tried other brands of convenient pounches and they are NOT the same, she will throw the other pouches on the floor.  When she sees Ella's at the store, she wants them right then.  As soon as I open it, she eats it up and asks for more.  She is small for her age, so I encourage her to eat these as much as she wants.  So glad I found these on Amazon, the price is so much better.  In the stores they average $1.50 - $1.79 each.

review/summary: the perfect snack
review/text: I love this product for my 4 year old. I pack one in her lunches and carry one in my purse at all times. I love that the packaging is BPA free, unlike several other competitor products. The lid is perfect for tiny hands to open and you can reseal the package if it's not all consumed. All organic ingredients, nothing artificial.

review/summary: Good, but other options  may be healthier
review/text: "The Red One", organic baby food "smoothie"<br /><br />If you're like me, you're interested in this item because it looks convenient and like something your baby will actually eat -- that would be a pretty good description of this product, with a few caveats:<br /><br />-The nutrition content of this product is not really that great.  We tend to mix this in with rice cereal for some iron, but otherwise it's a bit of a waste on its own.<br />-The taste is good, but maybe a little sweet for baby.<br />-The packaging is great -- very portable, screw top cap.  You tend not to waste much product with the packaging design.<br /><br />Just a reminder, the container is a bit smaller than some of the other "bagged" baby foods:  3 oz is less than the plastic Gerber containers (at 3.5 oz), but more than the small glass jar foods (usually 2.5 oz).

review/text: Picked one of these up this morning at our local natural foods market.  I gave it to my 22 month old daughter when we got into Kroger and she devoured it and asked for more, didn't have another so she sucked on the packaging the rest of the time in the store.  Will definitely buy more of these to have on hand for snacking on the road this summer, otherwise I will just buy the organic fruit and make it myself at home.  I tasted it too and it was delicious!  No GMO's and no pesticides, that sealed the deal for me.

review/summary: tasty, healthy snack
review/text: I prefer to stick with organic versions of the "dirty dozen" in produce (which, sadly, includes most berries), but I also try to follow my pediatrician's advice to have my son "eat the rainbow" each day. That gets tough, especially when we get into fall/winter, when fresh fruits and veggies are fewer and far between. Organic berries (like the strawberries and raspberries in this product) are expensive, hard to find, and definitely out of season right now here in NY. Enter Ella's Red One Smoothie Fruits. These pouches are great to have around as an option to round out my toddler's colorful fruit intake for the day. Not to mention, they're delicious - think applesauce, with sweet berries added for extra flavor and flair! And they're ideal when we're on the go. With a few of these tossed into my diaper bag, I always have something healthy and organic on hand for him to enjoy. They're even a nice snack for me when I find myself a bit low on energy when we're out and about. The crushed fruit inside these pouches is smooth (almost baby food consistency), so it slurps up through the straw-like top easily. Once I've unscrewed the cap, my 17 month old can eat this entirely without my help, leaving my hands free to get stuff done. Sweet!

review/summary: My current favorite food product
review/text: My little one eats very few purees nowadays.  He likes feeding himself.  However, these smoothies are good for both Baby and Momma.  a) The flavor is FANTASTIC with organic goodness bursting at the seams of your taste buds.  b)  I love, love, LOVE this pouch.  During a feeding, I normally start by squeezing a biteful at a time into a spoon for my little one.  No mess and resealable if he decides he only wants 1/3 of the container.  I've also found that after a while, my little one likes to hold the pouch and slowly squirt it into his mouth.  Once again, no mess for me to clean up, and Little Guy is very pleased at the food and being able to feed himself.<br />Fabulous product indeed.

In addition, all this is is pureed fruit - no added sugars, no preservatives, nothing. It's a snack I am happy to give to my kids. We take them everywhere - in the car, to the beach, to the zoo, sometimes I pack them in my son's lunch for school, etc. And they're a great snack for the parents as well... We will continue to purchase these for years I am sure.

review/summary: Delicious, Tasty and Healthy for my Little One!
review/text: My 20 month old loves fruits and vegetables! When I say he loves them, I mean he would pick them over his other snacks. So I don't complain when he asks for them either. We have a cupboard filled with these healthy snack pouches just on hand when we run out of his veggies and fruits. We take them along wherever we go. These come in very handy!<br /><br />We used another brand before this one (Plum Organics) but although tasty, they were more runny in consistency. I find that Ella's taste more natural as if they were truly mashed with a fork. Another reviewer thought that Ella's was more sugary but I don't agree. I think its because Ella's is more firmer than the Plum Organics, which tastes a little water down.<br /><br />My son loves these and doesn't even mind having some of the Stage 1 for babies! I gave this product 5 stars because it tastes good, its packaged nice, they come in different combinations and it healthy!

I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving. This stays down but is beginning to cause some indigestion at times. I'm not saying it would cause you guys to reflux or anything of that sort, but it was really acidic and caused me to choke. My throat now burns a lot, and feels sore, Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems. Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in, and need to retrain your stomach and intestines. Just be careful, some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />P.S. I like this flavor better than "The Red One".

review/text: Dark Muscovado sugar is fabulous !<br /><br />It's important to note that it is absolutely necessary to store it in a sealed plastic or glass container so it doesn't turn into a sugar boulder.<br /><br />Bought this sugar on a whim thinking it MIGHT be good and it certainly looked like something a different than you'd ever find in a supermarket.<br />What a thrill it is. Granted, the packaging is plain, nothing at all fancy about it but what's inside is very fancy with a flavor so divine that it invites you to try it in everything.<br /><br />Here are a few of the things I've used it for since it arrived in my kitchen.<br /><br />Adds an elegant, gourmet flavor when used as a topping on french toast.<br />On hot cereals such as oatmeal, cream of wheat, cream of rice it tastes rich and the steam rising smells so good.<br /><br />And here's a news flash: Mix a rounded teaspoon or two in hot or cold milk for a real treat. Or if you're like me and  into making from scratch hot cocoa, instead of mixing granulated sugar into the cocoa powder mix about 1/2 as much Muscovado sugar for an out of this world cup of hot cocoa. The flavor is deep and heady with an aroma that will knock your socks off.<br /><br />Want to add some pizazz to your beef stew? Add a half teaspoon of Muscovado to it about 1/2 hour before it's finished cooking.<br />It also will add great flavor to chili when you add teaspoon full to it near the end of it's cooking time.<br /><br />Cut up a few apples, an orange and add a 1/2 cup or so of dried cranberries and a handful of crushed walnuts or pecans, sprinkle a rounded teaspoon of Muscovado sugar on top and give it a light toss. Let the mix sit in the fridge for an hour or so and you have a grand fresh dessert OR - and let me tell you this is so good you'll want to do it again....instead of serving that mixture cold (it's winter here), pour it all in a sauce pan and simmer it until the apples are soft. Serve it warm. OMG! it's good.<br />I've also tried the warm mix with a splash of Peach Schnapps and a dollop of whipped cream added right before serving and the flavor blew me away. All of our dinner guests have given it rave reviews.<br /><br />The next thing I'm going to try it in is whipped cream - I'll come back and let you know how that goes.

I give away a lot of baked goodies as thank you gifts to friends, family and those who have helped and supported me and my family over the year, like my Vet and the hospital staff.  There is no comparison.  Everyone was asking what I did to the recipes to improve on already excellent products.  As I was making the doughs and batters, one taste told me that I was onto something great.  I'm not going back to regular sugars.  Muscovado is worth EVERY penny of the extra costs.

review/summary: molassas lovers rejoice
review/text: V E R Y impressed with this product.  I have experienced Muscavo suger from South America and wanted to try sugars from other regions.  My expectations were more than met.  This has the most molassas content of any dark sugar I have experimented with. Planning to try more of India Tree's offerings soon.

review/summary: Amazing flavor
review/text: This is one of my absolute favorite sorts of sugars to bake with. The molasses flavor is very rich and adds something wonderful to the whole wheat I use in all my baking. It combines very well with spices like ginger or cinnamon, it goes well in chocolate, and goes very well with coffee. More delicate flavors might be overpowered by this sugar.<br />I really recommend it for spicy shortbread variations if you like to experiment in cooking. I use shortbread to try out sugars and sweeteners and to see how they combine with different flavors.<br />This makes a very dense shortbread with a nice molasses warm flavor.

review/summary: secret ingredient for EVERYTHING
review/text: I stumbled on this sugar as I experiement a lot. I found that I can replace white sugar and especially brown sugar with this for many recipes and almost always have a better outcome. It has a much richer taste and texture and I sense it might be a bit sweeter than regular sugar, that and its much more expensive so I scale back a bit. But, I have not noticed any negative impact from doing that. I really recommend this product!

review/text: This very dark sugar has a wonderful rich molasses flavour that is ideal for baking or just adding to oatmeal.  Many if not most other brown sugars are simply refined white sugar that have had flavouring and colour added, they taste like a very sad imitation of real Muscovado sugar.  If a recipe calls for dark brown sugar I will only use Muscovado sugar.

review/summary: From Cane Grown in Volcanic Ash
review/text: I first found this sugar while working at Larry's Market in Seattle. The India Tree company is also located in Seattle. It was one of the greatest food discoveries I'd forgotten about. Well, not quite. I just had no idea why the sugar we ate in Africa was so rich and similar to molasses in color. This sugar is milled on the island of Mauritius off the coast of Africa and has the divine flavor only possible from cane growing on volcanic ash.<br /><br />Here in America, most of the brown sugar seems like white sugar coated in a brown coloring in comparison to this rich, dark and almost seductive slightly salty tasting sugar. When I found this sugar, it brought back tons of childhood memories. Mostly memories of eating a spoonful of sugar as a treat. This sugar is "that" good.<br /><br /> Muscovado is slightly moist, has a very high molasses content and is delicious in gingerbread, coffee cakes, chocolate cakes and anything with chocolate in it. You can basically use this sugar in any recipe that calls for "dark brown sugar."<br /><br />When making cookies, you will notice some of the lumps don't quite work themselves into the dough. This is no problem, because then you just find a few sugar lumps in your cookies. If you prefer your sugar to be perfectly soft, you can add a piece of apple to your sugar jar until the sugar softens.<br /><br />This is one of my "Top Ten" ingredient finds of the century.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: A true brown sugar, almost unprocessed.  The taste is (obviously) sugary, but with complex notes that cannot be put into words -- way beyond the finest molasses.  Add in the modest price and large quantity, and you have a winner here.  My recommendation: put this on grits/oatmeal for a unique treat.

They were AMAZINGLY rich. Normally, we can get through a double batch in 2-3 days, but with this sugar, they were so amazingly rich, we couldn't eat more than 2 cookies at a time.<br /><br />This is MUCH richer than most sugars, even other whole cane sugars.  I am now cutting my recipes to about 3/4 the sugar I used to use.

review/text: Great for sweetening coffee and oatmeal. I have found many amazing things to do with muscovado sugar and I will never go back to artificial sweeteners again!!<br /><br />Another one I constantly use is the brand called EL MAESTRO and I usually buy it on ebay. It has a pure, strong molasses taste much that I absolutely love. I believe its imported from the Philippines where they specialize in that. Don't get me wrong, both El Maestro and India Tree are amazing products!!<br /><br />But yeah, you can't compare muscovado sugar to any other sugars out there. Perfect with any recipe, especially coffee and tea... and marinating meats!

review/summary: Hooked on this sugar
review/text: Looking for a good brown sugar I came across this Muscovado Sugar.  It has a fairly small grain.  Unlike some of the other brown sugars, it is moist and sticky with a great aroma--hints of vanilla and rich spice rather than a molasses smell.  It's great on its own and I find that it works very well in recipes that use vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and seems to add more moisture to muffins and cakes (it works really well in carrot cake).  It also works very well in chocolate cookies...well, anything chocolate!  I think it's not as sweet as some of the other brown sugars I've baked with, so you might need a little more.<br /><br />As for keeping it moist, as long as you don't open the packs, the sugar maintains its consistency even if it stands around for a long time.  Once opened, it needs to be kept in a tightly closed container.  I also use a sugar clay bear and it seems to work fairly well although with time some of the sugar does turn into little hard clumps.

review/summary: Enjoy the taste of brown sugar instead of wondering if it's there.
review/text: I read a lot of reviews on brown sugar to find one that I could taste in my recipe after cooking.  I make homemade granola bars and it's so easy to lose the brown sugar taste when cooking.  With the Dark Muscovado you get a hint of of the taste with every bite.  I also like the way it melds so well with the vanilla flavoring and butter.  I will be getting more when I run out of what I have.  The price is right for the quality of the product and I find this brand better than what I was getting at the natural foods store.  I do keep mine in the refrigerator and I would like to add a special thank you to the manufacturers for their packaging.  It is so easy to close and sill the bag after opening.  So far all the packs of sugar have stayed soft until I've used all of the contents.  You can tell by just one use that this is quality sugar.

I mixed the shake ingredients together with about 1/2 teaspoon of the Xanthan Gum and refrigerated it overnight. The next morning I dumped it in my blender with some frozen fruit and it was PERFECT! You can drink it slowly and it maintains the thickness even when not ice cold. When I would use crushed ice it was a race to suck it down fast enough before the consistency got too runny and the flavor was of course always watered down. This is a great alternative and the little bag will last me forever!

(Boylan's, despite its exotic design, comes out quite conservatively standard as a root beer "taste".)<br /><br />This is entirely due to the notes of chocolate or maybe coffee (or both--obviously the tastes are related).<br /><br />If the notion of a slightly cocoa-flavored root beer appeals to you, and you don't mind spending somewhere between 2 and 4 dollars a bottle (depending on your shipping options), then buy with confidence!

The color is slightly pinkish in most areas and more moderately pinkish in other areas.  This product is not high-grade lump crabmeat.  This product is adequate-grade non-lump crabmeat.  (2)Unlike those difficult-to-open 4-ounce cans of crabmeat sold by MW Polar brand, these 6-ounce cans sold by Consul brand can be opened conveniently using a can opener.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)The quantity of crabmeat is very bad.  After squeezing the opened can to drain the water away, the level of the crabmeat drops to below the halfway point in the altitude of the can.  This means that the price for this product is actually a bad deal, not the excellent deal that others who have commented on this product have been fooled into thinking.

review/text: this is not crab meat, it is mashed, in a bath of liquids and chemicals....forget buying this if you are searching for real crab.

review/summary: Sweet taste and shell bits (See customer image I uploaded)
review/text: I tried a can of crab from the grocery store that was $4 a can. All is was was particles of crab meat kind of like coffee grinds out of a used coffee filter. It really didn't have a flavor to it. I ended up just putting it on some lettuce with ranch and ate it like a salad. I will never buy it again.<br /><br />But I really love crab meat and sushi but I can't really afford it nor do I have the time to dine out much. So I'm looking for some type of substitute for fresh seafood even though I know it won't be nearly as good so I have extremely low expectations.<br /><br />This was more like shredded crab mixed with particles of crab meat BUT there were a few thicker pieces in there like maybe from the leg of a very tiny crab. So it was better than the grocery store kind I tried and cheaper. BUT this brand had pieces of shell in it--the other did not. This one had sugar added to it so it tasted sweet which makes no sense to me.<br /><br />So I might possibly try this again knowing full well I'd do better just going to a Chinese buffet since that's the closet I will get to fresh crab in Appalachia. It's not something I will buy reguarly. Maybe once a month or every couple months. It's cheap. It somewhat has a crab taste if you use your imagination. It basically tastes like tuna.<br /><br />I will save up some money and try lump crab meat in a can next. Wish me luck.
