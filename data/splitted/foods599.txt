review/summary: paragon motla premium sno-cone and shaved ice syrup, orange, quart
review/text: Just got this today, was the first I have ordered from this company.  I like this a lot.  Good price, quart size, not too much of "standard-issue" orange flavor.  Little unusual.  Had gotton "orange cream" from other company and liked this best.  Will reorder this product from this seller again soon.

review/summary: Excessive shipping charges
review/text: I purchased this product and the seasoning is very good. I am, however, very dissapointed with their shipping charges. I had sent the seller an email stating that their shipping charge was excessive ($7.50) for such a small item. I received no response. The spice jar (3.5oz) arrived in a small box sent via USPS, and the USPS label on the front showed the cost of $2.38 for shipping. So faerie's finest makes an extra $5.12 on S&H. I suggest they notice that part of Amazon.com's success is due to the fact that they charge straight shipping costs, not inflated S%H. I won't buy from faeire's again.

review/text: "Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Polysorbate 60"<br /><br />It's really good cocoa, and I make it every morning for my husband (he won't drink coffee); we even bring it along on vacation so he can have it. I just wish that list of poisons above weren't included.  I've suggested to Land-o-Lakes that they make a ... "Sweet Nothings" version or whatever they want to call it:  a *totally* unsweetened version, so we can add whatever sweetener we wish to add.<br /><br />The corn syrup is unhealthy in the extreme; the 'partially hydrogenated' means trans fats (and soy is *not* healthy, contrary to the "common" "wisdom"), and the polysorbate has been shown in cosmetics to cause problems (and why is a cosmetics ingredient in a food item?!).<br /><br />That said (er... written), until someone comes up with a healthy product that tastes as good as this stuff does, he's gonna keep drinking these poisons every morning. {sigh}

review/summary: Supreme Chocolate Makes My Heart Sing!
review/text: Instead of creamer and sugar, I add a packet of this to my eight ounces of freshly ground coffee each morning! For a mere 140 calories, I enter bliss! Comparable, both in yummy-ness and nutritionally, to a whole milk Starbucks Mocha Frappuccinoï¿½, this Supreme Chocolate mix comes in at 3 grams of saturated fat (30 calories, 14% DV, from hydrogenated soybean oil and coconut oil), 0 trans fat, and 24 grams of sugars (sugar and corn syrup solids). As for price, since I live three hours from the nearest Wal-Mart, the shipped price is actually a little better than I would pay locally, and it arrives practically overnight. The entire box of 72 packets is only 7"x7"x18", and consists of six smaller display type boxes of twelve packets each. These 6"x7"x3.5" display boxes will tuck neatly into the smallest kitchen upper cabinets, and will maintain the individually wrapped single serving packets in a neat upright position. All in all, this is a big luxury for a little price, which is something that makes my heart sing!

review/summary: An Excellent Cup of Hot Chocolate!!
review/text: Being a hot cocoa lover as I am, it's hard to believe I've never tried Land O Lakes Supreme Hot Chocolate until I received it as part of a gift basket. I must say, it was one of the best cups of hot chocolate I've had in a long time.<br />I've tried soooo many different brands....from the most expensive to the least expensive. This ranks up in my top 3...which is a hard place to get to in my eyes (or taste buds?).<br />At approximately $0.40 a serving, this is a great deal.<br />You'll find this hot cocoa rich in taste and quite creamy as well...even though it's simply made with hot water.<br />Make sure you follow the instructions on the packet....6 oz. of water per packet.<br />Go ahead...try it...you won't be disappointed!

review/text: This cocoa dissolves in a nice way without a lot of chocolate clumps at the bottom of the mug. The cinnamon flavor has a 'cozy' aroma/taste. There are several other delicious Land O Lakes cocoa flavors including French Vanilla, Supreme, and Caramel. It's yummo in my tummo ( I find myself saying this a lot when I'm drinking it!). Several months a year the elementary school fundraising company called Market Day features a large box of Land O Lakes cocoa (assortment of flavors) for a much lower cost than in most grocery stores.

review/text: We've made the switch from Sojo's (oat based) to Honest Kitchen. We've got two dogs 40lbs & 61lbs so these 10lb boxes of food don't last too long. Also it doesn't mix the same as the other flavors (chicken, fish, plain), maybe because the beef flavor is almost a powder comparatively. Anyways, the dogs slop it up just the same. We add other vitamins and nutrients in with the mix so they get the broad spectrum. We also add a 1/4 cup of regular kibble (Blue Buffalo) just to make it go a little farther and bigger in their stomach so they're aren't whining for food in a couple hours.<br /><br />We also buy from a local shop because their price is spot on, plus it's good to help the local places.

review/text: Amazon had the best price for Honest Kitchen dog food.  We were recommended to try this food because our dog has allergies.  The food was gobbled up quickly, but unfortunately didn't have much affect on the allergies over time.  We've since switched to another food for the next several months, and will hope to see a change.  But Honest Kitchen is good food, human grade quality (but made for dogs) - and the ratings with most dog food rating companies show this food is very highly rated.

I think the overly sweetened, corn syrup & artificial flavoring/coloring-laden "juices" that kids are used to drinking these days are disgusting, though, so you know where I'm coming from.<br /><br />We're not big juice drinkers in our household (eat fruit, drink water, I say), but I let my kids have these juice boxes in sack lunches and for treats and what-not. I love that these drinks include veggie juice and only have 9 grams of sugar per box. I'm on a constant quest to reduce our sugar intake, so this works for me! I haven't had any kids complain about the taste either, and we've served these at various kids' parties, so FWIW, I think kids are amenable to the less-sweet flavor, unless perhaps their taste buds are ruined with a constant high-sugar diet. *shrug*

review/text: I will admit this brand juice/veggie drinks are aweful tasting to me however, my two year old son loves them. He will drink at least two to three of these a day which is a great thing for me since I cannot get him to eat vegetables on his own. I actually give him these before regular juice drinks since they are nutritional. The price on here is actually gyp I get his 40 in a case from BJ's wholesale store for $7.00. I think the older the child is introduceds to this the least likely they will probably like the taste since they have been introduced to regular juice for a longer period of time.

review/text: The Stash Tea Company seems to make excellent products.  Everything I've ever tried from them is a quality product.  In the herbal tea world, however that doesn't mean you like it all!  Moroccan Mint is THE best tea I've ever tried from any maker.  While not therapeutic, it is very welcome any time of day from that first cup in the morning to the relaxing last hour of the day.  That's why I subscribed to auto ship- so that I won't have to be without.

review/summary: Belly Fat??
review/text: I have reordered this product before in 240 count. I was waiting for my appointment at Yale New Haven Hospital and viewing the hospital closed circuit TV which was explaining health tips. The topic changed to the benefits of green tea and it mentioned it's anti oxidant properties and the fact that it helps reduce belly fat!!. I do not have a real problem in this area as I am 5' 10 1/2" tall and weighed 209 lbs. After surgery I had to watch my diet and with the help of Stash Green Tea consumed cold from a 32 once thermos at least three times weekly I have lost 17 lbs and inches from my belly area. TIP; Cut the string and tab off four tea bags and place in a 32 oz. thermos, top off with filtered water. You can refill with water all day or add one or two additional tea bags while leaving the others in the thermos. Keep refrigerated if possible. Ice cubes will rupture the tea bags. Try this for three months for at least three days a week or more and see if the belly isn't flatter!!

The biggest negative for me is the price... at the supermarket they usually have sales on tea that would make this a lot cheaper if bought there.

review/summary: delicious.
review/text: I'm picky about my green teas. Sometimes they're too weak, sometimes it just doesn't smell/taste like green tea, or sometimes it's just horribly bitter/sour and unpalatable (think most grocery store teas).<br /><br />But Stash's green tea is TERRIFIC. There's a good element of leafyness (it IS green after all) without much bitter/sourness. I can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag.<br />I was actually previously disappointed by Yogi's Green tea (it's just purely green tea leaves, can't remember the exact name of it though) - when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires, so I almost lost hope in American grocery store teas. I previously would only buy the Yamamotoyama green teas (slight roasted flavor) and Stash's green tea tastes remarkably similar, which makes me incredibly happy due to the Stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets. WOO!!!

review/summary: Lemongrass and Mint
review/text: It should probably be called Lemongrass Mint to more accurately describe the taste.  It's especially good as ice tea, but drinking it hot is enjoyable too.  The mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass.  I notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass, while others think it overwhelms the mint.  It's a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes.  I usually drink Bigelow Plantation Mint black tea, so I'm accustomed to a strong mint flavor.  Lucky for me that I like lemongrass too, so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me.

review/text: I realize that taste in tea, and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference. For me, I found this tea to be unpleasant. Opening the tea bag, I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings. As I drank the tea, I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste. I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste. I do not get the sharp "bite" I normally expect from a good green tea.<br /><br />I will try this for a week, and see if I am missing something, but as for now, I can not recommend purchasing this tea.

review/text: I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor. However, the price they are offering you to buy in bulk online is higher than buying 6 single boxes at the store. I've found this tea is always between $2 and $2.50 per box of 20. Multiply $2.50 by 6 and you get $15.00. They are asking $16.50 before shipping for the same amount. I think I'll keep buying it at the store.

It's not like drinking a mojito- but with a fresh slice of lime and some sugar, it's pretty darned good.  I drink it how, but the other reviewer suggested it over ice.  That would be great, I'm sure- I just happen to like my tea hot.

The mint isn't harsh- which is what I like about moroccan mint.  And if you add lemon to it (and I add a little German rock sugar) it's just amazingly good.  The new Mojito mint by Stash is also great.  I don't like it quite as much as this one, but I drink a ton of tea, and have about 5 favorites- and this and the Mojito are definitely two of the 5 (I also love the Stash organic Chai)

review/summary: ITS ALL NATURAL AND IT TASTE LIKE IT....VERY HEALTHY THOUGH..
review/text: So this is the first green tea ive bought and the second ive tasted. The first one i tasted was alittle better tasting. This stash green tea however does taste lets say, 'natural'. what i mean by that is it taste exactly like what it is, all natural dried herbs. It does look like leafs though not just crushed up almost powdery stuff like the other bag i drank. Im not quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is NOT good but its NOT that bad either and its also NOT sweet at all. But hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor. Overall though i DO recommend this green tea just like the name says it does appear to be premium green tea judging by how it looks and the 'natural' taste, so if your just after those health benefits you wont be disappointed if you want good taste this probably wont make you happy.

review/text: I have tried many types of tea - from "the scoop your own, tea-shoppe, imports" to the "waiter swears this is the greatest one ever" - and never did I expect to find my favorite, bar none, in this simple unassuming little box. I drink this every single day at work, often using 4-5 packs a day. Fair warning: this 6-pack may not be that great of a deal, depending on where you live. I can get it at the supermarket for about $2.48 a box. To have this 6-pack work out to be a better bargain than buying local it would have to be 14 bucks per, or less. BUT, that has nothing to do with the quality of this product. The tea itself is great.

This has a smooth, refreshing taste that you can enjoy every day or when you are tired of tea with milk. I like this tea with one packet of stevia. It would also be great with honey.

review/text: Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild. This tea contains green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil. I normally would not add milk to a green tea but adding two tablespoons of nonfat milk powder and a packet of stevia makes this tea perfectly soothing. If you don't like tea overly spicy this will appeal to you. I think it tastes better than a lot of chai teas made with black tea leaves.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Stash Premium Green Tea does not fail to disappoint, in the antioxidant factor. What's more, there is a wonderful smoky quality, too. Stash has always produced a high quality line of teas, and this is another wonderful addition to their family of flavors and adventures in hot water......

As a daily green tea drinker, I immediately thought this would be a good combo for me when I saw it. Stash is a very high-quality brand and you can tell by the taste of the tea. It has kind of a fresh, grassy (in a good way!) taste that is really distinct of high-quality teas. And now I can get the benefit of both green & white in the same cup. Yeah!

review/summary: On second thought...
review/text: One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I "brew" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~

review/summary: Delightfully healthy!
review/text: This tea is just so so so so so so so goooddddd!!! Can't have enough of it. Bought it last evening and had a cup of it and was raving all through the entire cup. Today, I had two cups and I felt like I wanted to have more. This tea has no sugar (read up its nutritional info on net). I am a mint lover and I love mint in everything. But here, the mint is not overpowering (as other reviewers say) but it has been given a good balance. I add half a tsp of Natural 'Sugar in the Raw' (it has only 2g of sugar) to give a lil' more sweetness to this tea, and its OUTSTANDING!!!!! Highly recommended. I am going to order the 6-pack version from Amazon soon after my current box empties itself.

review/summary: The fragrance is lovely, but it is too fermented to be good green tea.
review/text: The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.  I didn't like it at first, because it lacks the gentle subtlety of the blend of green and jasmine.  It's almost like an afternoon tea with jasmine added.  Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green.  However, when I want that delicate flavored, I look for something else, even the Bigelow (and I'm not a great Bigelow fan).

review/summary: a good tea, hot or cold
review/text: I was looking for a mellow green tea that I could drink on a daily basis either hot or cold. This one fits the bill. It is neither bitter or grassy tasting like a lot of other green teas that I've tried. I balked at buying a 6 pack, but now I'm glad I did since I'm down to the the last box and have not seen this blend at my grocery with the other Stash teas.

review/text: I love this tea, but I find the new box design annoying.  I don't really like the photos on the boxes and I have gotten two different types, this one and the Hazelnut one and both of them had flaps that ripped and they don't stand upright like the other style did, the old style with no picture.  I don't know why this is, but it bothers me enough to tell others about it.

review/text: This is one of my favorite teas.  Stash's mix of green tea and chai spice is the best I have found.  It is aromatic, yet milder than regular chai.  Tastes great both plain and with milk. This deal on Amazon is by far the cheapest way to buy it, especially if you "subscribe and save."  I drink this almost every day during the fall and winter, so it is a great opportunity to stock up.  If you enjoy green tea, this is a must have.

review/text: I've never had an iced tea that I like better, and I LOVE iced tea.  I make it in an iced tea maker using a little less ice/water than the markings on the carafe, and I use 6 tea bags which produces just slightly less than 2 quarts.  When it is done brewing, pour it over ice and be sure to squeeze in a little lemon which rounds out the flavors - it makes it the perfect beverage.  The fact that it is healthy is just a bonus!!  (If you don't have an iced tea maker, it's a really worthwhile, inexpensive investment if you drink a lot of tea)
