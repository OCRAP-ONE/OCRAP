review/summary: Vitamin Burst Strawberry Pomegranate Fruit Brew for Keurig Brewers
review/text: This stuff is awesome! Of course it's easily made by using a Keurig Brewer. To brew over ice with a Keurig(R) brewer follow these three easy steps:<br /><br />1. Fill a 16-oz. plastic cup to the top with ice and place on the Keurig(R) brewer. Do not use glass. Put a Brew Over Ice K-Cup(R) pack in the brew basket.<br /><br />2. Brew 6-oz. or 8-oz. for optimal flavor.<br /><br />3. The ice does the rest - stir and enjoy!<br /><br />There are 2 flavors:<br />-- Strawberry Pomegranate: Sun-warmed strawberries are paired with sweet pomegranates to create a delicious fruit brew.<br /><br />-- Acai Berry: A tasty combination of powerful super-fruit and luscious berries creates a refreshing fruit brew.<br /><br />Both contain antioxidant vitamin C as well as some other vitamins (check out the picture of the nutrition facts.)<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Sugar, Apple Powder, Dried Strawberry Puree, Citric Acid, Malic Acid, Dried Pomegranate Juice Concentrate, Natural Flavor, Dried Black Currant Puree, Beet Juice Concentrate (color), Reb A (Stevia Extract), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), D-Calcium Pantothenate (Vitamin B5), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), beta-Carotene (color), Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)<br /><br />Perhaps the only drawback is that sugar is the first item on the list, and thus you are consuming 17 grams of sugar. However if you compare a can of Coca-Cola, 12 ounces is 39 grams of sugar, with a 20 ounce bottle containing 69, so it is much less than that.<br /><br />I decided to compare the Vitamin Burst sugar content to the sugar content of some fresh fruit:<br /><br />apple 23g<br />banana 17g<br />peace 15g<br />strawberries 7g<br />and watermelon 18g<br /><br />If you compare Vitamin Burst Strawberry Pomegranate Fruit Brew with fresh fruit, Vitamin Burst fits right in there in how many grams of sugar.<br /><br />Vitamin Burst Strawberry Pomegranate Fruit Brew contains 40% of Vitamin C, 20% Niacin, 20% Vitamin B6, 20% Vitamin B12 and 20% Pantothenic Acid (also called B5). It does taste really sweet and it is really, really refreshing.

review/text: Love the laffy taffy.  But when I received this product, all of the protective plastic sealing was torn open (it actually looked torn open by a person as opposed to pressure breaking the seal).  Did not feel comfortable eating the product.  However, Amazon was great at quickly processing a refund.  I ended up buying the same product at the local Smart and Final for $4 less (around $9.00).  So the price of this product is much higher than it should be.

review/summary: Freddy Krueger, I've got your hand
review/text: Although my cat will play with this, I wouldn't recommend you purchase it.  The size is way big for me yet too small for my boyfriend, so it's difficult to manipulate comfortably.  A (much) longer, elasticized ribbed cuff would be better plus tailoring the fingers to actual human dimensions instead of all one length.  I'm kicking myself for not noticing that in the product pic.  The fingers have a rigid material (guessing plastic) that runs along a channel on top of each.  This allows you to wave the fingers for the cat. An elastic cord holding each bug to the finger also seems to run along the channel and will bunch up should the cat pull the bug for any distance.  The bugs themselves are cute and seem sturdy enough under supervision.  I would not allow my cat to play with this without me because there are too many little parts that could come off and tempt him.  Conceptually an interesting idea but the execution of this product is lacking.  I do plan to keep it tho since my cat enjoys the bugs.

review/summary: Fun to play with your cat & keep your hands safe!
review/text: Whenever I play with my cat my hands are always getting scratched. This glove  is a heavy canvas with long fingers so when the cat grabs at them your own hands receive minimal damage. There is a long spine (maybe plastic) in each finger which keeps each finger straight and the toys are actually attached with a retracting elastic cord so the cat can grab the toy, pull it out and chew on it, and then the toy snaps back to the finger tip. I've seen that the toys are replaceable too so when they get worn out (or eaten up) you can get new ones. I have a few toys by Fat Cat and they hold up well to play and washing, and I enjoy the color. Amazon has the best price and if you have Prime you don't pay shipping.

review/text: I bought two Catfisher Garden Mitts with the 4 mice lures, and my cat just loves, loves, loves them so much that the mice are all destroyed.  I thought I would try the insect one too.  He loves this a lot but not as much as the mice.  The insects make a crinkle sound that the mice do not, and because there are no feathers and string tails or body made of string, the insects have held-up signigicantly better.  I would buy this in conjuction with the mice lures just to have a back-up when the mice lures are destroyed, and you are waiting for replacements.

review/summary: Annoyingly Awkward
review/text: My cats generally love all toys made by Fat Cat.  I don't know if it's the catnip within or the vast array of colors, shapes, sizes and crinkly noises that attracts them.  All I know is that I'd never purchased a Fat Cat toy my cats didn't like.  Until this one, that is.<br /><br />I thought it would be perfect for interactive play, and if I had kittens, I probably would've been right.  They'll play with just about anything though.  Problem is, the glove itself is just plain awkward (very much in the style of Freddy Krueger), primarily because the fingers are twice as long as human fingers and you can't achieve much separation between them.  Oddly enough, all of my cats seemed to view having four toys simultaneously shoved in their face as an invasion of their personal space rather than an invitation to play.<br /><br />The good news is that after I removed the lures from the glove (which seemed to be well constructed and durable), they played with them on their own.  The bad news is that I paid far too much for those four tiny toys.

review/summary: Cat Fisher Garden Mitt
review/text: I liked this toy but my cat did not. It seemed well made and well thought out. The fingers have stiff plastic tubes that keep the actual toys away from your hand so the cat does not scratch your hand. There are elastic strings that keep the toys attached while allowing the cat to tug and play with each toy. The toys theyselves are adorable little insects that are actually pretty large.<br />I took my glove apart because the cat was not interested in it and hung the toys around the house. She enjoys batting them around when walks past them. I am afraid that she only gave the toy a one paw up review.

review/summary: A smooth and robust breakfast tea
review/text: I must admit to being a bit of a tea connoisseur.  I tend to like fragrant teas but I like a base of robustness to stand up to milk.  I have drunk the Yorkshire Gold tea in bags at the office, and I thought I'd try this as a base for mixing with my other teas.  I have to say that it is not as smooth and tasty as the Taylors of Harrogate Kwazulu, which Amazon also carries, but it certainly does the job of an above average black breakfast tea.  It's also fine alone but would do best in the English style cup with milk.

review/summary: One of the best breakfast teas
review/text: Yorkshire Gold is one of my favorite breakfast teas.  I like my tea strong, so I use two heaping measuring teaspoons for a 12 ounce tea pot.  After preheating the pot with boiling water for one minute, I empty the pot, add the tea, fill of the pot with boiling water and let the tea steep for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile I nuke a little milk in the microwave in my mug.  I then add the tea to my mug, together with a packet of Splenda.  The result is an excellent mug of breakfast tea, malty and rich tasting.  It may not be as refined in flavor as teas one can buy from a specialty tea website, but it's great for the price.

review/text: As a  black tea aficianado, I have tried them all, esp. in my efforts to find a tea for all time or one that I will return to again and again.  As fate would have it,I  stumbled upon Taylors and Harrogate Yorkshire Gold Tea while browsing in an English import shop. I bought a bag and loved it from my very first cup.  Although it's not organic which would give it 6 stars in my evaluation, it's deep in flavor and smooth and has become my everyday tea.  As cabernet is to red wine, as dark French roast is to coffee, as 70% chocolate is to chocolate, Yorkshire Gold is to tea.

review/text: I am loving the flavor of this tea! My Mom had some in tea bags that she gave me that I fell in love with. So much so that when I got to the bottom of the box, I horded the last tea bag because I didn't want to use it all up. After doing a search for this tea on the net, I was super pleased to find that Amazon carried it because my local grocery stores (and I checked all of them) didn't. I took a leap and got the big bag of loose tea and haven't been disappointed. I even got my husband and my Mother-in-law hooked on it. We got her a big bag for her birthday. Having spent time in Russia, both she and my hubby said this tea reminded them of the wonderful tea that they had there and hadn't been able to find anywhere in the US. This full bodied, rich black tea is good plain, sweetened, with cream, lemon or iced. I will never use lipton tea again for my Summer iced tea. There is no comparison. And I WILL be reordering. If this is what the English drink for tea time, I can see why they have to have it every day. Order it loose or in bags, you will not be disappointed.

I have preached its virtues to countless people in the aisles at Walmart, and have gotten several dozen people to try a can.  I have been a coffee snob for years, and since I can't afford my beloved Guatemala Antigua from a roasting house any longer, I buy many cans of South Pacific Blend.  I don't understand why companies don't just offer a couple of types now instead of trying to be all over the board "breakfast, classic, etc." It would keep costs down and people who are truly coffee lovers will quickly find what tastes good (without cheap filler beans) and stick by it.<br /><br />What I don't understand is why it seems to be unavailable in most grocery stores - I have to drive 50 miles to get it!

review/summary: Plump Pilchards
review/text: Everyone knows that Portuguese sardines are the best.<br /><br />Everyone, that is, except the sardines themselves, when they stray into Spanish territorial waters off the coast of Galacia, just north of Portugal.<br /><br />That's where these were nabbed. So while technically our conquistadores are Spanish, for all practical intents and purposes you can consider them Portuguese.<br /><br />Certainly, that's how they taste, and at a price significantly lower than you would pay for their cousins just across the border.<br /><br />Furthermore, these fish are presented in a decidedly upscale fashion. As we learn from the back of the carton, "Artisan fishing methods, old master cannery know-how and the highest quality ingredients produce a sardine that is moist, tender, and uncommonly flavorful".<br /><br />In addition, they are "hand packed" and "100 % natural".<br /><br />After all this my stomach's rumbling. Bring `em on!

review/summary: WOW!  Biggest little fish ever!  Healthy Breakfast in a Can!
review/text: I've started eating a can of these for breakfast on many days.  There are typically only three per can because they are so plump, but the can is still packed full, and they have a distinctively mild taste when compared to other canned sardines I've had.  Sure, they smell fishy, but it's not the "slap in the face with a cold fish" kind of fishy.  In fact, dare I say they taste almost...uh...fresh?<br /><br />Well, almost, but these are the best canned sardines I've ever had.  Hurray for Spain!

review/summary: A great, simple meal in a tiny can
review/text: OK, I know some people will find it hard to get excited about tinned sardines.  But these are excellent quality and well priced, fat and fresh, usually just three or four beheaded fish per tin.  If you occasionally get an uncontrollable urge for sardines in virgin olive oil, as I do, these will do it for you.  I plate them in their own oil, sprinkle them with minced meyer lemon zest or some brine-preserved lemon, piment d'Espelette, a teaspoon or so of aged sherry vinegar, a generous pinch of fleur de sel and some snipped Italian parsley and chives.  Toast and butter slices of baguette and put them in a basket on the side.  Slice up an apple, grab some Picholine olives, pour a glass of chilled Muscadet, and you have a really tasty and very healthy meal (mega omega-3 in them thar sardines!) in under ten minutes.  Now I'm hungry!

review/summary: Best sardines ever
review/text: My wife has been to Spain numerous times and has always returned with information<br />about food she has eaten while there, especially the "tapas." Aside from the small<br />Padron pappers (which I now grow), her comments about the Matiz Gallego sardines<br />made me eager to try them. I searched the web and finally decided on Amazon to buy<br />them, considering price and availability. This was well over a year ago, and have<br />been getting them ever since. I love sardines and these are the best I have ever<br />eaten; large pieces packed in olive oil, absolutely delicious , particularly with<br />fresh lemon juice over them and then mopping up the oil and juice with some great<br />bread. A must for sardine lovers!!!

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: We always have Clif Bars in our kitchen.  My hubby's favorite flavor is this white chocolate macadamia nut.  I also enjoy this flavor.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Made with a bunch of organic ingredients<br />- Nothing artificial<br />- Can taste the macadamia nut pieces<br />- Soft<br />- Fills me up and keeps me going when I cannot eat a real meal<br />- Has a nice overall flavor, moderately sweet, mildly nutty.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Could use some more white chocolate<br />- Makes me thirsty, must have a beverage with it<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />This is a pretty good flavor.  The macadamia nuts help deviate from the regular nut flavors typically found in this kind of food, like peanut and almond.  It could stand to use some more white chocolate, though, as that flavor isn't very prevalent.

review/summary: Delicious, chewy, white-chocolate, organic meal bar
review/text: This meal bar doesn't have as much protein as a Zone or Atkins meal bar, but the ingredients are organic, and it has no artificial sweeteners, which the meal bars which are highest in protein all seem to have. Each bar has 42 grams of carbs (4 grams of which is fiber), 7 grams of fat, and 9 grams of protein. It is sweetened with brown rice syrup, barley malt, and evaporated cane juice--which a great improvement over the corn syrup used by many other meal bars. The protein is from soy flour and roasted soybeans.<br /><br />This bar is relatively small and condensed providing perhaps 12 small bites or six large bites, but it is very filling. I carry one in my purse at all times, because you never know when you might need a healthy, emergency snack.<br /><br />The texture of all Clif bars is smooth and chewy, and most taste really good. They are not as sweet as candy or a bakery cookie, but definitely sweet enough to taste like a treat. There are many delicious flavors of Clif bars, but this one is my favorite. I am a big fan of both white chocolate and macadamia nuts.

review/summary: worked nicely,  but not when paired with the same brand shampoo
review/text: I like having 3-4 different shampoo and conditioners on the go,  so when I was offered this on Amazon vine,  even though I didn't know the brand,  I thought,  what the hey,  and ordered it.  I received a shampoo and conditioner that were the same brand but not identical titles. One thing I didn't like straight away was that it wasn't blatantly clear which was the shampoo and which was the conditioner,  I like to know without squinting at the bottles.<br /><br />I first used the conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo I received,  which had a slightly different title, claiming to help with colored hair (which I have)  I didn't like the first attempt at all,  my hair was flat and heavy and greasy. I always like hair products that increase volume.  I tried it with a different shampoo, not in the same range and my hair came out great,  moving nicely,  shiny and feeling nice.  So the shampoo didn't work but the conditioner did.  It's not the most amazing conditioner I've ever used but it's perfectly serviceable.  However,  when it ends I don't think I'll order another one.  I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053L60">Pantene Pro-V Conditioner, Sheer Volume - 13.5 fl oz</a> better.

review/text: My hair was so `fly away' that it had its own zip code. I tried many brands of conditioners.<br />This one worked best. I'm going to stick with this one. It's a winner.It also has a pleasant scent.<br /><br />The downside is the upside down tube. It's a little bit weird and the contents are difficult to squeeze out. Maybe that's why the opening is upside down; to make it easier to extract the contents.<br /><br />Other than that, I recommend you give Clear Scalp and Hair Conditioner a try.<br />You have little to lose because it's reasonably priced.<br /><br />Maybe you too will be able to say, "Welcome back beautiful hair; nice to see you again."

review/summary: A Guy's View
review/text: I've worn my hair at shoulder length for the last twenty years and also have a full beard (which I keep short but not that short).  One of the problems I have is with dry skin under my beard at my chin, between my eyebrows and especially at the sides of my forehead.  Most of the time I wear my hair back so that it's important that I'm not flaking all over my clothes.<br /><br />This stuff is thick.  Be careful when you squeeze it out of the tube because it has the consistency of yogurt.  That does make it a little difficult to spread around, so you need to rub it in your hands first then put it on strategic spots and then rub it into your hair.  A little extra water when your rubbing your hair (especially if its long) will help.  If not just use it on the crown of your head and a conditioning shampoo after.  It does have its' own conditioner so you can just was it out and leave your hair easy to comb.<br /><br />I didn't do anything unusual like washing my hair twice, and when I finished not only was my hair clean and tangle free but the skin under my beard was totally free of dry skin.  I even used some on the prickly-heat on my chest and the skin there looked like I had used and exfoliate (yes I know this stuff has a lot of the same ingredients).<br /><br />So more like 4.5 stars for me, great product.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz

review/text: I think it would be unfair to try to draw conclusions about a hair care product based upon how it works on one person. I tried the product once. Followed the directions. Found it was not as good as my present hair shampoo/conditioner. In my case (one cannot generalize from this experience), all I can say is that my hair obtained more body but at the expense of being more difficult to dry and style. Two days later and I had an annoying scalp itch and the beginning of a scalp condition. Took two times shampooing with my present product to clear up the itching and some dandruff like developments.  I do not think I will try any more hair care products under the Vine Program. Better to stick to books.

review/summary: Feels different than other conditioners.  Rinses clean.
review/text: This conditioner feels different to me than other conditioners.  Let me explain:<br /><br />Cheap conditioners go on slick but rinse off completely and my hair is left a tangled mess.<br /><br />Expensive conditioners (like tresemme or Loreal or Pantene) go on slick and leave a certain amount of slickness in and my hair is way more manageable, but you always wonder about the residue left behind.<br /><br />This conditioner doesn't really go on so slickly, and it washes away completely... and my hair is left somewhere in between the two other examples... not quite so tangled but not totally tangle free.  I have to add detangler when the shower is complete.  (I have very long, fine, curly/wavy hair.)<br /><br />The packaging would seem to indicate this product is more for a scalp treatment and not focused as much on the hair though.  But the conditioner has a nice feel to it and a nice light scent.<br /><br />I still think although I like the no residue feeling that I am so "conditioned" pardon the pun to like the slick feeling and no tangles that that is what my preference is even though I don't like the residue in my hair.  It's hard to break old habits.<br /><br />EDIT - I am now down to the last 1/3 of the bottle and I am having difficulty getting the product out.  This is a design flaw of the bottle I think.  The bottle is really thick and hard to squeeze it.  There isn't a good way to take the cap off either.<br /><br />I should note that I also got a bottle of shampoo from the same manufacturer and although this bottle of conditioner did NOT leak in transport - the shampoo did leak.  Something to note if that is a concern.  The leak was not much but it was a hassle to clean up.

I don't color or perm it or anything else like that --though my mother and sister say that's a mistake-- but I also don't need to.  During the summer my hair is crazy wild with nothing but humidity to urge it on.  (And I'm telling you this so you have an idea of exactly what I'm conditioning.)<br /><br />I used the Moisturizing Dry Scalp Shampoo that is the conditioner's partner and then the conditioner itself.  It went on more or less like Pantene conditioners.  It was thick and pearly.  I thought I might have had to rinse a little longer than normal to get it out... BUT I'm very pleased with the results.  I mean, I my hair looks great.  My librarian-wannabe locks are shiny and defrizzed and have stayed that way even after trips outside.<br /><br />This conditioner might be too heavy for winter, we'll have to see, but it's now my summer favorite.<br /><br />Pam T<br />mother and owner of a combo of Spanish/German hair.

I make sure not to use products that contains ingredients that will strip my hair of color or make it limp, lifeless and especially strip it of it's natural moisturizers.  Hair coloring can leave your scalp dry and itchy and  I normally do not wash my hair everyday since that can also strip your hair of natural oils.  I really liked the fragrance of CLEAR SCALP & BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner.  Once applied it lathered nicely was saturated my hair.  Rinsed off easily with no residue and left my hair soft, and shiny.  After just one use my scalp did not itch as much, it was not 100% itch free but not it was not as intense like it normally is.<br /><br />Water and cetearyl alcohol are the first ingredients listed. Cetearyl alcohol s a mixture of cetyl and stearyl alcohols that can come from vegetable or synthetic sources. They to eliminate the dryness that can occur in hair that has been styled with a lot of chemicals or with heat producing hair tools.  However, it does contain sulfate and sodium chloride which is good for hair loss but can dry, dull or strip hair color quicker.<br /><br />This is a good anti-itch conditioner to use in between my normal conditioner.  I will probably use it once every 8 to 10 days and especially after having my hair colored, but not after every shampoo since I worry that some of the ingredients may dull or strip my hair color if used to often.

review/summary: Shiny, Bouncy Hair
review/text: I usually do not have an itchy, dry scalp in the spring or summer (winter is another matter altogether). But due to a recent medical issue and the medication I received, my scalp has been very dry, itchy, and flaky for the past couple of months. So, I decided to give CLEAR SCALP & HAIR THERAPY MOISTURIZING DRY SCALP NOURISHING CONDITIONER a try, along with the shampoo of the same name. And I am pleased to say, that after just 7 days, the itching and the dryness have vanished. YAY!<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR THERAPY MOISTURIZING DRY SCALP NOURISHING CONDITIONER is extremely thick and creamy (almost like body lotion), with a pleasant light scent. Just a quarter-sized amount thoroughly coats your hair and soothes your scalp and then rinses away completely, leaving no residue. CLEAR SCALP & HAIR THERAPY MOISTURIZING DRY SCALP NOURISHING CONDITIONER moisturizes your hair and scalp, getting rid of flakes, fly-aways, and tangles. Your hair is left shiny and bouncy, not weighted down or greasy. For me, personally, my hair (which I color about once every 2 months) looks better than it has in a long time. WITH that added benefit of no itching. And, I have also noticed that if I just let my hair dry naturally (no blow dryer) that my hair has more volume. Again...YAY!<br /><br />Overall, I am very please with CLEAR SCALP & HAIR THERAPY MOISTURIZING DRY SCALP NOURISHING CONDITIONER, and would recommend it to anyone who has a problem with dry hair and itchy scalp.

Here, we all like it, but this conditioner is way too drying! How odd!<br />I cannot imagine why the company named it Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner.<br />It was terrible at doing its job--which would be to moisturize and condition ... unless I messed up, and don't HAVE a dry enough scalp, and therefore shouldn't have been using this product in the first place.<br />I would have given it two stars but I am still puzzled by the name DRY SCALP. Maybe it is my fault!<br /><br />By the way, all three products from this company arrived leaking. Even the last one to arrive, which came packaged differently (in a more protective hard box) was leaking, and the top was popped open. I have never had this experience with any other shipped product from Amazon.<br />The company who makes these products needs to go back to the drawing board on the design of the bottle.

review/text: Well, I bought this conditioner to go with the matching shampoo and I couldn't be more pleased.  I usually wash my hair every day.  Yeah, I know that may be a lot, but if I am going out then washing my hair is a must to get it to do what I want it to do.  I have dry scalp so I thought this shampoo and conditioner would help and it is brand new too.  I like trying new things!  This conditioner does a great job and leaves my hair silky smooth.  No tangles and it is not greasy.  It doesn't weigh my hair down like other conditioners that I have tried.  I would buy this again!

review/summary: Not the Best Choice for Me
review/text: I ordered a bunch of different products in this line to make a comparison between them.<br /><br />I think I was exposed to too much of whatever is now making me itch and break out all over. It started with my arms after washing and conditioning my daughter's hair in the sink (I had already washed and conditioned my own hair with different products from the line)...I noticed red spots along my arms, small bumps and itching. The kids saw red on my neck (which usually happens when I am allergic to something), but then it disappeared within an hour of first seeing it.<br /><br />For the last several years, my previous shampoos and conditioners were mostly PH balanced and all natural.<br /><br />These CLEAR beauty products have a "common thread" between the shampoos/conditioners, despite have slightly different smells...They are most abundant in ingredients that may initially detangle, but are drying and irritating on my hair and skin with accumulated usage/exposure. It is now clear that these products are not good for me to continue using.<br /><br />*Not the outcome I had hoped, but found a "silver lining:"<br /><br />When scalp became extremely dry as a result, with dandruff "raining down" to the touch, I did an internet search. I found that VINEGAR is an excellent conditioner. I used 1/2 vinegar/water-amazing results! My scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered-now soft to the touch instead of brittle.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I like the Clear Scalp because it actually manages to give a bit of the old feel back, without making my hair feel greasy as if I've left conditioner in it. I've used this for about a week now, and really like how it makes my hair look and feel. Definately worth a try if your trying to avoid that brillo pad head of grey hair like me.<br /><br />I used to have to worry about greasy, oily hair back in the day. I searched out shampoos that would dry out the scalp and leave my hair less oily. Well a handful of years ago I started to go grey, and when I went grey, I skipped right over the "salt & pepper" look and jumped from a dark brown to Bob Barker in what seemed almost overnight.<br /><br />Now, I didn't mind losing my hair color at a young age...at least I still had a full head of hair which is more than I can say for several friends, but what I hated was that the grey hair was of such a different texture and feel from my regular hair. It was coarse, dry and wiry. Suddenly shampoos like Head and Shoulders and Pert we too harsh, and my scalp felt brittle.

review/summary: Very rich conditioner, works well with matching shampoo
review/text: I have used this conditioner along with it's matching shampoo for a while now and using the two of them together really makes a difference with my dry and itchy scalp. The shampoo is thin but super rich and I really notice the added moisture to my scalp. The shampoo feels like it has conditioner in it as well. I usually wash my hair twice with the shampoo and then I use the super thick and rich conditioner and leave in on my hair for about a minute and then rinse. My hair is left very healthy, smooth and rich with moisture. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a nice scent. I have tried a variety of different Clear Scalp shampoo and conditioners but this set is one of my favorites.

review/text: My main problem with this line of products is how thick both shampoos and conditioners are, to the extent that it's hard to squeeze them out of the bottle. As for other qualities, it's just ok for my hair. This conditioner just doesn't detangle my hair, which is supposed to be one of the primary purposes of a conditioner.

review/text: In the interests of full disclosure, I received this item through Amazon Vine. However, I try extremely hard to write my reviews as if I had paid the full purchase price, for I think this is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this conditioner. It made my long (and somewhat dry) hair really soft and manageable. Over the years I have used a variety of products - from drugstore brands to high-end salon brands - and I think this is equivalent to even the most pricy products.  It smells *amazing* and I plan on buying a bottle when mine runs out.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: GREAT conditioner for fly-away hair!
review/text: While my MIL was visiting this awesome conditioner came in the mail for me to try out. She snatched it up before I even had a chance to try it.  She just ranted and raved about it and it ended up on the flight back with her!  Her hair was a thinner lightly permed white (she's in her 70's) and she loved the way it made her hair silky smooth without weighing it down.<br /><br />So I tried it as well and I also loved it. I have waist long medium/thick blonde hair that is straight and gets greasy really quick, but also has a tendency to be dry initially both on ends and scalp (and fly-aways are popular in my head of hair!).  So I loved how the conditioner eliminated all my fly aways and made my hair more attractive overall... plus conditioned my scalp so it did not get as greasy right away. I would give it a glowing 5 stars for that.  But the one thing I was wishing for is that it would be a deeper conditioning for my ends, which still seemed like they needed more.  So I ended up blending it with my other favorite conditioner: Pantene Long Lengths Replenishing Hair Mask.  I use the mask on the ends and halfway up, and I use this clear scalp conditioner all over.  Now my hair is perfectly smooth, light and moisturized. PERFECT!<br /><br />Also, I tried a couple different CLEAR SCALP types of conditioners and they just didn't work the same way as this one... so I would highly recommend trying this one if you are going to try any of them to control for dry or fly-away hair!

review/summary: Great smelling low priced conditioner
review/text: I coupled this with the matching shampoo and loved the results.  I don't have the money for the high priced salon hair care products so I'm always on the look out for something affordable that works magic on my hair. I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much from these products but I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only do I love how this feels while using it, it leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.  What I love the most is how it makes my hair smell, and the compliments I have received on how great my hair smells.  Who can deny that compliments are nice?<br /><br />I have found this available at my local grocery store for about the same price as a comparable size pantene or herbal essences. And to be honest I have like this shampoo and conditioner set enough to continue purchasing it after my trial bottle ran out.  I intend to continue using this product until I find something I like even more.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I recieved some sample packets of this product and the matching shampoo in the mail.  I was extremely impressed.<br /><br />My hair gets baked and beaten almost on a daily basis since I swim outside every day in the tropical sun.  Often I swim in the ocean.  What a tangled mess it can become.  There are times when no brush or comb will begin to go through it.<br /><br />I used this conditioner as I showered outdoors after coming out of the pool.  My hair immediately smoothed, softened and turned to silk, and a comb could glide through it no problems.<br /><br />When my hair dried it was full, and shine with tons of body.  I was amazed.  They have a great product here.  I plan to get a bottle of this to take to the pool and beach with me, and coat my dry hair with it before I enter the water, to protect it from damage, as my stylist recommended.  This is a fantastic conditioner.

review/text: I've been using Nexxus in my hair for quite some time now so I may be biased. This does the same thing as almost any conditioner that I've tried. Although it did not leave any greasy residue and did not dry out my hair, it did not leave me thinking that it was such a great product that I wanted to buy and use it again. It does have a very nice smell to it. Not overpowering at all. If you want something cheap that conditions then I definitely recommend this.

review/summary: Fresh Smelling Conditioner
review/text: I found this conditioner to be really thick (much like their shampoos) so I felt like I could get away with using less. It seemed to work fine. I put some on my palm, rubbed it in while in the shower and waited a few minutes. It rinsed clean and fairly easily, no left over residue, and left my hair smelling very fresh. I didn't see much difference in the way my hair acted in humid weather and such, because my hair has a mind of its own and can only be tamed by Treseme Mousse. Other hair products are child's play for my locks, which just laugh at my feeble attempts to break their spirit. And since my mane is very curly and thick, your millage may vary.

The consistency is creamy, not oily, and it doesn't seem to weigh my hair down.  This stuff seems to hurt more if it gets near my eyes, then other conditioners do.  I like it, but I won't order it again.  It lived up to its promises, but I just wasn't thrilled over it.  I will stick to my regular shampoo and conditioner.

review/summary: Good Product
review/text: This is a good conditioner.  It didn't leave my hair feeling greasy, which some conditioners do, even after rinsing them out.  Most importantly for me, it did not leave a scent in my hair, and the smell during use was extremely mild.<br /><br />Another nice aspect of this product is the container.  It has a completely flat bottom, so it rests easily in a shower caddy or on the corner of the tub.  The conditioner is dispensed from the bottom of the container, which means you don't have to shake it or leave it upside down to get some out.<br /><br />There is not anything amazing about this conditioner, but it is a good product that I would use again.

It's normal, but damages easily, especially near the tips.<br /><br />Using this with the matching shampoo works very well on my hair. My hair is sleek, soft and shiny. I've noticed using this line that there is actually less breakage and splits in my ends.<br /><br />I've been going through shampoo and non-shampoo methods for years, trying to find the best combination for my hair. This is the best choice so far for commercial shampoos, doing even better than the more expensive ones I've tried.<br /><br />It might be too conditioning for people who want body and fullness, leaving their hair limp.

review/summary: If anything, a little too lightweight
review/text: I keep my hair very short, and this conditioner was so light that, if anything, it made my hair a bit too fluffy. A very smooth, soft, nice-to-run-my-fingers-through sort of fluffy, but still fluffier than i'm used to.<br /><br />Using this with the matching shampoo, i did experience a reduction in dry scalp symptoms, so it seems to deliver on the 'dry scalp nourishing' promise.<br /><br />My two problems with this conditioner are both pretty trivial.<br />1) The conditioner comes in smaller bottles than the shampoo. No woman i've ever known goes through conditioner more slowly than shampoo, so having the conditioner come in a smaller bottle is a little strange.<br />2) The smell. It's generic perfume-y, and awfully sweet. But it doesn't last after my hair dries, so it only troubles me in the shower.

review/summary: Great Conditioner!
review/text: This is a really nice conditioner.  It does appear to add some nice soft shine to your hair without making it look greasy or coated.  I always find with a conditioner that they either produce buildup, which weights down or can actually "flatten" the appearance of your hair, or they tend to be very greasy.<br /><br />This conditioner does neither.  It rinses out easily, so your hair doesn't feel coated, and it leaves your hair looking "healthy" with a soft sheen.<br /><br />It also feels like tangles are easy to comb out on longer hair.<br /><br />As far as how it feels on your scalp, I do notice my scalp doesn't feel dry or itchy, something that I do sometimes feel in weather extremes, like the summer heat and sun, lot so swimming in chlorinated pools, the ocean, etc.<br /><br />Ingredients are typical of a conditioner.  The product is not "store brand" cheap in price, but nor is it "salon expensive."  It's fairly inexpensive, especially considering it yields top quality results.<br /><br />So for the price and results I would give this product a try!

After only a few days using this nourishing shampoo and conditioner together I found that I was running my fingers through my hair. That's not a normal thing for me to do because I swim a lot and usually my hair feels like straw. Not so using this combination! The conditioner is thick and rinses out pretty well; although my hair still feels a little slippery after rinsing.<br /><br />I still find myself running my fingers through my hair; definitely a winner for me! :-) I would suggest trying the shampoo and conditioner together. I definitely recommend this highly if you want soft silky hair like mine now feels! :-)

review/text: I love this new line of hair care products from Clear Scalp. The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner goes perfect with the Clear Scalp Shampoo that I am currently using. This conditioner smells great and my hair feels extremely soft and healthy. I love the shape of the bottle which makes it easier to store if you need the space. I know that this is nourishing my scalp but you surely will see the difference in your hair within a week because my hair already feels quite voluminous in just this short period of time.<br /><br />I also use the Clear Scalp &Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm to help provide my scalp with moisture as well as nourishment. I am in love with this conditioner and will definitely continue to use this in my hair. I like that I can maintain a healthy head of hair without spending a ton of money.

review/summary: Just ok
review/text: This conditioner is very thick and rich. It smells really good and rinses easily. The moisturizing and detangling ability is fair at best, though. I would have liked to see better performance in those areas. I don't think it should be called a "moisturizing" conditioner - at least not in my case.<br /><br />Usually with a moisturizing conditioner, I see better results. I had to use ALOT of this conditioner at a time, and use a leave-in conditioner afterwards. With my normal shampoo & conditioner, I only use the leave-in once or twice a week at most, but with this I had to use the leave-in everyday.<br /><br />I used this along with the matching shampoo and saw no improvement with dry scalp issues. Now, I do not have full blown dandruff or severe dryness either... just a little dryness and itch at times.<br /><br />My hair is long, to my waist and very wavy/curly. It is a little dry, but not severely and not damaged. This pair may work better for someone with a different hair texture and quality, perhaps, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone with hair like mine, based on my experience with it.

But if you want a good scalp nourisher, you might want to explore another route.<br /><br />I've used this conditioner around the same time as two other Clear Scalp & Hair products. Maybe it's because I'm not an expert, but I didn't see much of a difference between the three. They are great values though.<br /><br />If your scalp is dry to the point that you might want to seek a more effective solution. I doubt this product will cure your problems. That doesn't detract from it completely though, it's still a nice conditioner.

review/summary: Smells nice, works well in the shower to detangle.
review/text: I used this in conjunction with the Clear Scalp Shampoo.<br /><br />It might seem ridiculous to have some dandruff as well as oily hair. My hair gets oily in about 3 days. I try to not wash more than every 3, to not dry out my hair on the ends. This means I do get some dandruff.<br /><br />I loved the scent and design of the bottle. It was smooth and thick, which I like in conditioner. I need it because while I have thick hair, the individual hairs are very fine and when not using conditioner, I have awful tangles and flyaway hair. The shampoo alone did a nice job, but it left my hair a little lacking after rinsing. If I hadn't had a conditioner, I sure would have needed one. I used it mainly on the ends, trying to avoid my scalp.<br /><br />After air drying, my hair was shiny and silky. However in a day, I noticed more oil than normal on my scalp and hair near my roots. In 2 days, I found myself needing to wash my hair, when typically I can do another day. So while it might have made my hair feel good immediately after the wash and condition, it wasn't a good fit for me on a regular basis.<br /><br />I am now trying to use it without the shampoo to see if this makes any difference.

I shampoo & condition daily despite being told "its not good" well, I've done it all my life and I still get complimented on how healthy my hair is, so...<br /><br />This conditioner smells wonderful.  Floral and fresh were my initial thoughts. It felt thick, easily coated my hair with just a dime sized amount and rinsed out cleanly.<br /><br />Afterwards my hair felt soft, nourished and smelled fantastic.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just easy to please, but this new line of shampoo & conditioners has me hooked!

I am not really sure if it has helped at all with my scalp, but my hair does feel nice after I use this conditioner.  It also smells pleasant, but not remarkably so.

review/text: How much can I say about a hair conditioner?  I buy really expensive stuff at my salon which is better, but it's like 5 times the price.  Of course, a bottle lasts months, so it's worth it.  But I tried this and it was pretty darn close.  So 5 stars all around!

review/summary: Quality conditioner.
review/text: We chose to try out the Clear Scalp & Hair conditioner to see if it's all it claims to be. Both my wife and I have used it, and I would have to say it's lived up to expectations. The conditioner is not as thick as the Clear Scalp & Hair shampoo that they recommend using with it for best results. We've found that the conditioner lathers up well and leaves our hair feeling smooth and refreshed. It has a pleasant smell which isn't overpowering, so both men and women alike should be able to use it with no problems or hesitation. Overall, using this over the past couple weeks in combination with the Clear Scalp & Hair shampoo, we've been mostly happy with the results. Definitely a worthwhile product to try and see if it's right for you.

review/summary: Excellent conditioner for fine hair...detangles fairly well...
review/text: I'm the one with a dry scalp but my hair is rather coarse so conditioner isn't as much of an issue.  On the other hand our 3 daughters (4/6/9 years old) all have long fine hair.  This summer has been harsh - pool chlorine and lot of sun and sunscreen means really nasty dry hair that's even crunchy when wet and tangles like the dickens.<br /><br />This stuff works well to restore the oils stripped out without leaving too much residue.  We try not to rinse it out too much so there's still some detangling to it.<br /><br />Four stars - I think that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SKXL5I">Paul Mitchell The Detangler, Super Rich Conditioner, 10.14-ounce</a> is better for conditioning and detangling.  If you really need some hard core detangling I'd recommend  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GQ6F4I">Garnier Conditioner, Sleek and Shine, 13 Fluid Ounce</a>. but it does leave more oil in as residue - that's what gives it the shine.  Too much and it can leave hair a little flat.<br /><br />If you have any questions, comments, or if you found this review helpful, please let me know!

review/summary: A good choice for thick hair
review/text: I have thick hair which was recently cut from very long to shoulder length. Prior to the haircut, I always needed to use a super thick conditioner to keep control over it, because in addition to being long and thick, I also color it every 6 weeks. After getting my hair cut, I didn't need quite as thick of a conditioner (think like a jar of body butter lotion). But very light weight conditioners (like Suave) would make my hair a tangled mess. This Clear Scalp conditioner is a great middle ground. It's slightly thicker formula works well on my thick hair to control it, but it's not a deep conditioner like I used to use that would now just weight my hair down. I would suggest this for people with medium hair, thick hair, colored hair and graying hair. Anyone with very fine hair my find this formula weighs their hair down more than they would like. The only real issue I have with it is that the bottles of shampoo and conditioner don't always ship well. I ordered 4 bottles of Clear Scalp shampoo/conditioner, and 2 our of the 4 bottles had leaked some in transit. The bottles are packaged in plastic bags to help in case they so leak, but when it came to my orders, 50% of them were leaking in some way upon arrival. So it's possible there is something about the bottles design that causes them to be more likely to leak than others.

review/summary: Good conditioner, questionable bottle
review/text: This conditioner has a mild scent and has the consistency of hand lotion. It applied easily and washed out without a problem. Overall I am pleased with it. But I can't say that about the bottling.<br /><br />The flip-spout is located on the bottom of the bottle. So it will either leak over time or get an accumulation from use and piddle on whatever counter you store it on. I realize that the idea was to be able to avoid shaking it like a catsup bottle. Additionally, since their shampoo bottle has the flip-spout on the top, this helps to avoid grabbing the wrong bottle. But it is a problem you likely will have to deal with.

review/summary: Smells great, works okay, great price
review/text: This is at a great price point. I do think that using it long term is the key. At first blush, it smells heavenly. All of their products do! I don't enjoy conditioners that smell like flowers or fruit per se, I like the ones that smell like good salon products. This conditioner fits the bill there! Plus, at just $5 it's a great price point for all those good ingredients. I will say that my hair felt good at first rinse, not goopy or like I had to turn up the heat to get this out of my hair. It was a few hours later when I decided that it did, however, leave a slight film on my hair and that my hair just wasn't as soft as it is when I use my favorite conditioner.

review/summary: Comparable to Herbal Essence
review/text: I've been using the moisturizing version of Clairol's Herbal Essence conditioner (the one that comes in the blue bottle) for years now.  When I saw this conditioner, it sounded relatively comparable, so I thought I'd check it out.  I've been using it for the week it supposedly takes to give me stronger, more beautiful hair, but I haven't noticed any difference.<br /><br />I have fairly short, thick, dry hair that curls just enough to be nearly unmanageable if I let it grow too long.  As long as my hair is really short, I usually just shampoo and condition, and then comb my hair lightly into place and it works.  As my hair gets a bit longer I often use a mousse or leave-in conditioner as my hair is still rather dry even with the moisturizing products.  This product has been working pretty much the same way.  My hair is just on the cusp of getting too long, and if I just shampoo and condition, this product leaves my hair a bit flighty.<br /><br />This product looks, feels and works much like Herbal Essence, except that it's white in color rather than blue.  It has a thick, rich feel to it.  The product rinses nicely from my hair, leaving it noticeably softer.  It has a decent, mild, floral scent.  Despite the claim that it helps dry scalp, I have not noticed any change in this product from Herbal Essence, either during the conditioning process or afterwards.<br /><br />This product comes in a bottle that has a wide, flat base that doubles as product dispenser.  Personally I would prefer a container that could be stood on either end.  It is helpful to store the product on its cap as it's getting low, but when the bottle is full, storing it on its cap tends to produce a rush of product when the valve is opened, which results in much more product than I need, and there's no way to return the excess to the bottle.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a good product, but not necessarily better or worse than Herbal Essences.  Whether or not I would buy this in the future will depend solely on pricing - I would buy whichever one is cheaper

review/summary: Good Conditioner, Floral Fragrance
review/text: The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. How does this accompanying Dry Scalp conditioner hold up?<br /><br />FRAGRANCE<br /><br />Similar to cheap children's perfume. While it is not overpowering, it does linger all day and I think a simple "clean" smell would be preferable.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br /><br />The texture is creamy and easy to spread through long hair.<br /><br />CONDITIONING<br /><br />The name implies that this is a deep conditioning product, and I think it lives up to that claim.  My hair is soft and manageable, without being greasy.  This may even work well during the winter.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />Clear Dry Scalp conditioner is a good conditioner hampered by a cheap floral fragrance.

The conditioner was appropriate and didn't leave my hair feeling heavy or oily, in fact my hair passed my personal "squeak test" afterwards.<br /><br />So, while I still have a personal preference for conditioning shampoos, this is a very nice combination, with a pleasant scent.

I love the smell, it's light and stays with you for a long time. The products labels are clear and concise though I noticed that the ingredients weren't an obvious find. Further investigation led me to find a peel-able label that reveals the ingredients AS WELL AS the actual sent of the product--very unique. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a conditioner with a light, pleasant fragrance.

review/summary: Good Not Great Conditioner
review/text: My hair is long and easily tangled. One thing I especially want in a conditioner is a product that will let me effortlessly comb through my hair after shampooing and conditioning. This product was not quite as good as Pantene in this area. My hair also seemed to frizz more than with Pantene.<br /><br />The conditioner is thick and has a nice scent. It is especially designed for itchy scalps which is not something I suffer from. People with that condition might find this product more useful than I did.

review/text: The Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Conditioner is a fair product. It works great at smoothing and making hair feel softer it however does not keep that soft and smooth feeling as long as other products I have tried. The fragrance to this is fair but I did not personally like it. I liked that the conditioner itself is thick enough to spread and work into the roots and ends of the hair. The bottle is easy to grip and use in the shower and is wide enough to sit without tipping over easily.

review/summary: Goodbye tangles and itchy, dry scalp...
review/text: Every summer my hair and scalp seems to get very dry which makes my scalp itchy. I've been using this Shampoo and Conditioner for a week now and I've noticed a huge improvement already. The itchiness was gone after the very first use and my hair feels so much healthier now as well.  This Conditioner sure helps in the tangle department as well.  It makes my hair tangle-free and so incredibly soft.<br /><br />I've been having my 10-year-old daughter use these products as well and she keeps going around telling everybody to feel how soft her hair is now. The chlorine from the pools sure drys her hair out in the summertime but after using these products it seems to help out tons. The Conditioner sure helps those awful tangles that she's always fighting.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that the scent is something to rave about but it's not bad either.  The Conditioner seems to smell a bit better than the Shampoo does.<br /><br />I really like how much healthier and softer our hair is after using this product and I would recommend it.

review/summary: The Price is Right
review/text: I have very long thick hair and have been coloring it for years, so no matter how often I get my hair trimmed most of it is dry and fairly fragile. Although the aroma of this product is a little lighter than the others products of this line that I have tried, it is still a little over-powering for my taste.  My hair scent clashes with my perfume.  I hate that and that is why I try always to purchase fragrance free products.<br /><br />But that issue aside- this product seems to do what it claims to do.<br /><br />I'm always looking for an inexpensive product that may be the equivalent of a salon product. Well I'm sorry there just aren't any, but this conditioner comes slightly closer than most.<br /><br />I did seem to see less hair in my comb as I was combing my hair out after my shower, my scalp seems to bee less dry  and my comb ran through my hair quite easily.<br /><br />After drying and using the heated flate iron on my hair it appeared silky, somewhat shiny and was quite  easy to manage.

review/summary: works well on my fine hair
review/text: Shampoos and conditioners are so tricky to review because everyone's hair responds so differently to different products. I have long, straight, baby-fine hair, and this makes my hair very soft. I normally use all-natural conditioners so I find the scent stronger than I'm used to, but as long as my hair is out of my face (say, in a pony tail), it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />So hopefully that's useful to someone else out there with long, straight, baby-fine hair!

review/summary: This with the shampoo is my new duo.
review/text: I washed with the shampoo for moisturizing dry hair by clear. I was very happy with the way it lathered and rinsed. I then followed with this conditioner. I left in on for about 5 min as I took a slow massage shower. It rinsed out well and left my hair feeling silky.<br /><br />To give the ultimate test I let it air dry about till 80% dry and it was going a bit frizzy so I finished with the cool dryer and then a very low setting ceramic ceramic hot iron. My hair looks the best it has for months since it came it frizzy after losing about 1/4 after an illness. It is not total frizz free but this is only one use. It claims 7 days I think it can happen.<br /><br />I don't have to wash everyday so 7 washings will be more than 7 days.<br /><br />I will buy this again and the price cannot be beat. Better than anything a salon has ever used on me.

review/text: This conditioner is acceptable; it leaves hair soft and smooth initially, but after a couple of splashes of river water later on in the day, it felt like I was wearing a hair helmet, albeit soft.<br /><br />The bottle has a curved top, in order to distinguish the conditioner from its shampoo counterpart. The matching shampoo sits on either its base or its cap, whereas the conditioner must be set on only the cap. I hope that it's not just a matter of time before it falls down onto some toes.

review/summary: A Little Scenty
review/text: I used this conditioner after I washed my hair with the shampoo that is supposed to be it's partner (Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Moisturizing Dry Scalp").  It was nice and viscous and I used a dollop about the size of quarter.  I worked through my wet hair and left it on for about two minutes.  It rinses out easily and my medium long hair was easy to comb out.  I blew it dry and the texture of my hair was soft and smooth.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that it is kind of strong on the scent.  Even several hours later I can still smell it in my hair and I'm not partial to anything with perfume.  But if you like a scent that lasts a long time then this would be good to use.

review/text: I've been spending a good deal of time outside and in the chlorine with the kids, and the hair has definitely felt the heat and abuse.  I'm fair-skinned and have had some sunburns on my scalp as well, and it's hard to find a product that does not irritate my scalp when the sunscreen fails.  This one is great!  I really like the fragrance, and it's done a good job of providing moisture without irritating my skin or making my hair look too greasy.  My hair has been tending towards the frizz recently, and after one week of using this conditioner, it does seem to be laying straighter and 'behaving' better.  The cost is about the same as any other conditioner I've tried, and the results have been better. So far, I'm very pleased!

I love the feel of it on my scalp as I leave it rubbed into my hair while I finish the rest of my shower.  It feels nice and creamy in my hair and rinses out cleanly.  Some of these other products are harder to get out of your hair and you feel that they are leaving a residue on your hair.  Not this one.  This is also a recommend to buy.  Don't think you'll regret it at all.  Enjoy

review/text: There isn't a lot I can say about conditioner, but after using this product (along with the moisturizing dry scalp shampoo) I noticed that my scalp was much less dry and itchy.  The conditioner is very thick and works well on my hair.  I did notice my hair was a bit flat when using it, but that is to be expected with any heavy conditioner.  One good thing is that the bottle is designed to be stored upside down.  This is important when working with a very thick product.  Overall, it seems to do what it was designed to do though.
