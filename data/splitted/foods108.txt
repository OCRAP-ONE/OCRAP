review/summary: Love them!
review/text: I like crunchy snacks.  I'm eating low carb because my doctor advises it, and this helps fill the "popcorn spot" in my life.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about this product.  It's economical.  They cook up fresh whenever you want them, and they taste fresher than the ones you buy pre-popped in a bag.  They don't have MSG like the Lawry's brand, and they don't come with a lot of extra packaging.<br /><br />If you are a low carber looking for pork rinds to cook with, these aren't heavily seasoned, so they won't influence your recipe's flavor.  I like their clean flavor, but it's not hard to add seasoning if you want to experiment or you like more variety.  A little bit of oil or butter will serve as the "glue" to hold your Parmesan cheese, seasoned salt, etc.<br /><br />There is a bit of a learning curve involved in terms of discovering how long they take in your microwave, but by now I know by feel what size handful to grab and how long to nuke them. It's worth the effort to get to know these.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: A considerably healthier alternative to deep fried pork rinds
review/text: These pork rinds fry in their own fat rather than having to be deep fried which is a lifesaver if you like pork rinds. I'm not the biggest fan, but sometimes I'm kind of hungry and these pack way more protein than the average fatty snack. The only problem is the type of fat it's fried in--melted pig fat from the skin itself! Not particularly healthy, but it's much healthier than the mexican bagged varieties.<br /><br />Since we don't have a microwave (oh my god, how do we get by without one?!), we toast them in a toaster oven on a baking tray for about 10-15 minutes at 375F-400F. They come out great. If you lean closer to 10 minutes, you get a crunchy-porky tasting snack, while if you go past 15, you'll get the typically super-puffed pork rind you'd expect from Cardenas. I can't comment on how well they crisp in the microwave, but I expect it should yield the same results.

review/summary: Not bad, not bad at all
review/text: Being a long time fan of the piggy skins, and having tried a "microwave bag" version of u-cook-em rinds, I wanted to try something that wasn't drowning in packaging. And I'm happy with these tasty nuggets. I find in my fairly powerful microwave that i have to run a small plate of the condensed pieces (as they're shipped) for at least 1:45 (package says try 90 seconds to start) and I don't think it's my imagination that after these are taken out of the nuke chamber, they start to contract a bit.<br />But, when you consider that you can get a fresh, hot plate of puffy rinds in very short order, these are well worth the price. Of course you can get a trash-bag full of rinds at warehouse stores and other venues for a couple few bucks but for fresh eating at home, the only thing I'd compare these to is fryin' up a batch and these are hugely more convenient.<br />On a 10 point scale, I'd give these a 7 but on the Zon's 5 star system, I have to go with 4.

review/summary: Crispy Crunchy and Well Seasoned
review/text: If you like fresh pork rinds these do a great job and hit the spot. They require no extra seasoning, or preparation. Dump a handful on a plate. Spread them out a little bit so they have room to breathe, and pop them in the microwave. A little while later you have perfectly seasoned pork rinds nicely salted. If you want to add a little flavor, a bit of hot sauce does wonders.<br /><br />I would like to warn you however you need a certain wattage microwave. I originally tried in a 700W microwave and I got partially popped pork rinds which looked like crackling/pork rind hybrids and tasted horrible. I'm not sure what the minimum wattage would be, but a 1200W microwave made perfect pork rinds. I would suggest you put your first batch in, set it for 5 minutes, but then watch the batch closely to get the proper timing down for your microwave. Adjust slightly for larger and smaller batches.<br /><br />For alternatives to the microwave I also tried using the oven which works but takes more time than I'd like. If you don't, or can't use a microwave, frying in a little oil is a great option for these pellets as well, and makes tasty batches extremely quickly.

review/summary: What am I missing?
review/text: Everyone seems to enjoy these so I think maybe I'm missing something.  I microwaved them for slightly less time than instructed and only about 1/5 of them changed consistency from the little flat parallelograms to a slightly puffier flat paralleogram.  Next batch I did a little longer and a couple more of them puffed up a little bit.  Even the puffy ones seem to have patches of tremendously hardened pork(don't laugh) in them to a point where when you eat one and there are pork rind shards that break away from the puffy.  I tried one last time and microwaved them for a minute and a half longer than instructed and this time the puffy ones overcooked and burned and the others stayed in tiny, hard form(again, don't laugh).<br /><br />If anyone that orders these and learns any tips that I might be missing, please let me know. They will be in their resealable package in the pantry until that point or they expire.<br /><br />Thanks.

review/summary: Deep fryer saves these pork rinds
review/text: These arrived quickly.  I was eager to try them.  I put less than 1/4 cup on a paper plate and microwaved on high for 2 min.  Several of them were puffing up, but many needed more time, so I added 1 1/2 min.  Finally took them out.  The few that puffed correctly were good, however, many were still hard.  I have a new microwave, but perhaps its wattage is not high enough. I heated some lard in my fryer and tossed the under-cooked ones into the hot fat.  They puffed some more, and some of them were edible.  Then, I put a few of the uncooked chips in the fryer, and finally I had the pork skins I was hoping for! Hot, puffed, crispy, delicious. I used a spider to keep them in the oil until puffed all the way through. I would order these again for use in my fryer.

review/summary: Cooking Tip
review/text: Like many others, had trouble with the rinds puffing up.  Inital try had many unpuffed  pieces, and the pieces that puffed, had rock hard ends.  Microwaves pretty much work by heating the water in your food, so if the amount of humidity in your pork rinds is too low, they won't heat up enough to puff.  I took about 1/4th of a paper towel, wet it and lightly squeezed out the excess so it was not dripping wet, then put it in the bag with the pork pellets overnight.  The next day, the paper towel was dry, so I guess that the rinds absorbed the extra moisture.  When I tried to cook them again, they puffed up much much better and in less time.  There were only two or three unpuffed pieces, and one or two rock hard ends.  I also got good results by soaking them in water right before microwaving, but the papertowel method is easier with less mess.  Just be carefull that you don't make the inside of the bag too humid then you may have to worry about spoilage.

review/text: After wasting many batches of these nuggets I finally got them to puff up properly and was excited to try some that were not still rock hard.<br />What I found was that the texture is not very appealing and they smell horrific. I know most pork rinds smell funny but these were extremely pungent and the after taste was even worse.<br /><br />I ended up just throwing away the whole bag because I was not interested in ever having that taste in my mouth again.<br /><br />Great idea. Was excited to try..  but these just fell way short.

review/text: These pork rinds are SO easy to prepare - and they are delicious.  Much tastier than store-bought in a bag.  I put them on a napkin on a small saucer and pop them into the microwave for two minutes.  They usually come out hot and fluffy.  But be careful, the saucer will be awfully hot to handle.  I take two hot pads to get them out of the microwave and place the saucer on another hot pad to let the skins cool.  When cool, what we don't eat right away I put into a small ziploc bag to enjoy later.  Mostly, though,  they don't last very long.  If you like pork skins, you will truly enjoy these.

review/summary: Deeelish!
review/text: Since starting my low carb diet, I've been missing some crunch in my life and these guys definitely fill the void.  I love that they are microwaveable and quick to make when I'm having a snack attack!  I haven't had any problems with them puffing up as other reviewers have had, but I sprinkle mine with a little bit of vinegar (I have an undying love of salt n vinegar chips) and they puff right up.  If you're not a vinegar person, try wiping them with a damp paper towel or sprinkling water on them first.  I've found the two minute cook time to be true to form even though I don't cook as many as they say a serving is on the package. It is also true that they crunch up more if you let them sit for a few minutes after coking (and listening to them still snap crackle and pop is fun too!)  I think I'm going to try using some other flavorings on them soon as well.. maybe some ranch seasoning sprinkled on there?

review/text: This is a good idea in theory but doesn't work well in practical application.  The things do not all cook property.  About half of them are puffed, some are partially puffed and the rest won't puff no matter how much you cook them.  I follow instructions, measure and have a good microwave.  I usually have to cook twice as long as stated to get any puffing at all.  The flavor is ok but just awful compared to commercial pork rinds purchased in the grocery store.  I also end up with very little that I can eat out of a batch.<br /><br />They also taste just awful.

review/text: I was excited to try these Pork Rinds and so when they came, I popped some in the Microwave immediately.  If you are a traditional Pork Rind Lover, these are probably not for you.  They have the consistency of a Rice Cake.  Although they taste like a pork rind, it is not the same as the "feel" of a pork rind.  There is no "air" pockets, or crackling sensation that you get with holding a "regular" rind in your mouth.  I am sure these are great for some, but I am just not ready to call this good.  I gave my bag to a friend.  Lesson Learned.

review/summary: Good Pork Rinds
review/text: These pork rinds taste very good and it's a great value. I have found that the trick to cooking these is to not put too many on a plate at once. Literally 10 - 12 "disks" is the max I cook at once and they turn out great. I have found that if I try to cook too many at once they either take a very long time to puff up (5 minutes) or when they cook, they don't puff all the way, leaving the hardened bits that previous reviewers mentioned. Once you get the cooking down right, they're a great snack!

But this bag goes a long way. These nuggets are great! I've had the microwave pork rinds in a bag and these are far superior. Cooking a few or a lot is an easy task. They really cook up nice and tender. The first time I cooked these I thought the ends were burning so I stopped the microwave. Actually, the ends had not cooked. Allowing more cooking time (about 90 sec.) produces delicious, hot pork rinds. Highly recommended if you like pork rinds.

review/text: Yes, people will tease you when you talk about loving microwave pork rind, but they're tasty enough to endure it. The directions on the bag are fine, but not the way I do it. Put a heaping 1/3 of a cup of the greasy pellets in a brown paper lunch bag. Lay the bag on its side in the microwave. Now, it's time to get to know your microwave. For mine, it takes 2 and a half minutes for all of the pellets to "pop" perfectly. If you still have unpopped pellets, try a little longer. Too long and they'll taste a little burnt. Amazon is wonderful, as always, to offer them cheaper and faster than anywhere else! Enjoy!

review/summary: Made both of my dogs sick!!
review/text: I gave each of my two dogs one of these bones after I picked them up grocery shopping on Monday evening. By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding, of course) and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water. She had diarrhea on the carpet in MULTIPLE areas while I was at work, and then two more times during the night. She was very lethargic and unable to keep any food down at all. Meanwhile, my other dog has now gotten horrible diarrhea as well. Wednesday morning I made them some boiled eggs, but the one dog that was already throwing up ended up losing her breakfast a short while later. I gave her white rice with a little bit of chicken stock for dinner that night and she held that down. But sometime during the night, one of the dogs had diarrhea in the house again! Today is Thursday and both dogs are still loose, but (knock on wood)it seems like the vomiting is under control. I called the vet and she said to split an Immodium AD between the two of them and make sure they are drinking plenty of water, which they have been all through this debacle! I will keep my fingers crossed that my carpert will still be clean when I get home. I will never, ever buy another Hartz product again!

It turns out that that big green body on this tool is just filled with a spring and a rod, and you can't load it with cheese.  You can only fit enough cheese into a very small chamber for about one olive.  So you have to fill this little chamber with cheese by hand, and then it presses it into the olive.  Then you have to do it all over for your next olive.  You might as well just stuff the olive my hand instead of stuffing the stuffer.  It's kind of a weird concept.  It just doubles the time it would take you to get your olives ready.  If they could make one of these with a big chamber that could hold lots of cheese, we'd be in business!

review/summary: Stuffing By Hand is Faster - Avoid
review/text: Used this piece of junk to stuff olives with blue cheese for martinis. After two olives it bacame clear that the Olivator was not up to the task. It's poorly-designed (falls apart) and much slower than stuffing the olives by hand. It cannot handle sticky material like blue cheese and then you have to clean it.

review/summary: No more stinky fingers
review/text: Just purchased one on vacation and it works as I imagined with either block or crumbled blue cheese. Just stab the blue as it sits in the container several times until the barrel is full (thats what the slit in the side is for, to see when its full) then insert into your queen olive and press the plunger. Never have to touch the cheese and i just stuffed 15 olives in about a minute. Dont be stupid and hand stuff the barrel, just push into your tub of crumbles several quick jabs. With block its even easier. Simple disassembly makes cleaning a snap. Just go to Walgreens and get some pipe cleaners to run through the barrel while rinsing under water. The plunger just rinse and wipe. Couldn't be any easier or more effective. Just bought another one for my brother.

review/text: This salt is so good, you could almost eat it plain. I am telling you, sprinkling this with your fingers onto salads, chicken, fish, is amazing. Definitely don't waste this by cooking it, where you could use regular salt. This salt needs to be tasted as it really brings out the flavour of food in a really beautiful way. This is meant to be sprinkled on foods after they have cooked -- roasted chicken for example, or on raw vegetables like tomatoes or cucumbers. This is the Foodie's Salt!<br /><br />Now, I have noticed this salt is easier to buy in the regular grocery stores, so if you can, buy it there where it is cheaper to do so.

review/summary: No Lattes for Me
review/text: Don't care for creamy cappuccinos.  And you won't find me sipping a double mocha cinnamon latte that costs half a paycheck.  As far as I'm concerned espressos are for those shoppers with ten items or less.  Just pour me a cup of rich, hot coffee, brewed in a Mr. Coffee or a Bunn.  And if the coffee being brewed is FOLGERS CLASSIC ROAST GROUND COFFEE, I know I'm going to enjoy every drop.<br /><br />Folgers, an American fixture in kitchen pantries for generations, boasts about its mountain grown coffees.  I know this because Mrs. Olsen told me (and you oldtimers will know what I'm talking about).  Thing is, there's nothing better in the morning than waking up to the rich aroma of Folgers Classic Roast brewing in the coffee maker; it's one of the most recognizable aromas to stir the olfactories.  Folgers makes a variety of blends, but I prefer the Classic Roast; as a lifelong Folgers drinker the classic is the same brand I enjoyed as a young whippersnapper.  Yet on the high tech side, Folgers has the unique interlocking AromaSeal that preserves freshness. . .sans can openers.  The easy grip handles are pretty. . .handy, too.<br /><br />So pay through the noggin for lima bean espresso if that floats your boat; I'll take my can of FOLGERS CLASSIC ROAST GROUND COFFEE, thank you very much.  This stuff is good--good to the last drop.  Where have I heard that before?<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: I was in a local supermarket one day when I noticed several ladies flocking into the coffee aisle and throwing eight or nine canisters at a time of Folgers Classic Roast coffee into their shopping carts! As it turns out, the coffee was on sale; and the customers wanted to "stock up" on it. I asked one of these customers about Folgers and she swore that it was the best coffee out there. I then tried it myself--and wow, those people sure were right!<br /><br />Folgers Classic Roast Ground Medium coffee can be made in any coffee pot or coffee maker and the seal on the top of the canister helps to keep the ground coffee fresh. The coffee is consistently tasteful and it gives you a great, good tasting pick-me-up in the morning.<br /><br />The directions are simple enough: Use roughly one tablespoon of Folger's ground coffee to make one six fluid ounce serving of coffee. I use two tablespoons full when I want a mug full of coffee to start my day. In addition, you probably should refrigerate the canister after you open it; but I leave the canister on my kitchen countertop or even in a kitchen cabinet and the coffee still tastes great. If you can catch a sale on this terrific coffee I would suggest that you stock up. You can even put the unused canisters in your freezer for up to several months, maybe even a year. It will stay fresh and taste every bit as good after you let it defrost.<br /><br />Only one cautionary note that you probably already figured anyway--don't drink this if you are sensitive to caffeine. Consult your doctor if your stomach or your system is sensitive to anything that contains caffeine before you drink this coffee. Folgers also makes decaffeinated coffee that is quite good; I've tried it.<br /><br />Folgers also makes this coffee at what they call different "roast levels," or what we would probably call "strengths." You can choose from mild, medium, medium-dark and dark. I usually see just medium and medium-dark on the grocer's shelf. Amazon offers the medium strength of the coffee which what I personally prefer.<br /><br />All in all, Folgers is far and away the best coffee on my grocer's shelf and it should remain extremely popular for some while to come. It costs a bit more than some other brands of coffee but it's worth every penny you'll spend on it. You won't be disappointed!

A lot of cats are allergic to grains and by products aren't as healthy as actual meat.

Look into Merrick, Wellness/Solistic, Blue Buffalo, EVO, Innova, Chicken Soup for the Cat lovers Soul or Weruva just to name a few. Get your cat started out right.<br />I have a bengal who had terrible runny poo for the first 4 months I had her, even with adding Fortiflora to Royal Canin. I started doing research on what could be causing it and on almost every site I visited, they warned against grains and by-products. I've since switched to grain free/by-produt free food and it's made a great improvement on her stools. Cats need healthy food and Royal Canin is equal to McDonalds.

review/text: You have to understand, kittens need things like bones and shards of feathers and meat. That's what cats eat!<br /><br />For people to complain about the ingredients? For this? I see someone going behind and reading the label as some form of justification and I have to wonder if they know what kittins eat in the wild. This is formulated specifically for kittens too small to eat chunks o<br /><br />The kitten I have loved Fancy Feast Appetizers, just raw meat with juices from the meat. SHE LOVED IT. I had to get her to start eating this so I mix in the Fancy Feast Appetizers (mostly fish apps) with this and she LOOOOOOVES eating this now. one can of this mixed with two viarities of Fancy Feast Apps and that should do it.<br /><br />So you can mix this in with something else, kitten formula, a little water, and this mushy but soft food will adapt and work with what you put in it.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for people who want to feed their kittens, even if you can't get them to eat it. Whatever is in this, it's making my kitten super healthy. She has grown out of this food and now is ready for Royal Canin Canned Cat Food, Kitten Instinctive.

review/summary: If you LOVE Chicken wing meat...
review/text: UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing), but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag, and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road.

review/summary: Delicious -and- satisfying? You got it!
review/text: These are the typical red bags of premium beef-jerky you see at the store, only...you get FOUR of them! These four bags of delicious, mouth-watering beef nuggets are a tasty and healthy snack, and I don't feel bad about eating a whole bag throughout the day at my desk.<br /><br />I love all of the varieties Jack Link's has to offer. I've been a die-hard Teriyaki fan myself, so I'm hesitant to sway away from my typical "go-to" bag.<br /><br />If you're looking for a satisfying feel-good snack to take on road trips, sporting events, at your desk, or what-have-you ' you do NOT want to pass this up.

review/text: These are pretty good, but a little overpriced - I would only buy if there was a promotion. Some pieces are deliciously tender and seasoned perfectly, but there usually are more that are too dried out and tough, or overseasoned.

review/summary: Great for snacking or for a small meal!!!
review/text: These are great!  They are spicy, but not too spicy.  They taste just like Buffalo Hot Wings but without the bones. I agree with another reviewer who is thinking about microwaving these as I bet these would taste even better warmed up!  I bought an 8 pack of these and keep these at my job for when I get the munchies and want some quick protein and the calories for one bag is only about 280 so that is perfect for a snack or to ward away the hunger pangs.  These would be great for someone doing a low-carb diet or someone who just wants extra protein for their body.  One bag also has just over 30 grams of protein and this tastes so much better than eating just a protein bar.  Bottom line is this... if you love hot wings and can't get enough give these a try.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Even better than I expected
review/text: I just tried these recently and I can't get enough of them now.  They don't have the texture of buffalo chicken wings, it's more like the stuff you get when you order a buffalo chicken pizza...just chunks of plain old chicken smothered in hot sauce.  Haven't tried it yet, but they seem like they'd be REALLY good warmed up or tossed on a pizza before it goes into the oven.<br /><br />They seem to be a bit more expensive than other Jack Link stuff, but so worth it.  Om nom nom nom nom

review/text: I wanted to get some jerky and since I like buffalo wings I tried these. The problem is there is way too much salt, it's disgustingly salty, way more than normal jerky. I can barely eat it. If you eat a 3.25 oz package of these you will have eaten 1840mg of sodium, instant high blood pressure.

I got the Teriyaki by accident - I normally don't like teriyaki ANYTHING - but the only hint of added flavoring on these is a little sweetness.<br /><br />Lean, good cuts of meat with no nasty little gristley surprises.  My only criticism is they must cook these in crack cocaine, because I'm absolutely addicted to them.

review/summary: Wouldn't buy it again
review/text: I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.  I bought the Steak Nuggets as well, which aren't as good as Jack Link's jerky, but definitely tasted better than the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.<br />To put it bluntly, they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight Buffalo flavor.  They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there.

review/text: I would like to say that I have never tried a flavor of jerky that I didn't like...  that was true until a few days ago.  I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef.  This was a mistake, I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried.  From the smell to the taste, just not good.  If you really want to give this stuff a whirl, I suggest you find a single pack.  Don't buy 4 of them like I did.  One final note:  taste is subjective, you may really love this stuff, I just didn't.

review/text: Flamin' Buffalo Chick + A1 are my all time favorites. The meat is tender, and the taste (based on the ones I've bought) are extreme with flavor. The only problem with jerky is the salt, and these have a ton of it. I wouldn't consume more then one bag a day, but it's your choice and body. I'll definitely be buying more in the future though, because these are delicious.

review/summary: Mildly Spicy
review/text: I thought this would be spicy, and coming from someone who eats spicy food all the time and fire sauce on his burritos, this is really only mild. This does not make your nose run, or make your throat burn, ears tingle, which is the funnest part of eating spicy food. Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6-8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience. Just in case you don't eat it all in one sitting, the bag contains a zip-lock storage to keep things sealed. It will last 3 days after opening without refrigeration.

review/summary: Awesome "Hot Wing" supplement
review/text: Ive always been a big Jack Links jerky fan.  I usually buy a couple bags a month, but last month I was in Vegas and they were out of A1 flavor...my personal favorite!<br /><br />I looked around the store and found these!  I opened the bag and had a few on my way to the pool, they were awesome.  Anybody that loves chicken wings should give these a taste.  The chicken is tender and quite generous in size.  I was pretty surprised they even brought a bead of sweat to my forehead, usually store bought "buffalo" flavors don't accomplish that.<br /><br />As another reviewer said these are great if you love chicken wings but don't wanna down 200 calories a piece for that spicy burn.  I do have to say these are impossible to find in WI though, so luckily amazon has them, and at a good price for a pack of 8 bags!

review/summary: dark meat
review/text: All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)

review/summary: hmm... dogs enjoy, but there are healthier liver treat options
review/text: My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is "made with liver".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken "by-products"-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide.

The ten flavors all taste very delicious and I prefer the texture of the shaved ice when G N P's syrup is poured on, as opposed to Hawaiian Shaved Ice's.  I'd definitely recommend this less expensive option for snow cone syrup!!

review/summary: The Best Syrup!
review/text: Worth every penny, a little goes a long way.  Ordered these and many snowcones later, still have plenty.  The taste is awesome, and the thicker syrup covers the ice great.

review/summary: Great Snowcone Syrup
review/text: I bought a 10 pack of this snow cone syrup for my grandchildren & they just love it. The taste is great & it's nice having it already to go, no mixing. I would/will be buying from them again.

review/summary: Hawwian Ice Flavors
review/text: I had recently bought an Hawaiian Ice Machine from Great Northern which we love.  The kids loved the flavors and the added cones and straws are an added bonus.  A little pricey but delivered to your door and ready to go.

review/summary: Inferior product
review/text: The nose evokes the earthiness of white truffles, just barely.  The white truffle presence in Bartolini is weak with mineral (almost chemical) notes, not the earthy, warm and almost intoxicating fragrance you expect from white truffles.<br /><br />There is no such thing as white truffles (oil or otherwise) on a budget.  The real thing is expensive, a deserving price for the experience you expect.
