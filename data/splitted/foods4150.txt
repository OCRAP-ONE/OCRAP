review/summary: no constipation if adding purees to diet
review/text: Because this formula has a rice base and is iron-fortified, it could cause constipation no matter what age your baby is.  If your baby is old enough for solids (which is between you and your pediatrician) make sure you're feeding your baby stone-fruits (peaches, prunes, pears, etc.) once a day and constipation will be less likely.<br /><br />This is the best formula I've found and I've done A LOT of research, as I really didn't want to have to supplement my nursing but had to. Once a day purees of stone fruits have completely offset any constipation this formula could cause in my son.

review/text: I got this b/c my 3yr old loves to eat noodles and I wanted to try and get some protein in when she ate 'plain noodles.'  It taste great and she eats it just like other pastas, it doesn't re-heat very well and she wouldn't eat the left overs b/c they were too hard.  But other than that I love the product and it is much cheaper to buy on Amazon than at the grocery stores at $2.69-$3.39 per box.

review/summary: Good gluten free option
review/text: I don't know why, but I only really like the shells of this brand.  The shape makes them less mushy than the others.  It seems like they can stay a little bit hard in spots after cooking, but they taste great.  Good substitute for regular shells and quinoa is a very healthy grain. For spaghetti, I would go with the corn instead (Mrs Leepers makes a great one).

review/summary: Get ready for the Holiday Season
review/text: If you plan to do a lot of baking this holiday season then you don't want to be without this excellent cooking spray. It is made with real flour and soybean oil. I've been using it for years and just used it on a glass baking dish when I made banana bread. The bread fell out of the pan perfectly and nothing stuck. I also use this for cupcakes and muffins. One secret is to put your pan or dish on the top rack of your dishwasher. Then spray all over and don't worry about the spray going outside the pan. If you used to butter and flour all your pans now you don't have to because this spray does it all in a few seconds.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: I wish I had found this earlier
review/text: I discovered Beet Juice when I went to Whole Foods in search of a natural source of Iron. I was eight months pregnant at the time and anemic and I have a terrible time taking synthetic iron without throwing up. Anyway, I went in looking for something and the clerk told me this was the best source. I took her word for it and took these home, and I'm glad I did. These are awesome! Within a few days of taking this I felt remarkably better. I did a bit of reading about the benefits of beet juice, and there's not much it isn't good for. Its really considered a super food its so potent as an antioxident. It is also remarkable for vein support, regulating blood sugar and blood pressure. It is also good for replacing blood after surgery and it is a powerful anticancer food. It also is really high in fiber so it counteracts the usual problem associated with taking iron--constipation. The great thing about taking the supplement is there is no way you can eat enough beets to get all these benefits, so supplementing is the way to go!! I took these on a empty stomach before bed and it never bothered my stomach. Don't hesitate to try these. In the capsule form these are easy to swallow and much cheaper than synthetic iron pills. I'm still taking them because of all the health benefits they offer.

I bought this from the commissary, but they only had it because it was Christmas time. So now, I'll be ordering it off of Amazon. Great for cake pops and chocolate covered pretzels. I was amazed at the taste, I really expected it to just be ok, but it was better than ok, it was great.

review/text: A quick glance at the nutrition panel will show that this has less fiber but more sugar than regular raisin bran. But, the taste makes it worth it - very crunchy, plump raisins, a real treat! My only criticism is that it is a bit too sweet. To balance the sweetness, I mix it with regular raisin bran (or other bran-heavy cereals). Makes for that comfortable middle ground.<br /><br />Great price when it goes on sale on Amazon. The regular price is far more than what you'd pay in a grocery store. I keep it in my cart and purchase only when the price dips way down.

review/text: Raisin Bran is one of those cereals that, as a child, you are weary of.  You see your parents and your grandparents downing it because, well, they need to `fiber' and you think "that stuff tastes like cardboard" and so when they pour you a bowl you cringe a little.  In my adulthood I've become very fond of cereal and so I often peruse the cereal aisle at Walmart for different kinds to indulge in.  The other day, on a whim, I grabbed some Raisin Bran Crunch because I felt the urge to try it after all those years of fearing it so much.  This stuff is amazing.  It is a sweetened version of the original Raisin Bran, with plumper raisins and that crunch which gives the cereal texture that it needed (the soggy flakes that defined the original cereal are replaced by a firmer base).  Yes, Raisin Bran Crunch is a great part of my morning breakfast!

review/summary: Best little Secret from Amazon
review/text: You can not find a better bargin than Amazon on this cereal deal. I search all over and tried all types of cereals, this is my favorite. The price that I'm paying is cheaper than Costco, BJ or Sam's Club. What's better than having it ship directly to your home or office and don't have to wait for any sales or waiting on long lines? Best deal in terms of price. This Raisin Bran with crunch is the best in taste and one of the most healthily breakfast out there. I loved the original Raisin Bran and then this mix with the Crunch real gives it a kick. Just loved this cereal.

review/text: We found this on through a deal site I use for its rss feeds, anyway the cereal arrived very quickly and in good shape.<br />Too bad the taste was not good, I usually like sweet cereals but the flakes are frosted and that combined with the raisins was too much.<br />I was hoping for something similar to Wheaties w/ raisins.. Suffice it to say these will go uneaten for a long time until we throw them out.

review/text: Raisin Bran Crunch is a great cereal to fuel yourself up on and satisfy that morning hunger craving.  RBC is tons better than its' predecessor, and the flakes don't get as soggy or mushy!  It has that wonderful raisin sweetness taste, combined w/ that great crunch, that disguises the blah, bland taste of regular soggy bran flakes have.  And it's good for you!  Never get tired of it!  The kids love it too!

review/text: I bought the crunch version because it was on sale. Now I have a bunch of raisin bran that I don;t really like. Other reviews point out that there is more sugar in this than regular raisin bran and that you get tired of it quick. I agree with these assessments. I quickly grew tired of how sweet the cereal is, guess i was just expecting crunchier version of the regular stuff.

review/summary: Tastier than regular old Raisin Bran
review/text: Yeah yeah I know it's high in sugar compared to all of those healthy cardboard tasting cereals, but it is so sweet and delicious AND filled with fiber. I was a fan of plain old raisin bran, but I find that those crunch little clusters really add another element. I've also tried the Raisin Bran Extra in the yellow box with the cranberries and other jazz and that was just a little too much excitement in the morning for me. You really can't go wrong with the price on Amazon and you'll have enough fiber to give you plenty of time to catch up on your reading in the bathroom during your morning break at work!

review/text: You probably already know whether or not you like this cereal.  If you've really never had Raisin Bran Crunch then: (a) it is bran flakes + raisins + little honey oat granola clusters, (b) it is less sweet than many mainstream cereals, but still far too sweet IMO, (c) it is reasonably healthy, but you could do a lot better.

review/text: I was never been a fan of Raisen Bran, and really had no intention of trying the Crunch version.  I was at a friends house, and that was all he had avialable, so I decided to give it a try.  Wow.  Keeps a crunch, nicely sweetened, and the raisens are a great counterpoint to the flakes.<br /><br />That was about a year ago.  Now RBC is my main breakfast cereal, with very little straying.  I turned my Dad onto it, and he is the same way.  We use the Amazon Subscribe and Save as it makes it about $2.50 a box vs. the $4.00 a box it is in the local grocery.  I have 4 boxes comes in about every 2 months, and have no issues going through it.

review/text: This is one of my favorite "healthy" cereals. It's high in protein and fiber and also fills me up for most of the morning. And, most importantly, it actually tastes good! It's also great in yogurt. My only complaint is that some of the clusters in the cereal are really large, so much so that I have to break them up before eating. A minor complaint, really. Overall, I highly recommend Raison Bran Crunch Creal!

review/text: Tasty, crunchy.. I like Rasin Bran Crunch .. it's not (in my opinion) too sweet as some reviewers seem to think BUT if you're looking for a cereal that tastes like regular Raisin Bran, this is not it. This is a similar cereal but with a slightly different taste experience. So, at the sale price ($7.29 for a 4 pk) it was a good buy but I still would prefer regular Raisin Bran to Raisin Bran Crunch.

I will say that this ceral is rather sugary tasting, so if your not in to the sweets, you may not want to buy it. As for me even regular kellogs rasin brand seems to have too much sugar and although it may sound strange, I think regular has too many rasins. I'm going to stick with post rasin brand!

review/text: I thought Raisin Bran Crunch was new when I first tried it, but it turns out someone had been keeping it a secret from me for a while. Though it's definitely not as healthy as the original, non-sugary-crunch incarnation, it's still probably better than eating marshmallows for breakfast? Not everyone will love it, especially if they've had and loved the original, but I always found it lacking a bit in flavor and added sugar and other bits to it myself.<br /><br />Enjoy it so much that I'd love to buy through Amazon, but that's not an option at this time, and the sellers are charging a pretty hefty price (I can get way cheaper even in the middle of New York City - that's saying something!).

review/summary: Pleasant Taste but Light on Raisins
review/text: I really love raisins and always keep a large box in the pantry; this probably explains my disappointment with Kellogg's Raisin Bran Crunch Cereal, it doesn't have enough raisins to suit me. I have found other brands of crunchy raisin bran cereal that have a lot more raisins. Kellogg's advantage is its wide availability; you can find it at most stores.<br /><br />The obvious solution is to add some raisins out of my raisin box to the cereal which is exactly what I do. I'm always a little disappointed when I have to do that.<br /><br />I have found the sweetness to be just right for me and enjoy the cereal right down to the bottom of the bowl. I also enjoy adding almonds to the cereal or even a banana. This is a favorite of my mine for supper and I enjoy it several times a week.

review/summary: Fantastic price
review/text: My wife and I love this cereal but don't buy it often because the store price is high. We were very excited to see the price so low on Amazon. We went ahead and set up a monthly subscription for the cereal because at slight over $8 per four 18 ounce boxes, this is a better price for this cereal than I have seen in our local stores in a long time. Our first shipment arrived yesterday and we are very happy with it.

review/text: It's tremendously self-descriptive. Crunchy raisin bran. I eat this stuff almost every day and have for some months using the auto delivery feature here at Amazon. It's filling, it's yummy and between the crunches, the raisins and the flakes, you've got good variety to keep your mouth happy.

review/summary: Delicious cereal, horrible price
review/text: I love this cereal.  Essentially, if you like Raisin Bran but don't always love the fact that it surrenders to milk easily then this is your solution.  The honey in the granola clusters makes it especially great.<br /><br />What I have a problem with here is the price.  Amazon has this listed at $20.29 for 4 boxes.  That works out to just over $5 per box ($5.07 exactly).  Considering that I can go to Wal Mart and get the 25 oz. box for about $3.50 or even go to the one of the more expensive grocery stores in the area and pay $4.20 for these 18 oz. boxes, that seems like a horrible deal.  After all, you would hope that since you're buying in bulk here that you'd get some kind of discount.  Or at the very least I think it's reasonable to expect that you wouldn't be charged a premium for the privilege of buying 4 boxes at once.<br /><br />Delicious cereal, but not worth more than $5 per box as it is listed currently.

review/summary: Product of Mexico ???
review/text: Right on the box it says product of Mexico... nothing against any race or country but I prefer to have my food products made in the u.s.a .. This is basically raisin bran with some sweetened granola stuff added.. which could have been a nice twist to it.. EXCEPT .. it is WAY TOO SWEET . I finished the box but wont bother again.. This is a product I eat for both health reasons and enjoyment and this is a MAJOR FAIL . This much sugar turns it in just another sugar sweetened cereal..so common in america  these days it seems are unhealthy products disguised by bogus product labeling touting health benefits.To put this in perspective.. this cereal has 19 grams of sugar per cup.. Count Chocula has 15.6 grams per cup, so an unhealthy kids cereal has less sugar than this product. The #2 ingredient is... SUGAR !!! ... and if that wasnt enough.. there is also brown sugar, corn syrup and molasses added too. Forget about the 4 grams of fiber per cup.. with all that sugar its a " moot " point.I wouldnt be so hard on this product if the box wasn't plastered all over with how " wonderful and healthy " this makes your morning breakfast. This is a stupid amount of sugar. If your not a label reader than I advise you become one because "ignorance is not bliss " when it comes to the foods you eat and it seems there is no end to what companies will do to sabotage our health to make a buck. I'll look elsewhere .. Major Fail Kelloggs. I guess american plants and workers are no longer good enough for " all american " Kelloggs. Shame on you.

review/summary: First bite great... last one not so much
review/text: I decided to try this cereal because Amazon had it on sale.  I was impressed with the first bite.  It tasted really good.  However by the bottom of the bowl I was pretty sick of it.  It's just too sweet.  The amount of sugar in it is too much.  I will probably blend it with a more bland cereal to finish off the rest of the boxes.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I do not know why some of these companies have to mess with a good thing.  I used to enjoy this cereal all the time and I loved how it didn't give in to the sugary sweetness of the other cereals.  Now they tried to make it better but they failed they made it worse.  It is too sweet for breakfast, the only way to cut it is to add bran cereal, I do that with frosted flakes to cut the sugar.  Also the flakes seem to be a bit more "woody" than I remember.  I like the old one better.

review/summary: Tasty, But Probably Not Very Healthy
review/text: I bought a 3 box pack of this cereal and really liked it at first. However, by the time I finished the third box I didn't find it it tasty anymore. I can't place my finger on it, but maybe it had something to do with the excessive sugars and other carbohydrates. I would get a 'sickly' feeling after consuming a bowl. I'm not much of a cereal eater in the first place, so maybe my body isn't used to this type of processed food.<br /><br />I certainly wouldn't dissuade anybody else from eating this stuff, but I don't think I'll be buying another box (or 3) anytime soon. Thanks for reading.

review/summary: Not like raisin bran at all
review/text: If you're hoping this will be like some sort of enhanced raisin bran (of course you are) ...it's not. The flakes are different, it doesn't taste the same at all, and there's nothing really special about it. I guess there's nothing wrong with it, but I have no desire to eat it again.<br />If they would have just taken normal raisin bran and put crunchy clusters in it, it would be great, but they changed everything.

review/summary: Taste Great but Rightfully So.
review/text: This cereal taste great, and I feel no one will be disappointed with the flavor or texture. Keep in mind that this item is even less healthy than normal Raisin Bran. Both are loaded with sugar, and actually light on the bran. This product has 80 calories of pure sugar. Combined that with the empty carbs of the processed rice and wheat with some milk and you are looking at around 200 empty calories. Should have just enjoyed a muffin, a cold coke or something else instead. It does however have some of the most fibrous part of a wheat grain, the bran, which most other gran products leave out. It also taste amazing if I haven't already mentioned. I will have this on occasion as sort of a desert for the day early in the morning, but would never consider making something like this part of a daily routine.

review/text: I ordered A case of dog food and these 4 boxes of cereal. I joined Amazon prime. 2 day free shipping. Awful packaging. Items got to me quickly that is about it. The cereal was wrapped in some kind of wrap and was crushed thanks to the Joes that packaged it. A simpleton knows that you don't put cereal in the same box as a case of dog food. Half of the boxes are mostly crumbs. Shop elsewhere for cereal

review/text: I am surprised at all the positive reviews on here for such a sugary cereal. I remembered this cereal from my childhood and sought it out for a healthier alternative. My first bite, I couldn't believe how sweet it was. I looked at the box and was astounded. 20 grams of sugar per serving! That's more than kiddie sugary cereals! I now mix it with a cup of yogurt to cut the sweet taste...

review/summary: Korintje is as close as you will get to the Cinnabon Makara Cinnamon
review/text: If you don't want to have to buy a 50 pound box of Cinnabon Makara Cinnamon from questionable soruces on Ebay, then this is the next best thing. Makara is just the branded name Cinnabon uses. Makara IS Korintje cinnamon. The convenience of pre-measuring with this product  is an added plus.<br /><br /> Korintje Cinnamon is a strong and aromatic cinnamon that comes closest to the Cinnabon's Makara brand. There are many types of "cinnamon" and they all come from the bark of trees in the same basic family. The strongest cinnamon you can buy is Vietnamese extra strength but that's more in the red hots flavor range. if you are looking for a rich, aromatic and complex cinnamon to make sweet pastires with - this is your best bet. Pampered Chef uses Korintje and so do a number of other gourmet sources. Try it! At least you won't have 49.99 pounds of "Makara cinnamon" sitting on your shelf when you are done!<br /><br />This is not to say that other "cinammons" aren't tasty.  It's just that Korintje is the type that most people find most agreeable with sweets.  it's strong and bold but not peppery hot. There are milder ones too that are good for savory stews but most cooks are looking for Korintje.

review/summary: The secret is in the prep
review/text: I first tried this product with the sampler, and like the penne the best of the three offered.I tried following the package directions, but wasn't happy with the texture.After experimenting, I found the following to work the best for me: I bring a pot of water to the boil, add the pasta, stir gently until the water returns to full boil,put a lid on the pot and remove the pot from heat.  I like my pasta al dente (so it can be reheated later, as needed), so I drain the pasta after 8 min., but for immediate use, I wait 10 min. Do not rinse. I prepare a box at a time and divide pasta into equal portions before storing it in zip-lock bags in refrigerator. I have also measured the uncooked pasta into portions and stored it that way in my pantry, because if you like pasta, it is way too easy to cheat unless you portion it. Really good taste and very practical.I combine the pasta with steamed vegetables and just add a protein, anything from 3 oz. grilled/baked chicken, steamed fish, or even tofu.
