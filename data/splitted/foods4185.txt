review/summary: The Perfect Treat!
review/text: I first tried this at my mom and dad's house (in the Vanilla flavor) and was hooked.  Then, after checking out the stats, I was even more hooked and ordered the Caramel right away.  I do a low sugar or sugar free diet and this fits perfectly into my diet as a treat.  With only 80 calories, 4.5 grams of fat and 5 sugars, it's a win/win situation for me.  I do brew it with 10 oz of water instead of 8, otherwise it's just a little too sweet for me.  All in all, I'm very happy with this product and will order more when I run out.

review/summary: I love these!
review/text: Normally I don't care for coffee at all, but I absolutely loved these!<br /><br />My sister got one of the Keurig coffee machines, and there were samples of these included in the box. She told me that she thought I would like them, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />She was right! I absolutely loved these, and after running out of the samples decided to order some from Amazon.<br /><br />For me, they were the perfect ammount of sweetness, and I didn't find there to be any weird artificial sweetner taste as some other reviwers have mentioned.<br /><br />Now I drink one of these every day. The only thing I prefer over these are the Caramel flavored ones (also from Grove Square).<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to everyone. Especially people who normally don't like coffee. A+ and 5 stars in my book!

review/summary: Delicious Cappucino Hot or Cold!
review/text: I loved this Caramel Cappuccino. It reminds me of the taste of Tim Horton's Iced Cappuccino with the caramel flavoring. I made it hot and it was delicious. Then I made it with ice and it was even better!<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to buy this flavor because I saw a negative review and it came in a 36 count package. I didn't want to have to throw out that many Kcups if it was awful. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />We just started using our Keurig a few days ago so we're still testing out all of the good flavors. I've got this on my list of Kcups to stock up on in the future! The Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino is our second favorite flavor at the moment; our favorite is the Celestial Seasonings Sweet Southern Tea.<br /><br />Note: This cappuccino is very sweet. We love sweet drinks so this is great for us. I think it's perfect. However, if you don't like sweet drinks, you may not care for this.

review/text: I was very happy with the taste of this cappuccino!  Unlike the coffee's which i find to be a little strong for my liking this item was perfect! With the coffee i always use the large cup option and add a ton of cream & sugar to make it where it isnt sooo strong.  But the cappuccino is good even in the small cup option! It taste very much like what you buy at a good convenient store from one of their cappuccino machines!  Looking forward to when this becomes available again so I can order more.  You will really want to order this 3 pack instead of a single pack!

review/summary: Disappointed. . .
review/text: I do enjoy Hazelnut flavored creamers as well as french vanilla creamers in my coffee, I know the flavors aren't exact but  since I enjoyed them in coffee I might like them in cappuccino as well.  I love the french vanilla flavored variety they sell, so much so I've had to purchase additional (early) shipments from subscribe-n-save.  Unfortunately the hazelnut isn't so great, and not b/c it's 'convenient store' cappuccino either.  I prefer that over 'real' stuff.  It smells wonderful, but just something in the flavor that's lacking and it leaves a weird after taste.  Just wish I didn't buy the 36 count.  Definately buy the French Vanilla variety if you are trying to choose between the two.

review/text: First of all, tasted pretty good.  BUT, contacted a few Keurig K-Cup authorized on-line  sellers and was told by all that Grove Square are NOT approved by Keurig and using them will void the warranty on your brewer. Was told they are a "pirated" product.  Upon inspection, I discovered that the content are powdered milk, sugar, artificial flavors and INSTANT COFFEE!  Not even real coffee. Not sure if I'll buy again but does taste like Cafe Vienna instant coffee products with the convenience of Keurig. All authorized on-line sellers cannot carry them due to contracts with Keurig. Guess, buy at your own risk.

review/text: I ordered Grove Square K-cups - the cappuccino variety, for my Keurig BREWER.  As with all of the other K-cup coffees I've purchased, I expected it to be filled with coffee for my Keurig to BREW.  Unfortunately, it is filled with instant coffee and flavored with creamer and sweetners.  It tastes HORRIBLE.  I'm pitching the rest -it's not even worth donating to our church.  If I'd wanted Sanka, I would not have purchased an expensive coffee brewer - the microwave would have been good enough!  What I WANT is a cup of freshly brewed coffee.  The product description did not disclose the fact that it is fake coffee.  If a real cup of freshly brewed coffee is what you want from your Keurig brewer, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

I did not even know that was possible for a caffeine product. I would have rather had gas station cappuccino than this garbage. I wish there were a way for me to return the 22 K-Cups that are left but, sadly, they will just end up in the trash. What a waste of my hard-earned money.

review/summary: If you like coffee.. buy something else
review/text: Imagine yourself craving coffee. But you're on... a big ferry boat. With a single coffee vending machine. The kind that you wouldn't venture near if you had any choice in the matter. But you need a hot beverage, or the caffiene, or something warm to hold, whatever. So you bite. The paper cup shoots out of some recess in the machine, and a close approximation of coffee pours into said cup, with the familiar, but suspect aroma of vanilla in the air. Then you taste it - and yup, it's exactly as vending machine icky as you hoped it wouldn't be. You taste the artificial, and you learn to settle for it. Because you're stuck on a boat.<br /><br />Well, Grove Square Capuccino Cups, French Vanilla - are just a little better than that. A smidgen better, not much more.<br /><br />So if you aren't stuck on a ferry boat (or train station, or gas station, or local DMV waiting area or someplace equally dismal), and if you actually do have a choice, I would urge you to at least try before you buy. So you aren't stuck with 23 k-cups that make you cringe :)

Sadly, not only am I disappointed that it is not frothy, as the picture on the box shows, but 1/4 of the box are defective k-cups. The edges of the foil on top are not sealed, so the cups contents have leaked and the machine does not function properly if you still try to use them. I feel that I definitely wasted my money.

review/text: Defeats the purpose of K-cups. It just instant coffee, and much more expensive than normal instant coffee. Either get instant coffee cheaper, K-cups that have real coffee in them for more money or just brew regular coffee.

review/summary: Nasty fake sweetener aftertaste
review/text: I purchased this even after a few other reviewers mentioned that there is a fake sweetener taste thinking it would be ok but the taste is really overwhelming. If you are ok with drinking diet soda you will be ok with these. If not I would stay away. I keep trying to feed these to guest but with very poor luck :-).

review/summary: Beware of artificial sweetener!
review/text: In two words...awful and artificial.  I didn't find any place I could find out what the ingredients were in this until after I got it and it tasted so weird.  I know, I should have checked it out first, but I didn't even suspect artificial ingredients would be a concern.  Anyway, it is non returnable but Amazon did refund my money for this because to us, it is not fit for consumption.

review/summary: Not As Good As Starbucks, But Better Price
review/text: I bought this item for an occasional treat but still have to find the right setting use to make it have that perfect flavor. The largest "Travel Mug" setting leaves the coffee too weak and the smallest "coffee cup" setting is too much and even the middle size isn't "just right" and sort of tastes like a "lite" cappaccino. I never thought I was hard to please but it seems like this has proven me wrong.<br />The price is pretty good so I can't complain on that note, but I guess I'm going to continue to drink this item and let it grow on me. As a now-and-then cup of cappaccino it's ok.<br />The 4 star rating is for the price and convenience of not traveling miles to get a cappaccino.

review/summary: Good Flavor, not real coffee
review/text: It is a great tasting "coffee" but in fact it is more akin to a hot chocolate than a coffee.  The flavor is coffee (not chocolate-y), but  I noticed it didn't give me the pep as my other Kcups, so I decided to open one of the Cappuccino Kcups and noticed that (unlike my coffee Kcups) this was only a powdery mix - NOT ground coffee placed over a filter - the standard innards.  If you are ok with the idea that this is a coffee equivalent of a hot chocolate powder mix, then this is a great tasting buy, with less pep than coffee.

Kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it?  I guess it's my fault for not having read the package? But no where in the product description does it indicate this is "Instant Coffee".<br /><br />I would never buy this product again.

It is a mix that fully emties when you run it through the Keuirg.  A word of warning to the die hard coffee drinkers...this is not your Starbucks cappuccino.  It's more like your gas station cappuccino, which was exactly what I was looking for.  Great taste even on the largest cup setting on the Keurig platinum.  My new favorite morning pleasure.

review/text: This stuff tastes like the "coffee" you get from those vending machines at interstate gas stations or 7-11s.  The first ingredient listed on the box is group of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.  Doesn't bode well for a supposed cappuccino.  That's followed by multiple, seemingly random sweeteners, then instant coffee, a long list of other stuff that has no business associating itself with coffee, and then (inexplicably) sucralose, which gives it a strong artificially bitter aftertaste.  I took 2 sips about 45 min ago, and still can't get the taste out of my mouth.  Definitely avoid.

review/summary: Really good for what it is
review/text: This was very different from what I originally expected it to be.  That being said, I found this to be probably the best k-cup I have ever had.  It is very creamy and has a great hazelnut flavor.  I enjoy a cappucino once in a while and I love hazelnut coffee.  I expected this to be more of  cappucino with a light hazelnut flavor.  That was not the case.  This is like a creamy coffee/hazelnut flavored hot cocoa without the cocoa.  I was expecting something completely different but ended up being pleasantly surprised.  This is a great after dinner or mid day pick-me-up and this will now hold a permanent row or two in my revolving k-cup counter top display. If you want a real cappucino, this isn't for you.  If you want a great tasting hot liquid sweet snack, get this.  I liked this so much, I will be ordering the French vanilla version to give that a try as soon as I complete this review. Also, you cant beat the price....less than $10 delivered to my door.  Wooooo Hooooo!

review/summary: Very sweet
review/text: This is the first time I ordered, I hadn't read the reviews, which I know I should have. The product was very very sweet, and I like sweet. I kept the coffee, BUT, personally this might be ok if I make it as an iced coffee for the summer.  I guess if you like extra sweet, this is the coffee for you.

review/summary: Keurig Cups Cappaccina
review/text: Just love these and can pretend they are "cocktails". Most of my friends love them too.  However, I prefer them a little less sweet, so I runn it through the Keurig twice.  Tastes good to me and is cheaper.

review/summary: Favorite Morning Coffee!
review/text: Love this coffee especially because I don't have to do anything to it! It has the perfect amount of cream and sugar which is great for me because I have more time to get ready in the morning. Some people say it's gross because it is instant coffee and uses hydrogenated oil but it's super great-- plus you're saving money on cream and sugar! Also, I agree with the person who said it tasted like gas station coffee, but we must have different gas stations because everybody (myself include) loves the cappucinos at my gas station!

review/summary: Tastes like cereal marshmallows
review/text: It has that super sweet fake marshmallow in cereal taste. It's not great for coffe, but kids would probably love it. I was hoping to actually taste the hazelnut. All you taste is sweetness. It's an overload of the taste buds in all the worst ways. Day one was okay, then progressively it gets worse and worse until now I feel like I have to write a review about it and I don't usually write reviews.

review/text: Was not impressed with this product at all. In fact, it's just sitting in the pantry now. It might be possible to brew a cup of strong coffee, divide it two and then run cappuccino to add as a flavor.

review/summary: Starts my morning!
review/text: I love Grove Square Cappuccino - especially the Caramel.  It is wonderful to find a K-cup in yummy flavors that is not too acidy on my stomach (like the Emeril Big Bold Easy my husband drinks).<br />This product is difficult to find in stores; our Wal-Mart was constantly running out because it is so popular, so I am happy to find it on Amazon.  This shipment was fast and the price is great.  Thanks!

review/text: So I thought these were just regular cappuccino cups, when I got them, I saw the Hazelnut and thought oh boy....much to my surprise, they're very tasty!  I've always been a hazelnut fan, but wow!  They're very creamy and flavorful.  So this will be a re-order when I need to re-stock on my cups, very pleased!!

review/summary: Husband Loves it!
review/text: My husband is particular about his coffee.  This has a good flavor and he loves it.  It's definitely not traditional coffee though.  This is instant and is like the cappuccino you get out of the machines at gas station rest-stops.  As long as you're not expecting real coffee, it's great!

review/summary: It taste ok!
review/text: I love cappucchino & carmel. After reading the reviews I decided to go ahead and buy this. The only thing I wish I had done was buy a smaller box. It doesn't taste bad but it isn't so DELISH that I would be running back for more. I am not a real coffee drinker and before Mcdonalds switched over to the stronger mud tasting cap I LOVED theirs so I thought this would taste like it. It is not real sweet (as other reviewers have indicated). I didn't add anything to it but I will have to doctor it up in order to drink all three boxes. I did not taste any aftertaste either. For me it wasn't that bad but it wasn't that GOOD either. It was just ok. I would be willing to try a sample of the French Vanilla. It might taste better.

review/text: These cups are a great choice if you would like something different than regular coffee.  It tastes and looks like General Foods International Coffees, rather than real coffee.  There is no coffee remaining in the pods when it is finished. It is a nice treat.

review/text: I love this coffee. It is wonderful, smoothe and just tastes great! I first tried it locally and loved it. Then, my store no longer planned to carry it so I bought all they had. When I found it on Amazon it was delightful. This is my coffee treat and the rest of the time it is hazelnut coffee, not capuccino.

review/summary: Grove Square Cappuccino kcups
review/text: When I first got my kcup maker i went to walmart and found these kcups,For those who like a really nice creamy cappuccino hazelnut this is delicious. I would not recommend their reg coffee, but the hazel nut cappuccino is the best on the market nothing to add just make and enjoy but i recommend not to use more then 6oz.serving size to get the best flavor, using a larger amount will weaken the flavor very important!they also have vanilla cappuccino and carmel cappuccino which are both very good also.
