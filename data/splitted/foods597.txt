review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: To preface this review, I have to admit that I'm considered an unconventional cook by my family. For example, when I make my own special pasta sauce, I like to infuse it with spices and chili. After they eat my meals though, my family always agree I do some good cookin'.<br /><br />When I discovered this mayonnaise, I was instantly enthralled. "Hot chili mayonnaise?," I thought, "what a genius concept!"<br /><br />And it is.<br /><br />The creamy mayonnaise base is of good quality (better I reckon than that crappy Hellman's stuff) and the spicy, hot kick of the chili is at once both subtle and effervescent.<br /><br />I will definitely be utilizing this product in plenty of my recipes. ;)<br /><br />Only downside is that true spicy food aficionados won't find the taste to be hot enough. There's something to be said for throwing in a bit more oomph with chili powder, etc. I haven't tried mixing in Tabasco, not sure how the tastes will blend but I'm sure it'll be worth the try when I do.

review/text: I recently discovered this spicy-hot mayonnaise in Maui.  It is a grand addition to my kitchen inventory - I use it with beef, sliced ham, salads, sandwiches - anything you can envision for a good-quality mayo with a kick to it. A little of this spread goes a long way but the zing is devoon.<br /><br />I brought home 3 jars from Foodland in Kihei and am delighted to discover it on Amazon. What a relief to find this product on the mainland!<br /><br />Ruby

review/summary: Well, they tried...
review/text: The Cookies and Cream flavor turned out to be a disappointment from the moment the carton was opened.  As other reviewers have mentioned the color is disturbing, an unappetizing solid purplish grey.  It's not an easy or very appealing color to describe.  The taste is similar.  At no time would I ever describe it as Cookies and Cream, it more of an overly sweetened bad vanilla?  I can't quite put my finger on what the flavor is.  Something went wrong in the Arctic Zero kitchen on this one.  It's not so bad that it has to go in the trash,(especially after the hefty price tag) but I have to add toppings to help it go down easier.<br />I've tried all the flavors (except the newest coffee flavor), and below is my flavor ranking.<br />1.Mint Chocolate Cookie<br />2.Chocolate<br />3.Chocolate Peanut Butter<br />4.Pumpkin<br />5.Strawberry Banana<br />6.Vanilla<br />7.Cookies and Cream

review/summary: Independent Testing Suggests Caution about those Calories
review/text: ABC's Today Show recently tested <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002915VF2">Arctic Zero Chocolate Peanut Butter</a> along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002912506">Arctic Zero Maple Vanilla</a>, and found that "Arctic Zero Vanilla Maple had a whopping 46 percent more calories than the label. The Chocolate Peanut Butter: an incredible 68 percent more calories." If you do the math, 68% more Calories than 32 is 63 -- almost exactly what you'd calculate from looking at the protein and carb.<br /><br />They did not, unfortunately, test this product. Caveat emptor, is all I can say.<br /><br />You can find the report by Googling "Rossen Reports: Can you believe diet frozen dessert labels?"

review/summary: Picky picky picky
review/text: I haven't had the pleasure of trying all of the flavors yet since they are not all available where I live (but I will). No this isn't exactly "cookies and cream" (which is a real ice cream flavor that I don't like) but it is smooth, creamy, and delicious. Of course it doesn't taste (or look) exactly like real ice cream and it's not super sweet. Just check the label and you'll see why. To all the nay sayers I say be realistic-it's NOT the stuff that makes you fat. If it was then it would be more like 100 calories for a 1/4 cup and you would either get fat, stay fat, or only eat a tiny bit. It's more like a perfectly done frozen protein shake (but much smoother). I put mine in the microwave for 30 seconds and it softens up very nicely. Also if you don't like this flavor try another. I'm sure you don't like every single type of real ice cream available so why would this be different? I think this is the greatest new product available to dieters and I hope they continue to come out with new flavors. That said, I think that the other realistic point (for me) is that these aren't the most expensive ingredients out there so the price is unreasonable. Sure I'm gonna buy it anyway (I just said it's the greatest) but I bet you there are thousands (or more) who won't. Just consider all the fat people who only drink diet soda-hello-the market is vast. If you put the price within everyones reach (while maintaining quality) BAM! Where do I sign up? Finally, I say again-it doesn't taste like that because it's not that-it's something different. Its something different that's really good! Just try it-Don't listen to the naysayers-they bitch about everything. You get to eat the WHOLE PINT!!!!!

review/summary: A dieter's godsend!
review/text: Considering I've tried many different types of ice creams, gelatos, and frozen yogurts, I had high hopes for Arctic Zero. My creamy, cold, partially frozen desserts have got to taste good, melt in the mouth, and satisfy the craving appropriately.<br />Don't expect Ben & Jerry's or full-fat quality from this ice cream. By reading the ingredients alone, there's no magical spell that can transform monk fruit, water, and whey protein into egg yolks, granulated sugar, and cream.<br /><br />Arctic Zero's Cookies and Cream ice cream is a smooth and slightly slippery textured sweet treat. My first experience with monk fruit was in this ice cream and I've got to say it has a nicely sweet flavor to it without the cooling effects of artificial sweeteners. Taste is great, in my opinion! It definitely reminded me of a watered down cookies and cream flavor. There is no texture or cookie bits in here, though.<br /><br />The color is a slightly off grey, purple hue. I really liked it. If you've ever had taro flavored milk or bubble tea, it looks just like that. It also tastes similar to taro bubble tea. Maybe this is why I enjoy it so much!<br /><br />All in all, it's worth a shot to try in the grocery store before you go buying a mega pack. You will either love it or leave it. I appreciate that a mostly natural, low calorie, satisfying option is available and will continue to support and lovingly consume Arctic Zero!

Maybe, some people got a bad batch or something... or they are expecting too much from a low-cal and allergy friendly desert.

review/summary: The least appetizing flavor thus far
review/text: As others have stated, the Arctic Zero Cookies and Cream isn't what you expect. The cookie part of it is just crushed cookie powder mixed in with the ice cream and not the traditional larger pieces of chocolate cookie (like Oreo cookies) with vanilla ice cream. Also, the flavor was just weird. Not quite vanilla-like. There was a hint of nuttiness. Maybe hazel nut or maple syrup.<br /><br />After eating the Arctic Zero Vanilla Maple flavor, I realized that the base for the Cookies and Cream flavor are the SAME! All they did was add crushed cookies to it! And, that was where the nutty, hazelnut-like, maple syrup-like flavor was coming from!<br /><br />Pretty lame if you ask me!!!!

review/text: If there was a ZERO star rating guess what? I rarely write reviews but had to warn everyone that if you remotely think this is going to taste like ice cream you will be highly disappointed.  It taste like iced, colored gum.  ZERO taste is more like it. And what's up with the picture which I think is kind of deceptive?  First of all there are no 'cookies' and the product is a mousey brown color which is totally unappealing.  Then once you get past that and dig in not even by the biggest stretch of your imagination would you mistake this tasteless gook as some kind of dessert.  And it has the nerve to be expensive?  $6 totally wasted.

review/text: I rarely type reviews but simply have to after trying this product. I picked it up at Whole Foods and yes, the color is kinda strange, but I can get past that. And I realized it wouldn't taste truly like ice cream. But it has such a sickeningly sweet flavor that is nothing like cookies and cream. It reminded me of cheap ice milk with a bunch of Equal packets mixed in. And I did assume there would be 'cookies'. I know that there are whey crisps out on the market and assumed that something similar would be used.<br /><br />Overall, I really hated this product and after trying to doctor it up, I just threw it away. It's not a remotely good ice cream substitute. If you're looking for a natural, low sugar option, try So Delicious No-Sugar Added Coconut Milk Ice Cream. I've tried the Mint Chip and Chocolate and both are pretty delicious.

review/summary: Very low calorie, but I don't think it's for me :(
review/text: I was very excited to hear about Arctic Zero products, as I'm always looking for lower-calorie, natural snacks to incorporate into my healthy diet.  After checking them out on Amazon and reading some good reviews, I headed to the local big-box natural grocery store to buy one of each of the flavors (they're slightly more than half the Amazon price there).  Even the cashier commented that she'd heard good things about this brand, and that the Cookies and Cream flavor seemed to be customers' favorite.<br /><br />After trying this flavor last night, however, I don't think I'll be buying these again.  As other reviewers have said, the color is different from a typical, off-the-shelf cookies and cream ice cream, although that doesn't bother me because I'm used to all-natural foods being different in color than their synthetic counterparts.  What did bother me, however, was the taste - I would NOT classify this as overly sweet as some other reviewers have. In fact I'd classify the flavor as slightly bland, with no cookie flavor whatsoever.  In fact, I checked the container to make sure I hadn't accidentally gotten the maple vanilla flavor out of the freezer, since I'd bought that flavor as well.  In addition, I felt that the texture was "off" somewhat - not grainy or anything, just more viscous than a normal ice cream (it seemed to "coat" my mouth for a long time after I ate it).<br /><br />All in all, I ended up eating about 3 teaspoons of this and putting it back in the freezer - great for portion control, but I'd rather spend my calories on ice cream that tastes good rather than eating something non-appetizing just because it's low in calories.<br /><br />I'm hoping that the other flavors of this product might appeal to me more than this one did!

Please don't let this review stop them from adding new flavors, but if they need to discontinue a flavor to add a new one......then I vote to get rid of this!

review/text: No longer are the arctic zero ice creams icy - the company upped the calories to 150 per pint but the taste is much creamier and a bit sweeter.  The cookies and cream is now my favorite.  This flavor seems to be creamier than the others and though I don't see cookie crumbles within the ice cream, I taste them. Seems to be lighter color/taste version of their chocolate ice cream with a "cookie" flavor.  A great way to indulge, without blowing your diet.

The things I love about Barilla -- always cooks al dente, doesn't stick together -- also applies to this brand.<br /><br />It's a little expensive though -- even when you purchase by the case like this -- but a healthier choice for people who are trying to cut down on carbs. Unfortunately it still has WHEAT in it as well as the jerusalem artichoke flour, so for people who are trying to avoid wheat products it cannot be used as a subsitute.

review/summary: A pasta that works at our home
review/text: This pasta was mentioned on a very popular TV program so I decided to give it a try.  My husband is pre-diabetic and has trouble eating "white" foods.  He can eat this pasta without the worry of elevated glucose levels.  We love pasta and this has solved a big problem for our household.  The flavor and texture is excellent also.  I have given some to friends and they all like it very much.  This may not work for all diabetic issues but it has worked for him.  Whole grain pastas also work well for him also but I do not like them so am thrilled with this pasta.

review/summary: Pasta for Diabetics
review/text: I am a type 1 diabetic for 38 years.  I have always had spikes in my blood sugar whenever I ate pasta (pizza too). I watched an episode of Dr. Oz last year and really thought this stuff would taste like crap. How often does healthy things taste good?? LOL Did I mention that I am Italian and that I grew up in NYC?  I cannot eat crappy pizza or pasta.  I figured I would give this a try and go right back to my semolina pasta after the first taste test.  I was completely amazed that I really enjoy this pasta and what I enjoy even more than eating it is how it doesn't make my blood sugar difficult to control.  I actually take less insulin to cover this pasta then I had to with the semolina.  If you are diabetic and would like a great tasting pasta that does not make your blood sugar spike then try this pasta.  I am certain that you will see a difference.  It is also a lot healthier than semolina too.

They got even more expensive without the 15% discount. Guess, I might head out to Walgreens to buy some.

review/summary: Blow Pop Minis Off!
review/text: Bad news all the way. First off, the bags are not resealable- you want it closed, then be prepared for a hour struggle. The pouch states: "Cherry, Sour Apple". So I pop the cherry one in my mouth only to almost fall into a sour-induced coma. It was so sour that it hurt, especially for someone of my age (late 30's). So, the cherry ones are not plain cherry, but sour cherry. Oh, yes, the gum part...well, one gum "center" equals one "Tiny Size Chiclet". Get that? One "Tiny Size Chiclet". Plus, the gum atom transformed inside my mouth from a semi-gum form to cement. Don't ask. And don't purchase.

review/text: This is my third purchase of the case of 12 and the flavors are cherry, grape, green apple, pineapple, and orange. In other words, there are no watermelon and raspberry. You can tell by looking at the package what the five flavors are. Just thought I'd mention that since the contents listed in the "Product Features" is inaccurate :. The sour apple and the pineapple taste the best. The grape has a chemical taste and the cherry tastes exactly like the Cherry Sucrets throat lozenges.<br />Oh, the ingredients are: Isomalt , Citric Acid , Natural and Artificial Flavors , Sucralose , Colors , (Red 40 , Yellow 5 , Blue 1) , Soy Lecithin and there are 30 Calories for 4 candies with 13.0g sugar alcohol.

Nevermind I hate the taste of Sucralose But I am one of the few I guess where Sucralose makes me violently ill. The Wintergreen ones still are amazing though because they are using Aspartame still but I don't see that lasting very long. Almost every sugar free product is switching to Sucralose.

I find that a teaspoon of "Raspberry Patch" per cup is plenty.<br /><br />The white cubes in the picture are little apple pieces, ok to nibble after the tea brews.<br /><br />I have served this to guests and they, both men and women, love it too.  But I'm sure not saving it just for them!

review/summary: My dog LOVES these more than us!
review/text: My dog is pretty picky and she goes crazy for these. She is 10 lbs, so we break them into pieces and dole them out. This is the only treat she begs for. The ingredients are all natural and the product is made in the US. A bonus is the donation of a portion of the profits to the dog and cat cancer fund.

review/summary: Another quality cat food from Natural Value
review/text: My cats love all of the Natural Value cat foods. I like the quality ingredients in this brand. I prefer feeding them the chicken or turkey pate since it doesn't have a fishy smell. They really like the chicken pate and gobble this up like there's no tomorrow. Another fave is the chick topped with red meat tuna. All of them (and we have a lot of cats!) love this food. Our cats are healthy and beautiful, and have all been raised on Natural Value (even the young kittens eat this without any upset tummies). There are rarely any hairball incidents either. The price is great through Amazon with free shipping. I don't order it from a reseller so can't comment on that, but the Amazon orders always arrive in great shape. Now if they will just put in on Subscribe & Save!

review/text: My cats love Natural Value. The Sardines with Shrimp & Crab, Chicken & Sardines, & the Seafood mix are they're favorites. However, Turkey Pate doesn't go over so well. The Natural Value canned food along with Evo dry seems to work well for my Main Coon and Siberians. Their coats are beautifully shiny.

review/summary: Good Value and Good Food
review/text: After my cat was seriously ill with a partially blocked urethra, I was forced to change from dry food to canned, and researched lots of alternatives.  I wanted a canned cat food that did not contain significant amounts of grains or vegetables, had a fairly low level of magnesium, and was not seafood, fish, or beef based.  It also had to be readily available, reasonably priced, and not too obnoxious to scoop out of the can.  Natural Value Pate Style Chicken Dinner fit the bill on all counts.  My cats both love it and are thriving.  I'm really glad I found this product.

review/summary: Good food, but damaged in shipping
review/text: When I opened the case I found 4 cans were so deeply dented that I was afraid to feed them to my cat.  Otherwise this seems like OK food, my cat east it.  Weird that the price on Amazon went up so dramatically; I would not pay over a dollar a can for this.  I am hoping Amazon will replace the damaged product, but it doesn't seem as easy to lodge a complaint with Amazon as it used to...

review/summary: Wow. My 18 year old kitty has never loved any food like this before.
review/text: Seriously!  He's always been a fussy eater, and as he gets older, he's gotten fussier and fussier.  We took him to the vet last week to make sure that it wasn't illness causing his even more decreased appetite, and the vet said he's in fine shape.  But if we're worried about the appetite they may be able to give him something to increase his appetite.  I worry about him getting too skinny.  For a number of years we have only fed him canned food (he can't eat the dry food any longer).  We've been feeding Little Friskies and Fancy Feast because I thought i was supposed to be, well, fancy... and tasty.  But the struggle continued.  Today I finally brought home some Natural Value from our local supermarket where we do the regular shopping.  Just two cans, to give it a try.  I wasn't getting my hopes up.  It's much more expensive than what we were used to paying, but I wanted to give something new a try.  A few minutes ago I opened a can of the chicken pate and fed our old boy.  His regular dinner portion is 3/4 of a large can, or one small (fancy feast size) can.  And he rarely finishes everything.  Sometimes barely touches the food.  But tonight, when I put down 3/4 can of the Natural Value he at every last mouthful in one sitting and licked the bowl.  I've had this boy 18 years and have never, ever, seen him eat so much.  I'm thrilled and will be going to Amazon now to buy it in bulk to save some dough.  Can't say enough about it.  :-).  Maybe I can mix the fancy feast and little friskies in with it until I use up my supply.  I think he likes the Natural Value so much he won't mind.

review/summary: My cat's favorite pate flavor of this brand...
review/text: Out of the Natural Value Cat Food pate style foods my finicky cat has tried [turkey, beef and chicken], this chicken is his absolute favorite. He absolutely gobbles this down (and he's usually not a fan of chicken in canned cat food). He likes the turkey, tolerates the beef (which is unusual for him since he loves steak and roast beef) but he LOVES this chicken pate by Natural value and even licks the bowl clean.<br /><br />It's nice to have a reasonably priced, human grade cat food made in the USA without big chunks of vegetables, clay or whole flax seeds and other funky, unnecessary ingredients.<br /><br />Dear Amazon: Please keep this at the subscribe & save price of $22.07. I really appreciate having a healthy, safe cat food that my picky little furball will actually will eat and even enjoy!

review/summary: My dog loves these!
review/text: I bought the larger size for my lab mix, because he is definitely not a small dog. He jumped up and down, grabbed the Meaty Bone and disappeared to eat it. He had been acting strange since he thought I was after him when I WHACKED! a fly with a fly swatter on the coffee table. He won't spend any time in the living room now, which used to be his main place to hang out.<br /><br />Later in the day, I found his Meaty Bone, uneaten. I thought maybe he didn't like it, but I wasn't sure if he was sick, because he was overreacting to the fly-swatter incident, which happened a couple of weeks ago and still is bothering him.<br /><br />The BIG-sized Meaty Bone Dog Treats are scored so they are easy to break in half, so I did that. He grabbed it and ate it down so fast that now I know, it was just too large for his mouth!<br /><br />I think I'll by the small ones from now on. First, he'll get treats more often, which is all he wants anyway. Second, it will hopefully help keep his teeth clean, and we won't EVEN talk about his breath, which has been better recently after I started giving him some treats that say they are to help with tartar control. I can only hope!<br /><br />EDITED after the Meaty Bone Small arrived and we, or rather "he", tried them. They are the PERFECT size for treats for when he doesn't eat the UPS man or the mail man, or does something else right. He seems to have a lot of trouble with larger snacks, even though he's a fairly large dog. These are ideal for him. He'll get MORE treats, which will possibly, HOPEFULLY, mean better behavior from him. One can always hope.  :)

review/summary: Poorly packaged for sharing.  Product fine.
review/text: My dogs have preferred these for years over the "other one" and need the small size.  The local store that had them changed to the medium awhile back and I put in a request for the small again.  Since this was not done I looked and found them here.  Actually a little less expensive as well.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have (which I think is not minor) is that all of the boxes were taped together.  I had hoped to be able to share a few boxes but they looked so damaged after I got the tape off that it is really not possible.<br /><br />Great shipping, great product, poor packaging!

review/text: I can't find Meaty Bone in the grocery store any more, but I don't care because I can get it quickly and cheaper from Amazon.  My dog loves to hide treats in the couch cushions.  Meaty Bone doesn't rub off like some of the softer treats do.  My UPS driver gives out dog treats and he uses Meaty Bone also because his dog customers like Meaty Bone better than other brands.

review/summary: Hot "Chocolate"?
review/text: This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The "hot chocolate" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if you're expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere.

I'm not sure if they came from the seller that way or if this happened during the shipping process, but I decided to keep them anyway.  This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin. Kids seem to love that it turns blue once it touches the milk or water.

review/summary: Luck O' the Irish Hot Chocolate Mix
review/text: Good thing I got this from the bargain bin or I would really be perturbed. Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the "cauldron" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of "hot chocolate" per container if you like the "flavor" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand.

review/text: Today I ate a bag of pork skins for lunch and the pecan pie was an excellent dessert after this delicious meal.  I have enjoyed these pecan pies for years and they only keep getting better.  The gooey filling is nicely contrasted to any fried food that my family likes.<br /><br />It is recommended to place the pie on the dashboard of your truck for 60-90 minutes prior to eating.  The heat from the sun really warms up the goo/pecan mixture.<br /><br />Don't try to eat the pie while talking on your CB.  I got goo all in my mic and had to order another one for $45 and then pay $50 to get it tuned.<br /><br />Be sure to save the pie tins.  I take mine home to the old lady to wash.  I have some nailed to my mail box pole and they serve as great reflectors.  I also use them to store screws/bolts/nails etc. on my work bench.  My old lady once made a mobile out of them and put over Bobby's crib when he was a baby.  They make great ash trays and they can also be hung from trees to keep the deer out of your yard/garden.

review/summary: Best Granola Bar EVER
review/text: I've tried many granola bars, being a trail runner and always looking for something I can pack in my fuel belt. Everything I've tried has been too sweet, too crunchy, too cardboard tasting, too artificial. This is the first granola bar I've tasted that is extremely delicious and organic! I discovered this brand two days ago and want to try all the other flavors as well as products (like their cereal). The vanilla chip has just the right amount of sweetness in a moist and chewy, flavorful rolled oats bar. This was $3.99 at the grocery store but well worth the price. Even my 10 year old loves this and she's not really into granola bars. If you sign up on the Amazon subscription, the price drops to $3.70 a box. You may think it's a lot for one shipment (6 box/cs) but you'll go through them very quickly. This is a fantastic product, in quality, taste, and company values.

review/summary: Fine as a treat
review/text: Your satisfaction with this granola bar will likely be relative to your appreciation of tasty treats, tolerance for sugar and definition of a snack.  If you want a low sugar item, look elsewhere.  If you are merely looking for a quick and tasty snack (and you can confine yourself to one bar), this may be a great bar for you.<br /><br />Summary of likes:<br />1) Good taste<br />2) Portable and easy to pack<br />3) Good snack for those who cannot consume nuts<br /><br />Summary of dislikes:<br />1) There is not much that is nutritional value to this bar.  It has a high sugar content and low fiber.<br /><br />For more details on the above points, please read on.<br /><br />What I like about this bar:<br />1) The taste - Wow!  For a granola bar the taste is phenomenal.  If you are a vegetarian and cannot eat Rice Krispy treats because of gelatin, this is a very good substitute.  These bars have a light marshmallow type flavor and the chips add contrast to the granola.<br /><br />2) Portable and easy to pack - If you try to stay aware of your daily calorie intake, it is always great to have easy to carry snacks with their calories clearly labeled. Who has time to count out the exact number of pretzels that comprise 140 calories? That is part of the appeal of a granola bar. You've got a 140 calorie food item that can be placed in a purse or coat pocket and you are out the door.<br /><br />3) No nuts -- for those that cannot consume nuts, this bar is nut free.<br /><br />What is questionable about this bar:<br />1) This is a snack/treat bar and nothing else - This is not a healthful nutrition bar.  The product packaging does not necessarily say this is healthful.  It does use the word "wholesome" and boasts "8 grams of whole grains".  These notations along with the presence of granola may make some think this is a really healthy treat.  But it's not.  The bar has low fiber (1g) and very high sugar for a 140 calorie bar (13 grams).<br /><br />If you use snacks to hold you over, you probably should find a snack with at least 4 grams of fiber.  The 1 gram is not going to tide you over very long.<br /><br />If you feed these to your kids, there is a good likelihood they will like them.  They are pretty sweet and the vanilla chips are a nice touch.  But again with the sugar, what else are you giving your kids during the day?  Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar.  So you have about 3 and 1/4 teaspoons in this bar.  With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this bar may not be worth it to you.  Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day.  While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Cascadian Farms has created a very tasty, imitation Rice Krispy treat.  Props to the company for not saying this was a health or nutrition bar on the box.  I am reviewing this as a treat bar and as a treat, it is pretty tasty.  If it were being reviewed for health, I would not be able to give it four stars as it has high sugar and low fiber so it won't hold you over for hours until your next meal.<br /><br />These granola bars are made in the United States.

Meanwhile for those who are interested: Calories 140, Total fat 3g, Sat fat 1g, poly fat .5g, mono fat .5g, cholesterol 0, sodium 95mg, carbs 26g, sugars 13g, protein 2g.  So compared to energy bars in general a little low on protein but better in many other areas.  Great for a snack.

review/text: I didnt know these were organic until after I ate a few, I just grabbed them because the flavor sounded good. They are wonderful! Very soft, chewy, and I havent found anything else with a taste just like them. (I consume a LOT of granola bars!) The vanilla is great, very sweet. Will be buying again!

review/text: To borrow from my other review of a Cascadian Farm brand:<br /><br />I ordered a subscription from Amazon because it was MUCH cheaper than buying in store. I keep these bars at work for breakfast or when I'm craving a [guilt-free] snack. They are soft and full of flavor. If anyone is wary of ordering through subscription, have no fear - you can cancel, modify, or restart your subscription at any time with just a few button clicks.

review/text: These are some of the best granola bars out there! Taste isn't sacrificed at all by the organic ingredients. My wife and I usually have one of these each morning for breakfast and we're hooked. All of the flavors are good, especially Vanilla Chip, Chocolate Chip, and Harvest Berry. I'm sure kids would love these as well.

review/text: I usually don't care for the crunchy granola bars but these are so fresh and soft. They actually had these at my local 99cents store and I loved them. Unfortunately they only had them that one time, and I grabbed the last 2 boxes. I probably wouldn't buy them at full price but they are very good.
