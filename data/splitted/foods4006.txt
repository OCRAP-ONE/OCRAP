review/summary: Instant Gratification in Single Serve Size.
review/text: I was first given Pamela's Chocolate Brownie Mix as a sample from my local health food store.  My kids and I love them!  They taste great, especially served with vanilla icecream.  The very best thing about these brownies though is the package size. Your kids or yourself can mix, and microwave or bake one of these single serve bags in minutes.  This also happened to be a fabulous buy on Amazon with each bag costing less than a dollar.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I used these years ago when I was dieting because I like a lot of butter on my veggies!  I couldn't find them when I wanted to watch my calories again, so I checked Amazon and sure enough, there they were.  Still as good as ever!  I wish they'd sell them in smaller quantities, but that's a minor problem. I probably have enough to last a year now! The product is great and while they aren't as good as a stick of butter, (is anything!!??) they give a nice kick to plain vegetables and keep them moist in the mouth. They also give a nice sheen and flavor to oven baked rolls without all the calories.

review/summary: Excellent for butter flavor in some things
review/text: I like dry Butter Buds sprinkled on moist things like steamed vegetables and baked potatoes.  But I was particularly interested in the bulk packets for oatmeal.  Oatmeal is supposed to be healthy, but after I put a tablespoon or two of butter in it, it could probably make an pretty passable cookie.  Instead of a tablespoon of butter, I use a teaspoon of Butter Buds.  Still tastes good, but much less fat than even margerine. However, I agree with a couple of other posters that the rehydrated mixture leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />The unopened packets last a very long time.  My last one had to have been at least a couple of years old, since I haven't seen the packets in the stores for that long.  It still tasted pretty good, making Butter Buds a good candidate for storing with the emergency food supplies.

review/summary: Excellent when combined
review/text: I combine the liquid with real butter for the best taste.  This is especially helpful during the holidays when I am cooking many different casserole dishes to feed my large family and guests.  I have mixed half and half or done as little as add 1 tablespoon of melted butter. When I am doing a lot of cooking, I mix two packages with 1 stick of real butter.  I have still significantly reduced the fat and cholesterol but kept the flavor.  For those with health issues, there is a cookbook from the early 1990s by Pam Mycoskie called Butter Busters that uses Butter Buds in recipes.  Everything I ever cooked out of it was eaten with compliments. The sprinkles are very good on moist foods such as vegetables or baked potatoes.

review/text: I am unable to purchase the ButterBuds Mix on the West Coast and it is worth it to me to order a large stock in order to have them.  These are different from the sprinkled version and far superior, in my view.  They make excellent butter-lemon sauces, such as you would use with artichoke hearts, yet have almost no calories nor fat.  I also use them on cooked vegetables and potatoes.  Most important to me is the fact that I can take them in dry form with me backpacking and then mix with water while camping.  I can't live without these!

review/summary: Fair at most.
review/text: I used to love eating butter with everything until my dad had heart surgery and therefore, we only cook and eat food with butter substitute. I do feel that the food taste the same with or without butter buds. I often end up using more than the recipe requires just to get a hint of the taste.  I am not saying this is terrible as it does provide some flavoring after using a lot of product but I wish it was better. However, I am quite pleased that there is no fat or cholesterol regardless of however much I use which is something that real butter or almost all butter imitations can never achieve. My advice: use it if you absolutely must (such as in the case of my dad) but don't expect the same flavor as butter because there is slight taste to these which is nowhere near the real taste of butter.

In fact, I've come to prefer the taste to drawn butter.<br /><br />I was so glad to find them for sale on Amazon, and bought the whole box.  I think I'll have enough butter buds to last a lifetime.

review/text: I have used real butter for years.  This product is a shabby imitation, at best.  It has practically no flavor, didn't taste even close to real butter to me.  And if you mix it per instructions, it is extremely watery and has none of the "texture" of real butter.  It was so disappointing I wouldn't even give it away to the local food bank.  I simply threw it all out.  It seemed like a healthy idea, but I'd actually rather use nothing at all as a condiment than to use this product.

review/summary: Good, but...
review/text: ... not $54 + $12 shipping good.<br /><br />I haven't tasted these in 25 years. My French boss used to bring back a box or two whenever she came back from Europe, and back then I thought they were the best thing I'd ever put in my mouth. Imagine how pleased I was when I discovered they were available through Amazon!<br /><br />Well, a lot has changed since then. The filling texture seems margarine-y to me (somewhat like whipped Crisco) rather than the creamy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness I remember. Also, the flavor seems less pronounced, and the hazelnuts are definitely not as fresh and crunchy as they once were.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, or perhaps this is a shipping version of the recipe, better suited to handle temperature swings and rough handling. Whatever the reason, I wouldn't pay $66 for 1.5 lb box again; $25-30 seems about right.

review/text: This is by far the best white chocolate out there! Coffee-cream center is soft and melts in your mouth but is not nauseatingly sweet like some other types of fillings. Outside white chocolate is sweet and vanilla-flavored but does not overwhelm the senses as you bite down into the chocolate. I don't know how Leonidas does it - crispy white chocolate outside but soft and buttery inside! You hear a soft crunch as you bite into the white chocolate but the coffee cream just gives in without any resistance and begins to melt in your mouth! I don't know if it's the coffee in the butter cream or not but you will get a high that just makes you feel really happy! This tastes like crispy vanilla chocolate on the outside with coffee butter pudding on the inside! Very sensual and hits the taste buds just right!

review/text: Leonidas, if not the best, is surely near the top of the world's best chocolates.  OK so maybe some niche market limited production chocolate is better, but hey what we can buy from Amazon this chocolate is really good.  Great pains are taken to ensure the package arrives with its delicate cargo intact.  They are packaged in styro-foam insulating boxes inside cardboard boxes.  I think they are shipped 1 day delivery, but if it is hot, the chocolates may arrive slightly deformed.  This did not detract from the taste.  Although for the cost, I would have expected a little better insurance that they would show up immaculately presentable.<br />Overall fabulous chocolate, very quick delivery.

review/text: I know some people will say "aw you just don't know nothing about chocolate" or "aw you didn't major in chocolate in college" or "aw you and Stalin have the same taste in chocolate so who will listen to you" but believe it or not I did not find these great or worth bragging on.  I loved the dark chocolate and the milk I had before from Leonidas and I finished them in a day.  These I found to be rather bland and after eating a couple I was ready to give them up and eat something else.  I found them really enjoyable though with a nice hot cup of coffee.  With the taste in mind I even let my wife taste and she agreed that these are not of the same taste quality as what we had before.  I think some people will eat these and love them and think they are great but they are just not for me.  Its kind of like when my brother use to eat ketchup sandwiches and loved them so I decided to try it and the taste just wasn't for me and in fact was quite terrible.  I am not a trying to be a jerk but I find that a lot of people have a hard time believing that we all don't have the same taste but I hope if they struggle with my review they will seek help and counseling and come to an understanding.

I saved the name of the product and found it on amazon when we got home.  I ordered a case of the rosemary, and gave several boxes as hostess gifts and served to guests.  Everyone loved them.  Have already bought another case!  Yummmmmmmm!

review/summary: Love these crackers!
review/text: I first bought these at Whole Foods, but when they ran out of the rosemary type, I turned to trusty Amazon.  These crackers are light and crispy and go well with cheese, olives, dips, and are even very tasty on their own.  I first bought a 12-pack of boxes, which may seem a bit excessive, but they store well and make a nice take-along for a dinner party or hostess gift.  The second set of 12 boxes I bought were a little broken up, but still very fresh and good.  I recommend these highly.

review/text: I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. They have a lot of gourmet items and I enjoy trying them. Some I don't care for and then there's these: La Panzanella Croccantina (Rosemary) in a 5.5-ounce box. I guess you might call them a cracker or hardbread. Very good! Delicious! They're lightly salted with sea salt and you can see the little crystals. They also have a light rosemary flavor and are made with olive oil. Everything about them says "imported from Italy," but they're a USA product made in Tukwila, Washington. I'll be having more of these!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Review is about the misleading website information not the item
review/text: I like this product.  I had previously ordered the pack of three but it was discontinued on Amazon for a few weeks.  In the meantime I checked out the two pack which was more expensive plus a high shipping cost. The site didnt tell me how large the two bottles were but when I read that the weight was 8.8 lbs, I knew they were substantially larger.  I really needed the product as I have enjoyed using it,so I ordered them.<br /><br />What a surprise when I received two 10 ounce bottles.  I dont know how the company could claim that it weighed in at 8.8 lbs.  I was totally mislead.  I have contacted the company for a refund or to return the two tiny bottles.  So if your interested in this product which is a good one, DO NOT buy the pack of two as the weight is not TRUE.  Check out the pack of three from Amazon - that is the best and TRUE deal.  Read my review on the three bottles ------

review/summary: My Prayers Have Been Answered
review/text: I don't know exactly when it was that I started buying grocery items on Amazon. It probably coincided with me getting hooked on WoW. I do recall, however, searching for Red Bull, and not finding it. Last month when I discovered I could order a case with S&S, not pay shipping, tax, or even deposit, I truly thought to my (lazy) self that prayers do get answered.<br /><br />Those of you who are already hooked on Red Bull don't need convincing that this energy drink is as effective as it is delicious. Compared to the $5/16-ounce can price I pay at convenience stores, this is a bargain. And with Subscribe and Save, the case arrives (securely packed) to my home 2 days after I've ordered it.<br /><br />For those people who've never tried Red Bull and wonder what it's like. It does not contain alcohol. It's perfectly carbonated, not too sweet, and has the cleanest flavor of any energy drink I've ever tried. It sort of tastes like carbonated fruit (grape-cranberry?) juice without the cloying sweetness. And it really does wake you up and help you feel energized.<br /><br />Some people can't function in the morning until they've had their coffee. For me, it's Red Bull. And that goes double for a late-night-gaming session. All of the undead, trolls, witches, demons and dragons I have slain, all of the puzzles I've solved with GLaDOS nagging me, all of the raids I healed, all of the captives I have freed - well, I couldn't have logged into a game server or picked up a controller without this precious elixir.<br /><br />I love you, Red Bull! And I love you, Amazon for bringing it to my doorstep just in time for Diablo III!!!

review/summary: Nostalgia, Memories, Glory, THIS IS REDBULL
review/text: I found redbull in the summer of 2012 while working for a small town beverage distributor. Every week we would receive six or seven pallets worth of redbull, and without fail one or two cases would have one can cracked, thus making the whole case all soggy. These cases would go into a breakage section of the warehouse, and soon I was taking about three cans a day. Technically, I was stealing from my boss, yet I felt no remorse. A clarity washed over me during those months, my hand stayed steady no matter what I was doing and I felt a strong conviction that what I was doing was right, that I was perfectly fulfilling my role as a strong, young man spending his summer in the Pacific Northwest.<br /><br />Earlier that spring, I had bought a bunch of stock in the video streaming company Netflix (NFLX) for about 86 dollars a share. The stock then fell to about 55$ a share, and since I bought half my position on margin the company I bought the stock through kept selling off shares to pay for the margin requirements. I assumed my meager net worth was decimated, and I stopped checking the price because it was too painful on my weak, non-redbull-fueled psyche. Then, I randomly decided to check the price in the middle of July. At this point I was approximately one month into my lackadaisical, 40 ounces-a-dayish regimen of redbull consumption. When I checked the price, Netflix was trading at 84$ a share, just 2$ down from where I had bought. I sold the next day for a modest loss; Redbull literally saved me from financial ruin. I sincerely believe that the power of redbull so enhanced the powers of my subconscious that I was able to influence every trader from around the world to bid up the price of redbull to its six month high, allowing me to sell at that high. These events all transpired while I was working nine-hour shifts in a dimly lit warehouse singing Van Halen to myself because my damn boss was too damn cheap to buy a goddamn radio. Today, netflix is trading at 73$ a share. Coincidence? THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS COINCIDENCE.<br /><br />Also, redbull is doing some sort of ad campaign thing called RED BULL STRATOS where they are launching a skydiver from about 26 miles up in a special suit. The atmosphere is so thin up there that they expect their skydiver to break the sound barrier, which will be the first time that a human has done that without the help of a Jet or Motorcycle.

review/text: I purchased this item for my husband who loves Jagermeister and Redbull. I figured why not try it out and see what happens since it is about $15 cheaper than going the the store to buy them. It worked out perfectly. I got them two days after ordering with Amazon prime and they were well packaged and none of them had busted open. We are about halfway thru the box and not a flat/funny tasting one yet. I plan to buy this product again in the near future.

review/summary: A great replacement for Jell-o desert
review/text: I was a huge fan of Jell-o as a kid, but have been vegetarian for 8 years now, so no mo Jell-o. When I came across this product, I was skeptical but excited. With Amazon's "Customer's who bought this item also bought" feature, I also found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047F7M6Y">Unflavored Vegan Jel by Natural Desserts</a>.  I've since made both jelly deserts, and am happy with the results of each! Some finer review details for this product:<br /><br />Clarity: A+. There's no murkiness to the color, it looks very clear.<br /><br />Firmness: A-. Definitely a nice solid, but some droop when the desert dish is tilted. The "Unflavored Vegan Jel by Natural Desserts" was firmer, and closer to what I remember of Jell-o. Don't let this discourage you too much, it's plenty enjoyable. I bet a little reduction in the volume of water used would help as well.<br /><br />Flavor: A. I've tried the lime and orange so far. They're exactly as you'd expect from an equivalent Jell-o flavor.<br /><br />Ease of making: A+. The directions are in the product description. They're painfully easy to follow and you're done in less than 10min.<br /><br />I can't say much about the probiotic aspect, as I don't really have digestive issues.  I'll leave that for another reviewer.

Even if you don't care about that part (which I don't), this is a fine substitute with more nutritional value.<br /><br />I'll also mention that I used these to make alcoholic jelly shots, which turned out great.

I love that it is full of fiber (which slowes down sugar absorption and makes kids feel fuller) And I believe it tastes better than jello. All the kids loved it at the party and all my son's friends who come over to the house everyday love it and ask for it. I need to buy some more, I just hope it doesn't go too quickly this time.

review/summary: Higher in sodium than company claims on their website
review/text: I'm only giving 1 star because I can't use it! And also for the extremely bad customer service of the company it comes from. Before ordering I checked the nutritional information on their website, and they state that 1/2 a cube is 123 mgs. of sodium. I also checked another website that sells it and got the same info. I then decided to purchase through Amazon because the shipping rates were better. The only downside was, I had to buy 8 boxes--but I figured that would be ok because I would eventually use it. When it arrived, I noticed the sodium content on the box was 192 in half a cube. That's a LOT of difference for someone like me who has to maintain an extremely low sodium diet. To use it for soup, even for 1 person, you'd need a whole cube. Adding in the natural sodium in vegetables, that would be soup I would not be able to eat. I contacted the company (maplegrovefoods.com) 3 times to ask why the discrepancy in sodium content between the label on the product and the website, and never talked to anyone that could answer any questions. The second person I talked to told me to take it up with Amazon. Now that's BAD business!

review/text: This cherry pie filling was the best I have ever tasted. I am not kidding, here. It had just the right tartness and sweetness. I am fussy about this kind of stuff. I don't like some things to be too sweet, and this was just perfect. I will be very particular about which recipes I use this in (that is if it makes it to any recipe at all, actually, meaning I'll eat it straight from the jar). The price is worth it. Don't forget, you are getting about 12 ounces more than you are getting in the cans. Barry Farms has some awesome stuff, and this is one of them. I don't like paying the shipping and handling, but as I said before, it is worth it. This company has been on a trial and error basis with me from reading some of the reviews and experiencing the shipping and handling. The quality of this product just zoomed them straight to the top of my list. Don't hesitate any longer. Get this cherry pie filling. It's the best, and the flavor is perfect.

review/summary: Back to Nature Crispy Wheat Crackers - 8 oz.
review/text: These crackers are made by Back to Nature Foods located in Madison, WI--made in the USA! I give these crackers 4/5 for flavor, 5/5 for texture, 5/5 for maintaining Earth conscious integrity, 0/5 for truth in labeling--score 3.5<br /><br />The carton is made of 100% recycled paperboard and the ink is derived from vegetables. The company supports the Nature Conservancy (Protecting nature, preserving life).<br /><br />These are crispy wheat crackers with a sweet and mild flavor.  These are super crispy crackers that will hold up to any dip or topping.<br /><br />The sweetness adds just enough flavor to make your toppings pop.  I personally serve them with fish dips (salmon) and cheese toppings--yummy!<br /><br />The crackers are made of unbleached enriched flour and contain wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid, safflower oil, raw sugar, defatted wheat germ, cornstarch, brown rice syrup, sea salt, malted barley extract, leavening (monocalcium phosphate, baking soda), natural turmeric flavor.<br /><br />The 8 oz package contain 8 servings--17 crackers.  Each serving contains 130 cal., 4 g fat, .5 g polyunsaturated fat, 2.5 g monounsaturated fat, 230 mg sodium, 55 mg potassium, 22 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 4 g sugars, 2 g protein.<br /><br />The package states that the crackers contain no artificial perservatives or flavors and no hydrogenated oils.  However, the product does contain Thiamine mononitrate which is a 'synthetic form' of vitamine B1, and medical and nutrition experts recommend a daily potassium intake of 4.7 g per/day.<br /><br />Don't forget to recycle the box!

review/summary: Sorry to give these up -- afraid of cancer recurrence
review/text: The flavor of these bars is very, very good.  They are filling and have many good nutritive qualities.<br /><br />That being said, we have to stop buying these bars.  They are using soy protein isolate, which probably met two of the manufacturer's goals:<br /><br />1) Vegetarian/non dairy<br />2) Save money -- that is one cheap-o source of protein<br /><br />Although we all know that an alternative -- WHEY protein from cross-microfiltration -- is the highest form of protein available right now, it is expensive.  It is more easily assimilated than soy, causes fewer GI issues (gas, indigestion, etc.), and has a better amino acid profile, etc., plus has little to no lactose remaining.<br /><br />"Instead of using destructive chemicals, cross-flow microfiltration uses filters to separate protein from undesirable fat, cholesterol and lactose, based on molecular size and shape.(18) The low-temperature process isolates the native protein of whey at its biologically natural pH, carefully preserving its biological activity. GMPs and other immune-boosting components remain intact."<br /><br />informational reference:  www &lt;dot> sportswhey &lt;dot> com/science_ion_exchange.htm<br /><br />Aside from the problem we have with the grossly inferior form of protein they are using, our main reason for stopping with this product is this:<br /><br />>>>>> We don't want our cancer to return. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />We have had breast cancer, and it was estrogen positive.  Our oncologist has indicated that while foods containing soy are ok in reasonable amounts, SOY ISOLATES ARE NOT SAFE FOR THESE TYPES OF CANCERS.<br /><br />Research backs this up.<br /><br />These bars are possibly cancer-promoting in the sense that they have estrogenic-effects.<br /><br />Women who are at risk for breast cancer (and who knows how much of the population this includes -- we don't know until after we have gotten it most of the time) SHOULD NOT BE EATING THESE BARS.<br /><br />Maybe they can put a warning label on them to say women should check with their doctors before consuming them.<br /><br />The research on this is readily available on the Internet, and my oncologist has studied this issue extensively.<br /><br />We are sad to give these bars up because they were our favorite in terms of flavor.

review/summary: Awesome Replacement to Iced Coffee.
review/text: I have been purchasing Large French Vanilla Iced Coffee's from Dunkin Donuts for at least 12 years now.  Recently I've become frustrated at the stupidity of the workers that they employ and their inability to make my coffee the way that I ask for.  They also sometimes give me decaf without telling me simply because they are out of regular, too lazy to make more, and think that I won't notice.  Couple that with the fact it cost me $2.75 for every iced coffee I purchase and I simply have had enough.  I found out about this on a deal website and figured hey why not.  It tastes great, gives me a good pick me up, and doesn't have a lot of the bad things that are in energy drinks.  Sure it has the energy blend that most do and also (some of which you might not need) but other then that it has all natural ingredients.  It has real milk and real coffee and I don't miss my Iced Coffee one bit.  I order 3 12 packs and already have an order placed for when they are back in stock.  At 65 cents a can (after the coupon) you can't go wrong.  Only problem was some of the cans of the second shipment were pretty dented up but its not a deal breaker.  I even wrote the company about the freshness of the product seeing how there was no expiration date and they told me how to read the code on the bottom of the can.  Turns out the ones I received had a born on date of 12/14/2010 that is perfectly acceptable.

review/summary: Divine!
review/text: I learned about these on Slickdeals.net and after reading the positive reviews/comments of others, I decided to take a chance and try this product and placed my first order on March 20th.  I've enjoyed Hansen's/Blue Sky's natural sodas off and on for twenty years and looked forward to their energy drink.  Wow - I did not expect to like it as much as I did/do!  I've been on a quest for a good energy drink, and thus far, this is my favorite.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Hansen's/Blue Sky's reputation<br />Delicious, smooth coffee and vanilla flavor<br />Energy and focus without caffeine jitters and crash<br />Great anytime pick-me-up and doesn't require a coffee shop stop<br />Beneficial vitamins, low cal (please see Blue Sky Soda's website for nutritional info.)<br />Gives me a positive pre-workout energy the specialized mixes and drinks do not<br />Easier on my stomach, doesn't have the acid burn some of other energy drinks I have tried<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cans have arrived dented (I do not know if that's Hansen's or Amazon's responsibility.  Amazon refunded our first order, thank you kindly Amazon.)<br />Can be a little spendy - I contacted Hansen's to see if we could purchase these locally, they gave me contact info for our nearest retailer carrying them (60+ miles away), they sell Vanilla Sky for $3.19 each, clearly Amazon has the best price.  The folks at Hansen's were a delight to work with, one of the most positive customer service experiences I have had in a long time, this pretty much seals the deal of my continuing to be a loyal customer.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I love these (my sweetie does too now!), I will buy them again (we've not been without them since my first order) and I recommend this product.  Thank you kindly for reading, I hope this review will benefit others.

review/summary: Delicious in most iced drinks, a little tricky to make, worth the effort
review/text: If you follow the instructions on cooking boba/tapioca/bubble tea, the consistency and taste is amazing. The only downside is that the pearls tend to crumble in the bag and are generally fragile before they begin to cook and darken. Also, if the water is not hot enough in the beginning, you get the same problem of the pearls dissolving and things getting a bit messy and/or sticky. If you are patient and dedicated, these are the best choice, but if you want a simpler alternative, try the black minute pearls instead. Less delicate, easy to make, and just as tasty in the end, they are a lovely alternative. It's your choice, though. Either way, boba/tapioca pearls are a deliciously addictive addition to most iced drinks, especially milk teas, but also quite a few juices.

review/text: I liked the taste and texture. However, one of my packages arrived with the vaccuum broken and the balls had turned to complete dust. I wrote to customer support, but have yet to hear from them.<br /><br />You have to boil the balls for 30 minutes, covered, let them sit for another 25 minutes, still covered, then rinse them in cold water. Then you coat them in sugar syrup, which you make by simmering equal parts of sugar and water.

review/summary: Good taste! But buy flavored Boba Tea powder too if you want to make decent boba tea
review/text: I cooked this product last night and even though I muddled the directions a little bit, the boba tasted pretty good. You get a good deal for the price.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED COOKING INSTRUCTIONS:<br />- Boil water in pot with lid<br />- Pour some of the boba in (the amount you plan to use, since leaving boba unused for long makes the boba stick together and not as appetizing)<br />- Put lid on pot and cook boba at MEDIUM HEAT for 15 minutes<br />- Turn off the gas and let boba sit for a couple of minutes<br />- Drain the water from the boba<br />- Run boba under cool water for about a minute, then drain again.<br />- Mix honey, sugar, or sugar substitute (ex: Splenda) with boba<br />- Let it cool<br /><br />My number one tip for ANYONE buying boba is to buy the boba tea power too! That's what makes boba tea taste so good. Trying to make your own at home (like a did) will probably result in disappointment.

review/text: These are the closest I could find to the quality boba places I got so used to in LA. Others either never boiled through or had a different taste. I was worried about these at first with all the brown powder in the bag, but extremely satisfied. For those not getting good taste, remember to add sugar( 1/4 to 1/2 cup) to the boil and maybe a little honey. They are still about 80% as large as the boba places but the straws I have couldn't handle full size anyway.

review/text: These were just what I wanted! Nice and chewy, and easy to make. I didn't notice any weird smells like the other reviews said. They didn't crumble either. If you want the pearls immediately, boiling them for 5 minutes and then rinsing is enough for a nice soft, chewy texture. Although they do dry out rather quickly. If they do, just put them in the microwave with some sugar syrup until they're soft and chewy again. It works.

review/text: I first tasted the Asiago cheese in this snack box when I got one of the larger boxes of snacks in the mail. I'm still impressed with the smooth buttery texture of the cheese that goes very well with the crisp crackers. This box also contains delicious slices of salami that you can put on the crackers and cheese for a meal in itself. The best part of this snack box is the Cashew Medley which is a mixture of creamy yogurt chips, dried cranberries, raisins and cashews. Then for dessert there is a dark chocolate sandwich cookie which really finishes the meal off nicely. This is one of my favorite GoPicnic snack boxes. You can easily take these boxes to work, on a picnic, when you hike or if you need a snack in your car. Delicious and convenient!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Each part of the meal comes in its own separate package; all together in a small box.  Most of the packages are easy to open, but the salami required scissors. Since I wasn't traveling when I opened the package, I found that I like the salami better refrigerated for a sandwich The Asiago cheese spread was a little too bland; I really like the taste of Asiago.  The nut snack and the dessert were good.  For the use most buyers will put it (food for travel), I think it's a decent product at a reasonable price.

review/text: My daughter is now 7 months old, and I only now am getting time to write a review :) but these are my FAVORITE GoPicnics! I have at least 5 in my car at any one time, one in the diaper bag and I throw one or two in the stroller, when we go on long walks because I constantly need the calories (I am breastfeeding), and when she is sleeping in her carseat and I want something healthier than drivethru, and don't want to wake her up to go in anywhere, these save my bacon. I usually start with the surprisingly sweet and salty chocolate and move on to the salami then cheese and crackers (carefully balancing ratios), saving the nut mix until the end. Even if the chocolate melts in the car, it is still yummy :). These really come in handy when my grand food plans have fallen through because she is still not sleeping through the night... but that is another story...

Beware the pricing...Amazon's price is way too high, I bought mine on warehouse deals and won't pay anymore than that for any of these.  Too small of a meal to cost that extreme regular pricing.

review/summary: My whole family loves these
review/text: We all love this one, but my 7 year old is the biggest fan. She goes crazy over them. She literally swoons and says things like "The salami melts in my mouth" and "This must be what happiness tastes like." Over the top? Yeah. She's dramatic. But she loves her meats and cheeses. And she's right. The salami really does sort of melt away on your tongue. It's all good, from the fruit and nut mix to the chocolatey cluster. I wish there were more of it, obviously. Like 30% more would be perfect. A Hungry Man version. But that's my only complaint. I can't think of a better snack to take on a trip (air travel, midnight snack in your hotel), but we usually just eat them at home because they're just too good.

review/text: I love these the go picnic meals - I will be ordering them again.  These are great if you work at a place where there is no refrigerator to keep your food.

review/summary: Perfect for a lunchbox
review/text: My 7-year old absolutely loves salami and cheese pack for her lunch. She even eats dried fruit, which she wouldn't touch if it weren't in a GoPicnic box. It's a very convenient way to have a snack on a go, especially with kids. However, I found the combination of cheese, salami and crackers a bit too salty for my taste. If only crackers were not sprinkled with salt, it would have been perfect. But otherwise, a very nice snack box.

review/summary: Great for convenience.
review/text: I love GoPicnic meals for their convenience & variety. The salami is a bit oily/salty but otherwise the meal is great. I highly recommend these for adults & children. I will caution that my son has a hard time opening all the little packages so may be best for older kids.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I bought these to have as a backup grab-and-go lunch on days when I don't have time to make a sandwich, or alternatively, for traveling. Much tastier than I expected - the salami is very good (it is a little oily as some have said), the cheese spread is good, the crackers are good, the trail mix is very yummy, as is the chocolate cluster. These are not lunches for the large appetite or those on salt-restricted diets. But they are better than edible, very portable, shelf-stable and with some neat diverse flavors. Beats the heck out of a Powerbar, that's for sure!

review/text: I have only tried the GoPicnic tuna meal and I did not not like it.  The concept is good and I hope the other<br />choices are better but for me the product is not worth the price

review/text: I was so excited to see that I could purchase some Salsa Lizano!  Ever since my trip to Costa Rica 10 years ago, I've been longing to taste the flavor of some authentic Tico food!  Salsa Lizano has brought that flavor home to the States for me!

review/summary: Lizano Salsa
review/text: I have been trying to find Lizano Salsa in stores for many years. I discovered that I could buy it from an on-line company and was very excited to find that it was reasonably priced and just what I was looking for. It's a favorite in Costa Rica where it is found in every home and restaurant.

review/summary: Lizano love
review/text: WE fell in love with Lizano salsa on a trip to Costa Rica years ago, and brought some back with us.  Since then we've used several  companies to order it, most recently Costa Rica Products, who never sent the product despite many conversations with them.  So when it came up on Amazon, I immediately jumped on it and ordered, received it promptly and am very happy to have a reliable source for this excellent salsa!

review/summary: Delicious Salsa
review/text: I went to Costa Rica with my family back in June and wherever we went to eat<br />they had Salsa Lizano on the table. We all enjoyed it and wondered if we could get it back in the States.  I checked on Amazon and was happy to see that it was available.<br />So I ordered it and we use it all the time!
