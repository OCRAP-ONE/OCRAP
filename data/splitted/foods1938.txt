review/summary: One of the great snack bars
review/text: I've tried a LOT of snack bars. As I become more nutrition-conscious (and wary of additives and HFCS), I have become more particular. And as always, there is the matter of taste.<br /><br />At this point, Kind bars are all I use. Everything else pales in quality, nutrition, and taste.<br /><br />Buying from REI in >12qty gets a 20% discount, about a buck-sixty each net, but Amazon (with free shipping) is still better, near a buck-and-a-quarter.<br /><br />Good for between-meal staying power, bike rides, hikes, emergency car/RV stash. They last on the shelf longer than I have been able to wait to eat them; I can't tell the difference between new bars and > 3-month-old ones from my stash. The dried-fruit content and lower-oil nuts seem to keep them naturally preserved.<br /><br />I definitely do not like the ones with peanuts in them, but that's a personal taste matter.

review/text: My "ex" was a renown chef of northern Indian cuisine.  Of course, he would make his own curry blend, and it was wonderful!  It was robust in flavor with not too much of the chilli component.  The aroma of Spice Islands Curry Powder is really lovely!  As with all spices, be sure to brown the curry before incorporating into your dish.  (You can fry the curry powder in oil or in a small amount of water.) You want the spices to be like a velvet hammer (remember the drink?): soft but potent.

review/summary: wonderful coffee filling, OK outer hard candy
review/text: The Arcor Coffee Caf&eacute; is a dark brown, filled, hard candy; hard and sweet on the outside with a coffee filling that is delicious. However, the amount of filling varies tremendously from piece to piece. I had some that were more filling than hard candy, while others were all hard and no filling. The yummy filling was a real crap shoot; maybe yes, maybe no. The outer hard candy was sweet with a little coffee flavor, but tasted kind of strange. Most of the coffee punch was in the filling. Coffee was 4th item on a list of ingredients that numbered 8. When the filling was plentiful=6 out of 10; when there wasn't any filling=3 out of 10<br />  FYI- United, Kopiko and Coffee Rio were the top finishing coffee candies.<br />  God bless. Mike

review/text: I thought the unique flavors would be a good enrichment experience for my Cocker Spaniel puppy, and the ingredients list was extremely promising.  No wheat, corn or soy, low calorie, 96% fat free, highly digestible... Sounds amazing, right?<br /><br />Unfortunately, these aren't as soft as they look in the bag.  (I was imagining something the texture of Zuke's Mini Naturals or Cloud Star Tricky Trainers.)  Because they take so long to chew up (I even tried one and it took forever!), they're not really a good training treat, which is a disappointment since StarMark is trying to build a brand around training with rewards.  If they were a little softer, both my puppy and I would be a lot happier with the product.  We really want to like it!

review/summary: The Original.
review/text: Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.<br /><br />(From the Twinings website: "When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name.")<br /><br />Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley.  Just be careful not to oversteep it: only an exceptionally forgiving tea like, for example, Yunnan, will not turn flat and bitter that way; and with any decent Earl Grey, 2 - 3 minutes should be plenty of steeping time (with Twinings it certainly is).

review/summary: An excellent tea
review/text: I wonder if the first reviewer oversteeped his tea, as the second reviewer implied. After switching from coffee to tea as my primary hot morning beverage, I found there is a certain art to making the perfect cup of tea (using loose tea leaves), and part of the art is proper steeping. The recommendation is three to five minutes, and even as a fan of strong things in general (coffee, beer, hot sauce, :)), I lean toward three minutes for a good cup of Earl Grey. It's easy to be overzealous, especially if you're accustomed to drinking bagged teas.<br /><br />In any case, I haven't found a Twinings tea where the flavors were not deep and distinctive. And by the way, as the previous reviewer noted, Twinings really is an old British company, unlike some outfits that attach "of London" to their names.

review/summary: Best Earl Grey Tea: Heaven in a Cup
review/text: I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />I prefer loose leaf teas to tea bags. There is something in the process of measuring tea into a cozy and letting it steep that makes the resulting cup of tea that much nicer. There is a reason they have tea ceremonies in most of the world (and although less rigorous, so do the British in their own way). Twinings is the quintessential British Earl Grey, and if you've never tried it, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!

review/text: My experience with teas grows with time.  I really love a good cup of Earl Grey.  I bought Twinings Earl Grey and was disappointed.  The bergamot is very acidic, the flavor was not enjoyable even with added sweet and milk.  The tea was too weak for the flavor of the bergamot to be enjoyed properly.  I love the Twinings tea tins and the ability to create my own cup of tea, but with this tea I have to add other tea to give the cup a good flavor.

review/summary: Almond Crunch...or is it cashew???
review/text: I'm not sure how they (Mareblu Naturals) managed to list cashews as the first ingredient on this almond crunch...perhaps that's how it ended up being sold by Amazon.  At any rate, it IS actually almonds, not cashews in the package.  However, having consumed a LOT of Mareblu Naturals Almond Crunch in the last couple of years, I will say that they have changed it for the worse.  The pieces of almond are much smaller than they were, meaning there is more of the "candy" part (the sugar/rice malt which hold the almonds together, much like peanut brittle) than there used to be.  Previously it was large pieces and even some whole almonds.  Now it is more like chopped almonds and even crumbs.  Obviously, I preferred the former.  It is still OK but not nearly as great as it was.  I considered ordering the Mrs. Mays version instead, but noticed that it says something about ingredients coming from China for that brand, so I will stick with Mareblu if I am going to have almond crunch at all, I just wish they would change it back to the original version, and perhaps they could correct the ingredient list on the package...

review/summary: No Artificial Sweetners - Good Soft Drink Alternative
review/text: I started drinking Crystal Geyser sparkling mineral water, both lime and lemon flavored, about a month ago.  I wanted to get away from diet soft drinks/sodas that I have been drinking most of my life, but still wanted a carbonated beverage.  On the advice of one of my co-workers, I bought some Crystal Geyser brand and have found it to be a viable alternative.  The limon/lime taste is mild, so if you are looking for a strong or predominant lime/lemonade taste, this isn't the drink for you.  I do note for those seeking to avoid artificial sweetners, that none are listed on the packaging of this brand.  Most other flavored waters, either carbonated or non-carbonated, use aspartame or some other artificial sweetner.  Crystal Geyser is the only brand of carbonated water that is available at the grocery stores in my area of Central Texas that does not.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTE1AI">Crystal Geyser Mineral Water Lime, 42.27-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>

As for the vinegar itself I add a dash to my sushi rice to give it that tangy flavor and make it a bit stickier. I've never had any problems with the packaging.

review/text: I ordered this by mistake.  I wanted the seasoned rice vinegar not the one for sushi.  It isn't too bad, rather salty but that is probably what you need for a vinegar for sushi.

review/summary: Great tea! Good value too for six boxes.
review/text: I felt the effects from this tea the first day I started. I noticed I had more energy, I felt more productive and I wasn't as hungry. I didn't even think at the time about the fact I had had a cup of this tea in the morning. It wasn't until about 2 days later when I realized that all the energy and less hunger that it was probably the results this tea.<br /><br />Also...I have horrible kidney problems and since drinking this I've noticed a Huge change. I drink a lot of tea and this is the first time I've ever noticed a difference.<br /><br />Seriously..this is a great product..as well as their Peach Detox tea. I highly recommend it :)

review/summary: Healthy Tea Supports Weight Control
review/text: *****<br />This Fasting Tea from Yogi Tea for Weight Loss Support is "designed to promote healthy functioning of the stomach and intestines, and to help you feel more energetic while you lose weight." Fasting Tea is based on an Ayurvedic formula---Ayurveda is an Indian form of health care now also becoming popular in the United States.<br /><br />It's suggested that you drink Fasting Tea 15 minutes before eating. I have done this, and it does really seem to help, although I'm not quite sure if the effect is physiological or psychological. Oh, well, I don't care, since it helps me to be in control of my eating. It has a sweet and pleasing taste, and is quite enjoyable to sip on while others are filling up on bread, appetizers, and high-calorie drinks and alcohol.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Fasting Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Fasting is made with organic Red Clover and Garcinia Fruit designed to help support a healthy weight loss program, as it aids digestive functions, supports the metabolism and encourages internal cleansing. The tea includes hydroxy-citric acid that is found in the Garcinia Fruit, native to Southeast Asia. This naturally occurring substance has been shown to simultaneously suppress the appetite, help reduce fats and cholesterol in the liver and disrupt the process by which the body stores excess calories as fat. We have also included the warming herbs Fennel Seed, Cinnamon Bark and Black Pepper to help promote circulation, as well as Red Clover, which works as a tonic and a blood purifier. The recipe is complimented with Alfalfa Leaf, Indian Bacopa Leaf (Gotu Kola), and English Hawthorn Berry, all of which can aid the body in the elimination of wastes that are known to slow the metabolism. Finally, we've included Burdock, Dandelion and Yellow Dock Roots, all used by European herbalists for centuries to support the liver in eliminating toxins." Other ingredients in this tea are Licorice Root, Alfalfa Leaf, Cardamom Seed, Ginger Root, Clove Bud, Barley Malt, Date Powder, Natural Plum Flavor, and Natural Passion Fruit Flavor. Almost every ingredient in this tea is also organic.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Fasting Tea contains no caffeine whatsoever. It steeps for 5-10 minutes, a nice long time, but I find that I only need one tea bag instead of two for a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Hold your nose and chug!! But, definitely worth a shot :-)
review/text: I first bought this tea from Whole Foods when I was beginning a fast. When I looked at the ingredients, I knew that I would barely be able to stand the taste (just the sight of the word 'licorice' made me want to gag), but I've always loved Yogi teas and if it did what it read on the description of he box, I was willing to give it a go. Sure enough, when I just cracked open the box, the scent was unbelievably overwhelming, unpleasant and I knew it would taste just as awful. It  did.<br /><br />However, it does do exactly what it reads on the box and then some! It really does the job when it comes to quelling my appetite and it feels like I just got a shot of B-12 (maybe it's just because I actually do chug it lol).  In one review, the reviewer said that they drink it bedtime. Although it's caffeine-free, I personally get so, so much natural energy from it, I would suggest drinking it during the daytime and see how it effects you.<br /><br />I've kept drinking it after the fast, because of it's health benefits, it's appetite AND craving suppression and the natural energy boost that it provides. I totally recommend it, but cant give it all five stars simply because of the flavor. Definitely worth a try!!

review/summary: It's more than I expected
review/text: I was looking for green tea supplements that offered appetite surpressing and detox.  I always read the reviews of AMAZON and find them very helpful.  There were a few people who rated this product below a three, but more than not it was rated 4 or 5.  I understand why! The fasting herbal supplement has a good flavor and a little sweet taste at the end.  I am drinking it every day and find that I am eating less.  I do have more energy and I am moving away from coffee to drinking more tea daily.  I love it and I don't believe that alone I will lose weight, but as part of an overall better eating plan it will help me pass up some of the sweet stuff over the holiday season and beyond.  Good product.

review/text: I like a sweet tea and don't like licorice, still this tea is good for me.  I'm on day 4 of my seven day fast and whenever I have the urge to eat or am feeling low on energy I take this tea and voila- instantly I feel better (less hungry and more energized).  I'm going to look into more teas by this brand.  There's another cute thing about the tea tags, they have nice little affirmations on the white tags: my favorite is "Self reliance conquers any difficulty."  I also wanted to add that if you are new to fasting: after the second day it's been easy peasy for me!  I can easily go a week for internal cleansing and to kick start a diet.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because there is a slight licorice taste and I am not a fan.  Still I will buy it again as soon as I run out, I love the sweetness and the natural (organic) benefits to my body.

review/text: I've tried several Yogi tea flavors and this has to be one of my favorites. When you drink Yogi tea, you know the taste is going to be out of ordinary. For me, it took a couple tries to get used to some flavors. However, this one I enjoyed it from my very first cup. Now I drink it daily. I found that if I drink this tea first in the morning before I eat anything else, I don't crave for coffee or sweet for the day. If I choose to drink coffee first, I notice that I feel hungry sooner and want to eat more. Now I have this healthy fasting tea as my secret weapon to curb my craving, I am just thrilled to have something help me eating less. Two thumbs up! Yogi!

review/text: This tea is fantastic, I use it usually around mid-day when I'm wanting a snack and it shuts those cravings right up. It seriously is like having a little meal; it's extremely satisfying and a very good way to manage food cravings. The taste and smell is just the best, it's mostly savory with a little bit of sweet. For me the most prominant flavors are the fennel seed (love it), licorice root, clove, ginger, pepper, and cardamom. It has the same sort of effect on me as eating a few crackers or handful of chips, it's just very satisfying. I highly recommend this to any and everyone.

review/text: This should be renamed Fennel tea. Because that's all I could taste. Yes, it is the first ingredient and I probably should have acknowledged that more, but its different than chewing on fennel seeds at the end of an Indian meal. It is Fennel. Strange and sweetened by licorice (which also has a pronounced taste).<br /><br />As a fasting tea, I came to see it as: if you force yourself to drink a cup before a meal, you will lose you appetite entirely. Effective, sure. But certainly unpleasant. I'd rather have a different cup of Yogi tea, like Egyptian Licorice or Gingko Clarity to take my mind off of eating and satisfy restless tastebuds.

I had another the next day and the taste really did not grow on me at all. It's sickly sweet in the worst way. It's okay when I hold my nose, but then I breath again and just want to scrub the taste from my mouth and throat. However, I guess it works since I lose my appetite.

review/summary: The worst Yogi Tea flavor
review/text: First I have to say that I love Yogi tea. I love the messages on the tea bags and some flavors are remarkable! This one, however, is horrible. I guess if you love licorice root you will like it, but I do not. I tolerate the licorice flavor in the CALM Yogi tea because it really calms me before bed and makes me feel like I am floating on a cloud, but it still manages to taste good whereas this one does not.<br /><br />Please do buy Yogi tea and get the Green Tea Slim Life instead- terrific taste, which tastes like green tea with berries in it- a good flavor and not an artificial flavor to it. This Fasting tea has a bitter after taste, which is all licorice root. Stay clear of this flavor but do buy Yogi Tea. I feel transformed by the messages on the tea bags, as it is; so profound!<br /><br />Wise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi Bhajan<br /><br />"The universe is the stage on which you dance, guided by your heart."<br /><br />"The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment."<br /><br />"Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace."<br /><br />"Laugh because that is your purpose in life."<br /><br />Happiness is every human beings birthright."

It's a 6-pack of 25g bags, 150g TOTAL<br /><br />So you're getting about the equivalent of one bag of chips for your money. Still, not a terrible deal for something a little exotic.<br /><br />The chips themselves were good, though!

review/text: This chips kind of reminded me of bacon bits. The six small bags were the perfect size and there's no MSG. They were a little expensive, but considering they came from the UK it's understandable. Half the price was in the shipping. They are well worth the indulgence once in awhile.

review/text: This could possibly be the best tasting chip I have ever eaten. It has a nice smokey bacon flavor. I would make sure this item was always stocked in my pantry if the price was not so high for the amount you get, or if they would sell this "AMAZING" chip here in the states. I would highly recomend someone paying the price one time just to try this.

review/text: I ordered this product on Amazon to get some of the flavors we can't get in the US, namely, bacon, worcestershire, and prawn cocktail.  The photo of the product was so small and the description was so vague that I didn't realize until it came that what I was getting were actually 3 flavors of crisps that I can get down the street from my house:  cheddar cheese and onion, salt and vinegar, and regular flavor.  I was VERY disappointed.  Instead of trying again to order online, I will ask friends in the UK to shop and mail them for me.

review/summary: Excellent sugar free chocolate, and a recipe for you
review/text: I have reviewed their almond and cherry chocolate bars on those product pages.<br />I also tried the plain dark, which was excellent for tempering.<br /><br />Here's the recipe for a lacy bark with sun-dried mulberries, roasted cashews, and brown rice crispies, though you can add-in whatever you like.<br /><br />My little confections turned out fabulously, and the chocolate tempered perfectly.<br /><br />Break one bar into 15 sections.<br />Set aside four of them.<br />Chop these four into small shards and divide equally.<br />Put the remaining 11 into a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup and nuke on 75%-100% power for one minute.<br />Stir until chocolate is completely melted.<br />Add one group of the chocolate shards. Stir until melted and repeat with the other one.<br />Add in whatever appeals to you.<br />I used about 1/4 cup sun-dried mulberries, 1/4 cup chopped roasted cashews, and 1 1/2 cups organic brown rice crispies.<br /><br />Stir until everything is coated well.<br />Turn out onto a piece of aluminum foil or waxed paper, and spread out with the back of a wooden spoon.<br /><br />Let sit at room temperature until chocolate re-tempers, about 20 minutes.

review/text: I have four cats at home and they love this stuff. If they were in charge of shopping for their own food, this is what they would buy along with freeze-dried chicken treats. I've fostered occasionally for rescue and I've never encountered a cat that didn't take to this food immediately. The main risk with it is that your cats' taste will get hopelessly spoiled and they might start refusing other foods if you tend to feed a variety. For this reason, I use this food sparingly as a treat, generally no more than once a week.

review/summary: Possibly the best flavor of Quaker Chewy bars
review/text: I ordered these bars on Monday, a holiday, and they were shipped the next day and I received it on Wednesday. I'm very pleased that it arrived so quickly.<br />Lately, I've eaten other flavors of these Quaker Chewy bars (s'mores, peanut butter and chocolate chunk), but none of them compare to these cookies n cream. They are so tasty! These are great to take with you for a quick snack, even if they may not be the healthiest option.<br />However, I noticed the date on all 12 of the boxes say 26 Oct 2009 (and I received them on the 14th). There was no way I could (or would) eat 120 bars by then. But I'm not sure if the date is and expiration date or a "best used by" date (there is a different). I'll admit that I've eaten things after the dates written on the food and it tastes fine and I never get sick. Maybe it's just me. I guess I'll see what happens...<br /><br />-Update: 25 Nov- I'm still eating the bars. They taste the same, they aren't tough and I'm not experiencing any illness afterward. So, I'm not sure what that date meant. Maybe it's wrong?

review/summary: A nice tasty mustard
review/text: Perhaps I am not a connoisseur of Chinese food, but my wife and I like this mustard very much with egg rolls.  We have had some mustards that are so pungent they will clear your sinuses when you eat them.  This mustard tends to be at the lower end of that (unofficial) scale.  If you are really looking for something that is "Extra Hot" by everyone's measure, this might not be the one for you.  I live in a state where we eat a lot of Mexican food, and most people in the country don't like food as hot as it is typically made here.  What we think of as "hot" other people across the country think of as unbearable.  Using this as my point of reference, I think that if you are an average American in terms of your taste for hot food, this mustard is likely to provide a nice level of heat and spiciness.

It will not blow the top<br />of your head off, but it wont draw any complaints from guests either. Actually you'll<br />find more uses for this than egg rolls and I use it for making dressings in place of<br />Dijon.<br /><br />I repeat, this is better than Hokan, better than Roland, better than Kame, better than<br />any other off the shelf mustard. If you want it hotter, you can always stir in a little<br />horseradish or dry mustard. And if you do want the nuclearized version, get some S&B<br />Mustard Powder and make your own.

Its mostly corn and mystery meats, but it has so much stuff added to make the dog like it that they become quite picky afterwards. This stuff is like human fast food. It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency. After first week when he became accustomed to it, which was more runny.<br /><br />The price is good, but your dog will become more picky with blander foods afterwards.

review/text: I never knew you could by dog food at Amazon until one day I just happened to bounce upon it.  To my amazement it came right when it was promised and no shipping to top that off was a delight.  My dog is happy too because she never has to wait for her meal like in some days she did when I would run out and have to go to the store.  This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.  Boy that was disappointing.  But now I will always order her food this way.  I hope to add the cats food next time.

review/text: I like having delivered w/free shipping! There are two flavors per shipment. I think Pedigree is a good name and my dogs love it. So convenient - I don't even like going out to shop anymore!

review/summary: My Spoiled Rotties Love It
review/text: I use pedigree products and I am quiet satisfied with them.  I have used other products Diamond Naturals and Halo etc...  Which are good as well, but more expensive.  I have very strong dogs and they both enjoy pedigree dry and the meat varieties.

review/summary: Our very picky eater likes it.
review/text: We have a dog who doesn't like to eat. He is 6 1/2 years old and is terribly skinny. We have bought dozens of different kinds of food to tempt him to eat. This is the only one we have found that he will actually eat day after day. It is moist and our dog seems to think it is delicious.

review/summary: Nothing apparently wrong but dont like this "flavor"
review/text: Very dense formula - really have to break it up before feeding the dogs or they cough. Even subscribe and save prices are high compared to buying at local stores

review/summary: UNHEALTHY
review/text: Please dont feed your dog ONLY this. The only reason for the 2 stars is that i mix 4oz of this stuff into every cup of dry food and my pit loves it. She is a very picky eater and will refuse to eat any dry dog food.

review/summary: Complete Nutrition
review/text: This product is 78% water, so the 8% protein is equivalent to 36% by dry content matter-- what that geeky stuff means, is it's above the protein content average of 27% by a decent amount.

review/summary: dog food
review/text: We all know our dogs will eat Pedigree dog food. that was good and my dogs ate all the food. The problem is half the tins cans were smashed in, not sure where that happened, maybe stacked to high in some shipping faucility, or the delivery service was throwing them around.

review/summary: Damaged Cans
review/text: Refunded due to damaged cans.  Amazon customer service was friendly and apologetic. Good price and delivery was prompt but I have elderly dogs and cannot risk any chance of bacteria from a broken seal on canned food.  Packaging was poor. They need to better protect their product.  The star review is strictly for the company shipping the product NOT Amazon.com

review/summary: Convient food for my dog
review/text: When i initially purchased this item for my dog, i was a bit nervous. I had given her the food (and had slightly heated it up) and she smelled it and walked away.  Now, however i do not heat it...and she eats it.  The reason i heated it was because she had preferred it with past wet food, but obviously this was better at room temperature.
