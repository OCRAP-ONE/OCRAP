review/summary: First ingredient is trans fat ( partially hydrogenated oil )
review/text: I guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesn't mention that the first ingredient is trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil).  Had I know, I would not have purchased this.  Consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients.

review/summary: Mmmmm,plastic
review/text: I've been excitedly trying every type of K cup I can get my hands on since I got my Keurig for christmas and, until now, have not encountered any that I truly hate. Until I discovered this one. I would have though it pretty difficult to ruin hot chocolate but the people at Grove Square certainly did a good job. Not only was the hot chocolate watery, but it had a horrible plastic aftertaste also. Yuck!

review/summary: Taste like diet
review/text: I ordered this specifically b/c they said "dark chocolate" so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor. They taste very watery, even using the lowest amount of water on the Keurig. The nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar - where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams. I didn't like these at all. If you're going for something low sugar, they might be for you!

review/summary: Not Good
review/text: I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct "plasticy" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way.

review/text: Just tried this for the first time today.  They are "ok", but they do have an odd aftertaste.  Not sure I'll be ordering these again.  Also -- the packaging notes that you need to run a hot water cycle (without a k-cup) after making them (I assume to clean the machine out).

review/summary: Very acceptable K Cup Hot Chocolate
review/text: Unlike some others, this is actually IN a K Cup and not just an overpriced version of Swiss Miss.  While the flavor is not super premium like a Godiva or Ghiradhelli, it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak K Cup versions I've had.  The sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix, but it isn't unpleasant.<br /><br />I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste. The peppermint is my favorite, followed by the dark and then the light chocolate.  They are all very good.  My only wish is that I could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only.

My only complaint is that it seems like the taste of chocolate in the milk chocolate version needs a bit of a boost. However, I usually add another teaspoon of regular cocoa mix and the taste is great. The peppermint and dark chocolate k-cups are delicious. Definitely worth a shot for this great price!

The  price was right on these for sure but I was skeptical after reading reviews on the coffees made by this brand.  But it's just hot chocolate so I figured what the heck.  All three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving.  Honestly, I think they're a little bit better than the other brands we've had.

When I purchased my Keurig it came with a box of 16 hot chocolate K-Cups (name not used to protect the guilty), that have the most indescribable, particularly unpleasant after taste, all due to the "fake" sugar that seems to comprise most if not all of the product.<br /><br />This manufacturer does use some sucralose, but no where near the amount that "other" uses.  In fact, it actually tastes like hot chocolate during and after the sipping.  WhooHoo!!!!<br /><br />Will be ordering more - Thank You for my Kuerig hot chocolate reaffirmation.

review/text: Wow, I did a lot of reading trying to make a good decision on a K-cup hot chocolate, and of course taste is something that is very subjective.  If you read all the reviews on every product you'll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation.  So I decided that even with some bad reviews I'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  I'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  Some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  All I can tell you is I must have under-achieving taste buds because all I can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  My family burned through the first box and I just ordered two more.  If you don't like this I feel sorry for you. Better to have numb taste buds I guess.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Best K-cup cocoa
review/text: I've tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the Keurig, and this is the only one I keep buying more of when I run out. Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some.

review/summary: This ISN"T Sugar Free
review/text: I ordered this because so many people were saying that it was sugar free. It's not. The first ingredient is "SUGAR". It's too much of a pain to return, so I'll keep it and drink it (because it's a pretty good K-cup hot chocolate). I will think twice about ordering it again though. I'd really like to get what I ordered.

review/text: I was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my Keurig and even happier there was a variety pack.  I read the reviews and even there were some negative ones, I went with it anyways.<br />I tried the milk chocolate.  It has such a weird taste to it.  But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a "hot plastic-y" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste.

review/summary: YUCK!!! Artifical sweetener
review/text: As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone.

review/text: I'm an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesn't measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, it's just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.  I personally like the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate better!<br /><br />I bought a 24 pack, and then I was able to find it at my local grocery store, so I bought another one.  Now, I'm stuck with the 24 pack.

review/summary: Nice tasting cocoa
review/text: The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like.

review/summary: Good taste, bad product
review/text: I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.

review/text: I'm really baffled by the great differences of opinion on this product. I've tried a couple of different brands and the Grove Square was without doubt the best. I recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local Joe Muggs (in a local BAM store) that was over $2  for the smallest size and really couldn't tell much difference. Obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product? Oh well, I like it.<br />p.s. 11-27  I like this cocoa well enough that I have subscribed to momthly delivery with free shipping and reduced cost!

review/text: For the informed thinker consumer...<br /><br />WHAT!!<br /><br />When you understand what the buzz words mean, you become an educated and informed consumer capable of making a good choice for your pet and your money pouch. So many of my friends' dogs are sick with cancer and other diseases. Whay are they eatting...? I made the choice will you; or do you like to have your ears tickled?<br /><br />The Painful Truth:<br /><br />You really do get what you pay for when it comes to pet food, as illustrated in Ann N. Martin's book, Food Pets Die For. First published in 1997 and updated in 2003, Martin's book was the first to expose the ingredients legally used by pet food companies, including euthanized cats and dogs, zoo animals, roadkill, and diseased and rotted meat unfit for human consumption. Lest you think that what Martin documented isn't widespread, she writes:<br /><br />"In later investigations in both the US and Canada, I was to learn that the collars, tags, flea collars, and even plastic bags in which (euthanized) pets are wrapped, are not removed before they are shoved in the rendering pit. Deceased pets are being 'recycled' into pet food, and pet owners have no knowledge of what is happening."<br /><br />* Poultry by-product meal. By-products can include: intestines, chicken heads, duck bills, chicken and turkey feet, feathers and bone, soy, cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, peanut hulls, citrus pulp, screenings, weeds, straw, and cereal by-products. Ingredients listed as beef, chicken and poultry by-products are not required to include actual meat. Rendered meat can be ANY rendered mammal meat, including cats and dogs. If the ingredient contained enough meat that it could be measured, it would be labeled as MEAT.<br />* Digest of chicken by-products. Animal digest is a cooked-down broth made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals. Any kind of animal can be included, and the animals can be obtained from any source, so there is no control over quality or contamination.<br />* Corn gluten meal. Corn gluten is a cheap by-product of human food processing. It offers little nutritional value and serves mainly to bind food together.<br />* Soybean meal. Soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler. The Crude Protein analysis on pet food labels is only a measurement of the amount of nitrogen in a food -- not the quality of the protein. Because of this, pet food companies can use the cheaper by-products of human food production, such as soybean meal, to boost protein numbers.

review/text: My grandchildren love these biscuits. I tasted them and they really taste good to me. They are not very sweet. Good. I want them to learn to taste the food without the extra sweetness that some other companies put in their products. Love that the ingredients are good for you. I suggest that you give young teethers small pieces at first so that they can get used to chewing and using their tongue. Stay with children so that you are aware of how they handle any foods they have in their mouths. That is so that you can be able to react instantly if they choke on the biscuit pieces or any other food stuff. Give them small pieces so that they eat that and not cram their mouth trying to eat it all at once. Good product. Amazon delivered it promptly and packed it very well.

review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as "tart, sweet, smooth, licorice". Tazo describes the aroma as "oranges, roses, lime".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.<br />****

review/summary: Domata Living flour
review/text: I have been using this product for several years since my daughter and I both have Celiac disease. It is easy to substitute this flour instead of regular white or wheat flour. I like it because it is a cup for cup measurement and you don't have to mix all kinds of flours and thickeners together.

review/summary: Finally Gummies without Dyes and Corn Syrup!
review/text: I found these today in the produce section at Wal-Mart after having seen them online as well. My 4 year old and I LOVED them!! I have been seeking gummies that do not have the Red Dye #40 (or any other dyes) as I have seen the elimination of dyes cause positive  behavioral changes in children. I also sought to find products without corn syrups and chemicals and its not too hard to find one or the other but never have a found a product that didn't add sugar, dyes, syrups, or preservatives/chemicals all in one. Yes they are more expensive but its exciting that someone is finally hearing what so many parents are looking for! Thank you Buddy Fruits!!!

review/text: Let me start by saying that their are several pro's to eating these things but unfortunately taste just isn't one of them.  They are about as healthy for you as eating a piece of fruit but without the fiber and in situations where fruit and veggies cant be a normal part of your diet they definitely come in handy but the truth is that they arent all that healthy for you and in my opinion they just dont taste as good as the fruit they are made from.<br />My package came on time and besides the things I listed everything else was fine.

review/summary: Dog toy that REALLY entertains!
review/text: I have two golden retrievers who can chew their way through any treat in no time...not so anymore!  The Everlasting Treat Toy (one for each with both side holding a treat) have lasted the kids for going on a week now.  They love the taste, their teeth look great, and they continue to play with it right up until they get the last bit of treat out.  When the package says your dog will be busy for hours, they aren't lying.  I'm sold on this product and am busy stocking up on refills to keep my goldens happy.

review/summary: Kept my pup busy
review/text: I bought my dog the ball to go with the treats, nervous about spending the money because he chew apart every toy I get him with in hours.  I only have had it for  a day now but the toy is still in once piece and the disc is still partially there.  He really likes the treat.  I think this is good for dogs who are pretty destructive, I hate spending that much on a toy but if it keeps him from eating the walls I'm happy.

review/summary: Not Everlasting....
review/text: My 2 year old inteligent Red Heeler had this treat out of the puzzle ball and devoured in about 25 minutes.  However, my 12 year old "not that smart" Chow mix couldn't get the treat out of the puzzle and licked the treat for hours, until the Red Heeler got a hold of it.  So, if you have a "not so smart" dog this is a good product.  But if your dog is smart it's not worth the price.

review/summary: keeps an aggressive chewer busy
review/text: Update:  Sadly, my pup figured out how to get this treat out of the holder.  He chews with his back jaws and is able to flatten it pretty quickly and then somehow gets it out.  This used to last a day or two but is now only good for an hour or two.  If your dog is not a problem-solver, it can still be a good product but if he figures things out, then it quickly becomes a very expensive 1-2 hour event.<br /><br />Previous Review:  My young dog is an aggressive chewer when it comes to toys (not people!).  He can deconstruct almost any kind of stuffed toy and he can EAT any size of rawhide treat.  Rawhide is a disaster for him because he chews off big chunks and then swallows them.  The rawhide doesn't digest well and the big dummy gets diarrhea.  I was actually worried he was going to get an intestinal blockage from rawhide so we banned the rawhide when we found this product.<br /><br />It is very hard to get the discs into the rubber treat ball.  I have to stand on them and even then they don't seat in very properly.  However, the dog has an equally difficult time getting the treats OUT.  He has to chew sort of sideways on this rounded treat using his back molars.  They must be tasty too because he keeps working on these and they last for days.<br /><br />We will continue to buy this product.  It keeps our pup busy, seems agreeable to his stomach, and compares very favorably to other chewy treats.

review/text: These treats are much smaller than I thought they would be, and they only lasted a few seconds with my dogs. For the price, I could have bought a whole bag of treats and the dogs would have gotten the same enjoyment. I gave them two stars only because my dogs did seem to like the taste. But then, they're not exactly picky.

review/summary: Our dogs second favorite everlasting treat
review/text: I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is with this barbecue version coming in close second! These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls. We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each. These are about the density of bone, and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and giving the jaws a workout.<br /><br />We have a very old, very big malamute, another pretty old pointer, a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly, part rotty, part small bear, part cat...and a black lab puppy. Everyone loves the everlasting treats, but they really prefer this flavor and the vanilla mint. The malamute isn't much for chew toys, but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger. Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats.<br /><br />Update: The malamute figured out if he sawed away at one side until about 1/4" was demolished, that he could then pull the whole thing out and just eat it.  Takes him 5 minutes to eat three of them now.  Good while it lasted! :)

review/text: I have actually stopped buying these because they are so hard to insert.  I had to use a screwdriver to get it into the toy!  Even my husband had problems getting it into the toy.  We have 2 of these toys-a large one and a smaller one-and the smaller one has already been chewed on by one of our dogs.  Our big dog lost interest after the first couple of times and I just gave up on them.  They do keep the dogs busy, but 20 minutes to insert one treat seems a little too time consuming.

review/text: If the treat would stay in the toy for awhile it would be fine (which it would the first couple times I used the toy) but the toy must stretch a bit or something because now my pup can get them right out and it's gone chomp, chomp.  So after I use these up I'll probably not buy them anymore and just let him get the little treats out of the middle of his toy.

review/text: These are decent treats to keep your dog busy for a while, but if the word "everlasting" is what's making you consider buying...move on.  I have two german shepherds.  They aren't mega chewers but enjoy a treat.  These things last about 10mins MAX with them.  I have two types of "holders" for the treats and the dogs manage to crack the treat part in a minute or two then just gnaw on it for a few more minutes until its done.  For the price they are asking on these, definitely get something else.

These cooklie inserts are hard and durable, taking a long while to get through, thankully!  They are obviously very tasty because my dog can't get through them fast enough, though it does take him about a week just to finish one of them.  The good thing about this cookie is that the dogs can only scrape off a small amount at a time, rather than being able to gulp down big bites.

review/text: Ok so here is the deal. Most, if not all, of the companies offering shilajit capsules dont have but 5% fulvic acid. The shilajit used in those capsules are not extracted from top of mountains, but somewhere from bottom. FYI... shilajit found on top of Himalaya is much mush more potent....<br /><br />The shilajit smells like tobacco-ish and kind of metallic. This powder is 100% pure raw shilajit in its most potent form. Shilajit is not cheap. So companies offering shilajit for $5 for 100 capsules have nothing but fake stuff in there.
