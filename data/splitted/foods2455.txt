review/summary: No reflux or burning with this coffee!
review/text: It was so difficult to give up coffee after my diagnosis of GERD (reflux) this year.  I have been an avid coffee drinker for 30+ years.  Much to my delight, I had no burn after drinking this coffee! You might be disappointed if you like Starbucks or other high end coffees.  I used to grind my own as I enjoy the robust, fresh taste of the more expensive brands; nevertheless, the taste comes pretty close to any national brand supermarket coffee.  It was surprisingly smooth, not bitter (perhaps the other reviewer received a bad batch?) It has a slightly processed taste which I was able to overlook as I'm just glad to have coffee that did not burn up my esophagus!  There was no noticeable aftertaste other than the pleasant coffee breath which I welcomed after several unimaginable months of no coffee.  Hope this helps.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1K94">Folgers Simply Smooth Ground Coffee, 11.5-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: I drink this brand because I have a problem tolerating acid, and this is the only low acid coffee I can find.  It's usually much more expensive in grocery stores than regular coffee.  I got it cheaper here on Amazon and also got free shipping!  From now on, I'll buy my Folgers Simply Smooth from Amazon.com.

review/summary: Favorite thing about Brazil
review/text: I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong.

review/text: When it comes to refried beans, I don't know if there is a lot of difference. These certainly taste similar to the ones we get at our favorite Mexican restaurant. They have a good consistency, and are enjoyable hot or cold.<br /><br />The interesting thing about the fat free version is that a serving is exactly the same calories as the regular version. There is just a little fat in the regular version. I can't really discern a difference in taste between the two, and the small amount of fat in the regular version hardly seems of consequence.<br /><br />Either way, a serving is less than 100 calories and has an acceptable amount of protein.

If you like cream or milk in your coffee, try something else. This one is to be tasted black, like a fine 18yr old single malt scotch. It will make your Italian espresso machine sing like Pavarotti.

review/text: This brand (apparently owned by the same company that makes the 'Glutino' brand), is absolutely the best that I've tried.  There is no strange aftertaste like some other brands.<br /><br />Here's my suggestion that makes these pancakes even better:<br />When you are mixing, add in about a teaspoon of 'Pumpkin Pie Spice', and another teaspoon or so of vanilla.  YUUUMMMMM!!<br /><br />My daughter is sensitive to wheat and this is her favorite food!  Even if/when she grows out of this sensitivity, I'll continue to make these panckaes - They're DELICIOUS!!!

review/summary: Surprisngly delicious
review/text: I decided to try this pancake mix upon the recommendation to limit/reduce my gluten intake to improve my sinus problems during pregnancy.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious these pancakes were.  The batter is incredibly easy to make, just at eggs, oil and milk (I used rice milk) and prepare on a hot griddle.  Easy to make and the taste is very good.  What I especially liked was how crispy they get, since they are thinner than traditional pancakes they can get really crispy on the edges and I really loved that.  I think adding mashed banana or small pieces of cut up apple would be very tasty with this mix.  Very good product, I went ahead and bought the six pack after trying a box I found in a specialty grocery store.

review/text: Our family loves this pancake and waffle mix.  We have tried some of the other gluten-free pancake mixes but none compare to this one.  The Gluten-free pantry mix has a very smooth texture and the pancakes come out fluffy.  The waffles come out great too.<br /><br />We bought this mix initially for our 6 year old son who is allergic to wheat, eggs, beans, nuts, peanuts, and peas.  Now, even our 10 year old who has no food allergies loves the pancakes.  We use Ener-G Egg replacer and Eden Soy milk instead of regular milk.  I often add in some chocolate chips to make the pancakes even yummier.

review/summary: Gluten-Free Pantry Pancake Mix
review/text: My husband is a celiac and we have tried many pancake mixes.  This one is by far the best we have found.  He likes them a little thinner than the recipe calls for, so I add a little additional milk when mixing. The taste and consistancy is the closest to 'real' pancakes.  This company makes many fine products.

review/summary: These are GREAT!!!!!
review/text: I just started the Atkins Low Carb diet plan on Monday - - I have done this before, but eventually, I have fallen off the 'wagon' so to speak, and each fall resulted in the lost pounds finding their way back and bringing their friends to stay for a while...  One of the things that I really crave while on this eating plan is something salty and crunchy...  I went on a search for pork rinds (the big bags in the market are tasteless and get soggy too quickly), and ordered these because the bag looked like one I had bought before....<br /><br />They just arrived and OMG, they are wonderful...  Salty, crunchy, flavorful and satisfying...  I know that this product will help me stay on program...  I will be ordering from you regularly...  Thanks....

review/summary: I love these chips!!
review/text: I usually fast on wednesdays on a raw food diet. After work, I went to Whole Foods looking for a snack to eat on my one hour drive home from work and I found these. Needless to say, these chips were gone by the time I arrived at my home. These chips are healthy, satisfying, and have a slight hint of cheddar IMO. If you are looking for over excessive processed cheese taste of cheese puffs or doritos then you will be disappointed. Otherwise, all vegans, vegetarians, pescetarians, raw foodists or even people looking to incorporate an healthy snack come try this

And for the record I LOVE carrots, but not these ones.

review/text: I eat a lot at my desk, so was looking for healthy snacking options. I love kale chips so I thought I'd give the other chips a try. These certainly taste healthy, by that I mean, they're not the sort of "these taste guilty" snack that kale chips are.  These taste like carrots and beets; the cheddar flavor doesn't really come through.  These chips also aren't entirely crunchy, they're maybe a little chewy.  I will eat them, they're not so bad that I will just throw them out. But, I wouldn't order these again.

review/summary: Best dry dog food!
review/text: Our golden retriever had a rocky start as a pup and had several tummy issues. Once he was old enough, we switched him over to Royal Canin after hearing so many rave reviews. Since he switched over to the adult food, he has never had a stomach issue, and he's always SO eager to eat his meals! It must just smell better than anything else, because we've never seen him get so excited over kibble before. Every day, 3 meals a day, for the last 2 months he goes nuts when he realizes we're about to feed him. I love that this is a formula especially suited for the breed. You definitely can't go wrong with this brand.

review/text: This rice tastes so good. I have tried lots of other Broccoli Cheese Rice mixes and nothing tastes anywhere near as good as this. It's easy to make too. I always put it in the microwave and add an extra minute to the cooking time and it comes out perfect. The only negative is that this rice as way too much salt. There is around 1800 mg of salt in the whole package, and I usually end up eating the whole pouch as a meal. If they would just reduce the sodium, I would be eating this way more often. Regardless, I give this product a thumbs up for the great taste!

review/summary: It pays to find the best....
review/text: I have been a pastry chef for over 20 years and I have come across a lot of companies that manufacture vanilla. I can safely say that this vanilla is the best possible brand you can buy. The cold-extraction process that Nielsen-Massey uses creates a wonderfully smooth and rich flavor that is imparted onto my pastry items wonderfully.<br /><br />Also, since I peruse vanilla products quite a bit, I see that people are always upset that extracts smell like there is a ton of alcohol included. THERE IS...it is kinda the point. The alcohol acts as the solvent that draws the essential oils out of the vanilla pod. It then holds that flavor (oils) in solution until it is placed into a recipe. When you add it to your cake batter for example, the alcohol then blends with the batter, distributing the vanilla flavor throughout. When you BAKE the cake, guess what happens to the alcohol? Yup, it evaporates, leaving the vanilla flavor behind. If you arent baking the product and are sensitive to the alcohol taste, I would advise letting whatever item you are making sit for 2 minutes immediately following the addition of the vanilla, the alcohol will evaporate this way as well. It is amazing that so many people think that  high-alcohol content extracts are bad...in actuality it is the other way around. Using alcohol is an expensive way to produce vanilla. In the cheaper brands, different forms of alcohol or organic solvents are used. Sorry, had to preach..see too many of these comments over the years. This company also makes a vanilla paste which is a great alternative and contains vanilla seeds as well.<br /><br />This vanilla is great, worth the extra money if you are making something nice where vanilla flavor is important.

review/summary: Not just for Celiacs
review/text: Most GF pretzels, cookies, etc. that are trying to be substitutes for wheat products always taste "off."  These pretzels are great! Crunchy, slightly salty, no dry rice taste. My boyfriend likes them as well as regular wheat based pretzels.  Watch for a sale and they are a terrific deal.

review/summary: The best GF pretzels!
review/text: All the other GF pretzels I've tried have an "off" flavor. These ones don't! They have a great texture and flavor. I am the only one in my household who must eat GF, but everyone -- husband and kids included -- agrees these are good pretzels. They're crunchy, but light (not rock-hard on the teeth like some pretzels can be). Great alone for a snack, or just the right thing to combine with Rice Chex, peanuts, and seasoning for a great GF party mix!

review/summary: The BEST GF pretzels available
review/text: We have tried MANY GF snacks and these are our families favorites. Most brands of GF pretzels are hard and flavorless. Not these! Light, crisp and yummy, we tear through them at our house!<br /><br />My 3 year old and I are the GF members of our household, but everyone loves them! My 11 year old generally thinks all things GF are "ick" by default, but she inhales these. Many of my kids friends say they are the best pretzels they have had, and they have no idea they are GF.<br /><br />We mix them with Rice Chex (GF but not other types of Chex or generic brands), raw almonds and chocilate chips for a yummy snack mix we call "Finnie Mix" - named for my 3 year old. Good stuff!<br /><br />We also grind them with raw almonds and use them as a fabulous breading for chicken nuggets.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey, but well worth it. The subscription offer from Amazon is a great deal (about $2-3 less per bag than any of the stores in my area) if you want to drop $60ish bucks at once.

review/summary: Glutino pretzel sticks are great!
review/text: I regularly buy the Glutino pretzel sticks for my family. We had been missing pretzel sticks after going on the gluten free diet and were so happy to find these. They taste really great, almost like their wheat counterparts. Each of the many bags we've eaten has always been fresh and crunchy - never stale. A bag of these pretzels doesn't last very long in our house.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8FQ">Glutino Sans Gluten Free Pretzels, 2.6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 20)</a><br />I purchased this product primarily because of the reviews...and I scorded. These Gluten free pretzels taste great. They're light, taste just like regular pretzels, and have just the right amount of sea salt. I was a bit concerned when I read the sodium content, but figured I could just brush the extra salt off...no need. Both of my finicky kids love them, & I've even shared them at outtings with other children & adults who had no clue that these pretzels were gluten free. I would definitely order them again.

review/text: I just bought these for the first time. WOW! They are wonderful--not at all  something that simulates  pretzel taste. Many times the  gluten free products I try are not even a good imitation of the real thing. This is not the case with these pretzels. I took them to my office and let everyone try them. I had a hard time keeping everyone away after one taste!<br /><br />One serious word of caution--They are so good you will find yourself eating more than you should!

review/summary: Best darn pretzels, GF or not
review/text: These are the best pretzels we've ever eaten, and by far the best tasting gluten free product.  My family loves these, and it's only my son who has to eat gluten free.  It's nice to be able to give my son something that I don't feel like is a lesser product taste-wise than the "regular" version.  So glad to be able to buy them by the case since they are hard to find in stores.  The pretzel sticks seem to taste better than the traditional shaped pretzels--don't know why--could be mental on my part.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: My nephew is a picky eater. He would only eat cheddar goldfish. Recently, he was put on a gluten free diet and we were worried that we wouldn't be able to satisfy his cravings for something crunchy but gluten free. We started experimenting with all kinds of snacks and he hated pretty much everything. When he tried these pretzels, he wouldn't put them down. He won't even share!! They are delicious and he doesn't even ask for the goldfish anymore.

review/summary: Just As Good As Wheat Pretzels.
review/text: My kids were pretzels addicts before being finding out they had a wheat intolerance, so these pretzels were one of our first gluten-free purchases.  Many gluten-free products don't live up to their gluten filled counterparts, but these certainly do.  The kids loved them, and so do I.  We now keep them as a staple in our pantry.
