review/summary: beware the yuckiness
review/text: Quick, someone please hand me a towel so I can wipe this off my tongue.  The can says: "It's what soda should always have been".  If all "regular" sodas were like this, sodas would be only tolerated, not drunk by the gallons by a large percentage of the population.  That's not to say that "regular" sodas are good, I don't like them anymore either since eliminating high fructose corn syrup from my diet.  This has a very bland taste & a horrible cling-to-the-back-of-the-tongue aftertaste.  I use stevia all the time & was surprised at the odd flavor.  This also does not taste anything like Mt. Dew.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: We drink A LOT of this stuff.  It's become the favorite and most consumed flavor in our house and we drink a lot of Zevia around here.  Easily 100+ cans a month.  Now, probably half the total consumption of that is Mountain Zevia.<br /><br />Is it exactly like Mountain Dew?  No, but it's pretty close and on it's own it's very good.  I don't think it's as grapefruit flavored as an earlier reviewer suggested, but slightly more on the orange side.  Regardless, it's very refreshing and tasty.

review/summary: Mountain Zevia, and Cola
review/text: I recently tried the new Mountain Zevia. It's a zero calorie soda which tastes decent if your into that. I'm not really into the whole zero calorie soda, but it would be great for anyone watching their weight or someone with diabetes while wanting a nice, cool, and refreshing pop to wash down their meal with. I got the chance to try both the Cola and Mountain Zevia flavors. After letting them cool down in my fridge, I drank the Cola one first. It has very particular taste to it. It tastes kind of metallic and truly yucky. Again I don't drink coke zero or anything. Mountain Dew and Pepsi with all the bad sugar and calories is for me! Lol. So I don't know how competing drinks would taste. I ended up finishing the Cola flavor drink (not something I recommend). I took a break from the stuff, and with the upcoming dinner I drink the second can of Zevia ironically the flavor is called Mountain Zevia. Probably their signature can. All aside it tastes a lot better than the cola flavor. The sweetener is what really makes or breaks a soda. I just can't get use to the natural sweeteners used in these more "healthier" drinks. But as everyone knows it's how your raised and what your use to that determines how your taste buds react to the flavors. It's something that would take a little getting use to if your not normally a zero calorie soda drinker, but if you are one I recommend you try the Mountain Zevia (it's like Mountain Dew just with natural sweetener) before the cola. Right now they are on sale on Amazon for select Zevia Cans. But for a 24 pack the general price range is $27.00 without the sale going on with them right now. Not something I'm willing to spend $27.00 for every 24 pack I get. What I liked the most about Mountain Zevia was the colorful cans (they are fairly eye-catching and color popping). Other than that the taste is downright awful with the cola flavor and bearable with the Mountain Zevia flavor. I had my girlfriend and her family try them too. None of us really liked them (it's really a hit and miss). Some will like it, while others probably will agree and say it's not for them. Overall the key word is that they are decent, and that if your looking to watch your weight there are plenty of other cheaper and more flavorful options. (:

review/summary: Hypersweet bathroom cleaner taste
review/text: Firstly, it's hypersweet.  It's sweeter than mountain dew, and that's just wrong.  They need to lighten up on the Stevia with this particular product in their lineup.<br /><br />Next, and just to explain to the ladies, there's a small hockey puck shaped thing, usually pink that sits in a men's bathroom urinals called a 'urinal cake', placed in the line of fire to mask foul odors.  Most of the time, it's a fake cherry smell or a janitorial, industrial 'red' scent, but sometimes it's fakeLymon - fake lemon / fake lime.<br /><br />Zevia Mountain Zevia tastes like how fakelymon smells.<br /><br />They are probably cut from the same fakesensoryindustialscentingagents cloth at discount monsanto, any random industrial chemical scenting and flavoring agents manufacturer for the fakescented candles, car deodorizers, incenses, fakescented urinal cakes, fakescented alternative beverages/candies/other food products industries.<br /><br />Sorry guys, but Mountain Zevia is nasty.

review/summary: Great product, but the pricing for Amazon is odd...
review/text: This product tastes great for a soda that seems popular among my health food friends.  I was skeptical at first, but I found this product to be a great alternative to Mt. Dew and it's diet form. Because of its crispness, I can't drink the soda as fast as I normally would. This might be working out because I used to drink 1.5 L of Mt. Dew throughout the day at my office.  Now I drink about 2 cans of Mountain Zevia a day, which is roughly half of what I normally would. And there are no calories.<br /><br />I will say that I can actually buy this product for much cheaper in the stores where I live. I was hoping that buying in bulk would be a benefit but it seems not.

review/text: I found this very similar to Diet Mountain Dew.  I love Mtn. Dew, and the diet version is okay (but nothing like the real thing).  I was hoping for more of the original, but Zevia isn't like the original.  If you like Diet Mtn. Dew, this will probably be up your alley (and a little healthier than the aspartame-filled Pepsi product).

review/text: I enjoy Zevia sodas. This flavor was somewhat disappointing. It's good but compared to Zevia's other flavors, especially Dr. Zevia, this Mountain Zevia doesn't come close to tasting like Mountain Dew.<br />I would order it again. It's not too bad. It probably could use more sweetening.

I hope a lot of health-conscious people will support what this company is doing.<br /><br />Having said that...Mountain Zevia doesn't taste very good.<br /><br />I assume they are imitating Mt. Dew with this, but it is not really close.  The aftertaste is so strong that none of my family wants to drink it.<br /><br />I LOVE some of the other flavors though, but don't expect Mountain Zevia to be a Mt. Dew knock-off.

review/summary: Not the worst thing I've ever tasted
review/text: I try to avoid artificial sweeteners, but I love Mountain Dew and Diet Mountain Dew. I've enjoyed Zevia Root Beer and Cola in the past (though only when poured into a glass - it is nasty straight from the can.)<br /><br />When I saw Mountain Zevia at the Sunflower Market I thought I would give it a try. Uhm, you know how Mountain Dew looks like anti-freeze? This looks more like pee. I can get past that, but it tastes like Airborne - you know the Vitamin/Cold treatment? I would say half orange/half lemon lime Airborne. Not the worst taste, but I don't take Airborne for the flavor, and when I take it I usually mix it with a small amount of water and drink it like a shot.<br /><br />I don't regret trying it, but I won't buy it again. Mountain Dew is incredibly artificial tasting, and I imagine that is hard to duplicate with only natural flavors. Thanks for trying Zevia!<br /><br />I don't recommend this flavor - but I do recommend the Cola and Ginger Root Beer. Those are yum

review/text: As a huge fan of Zevia Cola, I eagerly awaited the release of Mountain Zevia. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the product.  Standing on its own I have given it 3 stars, but when comparing it to its namesake, it suffers greatly.  The drink has a strong grapefruit flavor, not the lemon lime of Mt Dew.  If you like grapefruit, you will love this soda.  However, its not a substitute for the Dew.

review/summary: Size is both an asset and a challenge.
review/text: Since these are rather large, just a few go a long way. They are especially nice on cupcakes. The colors are pleasant and they are large enough that you can sort them into piles if you just want only a couple of colors for your theme. A plus is that they don't add a taste of their own to your frosting or stain the frosting with rub-off color.<br /><br />The drawback is that you almost have to place them where you want them, one by one, which ends up looking kind of stilted. They aren't the type of decoration you can sprinkle on (despite the name). A lot of them tend to land on their side if you sprinkle and look kind of odd, and when you flatten them they have frosting on them. I confess to being a bit of a nit picker so, if you don't mind the random look with daisies landing every which way, these will do a nice job of visually filling out a cake or cupcake for a child's party or any family occasion. They look nice combined with single-colored sprinkles to emphasize a particular color from the assortment, such as pink, and this brings back the random-sprinkle look I lost when arranging the daisies how I wanted them.

review/summary: OK, but there are better choices
review/text: I have been exploring the range of k-cups looking for my favorites. While the Timothy's Italian Roast isn't bad, there are better options.<br /><br />I like my coffee starbucks style: bold, strong, with lots of character. As a point of reference, my current faves are Coffee People Black Tiger, Tullys French Roast and Italian Roast, Emeril's French Roast, and Coffee People Sumatra and Dark Magic. I tried the Timothy's version of the Italian roast expecting a similar flavor to others I have tried in the bold varieties, and I found it to be on the weak side. It does have some of the nice smokey elements that you expect from an Italian roast... but Tullys does it better if you are looking for full flavor.<br /><br />If you prefer a medium bodied roast with some punch you will be happy with this, but it wasn't for me.

review/text: I guess I'm used to an Italian coffee being a bit bolder.  I was definitely expecting a darker roast.  My favorite Italian roast is still <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512">Tully's Coffee Italian, K-cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, although this cup is a good every morning or anytime coffee with that crisp Italian finish.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this , just not if you're looking for something incredibly bold.

review/text: My husband generally prefers Sumatra and I prefer Colombian. We decided to give this coffee a try and to our amazement we both truly enjoyed it. It seems to be the perfect blend for the both of us.<br /><br />There is no bitter aftertaste at all, it has a depth of flavor and is smooth and delicious. Tastes great black and stands up perfectly to flavored creamers without being overwhelmed by them.<br /><br />Italian Blend will now be the regular coffee in our home. I completely recommend it.

review/summary: From Flavorful Favorite to Weak Disappointment
review/text: I would have given this a 5-star review in the past but my last shipment (October 2010) was extremely weak and didn't taste anything like it used to.  The k-cups didn't seem to have very much coffee in them.  They seemed very light when shaken as compared with the past.  I would also like to note that I have noticed this same problem on quite a few of the k-cups.  Also, they all taste very similar and not a good taste.  I had read that Green Mountain may have taken over some of the k-cup business for Timothy's, Caribou, etc. and maybe they have changed something.  For now, I will buy from BBB when they have a coupon and I can check the freshness code on the package.<br /><br />But, really I have gone back to using a french press which really doesn't take that long to make and has superior flavor.

I drink my coffee black which usually allows me to taste the coffee fully without diluting it with cream or sweetening it with sugar. This coffee was not too weak and not too strong to the point it was bitter. It will definitely remind you of an Italian cafe.

review/text: When I purchased my Keurig coffeemaker I had no idea what coffee to buy.  Especially since there is such a huge selection of coffees to choose from. The saleslady suggested the Timothy's Italian Blend based on what kind and what flavor that I told her I liked. Plus, she really liked it, too. I'm from Louisiana and was a little hesitant to buy it.  Italian coffee.........for a southerner??  Well, I'm so glad I did! This is the smoothest, best tasting coffee I've ever had! No bitterness, just a great cup of coffee!! I even converted my husband over to it. He drank only one brand, one kind of coffee for a number of years. Now, he loves it and won't drink anything else!! I keep it on hand at all times. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: What's with Amazon's prices?
review/text: I last bought this in May 2011, for around $26.  I used to get it for around $17 on Subscribe and Save, before Amazon ended that option.  I had to stop buying all my k-cups from amazon, because the big warehouse club has an 80-pack of Donut House and Caribou blend varieties for $33.  I first thought it was just the coffee product that amazon was having pricing issues with, but their prices seem to be inflating across the board, while their competitors are not reflecting the same sort of steep increases.  I've found myself going to v*t*c*st.com for many of the repetitive grocery items that I used to order through amazon.  The main difference I can see is that amazon's competitors don't have to worry about pleasing Wall Street, so their prices are kept more honest.<br /><br />Italian Blend coffee is a decent mild coffee, my wife's favorite.  We'll keep ordering it, but it won't be from amazon.

review/text: Have only had the Keurig for about 2 months.  The Timothy's Italian blend was in one of the sample packs.  One cup, and I was hooked.  Usually bold & extra bold are deliciously strong but also have a bite to them that ruins the taste of the coffee for me.  It tastes like the brewed coffee was burned.  The Italian blend has the perfect combo of strength & fullness, without the bite.  It is sooo smooth.  I know that everyone has their own taste in coffee, but to my mind this is "kewl beans" (don't know what that means, but heard it somewhere and it sounds right, lol)  Absolutely delicious.

I would recommend gently squeezing before inserting in to brewer to verify a tight seal on the top.

review/summary: taste and shipping
review/text: We have been getting this for awhile now. My husband really enjoys the flavor. This last shipment was very disappointing though as several of the cups didn't have the tops on the cups so the coffee was lost. They are expensive and you not expect to this to happen.

review/summary: One of my favorite k-cups
review/text: After trying about 10 different k-cups with my new Keurig, this is one of my top 2 or 3.  Definitely strong enough for a nice mug of coffee on the 7.25 oz setting, but not too dark or bitter.  I'm disappointed that its apparently not available directly from Amazon any more.  I see some reviewers got it with Subscribe & Save, which is not currently showing up. :(

review/summary: Tasty coffee, attractive Subscribe&Save price
review/text: We tried several different varieties of Timothy's and other K-Cup providers (Green Mountain comes to mind, but I know there were others also) and found the Italian Blend by Timothy's to be an all-around very drinkable blend, and as a result also practical to order through subscribe&save.  When using multiple blends it was not practical to manage each subscription because of lower volume, but having been able to settle on one favorite the additional subscribe and save discount, and the ease of managing just one subscription makes this a winner.  Also, it is admittedly a fairly small sample size but the number of cups that are duds (i.e. when brewing either grounds end up in the mug, or the mug does not brew completely) has been much smaller with the italian blend than with other Timothy's or other manufacturers products.

review/summary: Good tasting coffee
review/text: The Timothy's World Italian Blend coffee is a great K-Cup for those that just want a simple cup of coffee, nothing too strong or too weak. It's the kind of coffee you could drink every morning and be just fine with . I personally like my coffee on the stronger side and wouldn't mind a little flavor so I was looking forward to getting my second shippment in so I could try some different kinds. Right now I am loving the Tree Hugger's Organic blend. It's got just the kick I was looking for!

review/summary: Great coffee - HORRIBLE PRICE~
review/text: This is great coffee but I cannot believe this company has jumped in to sell it at twice the price Amazon was selling it for a month ago.  Amazon needs to get it back in stock and get the price back down into the realm of sanity!<br /><br />I love the smell and taste of Starbucks Espresso Roast in the latte's we make at home and work, which is why I decided to try the Italian blend, and it is by far my favorite.  It smells like a good morning cup should smell, then tastes just as good.  Most of the others have too much coffee in the k-cup for me and come on much too strong.  This one makes a perfect large cup of coffee.  I still buy others because my husband likes to explore but, in the morning, this is my coffee.

review/text: I enjoy a rich, robust cup of coffee, this coffee fits the ticket if you like the same.  AFter reading the reviews, I decdied to try it.  It seemed to be priced well in comparison to other Italian Roasts out there. I will say though that it must be packed full of caffene.  I can only drink one cup of this stuff, it gets me pretty wound up.

review/summary: A very good cup of coffee
review/text: I have tried several of the Timothy's coffee's as part of the initial variety pack which came with the Keurig brewer.  I tend to use the 10oz brew and add a bit of creamer or flavored creamer to my cup of coffee, but I always try to taste the coffee itself before doctoring it to my taste.  This was a very good cup, I prefer a medium to dark coffee, and usually drink a moderately strong french roast at work.  This was the best of the non flavored coffees, Timothy's or otherwise which I have tried so far (coffee people french roast is a 3 star, Newman's extra Bold and Timothy's Nicaragua extra bold are both very good but a little strong for my taste)  If you like a medium coffee that is smooth and flavors nicely with a creamer give this one a try.

review/text: We have owned our Keurig since before Christmas, and have sampled many of the k-cups through the 5-cup sampler packs.  After all of the tasting the Timothy's Italian is my favorite blend.  It is crisp, robust, and has a coffee-shop freshness every time I make it.  And what a great surprise that I can purchase this coffee through the subscribe & save program on Amazon!  I just signed up for automatic delivery, because I have not and don't expect to tire of the great taste of the Timothy's Italian Blend. (Try some of their other blends, especially the Fair Trade.)

review/summary: Not for Dark Blend Coffee Drinkers
review/text: I am a fan of other Timothy K Cups, but not this one. I tried it based on the reviews, but unfortunately it is not that strong. Of course it's a matter of taste. I prefer the darker blends, but if you are someone who prefers a "not so strong" coffee than I guess you would enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, it does not taste bad, just too weak for my preference.

review/summary: Excellent medium roast
review/text: Realizing that these reviews are very subjective and it is hard to judge taste... these are my favorite K-cups so far and I have tried many. They are not too dark and not too weak, but with a great sweet and nutty flavor and are very consistent. If typical breakfast blends and the like are just too weak for you and the super-double dark ones are too bitter, give these a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />For a "taste preference" reference point, I am also a big fan of Kona and Kona blends.

review/text: I was sad after running out of Green Mountain's Island Coconut Coffee that we enjoyed over the summer. We looked everywhere for more but couldn't find any. I came across Green Mountain's Pumpice Spice K-Cup Coffee on Amazon and after reading the few reviews about it, took the plunge and purchased the 108 K-Cup pack. I am so glad I did! This is a wonderful coffee I look forward to every morning.<br /><br />I'll be ordering another 108-pack so I don't have the same disappointment as the Island Coconut, and will also be sending some to my daughter for when I visit!<br /><br />Edited to add:<br /><br />I got this box of 108 at $69.95 = about 65 cents per cup.
