review/summary: Consistently Good Green Tea
review/text: I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.

review/summary: Stevia is Great!
review/text: I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviews for the other liquid Stevia flavors (why didn't I hurry and rate this as soon as I got mine a few weeks ago??)! I ordered the Chocolate Raspberry, the English Toffee , and this one, the Lemon Drop. I was used to buying the same brand in the packets of powder, but the health food store was charging like $8 a bottle. The prices here on Amazon is VERY reasonable. I love the Lemon Drop one in my herbal teas (particularly my Honey Ginseng Mint) English Toffee seems to work better in my coffee. For a nice rich "mouth feel" (like cream but without the bad calories) try cold-pressed Coconut oil, also available here on Amazon. It's amazing what it does for coffee!! I'm trying to cut back on the soymilk because of excess estrogen level issues, and the cocoanut oil in my coffee combined with these WONDERFL Stevia flavors - I don't miss the soy milk at all, let alone regular milk!

review/summary: Only need a few drops
review/text: My mother gave me this to try.  It is wonderful!  You only need three or four drops to sweeten a tall glass of iced tea. I have tried other Stevia products in the past and found it diffucult to regulate the amount. It is very easy to use too much stevia powder leading to an overpowering taste.  This product is perfect because the Stevia is already dispersed in liquid and ready to use.  The dropper makes it easy to dispense--one drop at a time.  I have known for years that you can make your own Stevia liquid sweetener by adding stevia powder to water, but that has been too much trouble to bother with.  SweetLeaf has done it for me and added some flavors to boot. Thank-you SweetLeaf.<br /><br />The flavoring seems mild to me, but I only use a few drops of this sweetener at one time.  If the lemon flavor was stronger I would probably buy the plain stevia.  A hint of flavor is just perfect. If I want lemon, I squeeze it fresh. In fact, I squeeze fresh lemons and/or limes daily for their health benefits. I sweeten my morning "lemonade" with organic grade B maple syrup (high in minerals) and I will continue to use the maple syrup in my morning beverage. I will use the Stevia to sweeten other things throughout the day.<br /><br />Off topic: The BEST citrus press I have found is by Kitchenaid (not the stand mixer attachment), the free standing juicer. No metal parts touch the fruit and the machine is FAST.  Easy to clean up too--goes right into the dishwasher. If you are interrested in learning more about the benefits of fresh squeezed lemon and/or lime juice, you may want to read the book EATING ALIVE. My vision has improved significanly as a result of drinking my fresh squeezed lemon/lime juice daily.<br /><br />I am looking forward to trying the Chocolate Raspberry and English Toffee liquid Stevia in my coffee.  I am a big Torani fan, so I will be delighted if the flavored Stevia offers the same or comparable flavor and sweetness to my lattes.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned using coconut oil in her coffee.  I much prefer organic coconut milk in my coffee. I use organic coconut oil from Tropical Traditions(the BEST)--the original hand processed (not green label or expeller pressed)--but didn't care for coconut oil straight up in my coffee--it floats on the top. Even the higher fat content coconut milk blends with the coffee without leaving an oil puddle on top. Coconut oil is very healthy.  You can read more about it at www.coconutoil.com  Also note that not all coconut oils are comparable.  I have tasted some that are NASTY!<br /><br />I store my opened bottles of SweetLeaf Stevia in the refrigerator.<br /><br />If you are an artificial sweetener fan, I encourage you to visit www.mercola.com and enter your artificial sweetener preference in his search field to gather some info on it. Then, consider trying this product.<br /><br />I also use agave (similar to honey, only better) and real maple syrup as sweeteners. They have more calories than the Stevia, but are both excellent choices for sweeteners.<br /><br />When using Stevia, I encourage you to start with less and add more if needed. It doesn't take much to add sweetness.  This is a great product if you don't add too much.

review/summary: I hate drinking plain water, this makes it palatable
review/text: For years I've been drinking Crystal Light and the knock-off Great Value brand sold at "W", then just recently I found out that the chemicals used in Crystal Light can actually make a person more hungry.<br /><br />I simply cannot stand plain, unflavored water.  I don't care if it's been purified, chilled with ice or run through the wringer, I will not drink it.<br /><br />So I came across this SweetLeaf Lemon Drop Stevia and decided to give it a try.  I'm using 40 drops to a quart of water; that may sound like a lot, and it is, but I hope to reduce it down to 30 drops after awhile.  It is certainly sweet enough from the stevia, and I do taste the lemon, but I wish it tasted just a little more lemony.  I love the tartness of lemon so I'll pick up a few lemons the next time I go grocery shopping and add a slice or two to my quart of water.<br /><br />Still, this isn't bad the way it is, and I know I'm drinking much more healthy now. At least I'm getting my water in which is a good thing.<br /><br />Make sure you shake the bottle up each time and keep it refrigerated after opening.  One bottle is lasting me about a month, so dollar for dollar, it's about the same price as buying the Crystal Light.

review/summary: Great for sweetening, not for lemon flavor
review/text: I bought these after I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J5FN48">Mr. Coffee TM70 3-Quart Iced-Tea Maker</a> . I tried using Stevia packets but noticed the Stevia would clump up at the bottom and would not separate even when stirred. Loving the taste of lemon with my tea I opted for this flavor. However, it does not taste like lemon. It sweetens really well, better than expected. However, you cannot taste the lemon in it at all. I will still buy liquid Stevia in the future since it works but will be leery about trying any `flavored' ones.

review/summary: Not very lemony!
review/text: I bought this thinking it would be great to add to water to get a weak lemonade-like drink. Unfortunately, it's not very lemony-tasting and it takes a good bit of it to flavor a 20-oz bottle. The stevia has an odd taste, something like a cross between saccharine and Splenda, so it takes some getting used to for a die-hard aspartame lover like me! I had also hoped it could be carried with me in my purse for when I refill my bottle on the run, but apparently it needs to be refrigerated after opening, so that's not gonna work, either! ;)

review/text: My daughter brings flavored lemon water to school everyday and I was looking for an alternative to her Splenda based lemon water. I thought this would be a great solution. Unfortunately, even though this is a very nice sweetener the lemon flavor is barely detectable. The scent is great though! In tea this is fine, but as a sweetener/lemon flavor enhancer for water, this is not a good solution- stick with real lemons and stevia.

review/text: I have been using stevia lemon drop sweetener for quite some time, I put it in my water along with organic lemon juice and its very refreshing, and helps me to get the recommended amt of water drank, without it there is no way I'd be drinking enough.  Also I only order from Amazon because the shipping is much faster and the product is always packaged so the jars aren't broken.  Fast shipping is very important to me. Also I occ put lemon stevia in unflavored greek yogurt and like that very much also, adds no extra calories and has a great sweet flavor.  I definitely give sweetleaf lemon stevia and Amazon a BIG 5 star rating.

review/summary: Weak flavor in this water-based item
review/text: While waiting for my Amazon order to arrive, I bought a lemon-flavored stevia in a glycerin/alcohol base and was quite pleased with both the flavor and the sweetness - it made a nice lightly flavored water although I had to shake it every time before drinking. So I was surprised at both the extremely weak flavor and mild sweetness when this water-based liquid arrived. It never did make a satisfactory flavored water, and even when I tried to use it to sweeten my hot tea, I was not pleased with the result. So I'll be giving it away.<br /><br />When reading any review, remember that people "taste" sweetness differently. Some people don't really taste stevia as sweet, while others find it *too* sweet. I can purchase this same brand in a glycerin/alcohol base at my local organic grocery, and I will be doing that to see whether I like the glycerin solvent better, or whether this particular brand just doesn't mesh well with my taste buds.<br /><br />Edited to remove a reference to sucralose, an unrelated product.

review/text: These are cute little bones with knots on both ends made of rawhide.  I ordered 100 of them.  They're perfect for small dogs but I should have realized how small they were.  My malinois has one gone in second.  Overall a good product.

review/summary: Tiny but awesome
review/text: Yes, these are tiny - when they shipped to me, the package containing all 100 of them fit in my mailbox! But my strong-jawed 35-pound pit bull mix will spend 5-10 minutes with it, which is way longer than most small / inexpensive treats. I love that she finishes it, so I don't step on nasty slimy rawhide leftovers. I'll buy these for as long as they have them.

review/summary: excellent small dog treat
review/text: these bones are a perfect treat for my smaller dogs - under 30 lbs each.  They are small enough for my little guys to chew on but last long enough to occupy them for at least half an hour.  They are even good for my bigger dog as a reward that won't disappear in a gulp after clipping his nails.

review/text: The size was fine; however, they give off a very very strong plastic smell. I ordered them because the Milk Bone Brand was no longer available - the Milk bone Brand does not have this strong smell. The smell causes me to wonder if they are good for my pets.<br /><br />My pets ate them and they seem fine - regardless of the smell.

review/summary: Mini mini's but big enough
review/text: Our puggle goes through a mini rawhide every night as a treat.  We'd been buying them in 10 - 15 packs from the local big box pet store so I decided to see if I could save a little money by buying in bulk via Amazon.  Although these rawhides are the same 2.5" size as the ones from the store, the rawhide is thinner and I would guess that they weigh about 2/3rds of the others.  However, they were much less expensive and, aside from going through each one in half the time it took to eat the ones from the store, the dog doesn't seem to mind.  It's probably healthier for him to eat the smaller ones.

review/summary: My dog's love these
review/text: I have three dogs, small (5lb), medium (20 lb) and large (60 lb) and all three of them love these chews.  I first learned of this brand of chew at my vet's office, I had one of my dog's teeth cleaned and they suggested these (as well as the C.E.T. toothpaste) to help maintain the health and condition of my dog's teeth.  I have used this product a little over two years.  I each dog one chew (small for the small/medium dog and large for the large)at bedtime each night.  They remind me every night when I go to bed by standing by the cabinet where the chews are stored.  The only disadvantage, which is a minor thing but worth noting so you don't get surprised, the chews can leave a colored-residue on whatever bedding they are on while they chew it.  My dogs like to jump up on my bed to eat them so I place a towel down for them to eat on so my duvet does not get soiled.  The residue does not stain, it comes out with regular washing.

review/text: I have ordered the C.E.T. dog chews both ways: those with the Chlorhexidine, and those without. I prefer that our dogs chew those without the Chlorhexidine for two reasons: First, the ones with Chlorhexidine have an obnoxious odor for me. But most importantly, one of my dogs has a terrible diarrhea if he has the Chlorhexidine chews. I will continue to order the C.E.T. Premium Oral Hygiene Chews WITHOUT Chlorhexidine for my pets and give the WITHOUT Chlorhexidine chews five stars!

They are dental chews and I can vouch that they help keep a dogs mouth fresher. I buy these for a quick chew bone.<br /><br />Look for Virbac to see what works for you, the rawhide version of these runs large, so for a medium size ie;25-30# get the small dog selection.

review/text: My puppy loves these. Since he's twice the 11lb. mark, I thought I should switch to the Medium dog size, but I think they were too hard on his baby teeth. He chewed some of the Mediums but lost interest in any that were thick. The medium and bigger sizes are regular rawhide whereas these are uniformly sized pieces which appear to be manufactured. I would give them 5 stars if the company provided more information about the product.

review/summary: First time reviewing a product from amazon..CET doggie dental chews!
review/text: I bought this after reading great reviews from other buyers thinking my dogs would react the same way, enthusiastically. I was a little sad when they didn't seem to want to chew it. After about five minutes, all three dogs just walked away from their chews. I'm sure it is good for their teeth and my dogs are just picky chewers. They prefer greenies and the old fashion raw hides. I think yorkies are the most difficult dogs to find treats and food for, they're so finicky! So my point is, before diving into buying a big bag from hearing only positive reviews, try buying a smaller bag to test it b/c all dogs have different taste. I've been looking for good dental products for my dogs to chew and something that they would actually chew, I guess it's back to the search. Btw, the delivery service was prompt and would surprise you. Ordered it Friday, came Monday!

review/summary: BAD for small dogs - choking hazard / Good for BIG DOGS
review/text: My Shih tzus and Pekinese really like these chews but they tend to stuff them into their mouth once they're small enough but still too big to swallow.  One of my dogs swallowed a big piece then began walking with her back arched & was constipated.  Another one of my dogs tried to swallow a 2 inch piece and began choking - I had to pry her mouth open and pull it out of her throat.  I'm just thankful I was home when it happened.  I gave the bag to my neighbor who has a big dog and seems to have no problem with the chews.

review/summary: My dog loves these so much....
review/text: These are for some reason, one of my dog's favorite treats, which is great because with his dental issues I always have a package in the house. They are a little expensive i think, 30 cents per treat even at this great Amazon price of $10 (at Petco even the non Hextra version is $22!) but it's a great treat because of the 10% chlorhexidine coating. I don't give them to him every day because of the high percentage of the antiseptic ingredient, even though everything i've read indicates that is not at all harmful for doggies. I give him a half of 1 every other day.<br /><br />Other rawhide treats have made my dog throw up but he has never had any issues with these. Love them.<br /><br />I do have 2 gripes though. 1 is that one of the ingredients is maltodextrin, it's a chemical used in sugar substitutes, which is another reason i don't give him these daily. 2ndly, I always prefer my dogs treats made in the U.S., but these ones are "A product of Mexico".<br /><br />Even though my dog naturally accumulates plaque and tartar and an unbelievable fast rate, with the regimen i have in place he's doing well. I will always include these in my regimen unless something better comes along.<br /><br />Keep in mind, doggy dental chews cannot replace brushing. Pet dental gels can if brushing is not an option, special water additives and even the plaqueoff powder, but these chews are great for maintenance. I also have Chlorhexidine tooth wipes for dogs, i only use them 2x a week, i brush his teeth every other day and use dental gel on days i don't brush or wipe the teeth.

review/text: I ordered the medium size chews to go along with PlaqueOff.  They are coated with a dust that my dog seems to like however because of the shape and size I felt I needed to watch her all the time to see what progress she had made to avoid it getting too small and it actually got wedged in the roof of her mouth!  I would just a soon stick to the rawhide rolls. They last longer and I don't have to worry so much.

review/summary: These are amazingly EFFECTIVE! WOW!
review/text: I have a Yorkie-Poo who refuses to let me brush his teeth or even use the finger brushes.  He lets me use the Pedi-Paws on his nails, clean his ears, etc but refuses the teeth.  His breath was atrocious and I was worried about the amount of visible tartar on his teeth.  We still have one week left on the first 30 piece bag and his teeth are sooo white with the exception of the two larger incisor teeth on top.  But even on those, the tartar is missing in spots so it is slowly but surely working it off those teeth too.  And his breath no longer has an odor at all.  Very nice!  Ordering more today!  Trying the next size up because he chewed through the Petite/Small ones very quickly, was hoping they'd give him a little bit of a work up chewing on them...so trying next size up.

review/summary: caution
review/text: This product is interesting and well priced... but there is a significant gotcha...<br /><br />this small chew size is pressed together out of small rawhide chips and treated....  if your dogs are energetic chewers, they will crunch these things down very quickly...  which is potentially dangerous as the chips come apart in hard sharp pieces that remind me of small chicken bones.<br /><br />I have two small chihuahua / terrier mixes who ate these things in literally about 30 seconds....  they broke apart into said sharp pieces and got swallowed whole before I walked across the room... who wants to give a dental treat to their dog and be worrying about stomach / throat punctures and the like?<br /><br />It's very surprising to me that other reviewers haven't seen this... I guess they are just giving them to the dog and not paying attention about HOW they get eaten and how they break apart.  Bad pet owners.<br /><br />so, while the idea is nice, it's a dangerous product in my view.<br /><br />not happy about this one.

The only things that seem to help are an enzyme toothpaste and C.E.T. chews, used daily. And my dog likes these chews, which helps. Other chews may look like C.E.T., but do not have chlorhexidine. My vet recommended them. My pepe le peu's teeth and breath are much better between cleanings since I added them to his regimen.

review/summary: She won't chew on much else
review/text: Tried the "non-flavored" ones, but our little dog (small Spaniel-mix) won't eat them. Found these on Amazon with the Chlorhexidine (again) and now she is happy having something to chew on.  She lies down, props one straight up and down between her front paws and chews it up until it is all gone.  Great delivery, product arrived intact and before these are gone we will be ordering them again! ~ Thanks, Amazon! (Ordered enough to qualify for $25 "Free-Shipping".)

review/summary: Vet Recommended
review/text: This product was recommended by our vet for one of our older dogs.  We no longer have him as he is waiting at Rainbow Bridge for our reunion, however we have 2 new dogs that we have and will continue to give these to as they are not a danger to their digestive system.  We use to give our pet family members rawhide until we found out that they could die from them not getting digested properly or get very sick and need medical and maybe even surgery.  This is a wonderful alternative as well as a great aid in keeping their teeth strong and their breath mild.  I strongly recommend this product to all that love their pet family members.

review/summary: dog enjoys them
review/text: These were recommended by a vet, so I purchased them from Amazon at a significantly lower cost.  My toy poodle (8 lbs) enjoys chewing them up - I use them as a special evening treat and always hold onto the end so she can chew on it while sitting on my lap.  I don't know about the efficacy of the tarter control yet - hopefully time will show the chews have been helpful.  Although my little girl can eat a whole one easily, I break each piece in half.  I think half is enough to give at least some tarter control each night.  This will make the bag last twice as long, too.

review/summary: Great dog chew
review/text: These were originally recommended by my vet for use when I don't brush my dog's teeth,  Face it, brushing a dog's teeth is not that much fun so I give one of these to my dalmatian every evening after his dinner.  He waits for it every night, and while he is chewing it, it gives me time to eat MY dinner.  It is important to chose the right size for your dog; the petite ones are for small dogs; I use the large for my 60 pound Dalmatian.<br /><br />There are two types, with and without Chlorhexidine, which is the dental chemical.  For puppies, chews without Chlorhexidine are probably better because they don't need the dental chemicals for baby teeth, (and without is cheaper).<br /><br />Also, if you ever need to keep your dog occupied while you trim their nails or clean their ears or even give them an injection,  while they chew it and it will keep your dog occupied.<br /><br />I highly recommend these chews.

review/text: My pups like the large chews, that I cut for them, because they are thick and they can actually chew them for a while.  The small chews are just pressed pieces and takes my 15 lb dog about 30 seconds to eat one (and he doesn't even like them).  Not worth the investment for us - I buy the bigger chews (which they can actually chew) and cut them.

review/summary: This should be more appealing to dogs... duck please!
review/text: Can we please get these soaked in duck blood or something?  My yorkie won't touch these unless I tickle her fur in an irritating manner so that she wants to bite it... once bitten, she's not twice shy, and continues to eat them... but it's so much work.<br /><br />Suggestion: I immediately take these out of the bag they come in and dump them into a bag of duck breast strips... which by the way are almost as chewy and my dog could live off of duck breast.  My hope is that over time the duck scent gets all over these so she's more excited to eat them.  I wish I could even tie these around the duck so she has to work to get them.  Perhaps I'll do a basket-weave of these in a square around duck so she has to eat through these to get to them... at any rate, they need to be better flavored for my dog.

review/summary: Dog Teeth Cleaning Product
review/text: I originally got a package of these from my Holistic Vets office as a Thank you Gift.  So I decided to order some for my Large Breed Dog and more for my Small Breed.  Then when they arrived I decided to Read the Package and To My Surprise I noticed they were MADE in MEXICO (distributed from the Verbec plant in Texas).<br /><br />I emailed My Vet right away and asked him if he was aware of this because he really supports this item and his answer was NO !  He was Not aware that the Texas Facility had CHANGED their Manufacturing Plant to MEXICO !  So he kindly said I could return the products.  And said he'd call the Company in Texas and ask them what was up, why they changed.<br />Unfortunately I still have not gotten an answer from my Vet and emailed him back (he is a VERY Busy Vet Being Nominated #1 Vet in the Chicago Land Area recently.)  So he said he'd delegate it to his Office Manager.<br /><br />SO BEWARE !  What you once thought to be Made in AMERICA may not be anylonger !  I will discontinue using these until my Vet has an answer for me to continue to use or not.  I bet he'll say Not.<br /><br />I say it's an OK product because my Dogs do like it.  But It should be rated a ZERO because it is NOT made in America and the company did NOT make the Vets aware that they were changing their Manufacturing Plant to Mexico

Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

review/text: At first, I thought these tasted a little artificial. After a few handfuls I realized I like them, regardless.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this company's products, and have even gone so far as to speak with one of their growers about the integrated pest management systems they employ (using the smallest amount of pesticides possible).  I will keep buying all their other flavors. The Bold line, especially the Habanero, is also excellent, as are the dark chocolate variety.

review/text: These almonds are nothing short of incredible- they are so delicious! If you are trying to follow a low-carb lifestyle (for dietary reasons or weight loss) and need a 'sweet fix' after meals, then this is a wonderful option - only 6 g. Net carbs! And the taste is so yummy! They are just sweet enough! I'm so glad that amazon sells them in bulk, because I could easily go through one container in a week!
