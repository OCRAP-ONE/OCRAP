review/summary: I could eat the whole case in a day!
review/text: My local health food store started selling these 10 years ago and then stopped to focus more on vitamins instead of food!<br />So now I order these directly from Lumen and usually get the case of "over and unders" which contains packages that they can't sell to stores due to the weight being off. This is your best bet since I read reviews on here of receiving them stale off amazon.<br />The best flavors are the original mild, bbq beef and the teriyaki beef. I HATE the Cajun varieties, they are so dry and tough to chew.<br />They are high in fat so I usually have to make my husband hide them from me since these are a rare treat for us in the house, I could eat 4-5 bags in a row!<br />Caution if you eat too many bags over a period of a few days, you may experience gas!<br />Try ordering direct and you'll be enjoying the BEST veggie jerquee there is in the US!!!!<br />PS These are made in Louisiana, could you ask for anything more authentic besides the real thing (meaning meat)

review/summary: Stonewalls is the best
review/text: If you're looing for a nice inexpensive jerky treat, you'd be hard pressed to find better. Stonewall's original and stonewall's original mild are some of the best tasting jerkey you'll find. What's best, is that this product is meat free. So for all you vegans out there this is especially a great treat idea. The package here is a store display container.  I keep them in the closet and when we remember we have them, it makes a perfect snack.  I think we'll be working on the box for about 2 month and that's with two jerkey freaks eating them.

review/summary: Airy and oily.
review/text: The texture on these things is all off.  For one, they're incredibly airy.  I am a huge fan of Primal Spirit and Tofurky Jurky, and had been used to denser vegan jerky when I first tried these.  It felt like I was chewing air.  Also, because these are higher in fat (8-9 grams per 160 calorie package), they are a bit oilier.  Coupled with the airiness, when you bite down on these, you can feel the oil oozing out of the little nuggets into your mouth, which isn't too pleasant.<br /><br />I don't think the flavor is anything special, either.  To be fair, I'm not sure what chicken tastes like or is supposed to taste like, but there are plenty of wonderfully flavorful vegan and vegetarian products out there.  This is not one of them.

review/text: An ethical workout for the jaw.  It tastes a little sweet, but teriyaki is supposed to.  Of course even considering a "vegan jerky" is to knowingly enter a state of sin.  This is a long-shelf-life processed snack food, not carrots and celery pulled fresh from the organic garden, but hey, no refrigeration required.

review/summary: Not perfect, but pretty good
review/text: I've tried two flavors - Pepperoni and Original Wild - and have enjoyed them both.  The texture's pretty good - nice and chewy.  The moisture level is okay, but it could be improved by being just a tiny bit more moist. There's also a little bit of an aftertaste (which I didn't find to be unpleasant, but some might).  The spice level on the Pepperoni and Original Wild flavors were perfect. The Original Wild was medium hot, so it might be a little too much for some.  I loved it though.  I recommend that people try to buy this locally before spending a lot of money on it.  I bought mine from a local vegan store online, then discovered that a large grocery chain carries it in their health food section.

review/summary: My Fave Veg Jerky
review/text: The "Original Wild" is a bit spicy for me, but "Original Mild" is spectacular, and Teriyaki Beef even better. Also like the spicy chicken one. I've tried all the veg jerky products and bewildered that none of the others come even close to this one for quality of flavor and texture. The others are loaded with sugar and taste more like candy than jerky; a couple of them are outright slimy; one was hard as a rock and flavorless. But the only time Stonewall's Jerquee ever displeased me was when the Poulsbo Market used a paper-punch to create holes along the top edge and hung them on a peg to dry out -- which I didn't realize until I got them home and they'd all been turned into hard lumps (which I ate any way). So now I have to buy them on amazon. I'll still get the fresh sushi at Poulsbo Market, that stuff's a dream, but what possessed them to poke holes in packaged foods???

review/summary: I love them:)
review/text: I have always liked these but I haven't had them in years.  Today, I was hungry and saw them at the natural market checkout counter.  I got the flavor "spicy 'chicken'" and LOVED it.  It is clear that this is a love or hate product.  I buy Primal Strips when in need of a snack I can eat in the car and they are just ok...oily and get stuck in my teeth.  Flavor is just OK.  Stonewall's are drier and puffier and chewier but somehow, don't get stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />I am on a low-carb diet and these are only 7 g of carbs for 13 g of protein.  I am getting a case of the original mild since it is Prime.  Would like to see more flavors available on Prime.<br /><br />Definitely suggest buying a small pack first given the love/hate aspect.

review/summary: Horrific Flavor and Terrible Texture
review/text: I love other brands of vegetarian jerky. This one, I hate. It is spongy instead of chewy and smells and tastes like concentrated, stale, off-brand dog food. I could not get this funky crap out of my mouth fast enough. I should also mention that I'll eat just about anything, including bugs and grass. If it came down to it, I'd turn to them before ingesting another piece of this food-like substance.

review/summary: Terrible. Couldn't finish bag.
review/text: I just purchased this jerky from a local store because they recently quit carrying the kind I like in my town. I ate a piece and thought it was disgusting. I wanted to give it a chance, so I ate a couple more pieces. It has a grainy, nasty texture and a terrible burned BBQ sauce flavor. For some bizarre reason it's made out of soy flour instead of strips of soy.<br /><br />The best soy jerky I've ever had is Tasty Eats jerky, since it's chewy and had a wonderful flavor. Flavor is of course subjective, but personally I thought the taste of Stonewall's is terrible, and the consistency is nasty. It tries too hard to look like meat, which I feel is pretty irrelevant to the demographic of people that will be eating it in the first place. Luckily it's Gluten-Free, so hopefully I can pawn the leftovers on my boyfriend...

review/summary: Best veg jerky
review/text: I think its interesting how spread out the reviews are on this product.  I guess its one of those love it or hate it type things.  Personally, I LOVE this jerky and cannot get enough!!  My favorite flavors are the hot pastrami and teriyaki. You do have to chew quite a bit but its not the same weird chewy texture some other veg jerkys have, like primal strips.  I hate primal strips but I had them about 10 years ago and never ate once since, so if the formula has changes on those then disregard...  So maybe try a small bag of this before ordering in bulk.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: I picked these up at Natural Grocers because I used to really love jerky, but am now vegetarian for four years, and I didn't like the Primal strips enough to re-purchase. I purchased the Original Mild and the Teriyaki flavors.<br /><br />The texture of these is spot on if you like toughier jerky (I do), although the outside has a weird sort of clumpy coating. Unfortunately, the taste is TERRIBLE. Both varieties honestly tasted like dog food. I also had two friends (one recently vegetarian, the other not) try them, and they said exactly the same thing. My friend's toddler-aged son loved them, though.<br /><br />I liked these even less than the Primal strips, and would not recommend them.

review/text: I think the jerky would have been good, but...<br />The packages I received contained jerky that had fuzzy white stuff growing on it. None of the packages had a read-able expiration date. The clearest packaging shows Aug 2011 (which means the product still had 6 months left in its life). When I contacted Lumen, however, I did get an email and phone call from them expressing their concern about my complaint. The man I spoke with was genuinely interested in investigating the problem. The company directly sent me three free packages to replace some of the moldy ones.

review/text: The seasoning is good, but the texture is not to my liking; it's almost spongy, and microwaving did not improve the texture for me. It is a little too dry and chewy, and has a weird aftertaste. I have not tried the other versions of this jerky. If you prefer a dry and chewy veggie jerky, I would go with the Vegan Dream brand. They have a sampler pack, with 6 different flavors. Also, as I follow weight watchers online, the 1.5 oz package has 4 points, with 8 grams of fat, 152 calories, 3 grams of fiber. There are lower calorie veggie jerkies available, if that is a concern for you.

review/text: This stuff is like crack.  There's no other way of describing just how delicious it is.  If it gets old, it gets a little hard, but they never sit around long enough to get old at my house.  I order this constantly and sometimes they run out, which leaves me craving it and miserable-- or begging my local health food store to dig in their back room for stray bags.  It's THAT good!!!  The only catch on Amazon is it's ingredients list wheat (in the soy sauce) as an ingredient, but the kind I've been getting are also labeled gluten free on the front.  I'm fairly confident it's a typographical error, because I've been eating it for a year now and no gluten reaction!  Enjoy!!!

review/summary: not like jerky
review/text: i had high hopes for this stuff. i have tried several types of veggie jerky, in search of the tough, fibrous, highly seasoned jerky of my old meat eating days. granted, my memory is likely hazy as i haven't eaten meat for about 20 years. however, this stuff is NOT like beef jerky. true, they are a bit hard and chewy. and they are very flavourful, but....in my opinion, not in a good way.<br /><br />if you have ever had those dehydrated soy slices made by "so soya" (and others) then you know what these are. take those slices, marinade and fry or bake, and you've probably got something like this jerky. they have a distinct flavour - i really can't pinpoint exactly what flavour it is, but it is consistent in all of the varieties and it is not too pleasant. i found the tofurky jerky to have a better flavour and nicer dense texture, but i think my search for the ideal jerky shall continue.

I've never had an issue with it, so I don't know for sure, but I suppose it'd be worth a try if you like the taste but find it a bit oily.<br /><br />All in all, compared with some of the gross real-meat jerky products I've tried, this stuff is pretty good. But don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself.

review/summary: Great fake jerkey
review/text: This is a great substitute if you're vegetarian. The problem is, when it is stale, it's very hard to chew* (but still tastes good). When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome. Stonewall's is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. I like mild best, and teriyaki is my second favorite. Both of these flavors are safe if you avoid spicy stuff like I do. If you like things hot, try some of the other flavors!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully!

review/text: With my favorite brand no longer available, I decided to try the Coffee Bean Direct.  The dark house brew had a pleasing flavor, a hint of sweetness and no bitterness.  All in all, a little better that my usual brand, and at a respectable price. The 80 oz. bad is large and should last at least a month, but being bagged, refrigeration is a must.  A finely ground, dark roast, it even looked appealing when I opened the bag.  So unless you are into grinding your own, this is a solid choice, for a strong, bold cup of coffee.

review/summary: My favorite of all potato chips
review/text: First, I wouldn't trust anybody's opinion on a food item because everyone has different tastes. Secondly, these chips are awesome and you should buy them because I say so.  Okay, well, actually, I suggest you go buy one bag somewhere prior to buying a dozen bags and finding out you don't like them.  I do love these chips though.  Most Vinegar/Salt chips are too wangy or tart for me.  These chips have a mildly tart, slightly sweet vinegar flavor.  Also I am a salt-aholic and these chips satisfy my salt cravings perfectly. Texture is similar to other kettle type chips - plenty crunchy.  Totally yummy!  I'm salivating just thinking of them.

review/summary: Unusual and tasty
review/text: I am usually indifferent to potato chips, but these are the exception.  I first tried them when visiting a friend in Colorado and thought they were delicious.<br /><br />Don't order them if you've never tried them, because they are not like other salt & vinegar chips, and if that's what you're expecting you'll be disappointed.  The malt vinegar gives the chips a slight sweet taste which goes quite nicely with the salt - for those of us who like these chips, anyway.<br /><br />Incidentally, this is is a good price for these chips.  Assuming you can get free shipping, it works out to about $1.60 per bag, which is cheaper than you'd ever find them in the store.

You don't get that sort of acidic burning feeling on your tongue when you eat them, which allows you to eat more. Uh-oh! If you are after a real hefty vinegar flavour, this may not suit you. Still worth a try because they are yummy!

review/text: These are the worst potato chips I have ever had. They are way, way too salty. And, to make matters worse, the manufacturer adds fructose sugar to the recipe, which adds an inappropriate sweet note. I would definitely not recommend these chips. Luckily, I did not buy a case. I picked up a single bag from my local grocer. I do not understand all the favorable reviews for this product! I think these chips are just awful!

review/text: These are the best chips ever. Beware: you open a bag and before you know it you've eaten the whole thing. Trust me, it happens no matter how hard you try.  These chips are just the right level of saltiness, and the malt gives it a sweetness with the vinegar that is incredible.  If you've ever been to the Carolinas or other states down south and had malt vinegar on your french fries, this is sort of reminiscent of that. Love these chips.

The salt part is ok but the vinegar taste very sweet, almost sickening sweet.

review/text: Dave's Burning Nuts are so hot I could barely keep them in my mouth.  As an avid fan of spicy nuts, I've searched far and wide for some hot nuts that could properly satisfy my taste buds.  I have finally found my nut match in Dave's Burning Nuts.  Seasoned with salt, habanero chili, spices, onion, garlic and paprika, these nuts will explode in your mouth and blow you away.  Be careful when devouring these nuts, however, they're addictive.  One is just never enough.  But if you're not careful you'll find yourself with a burning mouth and an uncontrollable craving for more of Dave's Burning Nuts.  And no one likes to run out of nuts.  Especially when they're this tasty.  These nuts are a perfect snack for those enjoying them on the go or a relaxing afternoon in bed.  A great and delicious low calorie snack, these nuts will sneak up on you and find their way down your gullet.  The spicy/salty combination will leave your taste buds wanting more.  In this world, there are only two kinds of people.  Those who crave burning nuts and those who fear them.  Don't fear the nuts.  Embrace the nuts.  Pop them in your mouth and enjoy every delicious moment.  At $10.40 a can, you can't afford not to taste these burning nuts.

This soup is lovely just as is, with lots of potential for interesting garnishes - a swirl of cream, toasted spicy pumpkin seeds, grated asiago cheese, coconut milk, panchetta....use your imagination, and serve it to admiring dinner guests!<br />It also makes a welcome addition to chicken stock to thicken up homemade chicken vegetable soup. The flavor profile lends itself well to putting an Asian spin on my old classic recipe.<br />Oh, and it also tastes awesome mixed half & half with Amy's chunky tomato soup.

review/summary: Great to-go food.
review/text: I'm a college student and being in a field that requires a lot of my time, I usually can't make my lunch. The on the go tins are fantastic because I can just stick them in my backpack for an emergency lunch and they'll last forever. I think the pasta is really good, I eat it at room temperature with a little salt and the sauce. The sauces are always weird for the Gourmet on the Go containers (honey for salmon??) but most of the time they really add a lot of flavor. This one not so much, but it may just be me. The meal is a little tiny, and you don't feel "full" afterwards. But you don't feel hungry! So if you're set on that full feeling, eat an apple or small snack with it. I only gave it four stars because it's not delicious enough that I'll go out of my way to eat it.

review/summary: I like the brand, but I did not like this one
review/text: I purchased the Salmon and veggies and the sweet corn, which are both pretty good, so I though I would give this a try.  Too bad I did not try one, instead I gambled and got the 6 pack.  Unfortunately I really don't like these.  I was thinking pasta salad, but what I got tastes more like pasta and canned beans or something.  I could not get more than a few bites in before I just chucked it.  I tried it cold, and then hot thinking it may be better - how wrong I was.  Later I found that they sell these at Whole Foods, which is a much better way to sample them.  Hey there's an idea, a sample pack, too bad they don't sell anything like that here.

review/summary: Great Healthy on-the-go & Portable!
review/text: I've tried this as well as many of the other choices, and they've all been good. The veggies are healthy and if you get one with beans & rice, the tuna or the salmon (which I haven't tried yet), you'll get a balanced meal. The best part? They all come with a plastic-covered small fork, salt & pepper and a gourmet sauce that's different for almost each variety.<br /><br />I rarely have time to make myself food to take with me, and being busy AND a diabetic, it's important that I have something to eat when I need it. This way, I'm not stuck eating junk or not getting enough to keep me going for awhile.<br /><br />The ONLY negative comment I have is that the cardboard box which covers the meal is rather flimsy, and also is open on the sides. So in a bag that's moving around, it sometimes can come apart, and then you have to search for the fork and condiments in your bag. Put it in a plastic bag so that you can easily find the items if it comes apart.

review/text: I fell in love with Krusteaz Almond Poppyseed muffins years ago when my mother made up a batch for the family. Much to my dismay, this particular Krusteaz flavor is difficult to find in my local supermarkets, with most stores opting to stock the Lemon Poppyseed variety but not the Almond Poppyseed.<br /><br />These muffins are fluffy and delicious, and they are very easy to make. There's nothing like enjoying a muffin hot out of the oven, which is a pleasure even the local bakery cannot provide!

review/summary: Poppyseed Muffins With Great Crunchy Texture
review/text: This mix produces a poppyseed muffin with great crunchy texture.  All you need is the mix, a cup of water, and an egg (although you can make an "extra rich & moist" version by adding 1/3 cup vegetable oil to the mix).  The box contains a large packet of poppy seeds, which you fold into the batter.  The finished muffins look exactly like the photo on the box:  lots of poppy seeds!<br /><br />The muffins have a strong almond flavor, which must come from almond extract, because it has a slight "chemical" or "medicinal" edge. This is fine with me, but some might not like it.  Each muffin has 240mg of sodium per muffin, so the mix is okay for persons on a low-to-moderate-salt diet, as long as they don't eat too many!<br /><br />The box also has instructions for using the mix to make almond poppyseed quick bread or pound cake. I've tried several of the Krusteaz muffin mixes, and they're all good, but this one is probably my favorite.

review/summary: Not bad, but rather bland -- I added berries
review/text: I am a big fan of Krusteaz muffin mixes -- I usually bake several dozen once a month or so (oat bran and fat-free banana are my favorites), then freeze them and have a couple for breakfast every morning (I nuke them on high for about 10 seconds each and they are ready).  I had never tried this kind before as it's not one my local grocery stores carry, so I bought a case from amazon.  The first time I baked them, they smelled AMAZING in the oven and I was looking forward to trying them.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the taste -- they were just very, very, very bland.  They tasted to me somewhat like vanilla muffins (I can't taste anything like almonds in them), but actually they didn't have much of a taste at all.<br /><br />With my second box, I added frozen mixed berries (blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries) to the mix -- I think about a cup or cup and a half of the berries (no need to defrost them first).  This improved the taste quite a bit, so I think this muffin mix just needs SOMETHING added.<br /><br />I will continue to add fruit (maybe nuts too at some point) to the 10 boxes I have left, but I doubt that I will order any more.  I really wanted to like these and am surprised no one else mentioned how bland they are.  (Maybe it's just me.)

review/summary: Avoid Online Orders
review/text: Be careful what supplier you select because returns aren't allowed. I had ordered this chocolate several times via Amazon. From Amazon directly, the G&B bars (made in Canada) arrived promptly. Then in late 2009 my first (and last) order, fulfilled Nutricity, arrived a month after the order had been placed, and then only after an inquiry to the seller. The bars were dry, stale and hard, the color of cocoa powder rather than chocolate bars. Although the bars still had 10 months to go before expiration of the sell-by date on the wrappers, they were a disgrace to the good name of G&B. It may be that they had been stored improperly, or that the single paper wrapper used in the Italian plant (the Canadian maker uses an inner foil wrap) allowed too much air to get to the bars. I ground them for hot chocolate, but they were unsuitable for eating directly and very similar in quality to the bars one sometimes finds at mass-market outlets that resell overstock from other retailers. Two years later I tried again, but had the same experience. The order was fulfilled by a different Amazon supplier, not Amazon itself. Again, the bars were stale and appeared to have been improperly stored (although they did arrive promptly.) In the future I will use a supplier with which Kraft (owner of Cadbury, owner of G&B) seems to have better quality control --- my local grocer.

review/summary: Nutricity gives G&B a bad name
review/text: I ordered this chocolate from Nutricity. Although I have no problems with the speed of the delivery, or the way the items were packaged, somewhere along the line, Nutricity did not store them well. DO NOT ORDER FROM NUTRICITY. The chocolate is dried out and discolored. It crumbles in your mouth and has a bitter, astringent taste. In comparison, I just picked up a bar at Wegmans. The color of the chocolate is darker and more consistent than the bars from Nutricity. The bar from Wegmans melts in your mouth and has complex undertones that I can't find words to describe yet. If I hadn't tried the comparison, I would have said that Green & Black's chocolate was pretty poor. However, the bar from Wegman's is a completely different chocolate. So, do not order from Nutricity, but do try Green & Blacks. I rate the chocolate from Wegmans a 5.

review/summary: Sumptuously delicious dark chocolate
review/text: Green & Black's is my new favorite dark chocolate--by a mile. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to eat dark chocolate either for the health benefits it provides or for its delicately bittersweet flavor. This particular brand of dark chocolate tastes amazing.<br /><br />The company G&B is from Canada and is famous for organic, fair-trade, 70% dark chocolate. This particular bar has had the same recipe since 1998. It was previously labeled "vegan," but per the G&B website, the label for this bar no longer says vegan and indicates that milk is an ingredient because both their "milk chocolate and dark chocolate bars are made using the same production line...and a recent audit revealed that traces of milk residues can still be found on manufacturing equipment despite intensive cleaning." The ingredients listed on the package are: organic bittersweet chocolate (organic chocolate), organic raw cane sugar; organic cocoa butter; soy lecithin (emulsifier), organic vanilla extract; organic whole milk powder. There is a warning that because this is manufactured in a facility that uses nuts and peanuts, those with allergies to them should not eat this product.<br /><br />The question some may ask who love sweet, milk chocolate is, why pay more money (often quite a bit more) for dark chocolate such as this that doesn't taste sweet? The main reason for most people in the over-50 crowd is the health benefits to be gained from consuming dark chocolate. The more chocolate contained in a chocolate bar, the more of the good stuff--cacao--that you are getting. In short, the more "bang" for your "buck."<br /><br />Over the last four years there have been dozens of scientific studies analyzing and confirming substantial health benefits from a small amount of dark chocolate consumed daily. The latest findings from a Harvard study released in early 2011 indicate that as little as 6 gm. of dark chocolate (about 30 calories) is a sufficient daily "dose." (That is equivalent to about 1.5 of the tiny squares of this chocolate.) The original German studies in 2007 used Ritter Sport chocolate, but I haven't so far been able to discover which kind of Ritter's dark chocolate was used by the researchers. However, since Ritter's only makes two types, 50% cacao and 71% cacao, this product, at 70% cocoa, fits well within the parameters of that study.<br /><br />The health benefits of dark chocolate are due to the flavonoids contained in cocoa. Flavonoids act as antioxidants in the body, which both prevent and reduce inflammation. Over many years of medical research, inflammation has been found to contribute to or directly cause a host of diseases, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and cancer, as well as autoimmune diseases like arthritis.<br /><br />Flavonoids are found in the pigments of fruits and vegetables which give them their color. The darker and deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the greater the amount of flavonoids it contains. Cocoa is derived from the dark-brown cacao bean, which is the fruit of the tropical tree, theobroma cacao. In any chocolate product, such as this one, the higher the percentage of cocoa/cacao, the more flavonoids the chocolate contains.<br /><br />Dark chocolate such as this product is better for your health than milk chocolate because it contains more antioxidants, which are good for you, and less sugar, which is not good for you--especially if you have diabetes or are struggling with your weight.<br /><br />The FDA defines categories of chocolate based on how much cocoa/cacao is in a given product:<br />1. Unsweetened chocolate with no additives is 100% cocoa. Most all brands of unsweetened baker's chocolate fall into this category. Their ingredient list will state simply, "chocolate."<br />2. Bittersweet chocolate contains 35-99% cocoa (35% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. There is a large range of products in this category, and the product names reflect the amount of chocolate they contain. Unsweetened chocolate is very bitter, and the more cocoa in a product, the less room for sugar, and the more bitter it will be. In order to avoid frightening off customers who are used to sweet chocolate, marketers often substitute the words "dark," "extra dark" or "intense" for "bitter" if that word is not paired with "sweet," for example as "bittersweet" or "extra bittersweet." This product lies at the top of this range.<br />3. Sweet chocolate contains 15-34% cocoa (15% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. It is sometimes also marketed as "dark chocolate," even though it has a much lower percentage of cocoa solids than bittersweet, which can cause consumers, in such cases, to purchase a product with less cocoa in it than they realized they were getting. Everything else besides the cocoa and milk solids is essentially sugar.<br />4. Milk chocolate is only required to have a minimum of 10% cocoa, a minimum of 12% milk solids and 3.39% milk fat. The rest is sugar and milk.

review/summary: Dark chocolate perfection
review/text: I've been eating dark chocolate since Hershey came out with Special Dark in the 70's. I discovered Dove, Ghirardelli, and more recently Scharffen-Berger, etc. A few years ago I tried this stuff and, honestly, I haven't looked back. It has fantastic flavor and, most importantly, it has the perfect melting point - NO waxiness - just starts melting and releasing complex flavor the moment you put it in your mouth. Not too sweet, not too bitter. I've had re-trials of some big-name dark chocolates in recent years (recalling swooning over them in the past), but continue to go back to Green & Black. Haven't tried the 85% but will soon.<br /><br />BTW, WalMart is selling these for 2.97 a bar, and occasionally Walgreen's will run them @ 2 for $5 - last time, I stocked up!

I don't find it bitter at all, unlike other common non-organic name-brand chocolates, which are often bitter even though they have far less cocoa content.  They also have a lot more sugar, and yet this low sugar bar is still less bitter.<br /><br />The other thing to note is that the caffeine content of Green & Black's dark chocolate is significantly less than the name brand non-organic ones -- 6mg per 40g serving, as opposed to 30+mg.  This is due to the other chocolates grinding up the whole bean including the shell instead of removing the nibs from the casing first, presumably to cut costs.  I'm guessing the shell is also what is adding to the bitterness of other chocolates.<br /><br />Now I just need to find a way to stock up on cases of these at a discount price.

review/summary: Great 70% dark chocolate
review/text: I have been sampling a number of 70% dark chocolate bars recently and this is as good as any I have tasted, plus it is organic.  However I would urge anyone who wants to try this product to check your local grocer first.  I bought mine at my local Publix supermarket and it was much cheaper than any price on Amazon.  The same is true for Lindt and Ghirardelli chocolate.  Plus no shipping charges.

review/summary: Perfect Dark Chocolate
review/text: If you're looking for a tasty, silky dark chocolate, this one is a treat.  Nutritionists recommend having an ounce of 70% or above dark cocoa per day.  This has a rich, silky taste and texture.  Not too bitter and not too sweet.  I'm happy with 3 squares of it which is about 60 calories.  I picked mine up locally at the health food store in town and a single bar was over $4.00 to give you a price comparison.  My son was able to find them at Walmart but I don't like driving that far and would order in bulk to keep in the house. These are tasty.

review/summary: Save Green and Black's from Hersheys!
review/text: Green and Black's chocolate has always been great - when I moved from the UK to the US I was very relieved to find it in my local Whole Foods - saved me carrying in pounds of it every time I flew back from the UK! Green and Blacks chocolate is smooth and full of flavor; luckily, Cadbury's, who bought them a couple of years ago, did not mess with the G&B formula, and let them produce their chocolate as they always had.<br /><br />Now if Hersheys buy Cadbury's, it may be a different story - Hershey's have ruined any small artisanal chocolate they acquired - it always becomes like Hershey's so-called 'chocolate' - a sickly-sweet, fatty, gross confection that does not deserve the name of chocolate. (It's amusing to me that Amazon offers a deal if you add a Hershey's dark chocolate bar to your basket with the G&B dark bar - NO self-respecting lover of G&B or any real chocolate would EVER go near Hershey's again if they have even tried it once).<br /><br />Anyway - buy this chocolate if you love real food, real taste and real chocolate. If you are a Cadbury's shareholder and chocolate-lover, don't let Hershey's get their sickly-sweet paws on Green and Blacks!

review/summary: Best I have ever had
review/text: This is the best dark chocolate I have ever had, hands down.  It has a very intense flavor.  You will probably have to be a true dark chocolate fan to really enjoy it though.  I can't keep these in my house.  And from what I read there are many health benefits to this kind of chocolate.
