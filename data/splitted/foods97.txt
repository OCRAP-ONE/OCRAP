review/summary: Oh, so very very very VERY good
review/text: I LOVE these cookies.  Most cookies are too sweet for me -- not these.  However, since they follow the  European trend of using  natural ingredients, they are full of saturated fat from butter and cream.<br /><br />WHO CARES?<br /><br />They are the best cookies, for me, in the world, comparable only to<br />"Feullitees Doree," which can be bought on in France.

review/summary: broken cookies
review/text: I bought these cookies for myself and as a gift for my dad for his birthday. Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad.

review/summary: Light, Flaky & Tasty GOOD Cookie!!
review/text: I really like these cookies.  They are made with pastry dough - lots of thin, flaky, crispy layers with a very light coating of honey (or something like honey).  The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It's a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!

review/summary: Rather Bland
review/text: I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.

review/summary: Coffee Lovers Beware
review/text: I purchased this coffee on sale at my local Vons. They had it on sale for $4.99 a bag so I bought four bags -- can't beat that price, right? I figured, how bad could it be?<br /><br />It is beyond bad. First, if this is "French Roast" coffee than I'm Angelina Jolie. There is not on identifiably French Roast aspect about it. The taste is nothing short of horrid. I tried making a pot with more coffee and one with less coffee. Nothing worked -- it's just awful.<br /><br />I am taking back the three unopened bags as this is just undrinkable. I threw the open bag away.<br /><br />This is how bad it is: I have a can of Folger's in my pantry for those emergency mornings when you wake up and learn you're out of coffee. I poured out the Gevalia and made a pot of Folgers and it was better than the Gevalia. Since Folger's is barely drinkable, imagine how horrid Gevalia is.<br /><br />Save your money. It's not even worth buying when it's on sale.

review/summary: God sent for minor digestive issues
review/text: I have to warn that my review is going to sound like I sell this product.<br />I wish I know how to make them but I don't.<br /><br />Next time you have minor digestive issues or stomach gas or nausea try one of these babies!<br />Just put it on your tongue and take in the juices.<br />You will feel better in 5 minutes.<br /><br />Just a little bit of history.<br />When I was growing up, I knew them as Al Bukhara.  My father used to regulary eat them.<br />50 years later, when I recently had stomach ailment, I remembered about them.<br />My wife found them at a local middle-east store under the same name. They are made in Iran.<br />Unfortunately, the store stopped selling them and had to look for an alternative and found the golden prunes from Sadaf.<br />They are not as good as Al Bukhara but next best thing and work well.<br /><br />I have been using these for two years and they work every single time.<br />But watch out, they will make you hungry; I am not kidding!<br /><br />Now, here is the most important thing<br />I found that not all dried prunes are as effective. In fact most of them don't do anything.<br />The prunes need to be moist, golden or light brown and soft. Sadaf also sells pitted prunes; don't buy them for relief from digestive issues or just to clear your stomach.<br /><br />Amazon has been out of stock for a while now.  I buy them locally.<br />If you don't have access to such a store, Sadaf sells them online.

review/summary: doesn't cook up quite as the recipes describe, but . . .
review/text: I purchased this red quinoa on a special deal here on Amazon, partly because I have a Vegetarian sister and a friend with gluten allergies, and so I'm always looking for new dishes that we can all eat and enjoy.  I'd never cooked quinoa before, though I'd recently sampled the white variety in a couscous dish at someone else's home.<br /><br />So far, the prewashed red quinoa seems to require longer cooking than most of the online recipes suggest, and I haven't been thrilled with the taste of the quinoa alone or with a few spices.  I read online that this red variety has an earthier flavor, and I'm not sure that it appeals to me.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is such a good source of nutrition that I've continued to experiment with using it in combination with other ingredients, where the quinoa flavor can be mixed with other tastes I enjoy more.  I don't regret buying this, but I'm not yet ready to replace rice or pasta or oatmeal in my diet with cooked quinoa only.

review/text: I can't say enough about these nuts, they are fantastic!  I stopped buying them years ago because they were way too expensive but at Amazon's price I'm now a subscription customer.  The only problem with these nuts is that once you open the can you don't want to stop eating them.  They have a Kona Coffee glaze and have just a hint of coffee flavor. I highly recommend this product.

I bought these at a specialty dog store for 3.00 more and the treats seem to be more solid than the ones I got from Amazon. The delivered treats were not consistent and many were hollow inside.

review/text: It appears Amazon may have gotten a bad batch, or they are very old.  I was excited to find these as my Husky-Shepard has allergies to Beef & Chicken and these did not contain either.  They are expensive, but I decided to try them.  When I opened them they have all sorts of holes (looks like air holes) in them and the dog (66#) had a hard time chewing through them.  I think she liked the flavor, but biscuits shouldn't be so difficult to eat. I saw several other people with the same comments, so I believe either Amazon or the manufacturer needs to figure out what is happening with these.  Had they been $1.00 a bag I would figure I got what I paid for.

Since both of the pups are only fed GRAIN-FREE diets, I was determined to find a comparable biscuit/treat formula that would not interfere with the benefits they've enjoyed since becoming members of the high-protein, low-carb community.  Viola! This superior dog biscuit recipe contains only 7 primary ingredients and when you open the bag, the aroma of smoked salmon lets them know to come a'runnin!  Now, they're eager to try the other flavor combos created by Dick Van Patten's company.  Thanks to the Van Patten company of dog lovers who want only the best nutrition and taste for their canine companions.  Applause!

review/summary: Shh!  This is my secret!!
review/text: I almost hesitate to give a review because this is my "secret ingredient" in so many things.<br /><br />My husband is from SLO and when we first met I thought it was so weird that the only thing he wanted from his mom for birthdays and holidays was Pepper Plant Sauce (I don't do spicy so I never tried it).  Then he got some of the seasoning.  Now I understand.  We use it in and on everything - eggs, steaks, popcorn (tip - put it in the butter!), chilli, black beans, soups, cooked vegies, tuna salad, guacamole, develed eggs (my fave).  Somehow almost every time I am "making up" some sort of savory recipe, this stuff makes it in there.  Just 2 weeks ago I had the idea to make dip with cream cheese, sour cream, the sauce and some seasoning.  It was a total hit at the play off party.  I just made it again today for our pre-superbowl potluck at work and got rave reviews again.  Heck - while typing this up I had the thought that the seasoning would make an awsome variation to garlic bread or crostini. Mmm - I might have to try that tonight.  You have to promise not to tell anyone though!

review/summary: Awesome seasoning!
review/text: My buddy turned me on to this stuff during a visit out to Monterey, California. I purchased some there locally and brought it back from vacation with me...and now I use this seasoning on everything. It has an excellent flavor, without too much heat. I use it on meat, vegetables, pasta...you name it. Highly recommended!

review/summary: not painfully hot, very tasty
review/text: I've liked the hot sauces from The Pepper Plant for a while, so I thought I'd give the seasoning a try.  It's not the hottest seasoning, and I think that's a plus with this stuff -- this seasoning is more of the smokey-salty-spicey pepper variety, and it's a good combination.  I haven't tried it on popcorn like another reviewer (it sounds like a good idea!), but so far it's good on meat, mashed potatoes, even mac & cheese -- anything you want to add a bit of flavor to, plus a little kick.

review/text: Taylor's Market Rules!!!  This product surprised me, even though I've been using Pepper Plant sauces for over 20 years.

review/summary: My favorite Jelly Belly flavor
review/text: I have been a huge fan of Jelly Bellys since I was a kid, which was about 25 years ago.  I have always had a favorite.  At first it was peach, then banana.  Juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years.  I thought nothing would top it, ever.  Then I tried red apple.  It is sweet and tart and really delicious, my new favorite flavor.  A ten pound box is surprisingly tempting and I am sorry they are currently all sold out.

review/summary: A Surprising Blend of Bean and Apple
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect from this Jelly Belly flavor. I have eaten "red apples" before but they were usually in a fruit. This was a candied bean with "red apple" flavors put inside. Despite the obvious witchcrafts, I tried this confection because I am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the RELIGIOUS RIGHT (WRONG). I was surprised to find that this "red apple" had a delicious apple-like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak. Would I eat more of these? Yes, I would. I would also recommend this "red apple" to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process. RED APPLE JELLY BEANS, THEY DO TASTE LIKE APPLES KIND OF BUT NOT COMPLETELY. STILL PRETTY GOOD.

It's so smooth and I never have to worry about a chalky, nasty taste because it's actually made from milk (not powder and water). I'm a big fan of the natural ingredients and can't imagine using anything else to get a great balance of carbs and protein. You can't go wrong with any of Core Power's drinks!

review/text: These muffins are great.  I've tried many gluten free foods and wasted so much money on things that tasted like cardboard.  I make these muffins  by substituting milk for the water and add 2 mashed bananas and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I've tried adding pineapple but didn't like it as much as my version of banana muffins.  My daughter's boyfriend loves these muffins and has no idea that they are made from rice flour.  Another great Namaste item to try is the Spice Cake.  Just add some grated carrots, pineapple, coconut, walnuts and raisins and you've got a kick-butt Carrot Cake.  Thanks to Namaste for the wonderful products......I'm hooked!

Having 2 separate one's allows for me to keep things separate and make any last minute adjustments to my carry-on luggage in case my suitcase is over 50 lbs!  If all your toiletries (shampoos, body washes, lotions, etc.) are together with your makeup, you can't carry them on (liquids & gels over 2 oz).  It rolls up, but holds alot and has a nice, sturdy metal hanger hook so you can hang them on the back of the hotel bathroom doors.  These Hadaki cases are made with fabulous quality and I love them!

review/summary: Exactly what I needed
review/text: For some reason, the stores around me stopped having these.  I use this type of bag for a few things in my life: camping gear (sleeping bag, hammock/tent) is able to breathe without being all over the place, storage of down comforter during summer, etc.  Then I got the great idea of using them for my recycling.  What a change in life this has been.  For three years, we've had to take moldy cans to the recycle center to redeem all our beer cans for the 5� apiece.  The little sips of beer in each can accumulate, and get trapped in a plastic bag, so I took my recycle cans and drilled holes in the bottom for drainage, then I line them with these bad boys.  The beer leaks right out, and when they're full, they're dry and while they smell slightly of stale beer, the change to that from stale wet beer and mold is incredible.<br /><br />Would I trust them for laundry?  Probably not if I had to carry it any distance.  They're mesh bags.  Going up or down stair or across the house is probably not a big deal.  Since I don't have machines, I wait until the last possible minute to do my laundry, so these bags would be totally and utterly full, stretching the mesh past its abilities, and would probably rip on the first or second go.  If you're smarter than me, though, and do your laundry in a reasonable amount of time, or don't have to leave your house/complex to do it, they'd probably be fine.

I needed a really tough one like the KBR guys try to sell us for $8 here in Afghanistan...2 of these bags are already in the trash after only 2 uses each.  They wash the laundry in the bag and both have ripped after only 2 uses.  I gave them a 3 b/c they are not that bad..just not what I was needing.  The seller was awesome!  I received the bags here in Afghanistan after only 6 days from the original order date so I have to say the seller was very expedient.

review/text: This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The "hot chocolate" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if you're expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere.

review/summary: Luck O' the Irish Hot Chocolate Mix
review/text: Good thing I got this from the bargain bin or I would really be perturbed. Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the "cauldron" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of "hot chocolate" per container if you like the "flavor" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand.

review/text: This is a good tasting cereal, probably on the sweet side (the second ingredient is sugar). For taste alone, I'd give it 5 stars but I am deducting a star from my overall rating for "unfortunate" ingredients like disodium phosphate, caramel color, yellow 6, BHT, yellow 5, red 40, and blue 1. I don't understand the need for all the "junk" ingredients and all the coloring.<br /><br />As for delivery, my cereal arrived fine. There were no problems with shipping, delivery, or packaging. I received it on May 8, 2012 and the "Best Before" date was March 21, 2013.<br /><br />For a healthier cereal, I like "Kashi Organic Cereal, Cinnamon Harvest" which is made from a small number of ingredients without all the questionable stuff. It's also not as sweet. I give that one 5 stars because it also tastes great (even though it's not as sweet) but the ingredients are healthier than Life.

review/summary: Use too many chemicals (colors, preservatives) - not healthy
review/text: While taste is OK it's simply using too many artificial colors (blue1, red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6 - approved by FDA doesn't mean it's healthy) and other chemicals (BHT etc) to be used by children.<br />If you're going to eat it yourself - take your chances. But since there are many good and healthy alternatives - why bother?

review/summary: Great snack for kids/toddlers
review/text: My 2-year old loves these cheerio-like banana flavored snacks. He prefers them to Cheerios. He has also tried the Blueberry flavored version of these snacks, and highly dislikes them, but I think that's just because he isn't a huge fan of blueberries. These are a hit, though!

review/summary: One of my 15 month old's favorites...
review/text: I bought these in the grocery store one day to ward off an upcoming tantrum and my toddler went crazy for them.  He is a big fan of the puff-type snacks and cheerios, but these and the blueberry ones are his favorite and he will pick them out of the mix I make for him with all different types of puffs.  They are quite a bit harder than the Plum Organics puffs that he also likes, but he just sucks on them and they dissolve.  The container is great because it is small enough to fit in my diaper bag and it also fits well in the cup holder of my car.  Amazon's price is much better than if I buy them individually in the supermarket.

review/text: My daughter (9 months) absolutely loves these "snackin' fruit rings."  And I feel much better feeding these to her because they are Earth's Best.  I much prefer this to the other brands puffs.  They do not melt like the other ones, but my daughter is fine with them.  She gets a big smile on her face when she sees me take them out and is trying to open the container to get them.  A great snack, and a great distraction in a restaurant.  I just wish I could buy them in a smaller bulk amount.

We start buying it through amazon because Kroger's stop stocking Reese Cheesy Popcorn, so I hit the net in search of it. It is very tasty on popcorn better than any other power popcorn salt that's been tried by our family. I highly recommend Reese Cheesy Popcorn to all.

review/text: I agree this is not extremely cheesy, but that is what I like about it.  I have been using this for years and only one store near me carried it.  I have recently moved to Florida and can't find it anywhere.  I don't understand the reviews that says it is too salty.  I tried the very overrated Flavacol and found that to be way too salty.  I actually use more of this on my popcorn than I would think because it is not that salty.  It sticks to the popcorn better than salt and has a very good flavor, admittedly not overly cheesy.  Best popcorn seasoning I have ever tasted!

A couple of months ago when I needed to purchase more, I found out that the grocery store had discontinued the product.  I Googled it and found that it was available on Amazon.com.

review/text: If you like cheese seasoning on your popcorn, this product will not deliver.  It tastes like they should instead of putting anything cheese related on the label they should say, 'improved salt flavoring that will stick to popcorn more than salt'.  I would recommend anything by Kernal Season's brand... that tastes like cheese.  But if you like a salty tasting popcorn, this is the seasoning for you...

review/text: I love this popcorn seasoning and it was cheaper to order through Amazon than to buy thru the local grocery store that charges $2.58 a bottle and is usually out of the product for weeks at time.  My only disapointment was that one of the bottles was broken when it arrived. Usually items ordered from Amazon are well padded to prevent breakage but this time there were none of the little airbags that give that extra padding. Still, I would order the product again.

review/summary: Excellent quality
review/text: I asked my brother, who is a chef, how he felt about the quality of the product he received and if he could recommend it to anyone. His comments were that quality was excellent and he would enjoy having it again in the future as a gift. He looked at the idea of buying something similar from Hickory Farm in the Mall where he lives since Mother's Day caught him and me by surprise since it arrived a week early this year and he came to the conclusion that this product was far better product than anything he could find in the Mall. I had thought Hickory Farm would work since he would have physical access to viewing any items from them and his comment was that Wisconsinmade, this company whose product I am reviewing, did a far better job in quality and produce. I think that says it. For those who see only volume and not quality, stay with the grocery store, it will give you lots of volume if that is your criteria.  I will note that I bought a couple of these products from this company and I have copied the same review to each so that people will know that this company has excellent quality.  Quality cheese and quality sausage is expensive and this company makes it well.

review/summary: STALE!! Nonreturnable and bad ingredient surprise - FDA food safety rules?
review/text: It looks llike I just walked into a raw deal. The item is intolerably stale, and there is no recourse - I am simply stuck with it!<br />I love licorice, and have bought Gustaf's licorice on Amazon before, to much enjoyment. What I received here is a junky plastic bag unsuitable to preserve the product, containing product that clearly is too old and has not been kept under proper storage conditions.<br /><br />Add to that, labeling is generic, and apparently this item contains wheat in substantial quantities, not what I know from my brand name Gustaf's licorice packages.  Those disclaimers on the item descriptions regarding ingredients may differ are utterly pointless and plain not ok. How does that do anything other than cover the vendor's rear? Clearly, customers get no choice, and might wind up with expensive purchases of allergy triggers.<br /><br />Strike one - utterly stale<br />Strike two - not returnable<br />Strike three - no declaration of ingredients pre-purchase, only offensive legal CYA<br /><br />[Just about every packaged food or supplement I can purchase in a store falls under clear FDA guidelines for labeling, food safety (storage conditions, materials, expiration date) - those rules are growing on me!]<br /><br />I am a strong buyer, and I shall refrain from any such purchases moving forward. Not only is it too risky and pricey if duped with degraded product, it is also an inexcusable trap  - who wants to get stuck with waste and have their  money taken?!<br />Amazon is not what I'd remembered it to be!

review/summary: Good Hardcore Licorice!
review/text: I believe the world is divided into two groups: those that eat black licorice and those that don't.  I belong to the first group, which I also find to be superior.  (Just kidding, kind of).<br /><br />I'm always looking for black licorice and cannot get enough of it.  I find licorice from Europe to be superior to that found in the states.  Gustaf's licorice is made in the UK, specifically where, I don't know.  It comes in a huge and heavy 5 lb bag.  It contains a long list of ingredients, including BEEF GELATINE. Okay, that's gross.  It also has Desiccated Coconut, whatever that is.<br /><br />The licorice is not shiny like in the picture, but dull, like a tractor tire.  It smells good and has a nice pungent taste to it.  (The Beef Gelatin perhaps?) It's all stuck together but comes apart easily.  It's a bit soft for my liking, but hopefully it will harden up over time.  Despite the disgusting addition of beef gelatin to my licorice (I know gelatin is from hooves, but do you have to remind me?) I will eat this licorice.  I have uploaded a picture to show everyone how this mass of licorice really looks, just so you don't stock up for parties.<br /><br />Will I order it again?  Probably not.  I want a company to lie to me about where gelatin comes from.  Gustaf is just too honest for his own good.
