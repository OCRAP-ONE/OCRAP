review/summary: Beware the cornstarch!
review/text: I bought this product with high hopes that finally I could make some 'real' powdered sugar baking! We follow a low carbohydrate eating plan for health reasons.<br /><br />I didn't realize though that it's made with cornstarch. If you are watching your carbohydrate intake, this is not the product you are going to want to use in quantity.<br /><br />I would recommend buying the regular Ideal and running it through your food processor (or blender/coffee grinder) and using that as a powdered sugar sub. You won't get the thickening and glossy finish of the cornstarch-based product though.<br /><br />I use and love the regular Ideal, just did not find this product satisfying for our nutritional needs.

review/summary: GREAT FIND!!!
review/text: I was SO EXCITED to discover a way to decrease the sugar content in icing/frosting...I have a wholesome baking company and now feel a bit better about offering products I do with glaze or frosting - this isn't as low calorie as the regular or brown ideal, but still way lower (344 cals per cup vs. about 768 cals per cup of regular powdered sugar)...I would recommend half and half for icing - a different taste slightly than reg., but NOT bitter at all...Even at half and half you'd be at 550 cals per cup... if using a drizzle of glaze, could go with just this product...mixed it with milk, vanilla, and dark unsweetened cocoa powder - YUM!

review/summary: Disappointing results
review/text: Being diabetic, I had high hopes for the confectionery version of Ideal. I heard a radio show about the satisfactory results that could be achieved by baking with Ideal, and shortly after saw a television commercial suggesting that baked goods made with Ideal compared almost exactly to those baked with sugar.<br /><br />I had already tried Ideal in coffee and tea, and found that it was, for me, the most acceptable sugar substitute I had tried. It tastes very much like regular sugar, with the least perceptible aftertaste of any other sweetener I had tried. I hoped I had found a way to enjoy cookies and cakes again.<br /><br />Alas, no. Since Ideal does not carmelize like sugar, so even though I followed the package directions, cookies were dry and grainy instead of soft and chewy, and cakes were either too flat and dense or too floury to be called delicious.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of people will buy and try this product for baking, and perhaps the company which produces it will make some money off of it, but unless others' results from baking with Ideal differ substantially from mine, not too many will continue to buy it.

review/summary: Delicious, but nutritious?  Hmm
review/text: I believe that sugar alcohols, some varieties, are actually beneficial.  Xylitol is known for preventing cavities; dentists actually use it.  And, it's great for diabetics to keep their insulin levels in check.  But, I question this brand's use of sucralose. The whole reason to use sugar alcohols or stevia is to get away from chemical sweeteners.  If the Xylitol isn't sweet enough on it's own, the Ideal brand should consider using stevia as an added sweetener, not sucralose.

It doesn't leave that yucky aftertaste and a little goes a long way.  My customer's love it and are so surprised that it is sugar free and not made from sacharrin or anything bad for your health like that.

review/summary: Buttercream Frosting
review/text: I use Ideal Powdered Sugar in frosting to save on calories.  I also like the taste better than regular powdered sugar.  But the consistancy can be a bit runny so I usually use no fat cream cheese and a small amount of butter to make the frosting.  It is very good and I think might be more healthy with the fat free cream cheese instead of a lot of butter.

Through the years I have found that Taylors of Harrogate has consistent quality to their product line. This decaf Breakfast tea is not as rich and strong as their decaf Scottish tea, but that product is not easy to find. For decaf teas I recommend the Scottish first, then the Breakfast second.

review/summary: Excellent Decaffeinated Tea
review/text: Most decaffeinated teas taste flat and weak to me. Taylors tea is an exception. It tastes almost as good as a cup of high quality caffeinated tea. So far I have never found another decaffeinated tea as good as Taylors Decaffeinated Breakfast Tea. Most of the Taylors teas are very good. For some reason, I think the tagless bags make better tea than the bags that have tags. Also, Taylors produces at least two sizes of bags and the larger bags seem to make better tea. Maybe that's simply because the tea made from larger bags is stronger, given that I do not vary the size of my cup.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I've tried a number of decaf teas (6 at last count, I think) and this is my favorite.  It's got body and depth of flavor with subtle hints of souchong, yet soft without the acidic taste some teas have.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I've been purchasing loose tea from the local shops, but they never carried any breakfast varieties. So I began checking out decaf teas while browsing Amazon.com, and came across this fabulous breakfast tea! Even as writing this review, I'm enjoying a steaming cup of T of H's breakfast tea(with milk and sugar). As someone mentioned in this forum, it really does stand up to milk and sugsr!. I wish T of H had the decaf Irish and Scottish breakfast teas; I would be first in line to buy a case each! Thanks, T of H!!!!

review/summary: Bland!!!
review/text: I hate to disagree with most of the other reviews, but this tea tastes flat, bland and a bit bitter.  I've searched for a decent decaf tea and finely found three, two here on Amazon, and for less money than the Taylors.  Bigelow Organic Breakfast Blend is the best.  It has a rich, deep, aromatic flavor and goes well with a bit of sugar and milk or just plain.  Higgins and Burke decaffinated Orange Pekoe is lighter in flavor than the Bigelow, but still offers deep amber richness.  The third isn't sold on Amazon, but hopefully they'll add it as they carry the Peet's brand coffee.  Peet's decaffinated English Breakfast loose tea is decent, too.<br />I use the Bigelow for single cup enjoyment and the Higgins and Burke for making ice tea.

review/summary: Dark cup of tea missing aromatic oils
review/text: This decaf tea will make a dark cup of tea. However much of the aromatic oils that are part of the experience of drinking tea are missing.<br /><br />The packaging of this product may have something to do with this - each bunch of 50 tea bags is placed into a cardboard box which is wrapped in a thin sheet of plastic. 6 of these wrapped boxes are then placed into a holder which is then also wrapped in plastic wrap. Given the thin plastic used the aromatic oils are lost pretty soon after manufacture.<br /><br />Other manufactures individually wrap their tea bags in individual foil lined pouches. Others use heaver plastic to hold the oils in.<br /><br />If you are fussy about tea I'd pass. T**d*r J**s has better decaf tea than this.

review/summary: Best dog food we've found
review/text: With 5 dogs of various breeds, ages, and sizes, it's difficult to find a quality food that meets everydoggy's tastes. With NRG Maxim Buffalo, we have found it! Plates of this food are quickly licked clean!<br /><br />We've tried other dehydrated/raws. HK smells very herby, and no one seemed to like it. Lucy's is apparently tasty, but its appearance will tell you it's mostly dried mashed potato. The ingredients in NRG are recognizably buffalo and veggies. There's a pleasant, fresh aroma upon adding water.<br /><br />For maximum convenience, I immediately portion out the box of food into smaller plastic containers. I suppose they could stay out, but I stack most of the containers in my freezer. I add COLD water to a container and put it in the fridge overnight. Next morning, it's reconstituted and ready to serve after warming up.<br /><br />Pricy? Maybe. But keep in mind that 10 pounds of dehydrated turns into much more after adding water. And the quality of this food is worth the price. I strongly believe that eating should be one of the pleasures of a dog's life. What made us think that it's okay to relegate a dog to a lifetime of eating only dry kibble? Give your canine buddy a plate of this...you'll see how much he enjoys it, and you won't want to go back to kibble!

review/summary: Convenient Way to Enjoy Chicory Beverage
review/text: I gave up coffee about a year ago--not because of the caffeine (I still drink tea), but because of the acid which was playing havoc on my stomach.  I lived in New Orleans for a couple of years and remember that most of the coffee served there had chicory root mixed in.  You can buy ground chicory root from one of the coffee distributors.  What I discovered is that I like the chicory taste better than coffee!  I don't use milk or cream in my tea because I've heard it cancels out the health benefits of the tea, so I was looking for something I liked well enough to forgo the milk.  Chicory beverage tastes great with milk, but I like it well enough without.  I was really happy to find this instant version on Amazon--it's quick and you don't have to pull out the teapots and strainers.  And it actually tastes fresher than another imported brand I tried not long ago.  If you like the taste of chicory, this product is for you.

review/summary: High-Quality Complex Black Tea, Not to Be Missed
review/text: *****<br />I really enjoy Numi's Berry Black Fruitea Darjeeling Black Tea, because unlike most berry teas, I taste the black tea and the Darjeeling far more intensely than the berries...the berries are more like overtones and definitely not overwhelming, creating what I think is a more adult berry black tea. The flavors of this tea are thankfully complex.<br /><br />Berry Black is certified organic and contains fair trade certified organic Darjeeling black tea, organic hibiscus, organic freeze-dried strawberries, organic freeze-dried raspberries, organic rosehips, and organic raspberry leaf. There are no oils or natural flavorings used, unlike many berry teas. It is also kosher. This tea is sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable, the carton is made of 100% post-consumer waste, and cello wrap is not used. Numi says that all their tea bags "are made of natural fiber paper, not the trendy, "silky" see-though nylon tea bags". The reason it is called "full leaf" is that Numi black teas do not contain tea dust or fannings, which tend to make tea taste bitter; instead, they contain the full leaf, expanding when they are brewed, "releasing a robust and long lasting experience".<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Extraordinary and the first of its kind, Numi's organic Berry Black features real North American forest fruits, not artificial or natural flavorings, to create an authentic berry taste. Our luscious strawberries and raspberries are freeze-dried at the peak of ripeness to retain their true flavor. This sassy, organic tea is fresh, wild, and all natural, blending hibiscus, Vitamin C-loaded rosehips, and a touch of smooth organic Darjeeling. Grown in the high mountains of India, Numi's special Darjeeling adds a floral balance as it captures the depth of black tea. Discover the berried treasure in each cup - you'll be hooked!"<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love Darjeeling tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Best deodorant available
review/text: I've never used a better deodorant. If you have used Degree for Men Ultra Clear sticks before, this is the same thing (+ silver ion technology), so you know how good it is.<br /><br />Unlike Right Guard sticks of chalk, this is not chalky or dry and leaves absolutely zero stains on your clothes (I've had huge problems with Right Guard staining my shirts). It's a solid stick, so it goes on evenly, but it's clear, so you can't see it on your armpit, even immediately after putting it on (making it good for applying in public, as well).<br /><br />Degree has the best scents, most of them (including the "Arctic Edge" scent that I chose) having a "shower fresh" smell, like a bar of Irish Spring soap. It also feels cool (temperature-wise) to apply, but in a very pleasant way (not ticklishly cold like some gels are). Even when you haven't just taken a shower, it almost feels and smells like you have after you put this on.<br /><br />Another standard Degree feature is that the entire bottom centimeter of the package rotates to advance the stick (rather than just a small ring in the center), making it easier on the fingers (great for arthritis, I would imagine).<br /><br />There is no better deodorant for men, in my opinion. In fact, I can't see any reason why a woman wouldn't use it, either, other than the label and marketing. If there's any drawback, it's that this is just a deodorant and not an anti-perspirant. I, personally, have not had any problems, but, if you're extra prone to wet armpits, you may need an anti-perspirant, instead. For most people, though, I highly recommend these Degree deodorant sticks, even those that are very picky about their deodorants, as I am.

I have axillary hyperhydrosis, which in layman's terms means I sweat a lot under my arms specifically. I apply a special prescription-strength antiperspirant at night to seal my pores, and apply this in the morning to prevent any smell. With that combination I smell great all the time and never sweat a drop.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is NOT AN ANTIPERSPIRANT, which means it will not make you sweat any less than you do without anything on. This merely ensures that you do not smell when you sweat. If you sweat a lot, either look into an antiperspirant/deodorant combination or apply an antiperspirant (such as Drysol or CertainDri) that is intended to be put on at night, and put this deodorant on in the morning.

review/text: I've been using Old Spice High Endurance deodorant (non-antiperspirant) for a long time but recently decided to try this type of Degree because Old Spice wasn't lasting long enough. The first couple of days that I used this, it worked well and the scent was strong enough to last the whole day. By the third day, I developed a severe itching reaction in both armpits, which goes along exactly with what numerous other reviewers have already said.<br /><br />The only real difference in base ingredients between Degree and other non-aluminum deodorants on the shelf is that Degree has silver chloride and titanium dioxide in it. I guess that's where they get the "Silver Ion" term from but apparently it can be pretty irritating when applied to skin. Dove Men+Care and Axe deodorants, both made by Degree's parent company Unilever, do not contain these ingredients and don't seem to cause the same type of irritation.

I came here to buy a 6-pack just to stock up but reading these reviews I had a revelation. For YEARS while using this product I have suffered from an occasional underarm rash that I actually chocked up to chafing due to a LACK of the product on my body. Rash=chafing so I must need more degree applied! Obviously I misread the symptoms and see that I too have suffered a rash caused by this product and have so for years. I found that Arm&Hammer has a new Essentials product that is also aluminum free (as well as silver free) that not only smells better but lasts longer and causes no rash. My eyes have been opened and I have made the switch. :-)

They all work very well, infact this is my favorite deoderant now. I actually look forward to sweating sometimes because the scent is just so great. It works all day long and i've never had any problems what so ever with this product. I was used to solid white deoderant before this and these sticks are actually clear, which is a much more wet experience under your arm until it dries... But if you don't have a problem with that, then your pits are going to smell great!

review/text: Firstly, I must start by saying that I'm a woman. I'm pretty active and live in the South, where the heat is absolutely abysmal. Women's deoderants really don't work very well, and don't always keep me from smelling the majority of the time; I'll end up smelling like a mixture of must/sweat/and flowers/powder etc. So, I decided to swipe up a men's line and see how it worked.<br /><br />This deodorant is very sticky, and it dries under your armpit too quickly. What I mean by that, is that it completely dissolves away within two hours and ceases to give you anymore protection. I put it on in the morning at around 9 a.m., and by the time I walked to my classes from my dorm and all over campus, I smelled awful. As another lady poster said, it was like an oniony type smell. In between one of my classes I HAD to go wash my armpits for fear that everyone would smell me.<br /><br />I gave the deoderant two weeks, and it's still terrible and doesn't work well. Besides that, the armpits on my shirts that I wore when I used this product continue to smell terrible when any heat starts to develop under my pits. I can't even wear them anymore because this deodorant didn't do what it said it would! On to Dove Clinical Strength.

review/summary: Had a reaction to it--have never had one to any other product before...
review/text: I'm not normally a sensitive type but when I used Degree Arctic edge I felt like the itchy edge--it irritated my underarms, became itchy and and I had a mild rash that took a couple of days to clear up. While it has a nice aroma if I can't wear it because of a reaction, it doesn't do me any good.<br /><br />I would recommend trying a sample first on an area of exposed skin to see if you might have a reaction to this product before buying it or, if you already have purchased it but haven't put it on yet, use it on a less sensitive area to test it prior to applying it.<br /><br />I was surprised by the number of reviews echoing my experience so be cautious. If you don't have a reaction more power to you but it's better to be forearmed and forewarned when it comes to your underarms.

review/summary: This review is going to be embarrassing, but I need to write it
review/text: Okay, so I'm a FEMALE and I was out of deodarant, so I used my husbands this morning, which was this brand.  I was dressed beautifully today, took a fresh shower this morning and put on a brand new, beautiful blouse.<br /><br />Around 12:30 p.m., my co-workers were eating subs.  Im talking to a co-worker and I smell a whiff of onion, I assume it's the subs.<br /><br />IT WAS NOT THE SUBS...IT WAS ME!!  OMG, I WANTED TO DIE.<br /><br />I have never had a deodarant not work like this.  I work at a desk.  I went out for lunch today and I was sitting in the hot sun.  When I started to sweat, that's when it all went downhill.<br /><br />I was paranoid ALL DAY, I kept putting on lotions, etc. to try to mask the onion smell, I just couldn't believe it!  How horrible! I asked my husband does this work for him and he said NO, that it only works for a few hours and he has been meaning to buy deodarant with an antiperspirant.  That made me feel better!  (I didn't share the gross details that it did not work for me--I was too embarrassed).<br /><br />I read the product label and it says that athletes, etc. use this for protection...WHAT THE HELL???!!  This product failed me after 4 hours and I am a very clean female, who showers twice a day.  How awful.  I pray my co-workers assume it was onions on the subs and not me!  I never want to see this product again. How devastating.

review/summary: Sticky
review/text: I can't believe I've used this stick as long as I have. This gel stick, and gel deodorants in particular I've found, is sticky and takes a while to dry - especially for a guy like me with a decent amount of hair under my arms. It doesn't stain shirts, but I am particular about letting my deodorant dry before I put a shirt on so with it's stickiness and gel-type, I'm left shirtless for quite a while. Though it does smell nice initially, the pleasant smell turns to that smell you get after you've worn gel deodorant all day. It's not bad, but it's a distinct smell I seem to get with all gel deodorant I've tried, but not with the dry form. I'd recommend Mitchum deodorant instead of this type. The dry deodorant sticks aren't sticky and dry a lot faster. The Mitchum deodorants are also very good anti-perspirants. I don't sweat at all when using them and they last over 24 hours.

review/summary: Try it!
review/text: I was introduced to quinoa (pronounced keen-wah)while on a trip to Peru and Ecuador. It's a fantastic food, especially the red version which is my favorite. It is a perfect protein, which means it has all the amino acids. Quinoa has more fiber and grams of protein than any known grain/rice PLUS it is gluten free. Use it where you might use a starch or find unusual places to use quinoa. I cook up a batch on the weekend and store it in the frig. I then add cooked quinoa to my morning yogurt or to warmed applesauce to make a breakfast or lunch dish. I especially like cooked quinoa added to vegetable soup or any cream soup in order to increase the protein and fiber values of the soups. Try it, you'll like it!

review/summary: Quinoa
review/text: Quinoa is a staple in our household, it has tons of vitamins and minerals, a higher amount of protein then any other grain so it doesn't spike a blood sugar, gluten free, and comes naturally in "two flavors", white and red. i add white to my son's oatmeal and chicken dishes (white has a milder taste), and red quinoa goes better with red meats and tomato/avocado dishes. Although the difference is not significant, it is nice to have a variety.<br />I like Alter Eco brand because it is a fair trade.<br />I highly recommend it to everyone! I'd give it ten stars if i could.

review/summary: Best, cleanest quinoa I've purchased
review/text: Quinoa has become a staple of my diet, and I've been looking for a reliable brand. The taste is great, but more notable is that this has been the cleanest quinoa I've encountered so far. Most people, myself included, prefer to have the bitter surface compounds washed away. The biggest issue for me is that while most brands claim to be washed, this is often simply not true. Subject them to any kind of rinsing, and the water will foam right up (the bitter compounds are surfactants, and will create a foam like soap). Upon washing this quinoa, I got almost nothing! A little fiber was washed away, but nothing more. It's entirely possible to just throw this quinoa in a rice cooker without worrying too much about washing it. For being both cheaper and less time intensive than other brands, I'll be sticking with this one for the foreseeable future.

review/summary: I love this Quinoa. Cooks up well in a rice cooker.
review/text: This has quickly become a staple in our home! It has a pleasant nutty taste that is nice plain or seasoned and works well with a lot of other foods. It doesn't need to be rinsed and cooks up easily in the rice cooker.<br /><br />I love that I can get it started with one hand in less than a minute with a baby on my hip! One time when I made it, I measured out the whole package with my rice cooker cup (3.5 rice cooker cups) and added twice as much water (7 rice cooker cups). I took note of the water level in the rice cooker bowl (right at my "Sweet 6" line). So now I can just dump the pouch in the bowl, fill with water up to the Sweet 6 line, set it to the brown rice setting, and start. That's it! My rice cooker brown rice setting takes 1 hr 45 minutes. I start it early in the day and the rice cooker keeps it warm until I'm ready for it. It always comes out light and fluffy. I have not tried it with the quick rice setting or on the stove-top, so I'm honestly not sure if there is any difference in taste or texture between the methods.<br /><br />I make an entire package once or twice a week. My family of 5 eats about 1/3 of it the first night and we finish it as leftovers over the next few days. One of my favorite ways to serve it is as quinoa salad, which I make with cold (leftover) quinoa, tomato, cucumber, maybe some onions, avocado and/or bell peppers, feta and some red wine vinaigrette. The texture of the quinoa goes well with the salad, and it soaks up the vinaigrette and takes on the taste. It is really a delight.<br /><br />The price with Subscribe & Save is great, especially considering that it is organic and fair trade, and doesn't need to be rinsed.

I highly recommend. I just cooked it today in some left over baked chicken juices with baby carrots and green beans. I love that you can just toss random things when you cook the quinoa and it changes the character of the dish. Other nights I add dried fruits and nuts.<br /><br />And the size is great. One package is probably right for 10 adults if it's a side to a main course.

review/summary: High Mountain Magic.  Food of the Gods
review/text: Even though I had been writing reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa).<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added Lavender Oil  4 oz.  EssOil and NOW Foods, Clove Oil  4 oz to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV7ZAI">McCormick Cloves, Ground, 16 Ounce Unit</a>, and lavender teaThe Tao Of Tea Herbal Tea Lavender, 100% Organic, 2.0 Ounce Tin (Pack of 3).  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, "nutrition" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of "yummy.").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to "gourmet it" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As "rice" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with "noodle heaven"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As "oatmeal" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, cream, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />-- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid (water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa (Note that some brands vary this ratio slightly; check their instructions on the product package).<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12 15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl (use a large one with lots of room above the grain and water to avoid the mess of boiling over) then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Depending on power levels and volume of food, a microwave sometimes cooks 4 times faster than "outside the waves" cooking.  As an example of time variance with larger amounts of food: 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8  16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (�) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate lid; zap it for another minute or half, then let it steep in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate lid I can just place it on the table for family style digging in.<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />Recently, Alter Eco Fair Trade, Arrowhead Mills, Berry Farm, Eden, Now Foods, and Angelina's have been added to my list of purveyors of Quinoa.<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm also very confident in ordering their Quinoa as well.<br /><br />The reviews on Quinoa Red were helpful. In addition to the most common golden grain, I've only seen black Quinoa, which is also appealing, and is reportedly the oldest variety. Well, actually all the reviews I've read on Quinoa have offered something of value to the info I've already gathered.<br /><br />*** Though I would happily purchase any of the available Quinoa offerings on Amazon, currently I'm favoring ALTER ECO FAIR TRADE for my personal use. The extra details of info on the Alter Eco Fair Trade buying pages were appreciated very much, and I feel that this product is very close to what the original seeds were intended to be.***<br /><br />(I used to sell Quinoa in my CITY CHEF kitchen store, which is no longer open; I spend all my time writing now, with a little cooking on the side.)<br /><br />Quinoa has an interesting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />-- The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varmints, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the "naked" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise old grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eon's younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000 foot elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of "health"?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had lived and evolved long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several KINDLE books and Amazon Shorts, including The Rose and the Pyramid

review/summary: Sad to see it go
review/text: This stuff was great. I was aware that quinoa is a superfood, full of protein, iron, vitamins and minerals, but it was cool to have a few copies of the specific nutritional information. The instructions say to use 2:1 water-quinoa ratio, but if you want to store it for later, I would recommend 1:1, so it has the texture of undercooked rice. One pound provides a day's recommended amount of protein, if quinoa is all you eat. Great for vegetarians and vegans, but there is still the concern of food-borne illness. I admit that I have a very strong immune system, but the individual, resealable packages definitely reduce the risk of getting sick. I ate all 8 pounds over the course of a couple months, and I never showed symptoms of poisoning from e. Coli and friends. Decent value, and coupled with some vigorous exercise, you will see improvements in your health.

review/summary: One word: bleh
review/text: I should have gone with my gut. Cotton candy frosting doesn't sound all that great. After one bite, I passed my piece of cake to my husband. He ate both his and mine, while grimacing, and said he will eat the rest. I guess it was for the sake of not wasting a whole cake. He never requested more after that night. I couldn't even look at the cake without getting nauseated. I made a plain, white box cake. At least, I know, cotton candy frosting doesn't go with white cake at all. And I can't imagine it being good with any kind of cake. I'm hesitant to try any of their other flavors - this was my first. I rarely write reviews, but I felt I had to. This nauseous frosting is not worth trying. It doesn't even taste like cotton candy, anyway.

review/summary: So bad I threw it away
review/text: My son wanted cotton candy cupcakes for his 8th birthday so I searched online and found this flavor mix.  It's horrible.  When I opened it to mix with the frosting starter base, the flavor mix smelled of chemicals.  I asked my 8 year old to taste it and he hated it.  I tasted it and threw it away.  It's got a really bad after-taste that I couldn't get out of my mouth.  I would not recommend this product, at least the cotton candy flavor, to anyone.  Yuck. P.S. I gave it one star because that's the least I could give it.

review/text: I love cotton candy and was excited to try this, but it doesn't tast anything like cotton candy.  It had a strong chemical smell with a taste that I really don't know how to describe.  I used it with funfetti cake mix and while the taste was fine, it wasn't anything like what I expected.

review/summary: FREAKING NASTY
review/text: I love cotton candy and I have used cotton candy flavoring before. So I saw this and decided to get it to frost some cupcakes I am making right now. However, after i poured the packet in the frosting base (with a cloud of it that poofed all over!) and mixed the frosting, before I even tasted it I knew it would be nasty. It smelled strongly of chemicals! And it tastes like some sugar substitute chlorine. Not even a bit like cotton candy, just SO GROSS. I am so mad I bought this, it was more money than normal frosting and is so disgusting.<br /><br />DO NOT GET COTTON CANDY.<br /><br />Also, I have heard some other flavors are gross too. I am not even going to try any others, this one was so bad that there is no possible way any other little packet would taste good.

review/summary: Cool and Refreshing
review/text: These are my favorite breath mints.  I keep a tin in my purse and a tin by my bed to sweeten my breath and cure dry mouth.  Since I was buying them so often I think it is great that I can purchase them in bulk on Amazon.  I have had the spearmint flavor, but peppermint is still the best in my opinion.  Some mints are so strong that they taste bitter or they are so weak that they do absolutely nothing to freshen bad breath.  These 3 Hour Breath Savers are neither too powerful nor too wimpy.  If you like a substantial mint that works give these a try.

review/summary: Breathsavers
review/text: I love Breathsavers Peppermint, not too bitterly strong and not overpoweringly sweet. My job involves talking a lot, and sometimes, it's inconvenient to be swilling down water every five minutes, and these mints do an excellent job.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars was that about 1/4 of the mints in each of the tins are crushed which is inconvenient.

review/summary: Delicious and Healthy Food!
review/text: I have enjoyed much of Pure Alaska's product line, and I was going to try their no salt added Thinkpink when I saw this review, and I must respond! This customer must not be familiar with canned salmon, because the bones and skin, unless it is the fillet, is the standard for canned Alaska salmon. The Pure Alaska brand has just the right amounts of each, not too little nor too much. If one reads about the health benefits of the bones and skin, one knows that these are among the reasons to eat it.  Our family has eaten canned salmon for generations, and we fight over who gets to eat those wonderful little edible bones while the omega -3 rich skin just mixes into the recipe and is such an important part of the salmon, from a health perspective. Those bones and skin are very nutritious--don't throw them out!<br /><br />All of the salmon I have purchased from Pure Alaska is delicious and is of the highest quality. It is also important to us that Pure Alaska Salmon Company is owned by a functioning Alaska fishing family, not just some distribution company--so they put out the best product possible. This is a great food..I love the fact that it is a safer food to eat than other mercury-laden fish such as tuna. It's also more versatile - ever hear of "tuna pate?" This salmon also makes a marvelous pate to serve guests!<br />>

review/summary: Fish spine, but good
review/text: It's ground up salmon bones and skin with bits of salmon still attached.  The cans we got have full pieces of fish spine.  Had to be a mistake, but no the *inside* of the can label says this is all very tasty bones and skin.  It looks like they are grinding up fish remnants after they are done steaking the fat parts of the salmon.  I'll never buy this stuff again.  Didn't even feed it to the cat.  Beware, it's marketed under different labels from the same company.

review/summary: Horrible cup of coffee
review/text: Bought this to use in my classroom - first time I tried it, I used the usual amount of water I would normally use to the usual amount of coffee.  I ended up with a semi-dark colored cup of water with a bit of a coffee taste.  It was absolutely not worth the $6 I spent on it at Publix.  Hate the thing.  I now just use the coffee cup itself as an extra - even that was chipped when I took it out of the box.  :-/

review/summary: Just Blah
review/text: I purchased this product to use in my breadmaker, and my machine produced a fine looking small loaf. The directions on the Cranberry Crunch Bread package were simple to follow. The basic question is "where is the crunch and where is the flavor"?<br />There were a few cranberries scattered throughout,no nuts visible to the naked eye and a taste that was comparable to standard white bread. Not a hint of sweetness to be found.<br />To be fair, the package did say that you could add some honey to the mix during preparation, and I did not, as it was optional. I thought it might make it too sweet. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Just not worth the price.
