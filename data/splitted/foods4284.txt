review/summary: Fantastic sencha !
review/text: Overall my favorite tea to drink most everyday.  I first had this at a small pizza restaurant in Princeton and loved it! I could not locate it any market but was lucky to find it at Amazon and have been buying it here regularly ever since.  I would recommend using it for a 2 to 4 cup pot though, as for a single cup, it could be a bit strong.

review/summary: UMF 10+
review/text: I used to buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKWXA4">Active Umf 10+ Manuka Honey, 500-Gram Jar</a> because my research showed that Comvita is a legitimate producer of manuka honey in New Zealand.  That Comvita manuka product isn't available through Amazon's subscription anymore, so now I subscribe for this manuka honey.<br /><br />From what I read, if you are looking to buy manuka honey, you should look for the label "UMF" because that shows the New Zealand's certification of antibiotic property from the manuka honey.  I believe UMF 10 is the minimum, and that's what I look for because I buy manuka honey for its special antibiotic property; otherwise, I guess I wouldn't buy manuka honey because it is so expensive.<br /><br />I would give this product 5 stars if I knew for sure that it is from a good company selling manuka honey from New Zealand or Australia.  The label on this product has all the keywords I'm looking for, and that's all I have to go by for now.

review/summary: I wish I had found this earlier
review/text: I discovered Beet Juice when I went to Whole Foods in search of a natural source of Iron. I was eight months pregnant at the time and anemic and I have a terrible time taking synthetic iron without throwing up. Anyway, I went in looking for something and the clerk told me this was the best source. I took her word for it and took these home, and I'm glad I did. These are awesome! Within a few days of taking this I felt remarkably better. I did a bit of reading about the benefits of beet juice, and there's not much it isn't good for. Its really considered a super food its so potent as an antioxident. It is also remarkable for vein support, regulating blood sugar and blood pressure. It is also good for replacing blood after surgery and it is a powerful anticancer food. It also is really high in fiber so it counteracts the usual problem associated with taking iron--constipation. The great thing about taking the supplement is there is no way you can eat enough beets to get all these benefits, so supplementing is the way to go!! I took these on a empty stomach before bed and it never bothered my stomach. Don't hesitate to try these. In the capsule form these are easy to swallow and much cheaper than synthetic iron pills. I'm still taking them because of all the health benefits they offer.

review/text: If you like smoked sea salts this is a very good product.  The smoke flavor is mild and the taste is great.  I put this salt in a grinder and find that the crystals are a bit small so it comes out fast.  I may switch to a small jar and salt spoon or a large holed shaker.  The 12.4 oz jar is enough to go a long way as seasoning salt.

review/summary: Interesting flavor combo/ Tasty yet Pricey
review/text: OK - I love this mix, except the honey mustard pretzels. While I love HM pretzels on their own, just not in this mix, flavors don't go together that well,  in my opinion. Everything else in it does & was fresh & tasty. Little pricey but overall good. Probably wouldnt order again, as there are comparable mixes less expensive. Glad I tried though, I would have never known if I didn't try them once.<br /><br />FYI the honey roast peanuts are more of a crunchy coating & super delicious. Whale crackers like cheddar goldfish crackers, corn chips nothing special, think they have flax seed in them, the chili lemon sticks good, not a lot of flavor or heat, probably because they're really small. Honey roast sesame sticks very tasty.

When I put this in his wet food dish, he looked at me in a confused way, then proceeded to snarf it down.  It's not as pungent as one of the other reviews led me to think it might be, but perhaps the stink of his wet food has my olfactory standards warped.

review/summary: A Really Great K-Cup for a Dark Roast
review/text: I really like (not love) this k-cup, but only due to preference of medium roasts over dark roasts.  I really like having some of this blend on hand for variety when I want a dark roast with very strong flavor.  Within the Barista Prima line, I absolutely love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLILAW">Barista Prima House Blend</a>, and love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLIL6Q">Barista Prima Colombia</a> which are more medium or medium-dark.  But for a complex, well blended dark roast, this is excellent.<br /><br />I agree with their text that states a more complex flavor.  The claim is that this is a premium line for those who expect a premium coffee more like a coffee shop.  I tend to agree, except you just don't get as much per cup.  The italian blend is a stronger flavor, but not quite as burnt as a very dark french roast can be (not having tried the Barista Prima French Roast yet but comparing to french roasts in general).  To me, no specific note stands out other than a strong coffee or maybe being a little more bitter.<br /><br />What is nice about K-cups is you can easy switch blends per cup or over time without having to exhaust a whole bag of beans or grounds before moving on.  And preferences change as you have the same day in and day out.  I certainly don't like to have dark blends constantly (but many do).  But what I can say is that when I do, I think this one is great.  I prefer variety and usually have House Blend in the morning, and a Colombia blend in the afternoon.  On more rare occasions, I'll have this roast when I feel like a dark roast with very strong flavor.  I prefer this over another somewhat similar <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004772PJG">Green Mountain Espresso Blend</a> which is more bitter and seems to hurt my stomach occasionally however quite good.<br /><br />The Barista Prima tends to be more expensive, and depending on the sale price, can be only a little more expensive than other varieties.  For a little bit more, it is worth it to me.  For a lot more, maybe not.  Paying about 12% more yields about 30% more in value in flavor to me.  But paying 50% more is costly when there other flavors are plenty good too.

review/text: As frequent K-cup users, our household coffee mavens, if reluctantly, really like this roast--"Barista Italian." It can be almost twice the price per cup as the usual range of offerings.

review/text: I've eaten sour as well as sweet tamarinds, and have drunk juice made from diluted tamarind syrup all my life, so can I tell you that this tastes nothing at all like the fruit.<br /><br />If tamarinds were used to make this product, they were sadly wasted, as any hint of them is well hidden under the overpowering perfume of rose water. So, if you like the flavor of rose water, you might still like this product, though you could save yourself some money by simply buying rose water essence, diluting it in water, and adding your favorite sweetener.<br /><br />However, if the enjoyment of tamarind in liquid form is your goal, you'd be much better off considering products from Thailand, the Caribbean, or Mexico when shopping for syrup.

The chocolate chip cookies were tasty as was the bread.<br /><br />Pro's;<br />Easy to store (no need to have 15 different bags of flours and starches in the cabinet)<br />Tasty results<br />Even gluten eating people thought the rolls were tasty<br />Good price<br />NO ADDED SUGAR!<br /><br />Con's;<br />First ingredient is white rice flour and the LAST ingredient is Almond flour<br />Has potato starch which tends to hurt my stomach<br /><br />I probably won't use this very often as I do have other choices but this definitely will be my go to flour mix when I don't want to measure out 9 different kinds of flours OR when I'm making rolls for special occasions (because they seriously were amazing!)  I think if you are cooking for celiac kids (or someone has just gone gluten free) then this mix is a MUST have.<br /><br />Edited 12.21.10 After almost a month of using this flour I have to admit it's my go to flour.  If a recipe calls for 3 cups of flour I only use 2 1/2 and add 1/2 a cup of teff flour for a little more nutrition.  I love that I don't have a million canisters of every type of flour known to man sitting in my cupboard/fridge and that I've had nothing but sucess with everything I've made using this flour blend.  Another perk it's cheaper than another amazing bread mix I was using and doesn't have sorghum flour or lots of sugar added!  I'm almost embarassed to add that I went through BOTH smaller bags in record time so I just ordered 4 of the 4lb bags!

This product actually has more than double the carbs that regular flour does (because its mainly a mix of rice and potato flour).  I did try it and it tastes ok and works like regular flour, but if you want to lower your carbohydrates then this is not the product to buy.

With the addition of Guar Gum or Xanthan Gum, this flour can easily replace regular wheat flour in most of your recipes....and Gluten Free Mama has a wonderful assortment of recipes on her site to use for free, if you don't want to buy her cookbook right off the bat. This is not a Almond Flour as you might see in healthfood stores, but rather a nice blend of GF flours with Almond flour added for enhancement of flavor and protein. It's a blend of just the right ratio of flours.<br />I dreaded going gluten free after watching my mom be disappointed for years - little did I know this amazing flour would be on the market now and be able to help us both in our daily diets.<br />Thank you Gluten Free Mama!

review/text: This is not almond flour, obviously it says blend. But read the ingredients on the bag - it contains A LOT of flours that aren't good for you. Find real almond flour that is ONLY almond. Much better for you. I wish I could return this and didn't order it at all.  I don't even think they can legally call it almond since it barely contains almond at all. Its mostly RICE.

review/summary: Gummy, can't be used with just any GF recipe
review/text: I have gone through 5 lbs of this flour, trying everything possible to change the consistency that it comes out as...with NO luck.  I do not have her cookbook, and I think in order to use this flour you have to use her recipes.  Every time I use this flour the consistency is gummy, sticky like a very glutinous rice flour.  Muffins, scones, pancakes, all came out with a very dense and chewy center.  It even has a transparant type of look to the center of baked goods.  I have tried to use this flour to thicken broths and the four just balls up into little gummy things (Bob's Red Mill works a LOT better).  I would not recommend this flour to anyone.

review/summary: Good Substitute for Traditional White Flour
review/text: Mama's Almond Blend had become my go-to gluten-free flour blend.  With help from Mama, I have created fluffy pancakes, delicious sweet breads, crepes and cookies.  When used with the proper amount of xanthan gum (to bind the ingredients together), this blend creates baked goods that are more than equal in taste and texture to their more popular cousin, bleached white wheat flour.  The reason for the four-star rating is that nutritionally, this flour has very little value.  When creating a purposefully nutritious baked good, I use my own sprouted brown rice/sorghum/millet flour blend.  Otherwise, this is a perfect product for the gluten-free set!

In the past, I would avoid baking, etc, because I couldn't get past the beany aftertaste or graininess of other gluten free flour blends.  This year, I have used this GF blend to substitute for wheat-based flours in all of my family cookie recipes with perfect success.  We had a cookie-baking party and no one even noticed that the three types of cookies that I baked were GF!<br />I have also used this flour for dredging meat before frying- turned out perfectly, not soggy or with an odd taste!  Soooooo happy that we found Mama's Almond Blend!

review/text: This is by far the best Gluten Free Flour I have used in the three years I have been gluten free. Gluten Free Mama's Almond Flour Blend really can be used cup for cup in your recipes. I do recommend using xanthan gum along with it or any other gluten free flour blend. The amount needed for the recipes is on the packaging for the xanthan gum. So far with this flour I have made zucchini bread, chocolate cake, blueberry muffins(recipe on the packing for the flour) frosting, sandwich bread, pancakes and to thicken up some other odds and ends. I highly recommend this flour to anyone who is gluten free.

review/summary: GF Mama Almond Blend is the best you can buy
review/text: I have been using this blend for over a year now and am finally creating baked goods of the same outstanding taste and texture that I was before I discovered my gluten allergy.<br /><br />This particular blend has a nice, "wheat" taste and texture.  Her coconut flour is excellent, too, with just a touch of sweetness and slight hint of coconut.  It does have a slight chalkiness, though.  If you're baking GF breads, biscuits, or other savory items, or simply looking for a perfect flour to use when converting your wheat recipes, this is the one I'd recommend.  I haven't had any trouble at all using my own recipes and converting them, though with gf cooking, it's nice to know a few of the tricks because gf baked goods take a few extra steps.I've tried every flour on the market and this is by far the best.<br /><br />As a note to people who are looking for something ready-to-use, GF Mama does not include xanthan gum (the binder that takes the place of gluten) in her flours, because different consistencies require different amounts of binding.  :)

By the second day of being on this food his gastrointestinal issues were gone. My cats love the food. I am sold on Earthborn! I also like that it comes from my home state of Indiana. It should be noted that if you save and send in UPC seals from the food bag, then they will plant a tree for the environment. This food gets 5 well deserved stars!!!!!

review/text: Just so you get a sense of my cats tastes -<br />Foods he does not like include: Blue Buffalo Longevity dry cat food, Friskies canned food, anything chicken flavored, anything beef flavored, science diet canned food for kittens.<br />Foods he loves: Science Diet dry cat food, Spot's stew - salmon, BFF - any seafood flavor, Oceanfish canned food from Trader Joe's, Fancy Feast appetizers.<br /><br />So if your cat has tastes similar to ours, odds are this one might be a hit with her/him.<br /><br />My only issue with this food is that is has ash in it. Why?<br />Isn't Blue Buffalo supposed to be all natural?<br />Seeing Ash as one of the ingredients always unsettles me.<br /><br />However, our vet said we need to start giving our 7 month old kitten canned food to increase his water intake. He is quite the fussbudget who instantly tried to bury food he doesn't like, so I am very grateful to find a product that is all natural (expect for the ash).<br /><br />I just compared prices with Amazon and my local Petsmart, seems like you can save approx. 2 bucks if you buy this off amazon.<br /><br />You might want to buy just one can from a petstore first though - to make sure your pet likes it.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/text: We have 2 Bengals, male littermates, about 14 months old. They have been very finicky eaters so far so we were somewhat stuck with what the breeder had fed them. We decided to try some of the healthier canned foods for them to no avail until this brand was tried. They can't get enough of this salmon. They even like the Blue tuna too, though they have not liked much else. But actually I can put some of this salmon on top of other Blue food (like the seafood stew) and then they seem to like that well enough. I read an article about cat food preferences which stated that salmon is a favorite of cats and this is certainly true in the case of our boys. I am really happy I found this food for our cats.

review/summary: Mixed Review
review/text: As the title indicates -- I have a mixed experience with this cat food.  On the plus side, it doesn't smell to high heaven, and, when the cats actually eat it,  their tummies don't go into reverse and urp it up.  But -- this is the one canned cat food my street cat from Tajikistan doesn't like, and will pick at it only after he gives up on screeching for something else.  My other cat was also a rescue, and he normally treats every mouthful of food as if it might be his last.  Even he walks away from this with half of it uneaten. I was frankly amazed -- these two cats really will eat anything, or so I thought.  It's certainly a high quality cat food -- and maybe the lack of a strong odor has something to do with their disdain.  Conversely, they both inhale any flavor of the Tiki Cat food.

review/summary: A potentially healthier alternative to Soda
review/text: I discovered this at Whole Foods a few years ago and have since been a fan. The flavor is closer to Fanta or another classic Orange soda vs a energy drink like Redbull (which, IMO, is undrinkable without Vodka). It is made from organic ingredients and the quantity of caffeine is not insignificant. I've tried other flavors, though they don't work for me as well as the Orange. If you haven't tried it, I'd recommend ordering from here or picking up a pack from the nearest Whole Foods.<br /><br />One of the reviewers pointed out the tea like taste. I ordered a 24pk from Amazon in Nov 2009, which had a distinctly  tea-like flavor. I believe this was an experimental batch, because the flavor since has been reverted to orange soda flavor.

Of all the flavored cookie inserts I have tried, there has never been one that he doesn't like.  I usually put one flavor in one side of the Everlasting Treat Ball and another flavor in the opposite end.  These treats are hard and durable, allowing the dog to scrape off small portions of the cookie at a time.  It usually takes my dog a week of constant, daily chewing just to get through one cookie insert.  These cookies are the BEST!

review/summary: Depending on your dog they may last forever or for a few minutes
review/text: I have a yellow lab that destroyed the kitchen furniture when he was teething, but he is 3 years old now, and he prefers shoes. He doesn't chew on furniture anymore, but good size rawhide bones only last an hour on his paws, which is longer than these treats but not so healthy for him. He found that instead of trying to chew these hard treats out of the rubber ball, he can get them out rather easily by dropping the ball to the kitchen floor, over and over again, until they come out. Once the treats are loose (5-10 minutes later) they break easily in his powerful jaws. Note: The treats don't come out so easily when he drops the ball on the carpet, but he knows that.<br />The treats keep him entertained for half an hour, maybe longer using one treat on each side of the ball. Not perfect, but I haven't found anything better. I would have given it 5 stars if the ball had a tighter grip to hold the treats for a little longer. My dog loves the taste, and seem healthier than rawhide, but I haven't really found anything edible he doesn't like.

review/text: These treats are good fun for my dog for about 30 min.  He loves them but it takes about 30 seconds for him to remove the treat from the holder and maybe 15 to 30 minutes to eat the treat.  They are good, I just wish they lasted longer.

review/summary: Dog Loves These!
review/text: I bought the initial treat ball at my vet's office, and after it kept my golden busy for a LONNNNNG time I knew I had to find the refills cheaper than they sell them! She LOVES them - when she sees me get it out of the package she follows me nosing my hand trying to sneak it out of my hand. She works at them for awhile, and pops them out of the treat ball, but they still keep her busy. Would be excellant for dogs in crates.<br />:)

review/summary: My Experience  With This Treat
review/text: After reading some of these reviews, I thought I'd comment on how I use this. I have a smallish (about 22 lbs) mixed breed dog who is a strong chewer. I started using a medium sized treat ball and everlasting treats when he was about 10 months old, right after I rescued him. I use this only with the treat ball -- I would never give him a whole treat and let him eat it in one session.  I put some kibble or some small treats in the ball, with the everlasting treat only on one side.  The kibble comes out fairly easily, but slowly enough so he still has to work for it and so he still has fun. The treats are a little larger and don't come out so easily. He's learned that chewing on the treat, pressing down on the ball, enable the treats to dispense. Once the kibble or treats are gone, he chews and licks the everlasting treat. Eventually, after several weeks, he manages to consume enough so there is a hold in the center of the treat, and at that point I usually take the everlasting treat out, break it in half, and let him have it, one half at a time.<br /><br />It used to be that he would chew and lick the treat until he got bored, but he has now learned how to get the treat out. I've never actually seen him do this, so I don't know exactly how he does it, but I now take it away from him after I've decided he's had enough.<br /><br />A couple of notes:  I think the smaller treat ball was recommended for a dog his size, but I got the medium because he's such a strong chewer.  I'm glad I did, as the smaller ball wouldn't have lasted long.  I do think this is an excellent toy/treat when used the way I use it. The treat isn't particularly nutritious, but if it's consumed over a period of weeks, it shouldn't be too harmful. Also, when it's filled with kibble, the dog is working for his food and, if you're having problems with your dog eating too fast, this will slow him or her down.

review/summary: Not "everlasting"
review/text: I picked up several bento balls and large treat balls with these treats. I have a: one year old half Timber Wolf, half German Shepherd; seven year old retired bomb detection German Shepherd, 11 month old Lab/terrier mix, and 8 month old Smooth Collie. The treats were out of the balls within minutes and demolished in under 30 minutes. I had put several smaller treats into the ball as well, so after they finished the larger treats, they managed to be entertained by trying to get the small treats out. There hasn't been much that the pack hasn't been able to figure out.<br /><br />We regularly give them fresh deer bones as treats. The wolf will strip the meat while the shepherd will eat the bones, so I didn't expect these treats to be a true challenge for their jaw pressure and mental abilities. I will continue to get them and try other various tricks out. Some include putting the disc in upside down and adding peanut butter or other purees into the balls. The treats may not last long, but the balls will allow for some creative training.

review/summary: Tasty but hard to chw
review/text: We have a small dog (17 lbs) and she could not get started on these - they were too hard to bite.  Once we cut them in half (which is quite hard to do!) she was able to get at them and then really enjoyed them.  We probably wouldn't buy them again, since we were looking for something that she could work on and enjoy for a long time, and it didn't really work for that.  Either she couldn't eat it at all, or she could eat it too quickly once we cut it in half.

review/summary: Least Stinky of These Treats
review/text: First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really "everlasting" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a>.<br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: These are probably the least repugnant smelling of the discs, to me, anyway. It just smells like chicken broth when the dog gets going on it. I expected the Vanilla Mint ones to be better, but have found these are the least offensive.

review/summary: The doggie equivalent of popping in a new DVD for the kids:  Silence and Peace!
review/text: I have 3 70 pound retriever mixes and they always have to have something in their mouths. Unfortunately, it is usually one of their fellow pack-mates that they wind up chewing on and the 3 of them get to scrapping like a scrum in a rugby game. Not very restful.<br /><br />However, with 3 of the large Everlasting Treat balls stuffed with these treats, I'm good for a couple of relatively peaceful evenings. Depending on the dog and the ball, the treats usually stay in there and will one two-pack will last a couple of nights. Occasionally, the treat will "pop out" of the ball and the lucky dog will be able to chew it up in about the same amount of time as a raw-hide chip.<br /><br />I like that these aren't raw-hide since raw-hide will sometimes cause digestive issues in my dogs (and there is nothing worse when 3 big dogs have digestive issues!).<br /><br />I'm so glad to see Amazon sell these because my local Petsmart no longer carries them -- at least not in the size that I need. Plus, Amazon saves me a trip, shipping, and tax... happiness abounds for bi-peds and quadra-peds alike!

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: This product is simply fabulous.  I purchased it for my 7 month old pit bull, who is always into something and very highly food motivated.  Prior to the everlasting treat ball her favorite toy was the Chuckle, made by Premier.  The advantage to the chuckle is that I could fill it with her food for a nutritious but fun toy.  After a few months though, she learned how to get all the food out in under 10 minutes and I needed to find something else to occupy her while I focused on other things.<br /><br />She was just a couple of pounds over 40 pounds when I purchased the treat ball.  Although the large looked too big for her, it was recommended for her size so I went with that one.  Now that I've seen her playing with it I can tell that the medium would have been too small.<br /><br />The first time she got her paws on it, she chewed on the treat for six hours straight!  I actually had to take it away from her a few times and make her drink some water because I was afraid she'd make herself sick.  The discs weren't completely gone at the end of her play-fest, they really are "everlasting."  I usually give her the treat ball with both sides covered in their treats.  Her favorite is the barbecue, but it is also the darkest and will show up on fabric.  We've tried the chicken & liver too and had positive receptions to both.<br /><br />Even after playing with this for a month I can still get a good hour to myself without having to worry about her getting in to trouble when I let her play with it.  I've also tried squeezing some cheese into the center hole for her to lick and she loves this as well!  I think peanut butter would be another excellent choice.  After about a month she has found a way to pop the treats out once in a while, but it seems to be by accident because she doesn't do it every time.  Even after she pops the treats out they still last a long time.  If she doesn't get them out herself, I pop them out when there is only a rim left and give them to her to chew on.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this toy four stars instead of five is that I wish the holes in the center were smaller to accommodate her dog food or treats.  Small/med. treats fall out too quickly.  It does seem to be sized well for their Every Flavor treats, but we haven't really tried those so I can't comment on them.<br /><br />For anyone put off by the cost, this product is TOTALLY worth its weight in gold!

review/summary: Airedale Approved
review/text: Being that I have an Airedale Terrier (over 70 lbs) I have to be very picky and harsh on products. Treats don't need to just say "long lasting", "tough", "durable" or "everlasting", they need to prove it. This flavor and product last way longer than I expected. It pops out of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a> a little sooner than I would like, but, considering I did have a hard time putting two treats in there I would have to say if they made it harder to come out I may not be able to put it in.<br /><br />The very first time one treat lasted a good five minutes, on the second attempt maybe more like four minutes and that is just because he knows how hard to bite down now. Either way with the whole package I would say it is a good investment as a once in a while kind of treat for when he does something special or we just need silence to watch a show (30 minutes to 1 hour, not a 2-hour series premier).<br /><br />My dog is pretty mellow when he has his exercise, but, when it is missed this can help to get some quiet. Though every dog, no matter the breed needs to be exercised.

review/summary: My lab loves these!
review/text: My black lab mix loves these. It doesn't take very long (probably an hour or so) for him to remove the top "dome" part of the treat  and make it a flat cookie inside the blue dispenser ball. The flat part of the treat lasts another four or five days until it's just a ring inside the ball and finally the ring will take him about another week to remove and consume. He loves these things so much that I have to put refills in his ball while he is outside doing his business or I can't even get enough space in the kitchen to pop the new one in before he's trying to take it back! And even when the ball is empty he carries it around and licks around the inside of the dispenser part. I guess he's licking the smell out haha!

review/summary: Five stars for the dog, one star for me
review/text: All of my dogs went nuts when I gave this to my 55 lb., only 5 month old, German Shepherd puppy. I have a 15 lb Bichon and a 4lb Yorkie-Poo. They were willing to (literally) walk into the Big Bad Wolf's den. So, the dogs go nuts over this. I do not. It stinks. I cannot stand the smell of it. Perhaps if you have an "outside" dog this would be fine...but, no, it would attract skunks and raccoons. You have to REALLY LOVE YOUR DOG if you are willing to put up with the smell. (bully sticks are nothing compared to these) And, to add insult to injury, the toy that I purchased with these inserts does not comply with those inserts. I would've really appreciated a heads up on that. I would have been happy to buy the truly corresponding toy.

So, if you have a "not so smart" dog this is a good product.  But if your dog is smart it's not worth the price.

It is also a helpful tool to distract dogs while you entertain guests.  Great treat for dogs.

review/text: I bought a 2-pack of the chicken flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very "everlasting" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (Liver and Vanilla Mint). The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it.<br /><br />Two paws up!

He worked on the chicken end for over 2 hours yesterday and has yet to dislodge it from the ball, albeit he did make quite a dent in it.  Other days, he'll work on the BBQ end.

review/summary: Everlasting Dog Treats -- Love at First Bite!
review/text: This was an instant success for our food- and treat-fussy Siberian, and our "normal" voracious Malamute.<br /><br />Pros: 1) Most importantly: If our siberian will accept (as in devour!) these treats, we predict most any other fussy pups will too.<br /><br />2) Someone intelligently designed the treat holders and shape of the treats themselves so that they can't be immediately removed and consumed... our dogs spend hours working on their treat ball. True to their breeds, our pups get in an occasional gnawing moment, but for the most part they have to lick and nibble their way through their treat. Which means when we leave for an extended time, they are honorably occupied, not bored, and not getting into mischief.<br /><br />3) The ball itself is made of a soft-ish, somewhat pliable material, and yet appears to be indestructible. Time will tell.<br /><br />4) A variety of flavors. We purchased each of the available flavors to learn which would "win", and immediately discovered that all flavors send our pups into exited expectation when they see their ball coming.<br /><br />5) You can put your own treats inside the ball itself, but it looks like a tough nut for any dog to get to.<br /><br />Con: and this could be a good thing: it's hard getting a treat into the ball unless you have strong hands/wrists, or a smooth ended spoon handle to help peel the retaining edge of the treat ball opening over the edge of the treat. This means your pup will not likely remove the treat in one lump (unless he uses that smooth spoon handle) and immediately consume it.

review/summary: Orange treat is better
review/text: Before I comment on the cookies. I want to inform buyers about the toy that you insert these into. Petsmart and other pet stores sell a blue ball. You stick a treat on both sides of that one. I purchased one and promptly had to return it...because on the car ride home my dog was able to get chunks of the blue plastic ripped off. I at that time decided to never purchase one of these again. However, I was recently at Pet Supplies Plus getting my sheltie groomed and I wanted to get a treat for my heavy chewer since she got left at home and was very unhappy. While browsing the treat insert toys(kong, etc) I noticed the orange ball of this that holds one cookie and small kibble or treats on the other side. I promptly dismissed it because of it being an everlasting toy. I continued to browse and when I realized that we either have or have tried pretty much every other treat stuffed toy. I decided to try it since if she ripped it apart they would refund my money and I would know if it was good or not.<br /><br />I got home and man oh man did I have a happy dog. She still has not even punctured the rough rubber. Unlike other reviewers stating that the treat came out easily in the blue ball this one did not. Once she had cleaned the middle out I could not get the treat out to save my life. I had to use a meat mallet to bust it apart. She does, however, get any kibble or other treats out of the backside very easily. We only put treats in the back when we need to get her interested again.<br /><br />Just to elaborate on the chewing power of my dog. She can eat a full rawhide in just an hour or so. (a large rawhide with the tied ends, she is 26 pounds). She has also demolished a couple of kong's and ate through the rope on the tug-a-jug toy. She also completely chewed trough the Twist-and-treat by the same company.<br /><br />The only other flaw I see with this product is the rubber. It is a lint/hair magnet. I hate picking it up and am constantly washing it because it picks up all the dog hair and lint possible...On the reverse side I love that it is not a toy that peanut butter or other semi solids work best in. I hate putting them in the kong because it leaves a very bad smell and clean up if not taken away promptly and cleaned.<br /><br />Onto the cookies. They are very hard and last her a couple hours of constant chewing. I have a large treat ball even though she is weighted into the medium. I find the oversized toys help prevent her getting a good grip and ripping it apart. She seems to love the flavor and loves when we put a new treat in. I do find them at a very good price compared to other refill treats.<br /><br />Over all I find it one of the best treat filled toy buys that we have made. It has out lasted any of the Kong's...even the black ones. It is easier to clean and provides her with a lot of enjoyment...and us with a lot of laughter as she tries to go at it.

review/text: Our golden retriever has decided he prefers these treats to the taste of my husbands trainers. While a pair of trainers may last slightly longer than this treat, they are saving us a fortune.

review/summary: these are great
review/text: These items that you go through in a hurry are great to add to your list to get your free shipping offers!  I use these for my very large dog and she goes through them very fast, so, as usual, Amazon offers everything you could need and if not cheaper than usual which they usually are, they at least cost the same and help you get your free shipping.  I got them in a reasonable amount of time and was ready when the last ones were gone!  Thanks for these opportunities to stay home and get my favorite items shipped right to my door.  That way I don't run out.  Flo

review/summary: Not Everlasting but keeps my dog busy
review/text: The first time I used this it kept my dog entertained for hours.  He figured out how to get the treat out of the ball so now it will keep him entertained for maybe 30 minutes.  Really expensive to keep buying these treats that distract him for such a short period of time now.

review/summary: Last Longer if Put in Upsidedown
review/text: Ok the bad news,  these aren't the healthiest treats but if it takes ages to eat them then it doesn't matter so much. Gluten is no big deal unless u have allergies or celiacs (do dogs get that?). They do make one with rice gluten if ur dog can't do wheat.  Garlic (like onion) causes a type of anemia in dogs if given in significant amounts, low levels like in this treat or in some foods is safe but I don't like it.<br /><br />Also they don't last long if put in the way the toys show you. My dog gets it out and finishes it in less than a minute when put in right side up.<br />Upside down ( bump facing inside the ball) it takes her up to a week to finish it. I also give it to her for only like an hour or two at a time now because after a while when she had it out all the time she got bored with it. Taking it away keeps her interested. The Bento ball also works best for me.<br /><br />Chicken is likely my dogs favorite flavor. I'm surprised she likes them because she's not very food oriented. (She also likes the natural ones but hates liver.)<br /><br /> Medium is the right size for my dog she's about aussie or border collie size 35 to 40 pound. Large is actually easier for her, maybe not for other dogs.

review/summary: A Really Tough Treat!
review/text: This very solid chicken flavored dog chew may have an unusual appearance, yet it works!  Most women who see this chew in person will experience a momentary impression that it resembles, yes, I'll say it, a diaphragm.  On a serious and positive note, the round chew is challenging for dogs to grasp when the chew is concave to the floor.  Hardwood makes an excellent shuffleboard surface and my dogs kick and chase it for fun.  The exterior is somehow resistant to dog saliva, so messy floor streaks and drool spots were surprisingly absent.  My two dogs kick it, chase it and trot about the house with these very durable chews for days.  Eventually, something possesses the dogs and they start working at dismantling the 'bone'.  It literally takes hours of dedicated canine chomping and gnawing for the chew to be reduced to crumbs.  The final word is that there are no intestinal after effects in what I have observed in my two English Springers. These "Everlasting Treats" make it possible for me to sit down and watch a film in solitude. - an activity long ago lost by any 'Springer parent'.

review/summary: Great for aggressive chewers
review/text: We have a 88lb silver lab.  He loves to chew things.  We have a hard time finding toys that he don't have chewed up in 10 minutes.  These are great if you put them in the blue rubber ball.  The first time he played with it he took him about 2 days.  But he has slowed down on it now but he chews on it everyday.  It's one of his toys that he hides so no one knows where it is except for him.

review/summary: Best Small Dog Chew Toy-Treat
review/text: I found the Everlasting Bento Ball and Everlasting dog treats one of the best long lasting toys I have found for my 10 lb. Bichon mix. She just loves to play, toss around and chew on the Bento Ball. It takes here weeks to chew down the middle of the treat inside.  It takes her minutes to chew down any other chewing treats like the bully sticks.  I'm not buying those any longer.  I can imagine that larger dogs would find a way to chew into one of the treats inside any of the Everlasting Treat toys very quickly.  But, for smaller dogs, this type of chew toy is ideal.

review/summary: Longest lasting dog treat I've found
review/text: This is by far one of the best dog treats I've found for my pitbull mix. She will devour a large rawhide in 30 minutes of less. These treats last for hours or days. They work best when both treat discs are placed in the ball. It takes a lot more mental work for my dog to stabilize the ball and chew on the treat. (Plus I thinks its adorable to see her use her paws like hands:) I tried to make my supply of discs last longer by only putting in one at time, which backfired because it allowed her to chew through the one disc much faster. In a true testament to this product's quality, it still took her about 4-5 hours to eat just the one. Now I use both discs and just take it away from her after a couple of hours. She loves these treats.
