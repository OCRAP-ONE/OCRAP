review/summary: Just Junior Mints in a new box...
review/text: These certainly sound appealing, and the bright red box won me over in the grocery aisle, but these Peppermint Crunch Junior Mints are not greater than the sum of their parts.<br /><br />They are typical Junior Mints that are simply 'misted' with red, starlight mint dust.  The peppermint pieces are too small to make a noticeable 'crunch', and Junior Mints already taste like peppermint, so the addition of crumbled up peppermints doesn't really change the flavor at all.  They certainly taste good, but no better (or even different) than your typical Junior Mints.  Just a heads up for anyone who is looking for something new...

review/summary: Grossly overpriced for **tiny** cans
review/text: I was in a hurry that day and unfortunately I assumed that based on the price ($31 for 24 cans) that this would be the normal size cans (5.5 oz). That price is nearly as much as you'd pay for a case of the regular cans just about anywhere. Well, these are the teeny tiny cans - about one serving for just one of my cats. At $1.25 a pop, I can't afford to feed my cat using this reseller. This price is extremely high for these cans. Go to your local pet store if you want a reasonable price. Cat food is supposed to be cheaper by the case, not more expensive.

review/summary: Lemonade in a jelly bean
review/text: My two favorite flavors in the world are chocolate and lemon, with lemon normally coming in a distant second. But after tasting these, I may just have to move lemon into a tie position. These are seriously good lemon.<br /><br />Unlike the sugary flavor you might expect, these have a tart, slightly sour flavor with sweet overtones. They are the closest thing to very fresh lemonade that I have found. When I say very fresh, I'm talking small town, sitting on the porch on a hot summer day fresh. I'm talking the fresh lemonade you buy at the county fair and never get enough of in the cup fresh.<br /><br />And unlike some of the other signature beans, these don't seem to get sweeter, they stay just as tart to the end.<br /><br />If you are a lemon fan, or if you know someone who is, you will not go wrong with this one pound bag! But don't expect a mild lemon, these are wonderfully intense!<br /><br />I had the opportunity to receive a complimentary box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> from the distributor, and these ended up as my favorite flavor.

Perhaps not as much as Hickory Farms, but their summer sausage is quite delectable.<br /><br />The shipping was listed as 3-5 business days all the way through checkout and should have arrived by Monday at the latest after I ordered it.  I got a message telling me not to expect it until Thursday of the following week!<br /><br />With such horrible planning on SC's part, I will either order before I need something a week or more in advance or just forget it.  It's more likely that I'm going to say forget it and go with another company after being burned twice by Swiss Colony's outmoded and unnecessarily expensive shipping standards.  3rd class mail?!  Horrible.  Wouldn't a well-known company have established a flat rate deal with their shippers?

review/summary: Delicious Alternative to Sugar
review/text: If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great Price for Great Sweetener!
review/text: A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally.

review/summary: Cats LOVE this!
review/text: This is the good stuff my cats come running for!<br /><br />This is a jar of dried fish "shavings." They're paper thin, and cats ADORE them. I have to hide the jar, because if I don't, I find the jar in the morning with little kitty tooth marks all over it, from them trying to get it open. LOL.<br /><br />This stuff is such a big hit at my house, that I have taught my cats tricks- like to "Sit" on command, in exchange for this treat- that's how much they love it.<br /><br />Best of all, I have a cat whose tummy gets upset easily, and she never gets sick after eating this like she did with other kinds of treats. This is 100% pure dried fish- NO fillers, which is great.<br /><br />I deducted one star because these shavings tend to turn to powder in the bottom of the jar, which makes the cats sneeze so I usually have to throw a tiny bit of it away- but it is a very small portion compared to the size of the container.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product, healthy and makes kitties VERY happy. I buy it regularly.

review/summary: Good.
review/text: I received Gudrun chocolates as a gift.  I'd never heard of Gudrun, so I was curious to see how they'd stack up against other premium chocolates.  I'd have to say that they're good, but not my favorite.  The best way I can try to compare them is to say that if you like your centers whipped to a lightness that almost floats away and is delicately flavored then these are for you.  If you prefer, as I do, a denser texture and richer flavor then I'd have to say that you'll want to pass on these.  One thing I did like was the beautiful golden box mine came in.  At first I couldn't figure out how the box stayed shut but then on closer examination I discovered that there are little magnets cleverly mounted in the flap of the box.  Very nice, and a solid choice at a lower price.

review/summary: Not a good substitute for Postum
review/text: I ordered this along with Cafix and Roastaroma to try the three. I'm a former Postum aficionado and had certainly developed quite a liking to Postum.<br /><br />Really can't take Pero Extra very much. I keep trying it again and again, prolly 10 times now, to see if I can develop a liking for it and just can't. I'm sure some people may like it, but it's just not for me.<br /><br />Cafix is what I'll usually go for, but it has a certain sort of built in sweetness (very mild, barely distinguishable)which comes from the beets that are added. Over time I've found it just sort of fills in some of the void from lack of Postum, and while it's not a Postum replica it has certain Postum like qualities.<br /><br />The Roastaroma actually is what I think tastes the best of the three, but it's taste is just not at all like Postum, is however very balanced and has a nice maltiness to it. Often I'll put just a little bit of Stevia powder in it. (I could always tell if I've ingested aspartame by (or nutrasweet, whatever) by how I felt, and try to verify any food/drink I ingest doesn't have aspartame. I mean, an item which arose out of research into nerve agents for warfare, and itself found to be an effective weapon, really shouldn't be passed off as a food item. Stevia is ground plant matter, even less processed that sugar.)The combo makes a really nice morning or late evening drink.

This will probably make about 60 cups of tea since the leaves can be reused up to 3 times.  (It actually tastes better the second and third brewing.)

review/text: Great taste, and also great value ordering here on Amazon. I usually brew with loose tea, but these teabags are a very close 2nd place to brewing loose tea. I was not a big fan of green tea until I found Dragon Well, which I find extremely enjoyable.

review/text: We have the Adagio Dragon Well Tea as one of our subscribe and save items. The tea is very good, just as described, but in a couple of the shipments we had some open tea bags and one tea bag had no tea in it at all. We contacted Adagio to let them know what had happened and they quickly offered to ship out a new box to us. We received a fresh box in just a few days with a handwritten card! To have such fast, friendly, personal customer service is a rarity these days. We love a company that stands behind their product!

review/text: This is almost as good as the looseleaf dragonwell green tea I bought in China. I like the mesh teabag and I get at least two steeps from one. It's a little expensive but we are paying for the convenience of the packaging which means I can take one with me whereever I go. I recommend this if you want something to travel with and be sure you are drinking quality tea.

I was right - he loves it.  We have 4 cans left, but he wants me to go ahead and order more. I'm wondering why they don't sell this nationally as it is so tasty.  I don't remember it costing so much when I lived out East and the next time we're out that way I'm going to buy barrels of it!

Well, happy times are here again since last week when I found it on Amazon. I immediately bought 6 cans. It's a bit pricey, but I don't care. It's just as wonderful as I remember. I like it sliced and toasted with butter. It's also fantastic with baked beans. My husband hadn't even heard of it before, but he's a big fan now. Thank you, Amazon, for restoring this to my life.

review/summary: Restaurant quality Indian food made super fast at home!!
review/text: "Wow" would be a good place to start!  While I have had a handful of Indian restaurant experiences, the closest one to our home is at least an hour away.  I found these sauces at a local closeout retailer for about $2.00 a bottle and thought I'd give this a try.  We love the taste of cardamon and lemongrass in our home so it was worth the risk.  I made some roasted chicken, and cut up carrots, onions, and red peppers to combine with this sauce and paired it with some Basmati rice.  Upon first taste, Hubby and I were hooked and I headed to both discount retailers in our town the very next day to buy out what  was left of it which turned out to be about 5 more bottles in all. I will be disappointed when it's all gone since nobody else, not even Kroger, seems to sell this product.  Amazon will have to be my source for more of it if we don't tire of it before it expires.  Tonight we're having Sharwood's Red Thai Curry Sauce which I'll combine with chickpeas, shrimp, and acorn squash along with some home made garlic naan.  I hope we like this as much...looks like another trip to closeout "Lots" tomorrow if we do.

review/summary: It's just plain good soup.
review/text: This is the first "diet" soup I've ever tried.  I bought a can at the local grocery store and have ordered more from Amazon.  It's good.  It does NOT taste diety to me.<br /><br />This is just plain ol' good soup.<br /><br />Notes:<br />* Campbell's seems to think it appropriate to only eat half the bowl in a single serving.  That's crazy.  Don't fall for the marketing illusion that the can is "only 50 calories" - No, you're going to eat the whole thing, but don't worry, that's still only about 100 calories.<br /><br />* The label said it was only 0 Weight Watcher points.  It should be noted that WW recently changed to Points Plus.  Under the PP program this whole bowl (remember "2 servings") was 3 Weight Watcher Points Plus.<br /><br />* It is not "chunky" - It is mostly broth, but it's got veggies and small little noodles too.  My unprofessional guess is that the whole can would be worth a single "serving" of vegetables.<br /><br />* It's got a mild/simple "herb" taste.  There's no spiciness.  And while it wasn't "too" salty to the taste, it did have the usual canned-soup saltiness.  I sprinkled in some black pepper.<br /><br />* I have no problems with the lid or in preparing the soup.  No mess made here.<br /><br />* Finally, what I like best about this is I can keep it in my desk drawer at work and if I get hungry between meals, it's a more filling/satisfying snack for 3 Weight Watcher Points Plus than say a granola bar or other treat.  It also goes well with a light sandwich from home if I want to make more of a meal out of it and skip the bag of chips.

review/text: Am I the only idiot in the world who cannot remove the metal lid without making a huge mess?  I normally end up wearing part of the soup, which I guess makes my meal even lower calorie.<br /><br />Other than that, the soup is pretty decent.  As with most low calorie soups, it's mostly broth with a few vegetables thrown in.  It's not loaded with corn syrup, and water is listed twice in the first seven ingredients.  It's filling, but the entire bowl counts as two servings.  Yeah right.  I barely eat anything, and not even I am buying that.  Still, 100 calorie lunch is not bad.<br /><br />To avoid the lid ordeal, buy yourself a thermos and fill it with soup.  You can get two to three real lunch servings per can, save some money and not smell like soup for half of your workday.  If you ask me, that's a win!

Basically they have taken ordinary coffee beans, which may or may not be good beans to begin with, and put in 00.16 ounces of Kopi Luwak beans per pound.  That means this bag contains about 00.30 ounces of Kopi Luwak as it's a 200 gram bag.  My point?  Drinking a cup of this is not drinking a cup of Kopi Luwak, but just a very expensive cup of normal coffee, period.  Amazon should be ashamed to be selling this.  Enjoy your fake Kopi Luwak coffee.

review/summary: not real Kopi Luwak...
review/text: ok people just to let you know real Kopi Luwak sells for around $300 per pound if not more. this is a blend of beans. what they dont tell you on this page is youll be lucky if theres 3% Kopi Luwak mixed in with who knows what other beans. ive seen a similar posting like this for $50 using the same picture but it tells you its only 2% Kopi Luwak. dont buy this if you want 100% Kopi Luwak

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: This is pure marketing scheme...which I fell for because I did not read the description thoroughly enough.  This coffee only has 2% Kopi-Luwak, purely for marketing purposes so they can charge you outrageous price for average coffee.  The coffee itself (brewed in a siphon coffee maker which is renowned for making smooth coffee) has a highly acidic taste and leaves a strong cardboard finish in your mouth. In my opinion, one of the worst cups of coffee I ever tasted.<br /><br />I do highly recommend buying 100% kopi-luwak as it is the smoothest, most organic cup of coffee I've ever tasted.  Not better than Jamaican Blue Mountain, but definitely as good.  Like JBM, Kopi-Luwak has it's own very unique and ultra smooth characteristics. Fantastic but at $70 a pound, it's definitely a weekend coffee.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this coffe.

review/summary: Pass This Passed Bean: Civet Coffee is Not Worth the Investment
review/text: I have tasted the kopi luwak coffee. Yes, it is processed through an animal's intestinal tract, but pleasantly, I can assert all fecatorial concerns are diminished once the beans are presented to the company by the blessed animal.<br /><br />I have had this in espresso, cappuccino and regular brew form. It tastes like a very decent cup of coffee, but nothing so remarkable that it requires its excessive cost.<br /><br />It is expensive at any price above the market value of a standard Sumatran bean, as the value is not in the taste (ordinary), but its exoticness.<br /><br />Civets eat the coffee berries and then pass the beans. In doing so, various chemicals are extracted that normally are part of coffee we are familiar with. Is it is enough to lift the quality to one worth the investment? No.<br /><br />If the idea is intriguing, and you want to say you have tasted all life offers, consider the kopi luwak bean. You will have a very good cup of coffee and a great laugh. If you are looking for a terrific flavor beyond all others, look at other beans.<br /><br />Pass on this and enjoy more of something else.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/summary: Buyer beware
review/text: Make sure when you shop for Kopi Luwak that you are getting the actual 100% Kopi. There are a number of blends out there that sport a whopping 2% or 3% of Kopi beans mixed with something else. The true Kopi has a remarkable smokey, silky character with a wonderful caramel finish that coats your mouth long after swallowing. I just shared some with my veteran coffee roaster (his first taste) and he remarked that it was the best coffee he had tasted since the old Kona before the quality dropped in the early 90's. Real Kopi should be treated like gold and with respect by: Using a burr grinder on the fine side of medium grind; making a single cup at a time; and using water at about 190F (boil filtered water and let it sit for 1 minute). Wet the grounds (about 2 standard coffee measuring scoops) with a little water at first, then pour just enough for one 8 oz. cup. BTW I discovered you can reuse the grounds from this process one more time with only a little reduction in quality if you make the second cup right away. You can stretch your Kopi dollars this way since you are spending about 7$ a cup.

And I can't find any pictures or videos to proof and compare Kopi luwak bean to the regular coffee bean. They Looks alike. Sooooooooooo wake up people.........If I sell you guy a regualar coffee bean and charge you $160 per pound and tell you this is Kopi luwak coffee bean. And I can get away with it. You know why??? Because there are no way regualar people can tell you that is the real Kopi luwak coffee bean. Especially after they Roasted the coffee bean and it became brown color. That even make it more impossible to tell if it is the real Kopi luwak coffee bean.............. Am I right?

review/text: after living in indonesia for over 12 years. I have had kopi luwak more then a few times. Even in indo it is very high priced. I was looking for some here in the US. having just placed my order for this one the review is not really about this one but about the kopi luwak i know.<br /><br />the coffee we used to get is like most indo coffee is more like powder.<br />like a instant coffee.  But is not really instant. put some in a cup and hot water stir and wait a min or to for the nasty stuff to go to the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />There is almost zero of the normal coffee after tatse, The taste to me is more like a nutty & chocolate after taste. Very smooth, and almost<br />Creamy in texture. More then a few of my friends who came to visit me there, said that it was the best coffee they ever had.<br /><br />is it worth the price?  hmm no not really, i have seen it in hotels for over 40 dollars a cup,  but it is fun to get and try with friends at least once, just to say you gave it a shot.<br /><br />maybe if i was rich i would get some more often lol

review/summary: All the nutrition, half the price
review/text: We used Parent's Choice Formula with our twins. The hospital sent us home with a bunch of samples of a Name Brand formula. When we ran out and went to the store to get more, we had sticker shock once we realized how expensive it was going to be to feed twins. Unfortunately, I physically could not breast feed, so formula was a necessity. We sat down in the aisle at the store, pulling cans of the various formulas off of the shelf and comparing the nutrition labels. It was surprising to see that they were all just about the same thing, yes the Parent's Choice was half the price, and for a larger container!<br />We did a little more research about infant formula, and found out that due to certain guidelines made by the FDA, all infant formulas are required to be made nutritionally equal. So, we didn't have to worry about sub par nutrition, or having to use more to get the right nutrients, etc... It was essentially buying the same formula, with a different label/price.<br />In the course of a year of formula feeding twins, we saved nearly $1400. We used that money to get other things that they needed.

review/text: I started my daughter on Emfamil and she was gassy and constipated.  I changed her to Similac, and she did great but it was costing me $25 a tub.  Ridiculous.  A woman at Babies R Us told me to try this brand, because she had switched her child over.  I tried it, and my daughter had no issues switching between the formulas.  The ingredients are almost identical.  Only two things were different, and it was only by a few percentage points.  It works great and is an awesome bargain.  Formula companies all have to meet certain requirements to label their product as formula, which reassured me that I had nothing to worry about.  You can also find it at Walmart stores (I hate that store, BUT it saves on shipping).

review/summary: The Best Via Variety
review/text: I've been a fan of Starbucks Via since it was first introduced.  As a pregnant (and now breastfeeding) woman, my caffeine intact is restricted to one cup of coffee a day.  I'm lazy and not willing to go to the trouble to make a pot of coffee for just one cup, so I switched to Via.  I don't think I'll ever go back.  I've tried all the Via varieties, including the Decaf Italian Roast and the various flavor blends (mocha, vanilla, etc.).  Out of all the different varieties, the French Roast is my favorite variety by a long shot.  It has a bold flavor without the weird aftertaste I sometimes detect in the Italian Roast.  The flavor is even stronger (in a good way) than the Christmas Blend Via, which is the second-best variety, in my opinon.  Good work, Starbucks, and keep the new varieties coming!

review/text: As a solo coffee drinker, I've become addicted to the ease and tastiness of Starbucks Via.  Instead of making a pot and drinking cold cups of coffee for the rest of the day, with Via I can have one fresh and hot cup whenever I want (these days, I only break out my 10 cup coffee maker for guests).<br /><br />A dark roast fan, I've been drinking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UHRX1G">Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Italian Roast Coffee by Starbucks Coffee</a>for a few months when I spotted this limited edition French Roast pack of twelve.  It's delicious.  Stronger and deeper than the Italian, but still quite smooth.  And delivery was exceptionally fast; I ordered it with two-day shipping and got it the next morning.<br /><br />Hopefully Starbucks will decide that the French Roast Via is a keeper and start selling in the 50-count boxes.

The biscuit is more of a soft cookie about 1/4" thick; it's topped with a stiff orange jelly & iced with a thin layer of dark chocolate icing. One of these cookies will satisfy my craving. I tried the raspberry flavor, but prefer the orange.<br /><br />Serving Size: 2<br />Servings per 5.29 oz Container: 6<br />Calories: 100<br />Total Fat: 3 g<br />~Saturated Fat: 1.5g<br />~Trans Fat: 0<br />Cholesterol: 10mg<br />Sodium: 35mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 17 g<br />Dietary Fiber: 0<br />Sugars: 14g<br />Protein: &lt;1g<br /><br />Ingredients listed on product page under Important Information<br />Made in Belgium

review/summary: Great little dessert cookie, or "chocolate and orange, together at last"
review/text: My late father's favorite flavor combination was orange and chocolate. His confection of choice was candied orange peel covered in dark chocolate. When he passed away in his 80's we found a small stash of chocolate-covered orange jellies in the cupboard--his treat. He'd have LOVED this cookies. They are soft sponge biscuits with a layer of stiff orange jelly and a brittle dark chocolate topping. The combination is delectable--the soft biscuit, orangey jelly and the crackle of the bitter chocolate on top. A few of these make a great dessert with a cup of espresso. They come in raspberry flavor as well, which I tried and it's also absolutely terrific. So keep a tube of these on hand and if required to produce a dessert or afternoon refreshment for a sudden visitor, make a cup of coffee and put a few of these on a nice paper doily. Done.

review/summary: I've loved them since i was a child
review/text: I've been eating these Belgian cookies since i was a child growing up in Belgium.  They're a very old cookie called Couques de Bastogne (Bastogne cookies, from the town where the Battle of the Bulge took place). They were first marketed in the U.S. under that name but since that didn't mean  much to Americans the name's been changed several times over the 20 or so years I've seen them around. My local grocery store (I live in the Rockies) was carrying them, then Nabisco took over the LU brand and quit carrying the Bastogne here.  I just bought several boxes in NYC at a deli next to Time Square and really wanted more.  So happy to have found them on Amazon.<br /><br />They're a bit sweet, that's true, and that is a bit unusual for a European cookie but they make the best dunking cookie: cold milk, coffee of hot chocolate. They're similar to the the Lotus cinnamon cookie also made in Belgium that Delta serves on its flights. sorry the name escapes me.  I prefer the texture of the Cinnamon Sugar Spice; it's lighter.

review/summary: Great cookies!
review/text: I am always looking for something to send to my sons (one is in college the other in the military). I sent these cookies along with some other LUs to my college son. He called me almost immediately when he received them (and suprisingly it wasn't for money, lol) to thank me. He told me that all his roomates devoured several boxes within just a few minutes. So, these cookies passed the college frat test. Combining it with Amazon Prime shipping and it's all good. Kudos!
