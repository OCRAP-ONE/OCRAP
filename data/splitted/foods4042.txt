review/summary: Perfect Snack
review/text: I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel "mouth-satisfied" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value.

review/summary: GREAT for low carb/glycemic diets
review/text: This is my favorite flavor but all the BOLD flavors are helping me stay on my low carb diet.  They taste great, crunchy, mouth full of flavor.  My whole office is now eating my "diet food."  If the sodium is high for your diet, mix them 50:50 with plain unsalted almonds. just YUMMY!

review/summary: Full of flavor
review/text: To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.

review/summary: Wasabi Soy Flavor is too salty!
review/text: I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, "hey that happens, no big deal..." A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, "hey that happens, it's hot out..." But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, "hey these are really salty" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.

review/summary: addicted to ... Lime and Chili Almonds
review/text: I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought "When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too.

review/text: We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.  They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here.

review/summary: A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word "Bold" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a "Bold" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!

Rich like chocolate, but lighter - this is a solid favorite of all who try it for the first time.

review/summary: The legendary cake still pleases! Old-fashioned goodness
review/text: For those of you not familiar with the great Urban Legend of the Red Velvet Cake recipe that cost $240 dollars, see Jan Harold Brunvand's series of books on Urban Legends starting with THE VANISHING HITCHIKER available here on Amazon. Most of us know the legend in it's more modern form as the "Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip cookie recipe" that some poor unsuspecting soul requested and was told would cost "Two-forty" and who assumed that meant Two Dollars and forty cents only to receive a credit card bill of $240. Needless to say the legend is NOT true, never WAS true & never will be true be it about the cookies, Red Velvet Cake or Waldorf Salad( Another part of the legend).<br /><br />Red Velvet Cake started out as a pretty and regional variant of Devil's Food cake and is really just a wonderfully light chocolate cake with red colouring added to it. It is often topped with either a vanilla buttercream frosting or in more modern times with cream cheese frosting. The Duncan Hines mix is probably a better option than any of the current recipes floating around that are often remnents of the old Urband Legend for a variety of reasons. Many of the legendary recipes have bizarre added ingredients intended to make the recipe look weird or authentic and often call for far more food coloring than is needed, imparting a bitter flavor and ghastly colour to the finished cake.<br /><br />Having had the Duncan Hines mix as a child and again more recently, I can attest to its superiority over most of the existing recipes for Red Velvet Cake. The Duncan Hines Cake Mix has a lovely chocolate flavor and just the right amount of red color to make the final product interesting. When made as a layer cake (preferabley with four thin layers as opposed to two thick ones) and topped with Cream cheese icing, the Duncan Hines Red Velvet Cake makes a wonderfully festive Holiday cake sure to provoke conversation. You may find yourself having to give away a number of the boxes of mix you now have to friends eager to make it themselves and share the intriguing legend. The finished cake truly is a show-stopper!<br /><br />Conventional wisdom is that the cake itself began as a Southern tradition and indeed, it can still be found on the dessert menus of some venerable Southern eateries. The best I ever had was in Nashville at an old Inn but it wasn't all that superior to the Duncan Hines mix which is more moist and lighter in texture than most Tradtional ( as opposed to "legendary" ) recipes.<br /><br />You can still find elaborate versions of Red Velvet cake popping up in places such as the Swiss Colony Holiday Catalog but for outragious prices. Do what I do and make your own! Since it is near impossible to find anywhere else, go ahead and order the mix here. Even if you only make it a few times a year, the mix lasts a long time and is a good value when you consider its "Star Quality" as a dessert and a natural conversation piece! I know of one mom whose daughter got an 'A' when using the cake as a demonstration of modern Folklore in her high-school social studies class!<br /><br />If all that info isn't enough inducement to try it...just remember..it's chocolate cake for heaven's sake! And...it's pretty! What more could a person want?

review/summary: EASY (Fail Proof) and Surprisingly Delicious!
review/text: Wow!  I couldn't believe I just made the BEST Red Velvet cake ever!  I love to bake but normally avoid cake mix from a box (sugar control) but store keeps putting these things on shelf for 99 cents so I couldn't resist.  (Good for a lazy day for bake for friends/family)<br /><br />I tried (followed instruction exactly) Duncan Strawberry Cake mix before and hated it.  I gave Red Velvet a try with a little adaptation.  Instead of 1/3 cup of oil as instructed on the box, I used 1/3 cup of applesauce and a dash (1/2 tsp) of oil.  Preparation was a breeze and couldn't get easier than 'mix everything in a bowl on low' and bake.  I felt like working out so I manually used a wisk and mixed it away with my power hand! :)<br /><br />I baked it according to the instruction and the cake came out gorgeous!  Very dark red color, puffy, moist and DELICIOUS!  It's so good I didn't even mind the extra sweetness!  I also frost it with cream cheese frosting for my DH. (Mr. Sweet tooth)<br /><br />Creamcheese: 1 (8oz) soften cream cheese, 1 stick soften butter, 1 1/2 cup powder sugar, 1 tsp vanila, dashes of salt.  BEAT away for 10 minutes and it will come out just like what you lick off a Cinnabon!

review/summary: Cake Mix great... shipping cost-NOT
review/text: Loved the cake mix. It is very hard to find the red velvet in stores, so i had no choice but to order it online. I really wanted it, and i guess you get what you pay for- but i did think the shipping cost was way too high in comparison to the cost of the Mix. End the end, 2 boxes of cake mix which was about 6.00 with shipping (12.00) ended up costing me like 17.00! I don't think I would ever order it again with that shipping cost unless it was for a special occasion. But i must say that they did deliver in a timely fashion.

review/text: These little cookies are the best ever.  Who can stop at just a handful.  I found them at our local HY-Vee store in the organic section.  We all know that sunflower seeds are important to our health, but to have them in such a decedant form is just well wonderful. Amazon is selling these cookies cheaper than in the stores so stock up and have fun with them.  They never seem to last very long at my home.

review/text: Yes, the cookies are wonderful, but $8.99 for a 12-ounce bag? I get them for $4.59 at my small independent natural food store. And I'm not in a low cost shipping area.<br /><br />If these cookies were $6 they would rank in the top 10,000 at Amazon. Sell them for $5 and they could get to 5,000. Everybody likes to make a buck, but I think they are being a little ambitious at $9 a bag.<br /><br />I give the cookies 6 stars, but take away 3 for vendor greed.

review/text: These cookies are delicious but most assuredly NOT worth $8.99. Shame on Amazon for charging this much!!!! Amazing that Amazon has the audacity to charge this much. I have bought these cookies at Whole Foods for $4.99 and at Natural Grocers/Vitamin Cottage for $4.69.  I thought THESE PRICES were too much...I was shocked when I saw them priced even higher on Amazon.  Grace's has their own website but they charge more than Whole Foods.  Since when did we have to dole out this much money to get a good cookie???  My mother used to make cookies this good - now I just need to find the right recipe to replace the need to purchase these too expensive cookies.  I would rather do without and send the money to some needy family.  Seems that Amazon would rather rip off the consumer and keep the extra for themselves.

review/text: The vanilla flavor tastes fine, unlike the fake tasting flavors like lemon. I believe it's best to get plain vanilla pudding and add flavor. For example, adding 1/2 cup of pumpkin makes great pumpkin pudding and a heaping tablespoon of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNFHLC">Frontier Cocoa Powder, Dutch-process Certified Organic, Fair Trade Certified, 16-Ounce Bag</a> makes better chocolate pudding than either the Jello chocolate or fudge flavors in my opinion. I also like to add wheat germ to the pudding to lessen the bitter taste of wheat germ and make the pudding more nutritious.

review/text: These are supposed to be lightly salted, but in fact the salt is very heavy and clings tightly to the nuts, making it almost impossible to wipe off the excess. Even worse, many of the nuts, especially the smaller ones, are soft and chewy rather than crunchy, possibly rancid? There are a lot of incredibly tiny nuts in the bag, like I have never seen before. I certainly won't order these again!

review/text: These crackers are just fantastic. I do not have any kinds of problems with wheat (for those of you who do, you should try any of the other Doctor Kracker flatbreads - they are made with spelt flour.)<br /><br />These do contain wheat, and they are incredibly crunchy and satisfying. In fact these may be the crunchiest crackers I've ever had - and that is a big plus for me.  They are sweet (naturally - from the whole grains) and filling and are very healthy for you. They are good with any kind of topping (peanut butter or fruit) but I usually just pop them in my mouth as is.<br /><br />Highly highly recommended.<br /><br />*I have tried the other Doctor Kracker flatbreads - the ones with spelt flour instead of wheat - and I don't much care for them. In my opinion these are the best.

review/summary: Dr. Kracker - YUM!
review/text: These crackers are fantastic in flavor and crunchiness!  They are nutritiously healthy and low in sodium.  My grandson and my sister love them too.  I have them on auto-delivery monthly from Amazon. Dr. Kracker also makes a variety of other flavors. The only problem I have is that Amazon has increased the price gradually from when I first started ordering them in September 2010 at $14.89 ($2.48 per box) for a case of 6 boxes, to $25.73 in March 2011 ($4.29 per box).  That is a price increase of $10.84 (or 72%) for the same case of 6 boxes of crackers.  I think that is an outrageous price increase!  Amazon has made them very expensive but I do like the convenience of having them delivered to me monthly and I always use up the six boxes before the next delivery.  If I weren't an elderly person that uses a wheelchair to shop, I would instead buy them at Whole Foods, where they cost less than this.

I supplement with high quality can food, organic free range chicken, healthy powder and salmon oil. My boys are healthy; their coats are amazing. Highly recommend but with supplements--see above.

review/text: Newman products have been used in our home for years. After researching Newman's Adult Dog food I felt confident in giving the food to our two cocapoo's. They love it! One of them wolfs it down in 4 seconds! Really, I timed it.<br />With so many companies recalling dog foods,I felt the Newman company being organic would be more reliable. Keeps me from worrying so much as I pour that bowl of food for them.

review/text: We have had trouble in finding dog food for one of our small dogs who obviously has a very sensitive stomach.  We have tried several kinds of dog food for her and Newman's Own Organic seems to be agreeing with her. So we will continue purchasing this product through Amazon as long as it does.

review/summary: My Dog Loves This Food!!
review/text: I was using Organix for a while, and was happy with the ingredients, and my dog seemed to enjoy it. Then I saw all the great reviews for Newman's Own Organic Dog Food, along with the great price, and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />They say that it takes a dog a while to get used to a new food, but I have to tell you: from the first day I gave him the Newman's Own, he REFUSED to eat the Organix anymore, he loved the Newman's Own so much - even though he'd eaten the Organix for years! I even tried mixing the bit of Organix I had left in with the Newman's Own. But he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowl.<br /><br />So, I don't know what it is, but my dog sure seems to love this food! He's eating more now and he's very healthy.<br /><br />Again, I had no complaints about the Organix. I think it's probably a good dog food. But my dog sure prefers the Newman's Own!!

review/summary: My picky dog LOVES this stuff!
review/text: I have a 11 yr old Pomimo (1/2 Pomeranian, 1/2 American Eskimo) who seems to only like human food. Although I'd love to give him human food all the time, I know it's not good for his digestive system, and it doesn't have the proper nutrients required for a dog, especially at his current age. Upon trying various brands including Blue and Call of the Wild, I couldn't justify the price in comparison to how little my dog liked the taste. After reading some positive reviews here on Amazon for Newman's, I decided to give it a go. Surprisingly, my dog started eating the food immediately after I poured some into his dish. He never does that with other dry dog food, and usually waits to eat after I've given him a nibble of everything that I eat during the day. What makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality. Yes, I understand that organic and quality US-made food are naturally more expensive, however some of the brands charge double of Newman's and provide only half the taste. As humans, we're usually sold by the nutritious & wholesome advertisements when buying dog food, however I think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also. Newman's seems to be the ticket for both nutrition and taste. Will be buying Newman's as a regular!

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: We have been feeding our dog Newman's Own since she was very young.  She was a finiky eater and I was a determined owner who insisted on organic food.  Both of our needs were fulfilled when we found this great product.  It's the only dog food that she has eaten and she is going to be 9 years old next month.  The only reason she ever has gone to the vet is for her shots.  I highly recommend this food....I am SOOO glad amazon carries it now because we had to drive quite a distance to buy it before at a organic pet shop.....

review/text: I switched my dog to this food and watching him truly enjoy eating and the taste of his food is worth anything.  He has eaten Precise foundation formula for the almost two years since I adopted him.  He often goes off his food and/or vomits from time to time.  I've tried switching him to Wellness and Blue Buffalo with no positive results.  I can't tell you the immediate difference in him from the first time he ate the Newman's...and he looks forward to every meal, doesn't beg for other stuff because he is satisfied, and he seems to have more energy.  He is a 110-lb Great Pyrenees and finally very happy with his food.

review/text: We switched to this brand because one of our dog's eyes always teared, and someone said it could be from a corn allergy.  This is one of only a few brands that is corn free and it cured the teary eye problem quickly.  BLUE brand does not contain corn, but they include garlic in their blend which can cause kidney problems in dogs over time according the veteriniarian.  It smells more natural than Purina One which I had been feeding them and they seem to like it better.  I like that the sales from the food go to charity too.  A good product.

review/text: My dogs love this food! No allergies, more energy and nicer coats. My big dogs skin doesn't seem nearly as irritated and I am assuming with a little more use his skin will be normal again. We like it m2 ofore than any other I have seen. My only problem is that I have 2 dogs one huge one and 12.5lbs hardly make it a month. We really could use bigger bags or a qty discount. Plus I cannot find this in any stores so when I ran out I had to by a substitute...<br />UPDATE: My second shipment did not arrive at all. i have been trying to contact buyer but I cannot figure it out... Had to go back to the old food at least I realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have.. :{

They have been eating Newman's advanced dog formula for active or senior dogs for 18 months now and have not tired of it. Their skin and mobility has improved and they love it. I buy it by subscription so we never have to worry about running out and it is the cheaper way to purchase. My local stores only sell small bags which is an expensive way to buy.

review/text: I buy Newmans Own adult dog food for my two chihuahuas.  I've always fed them natural, human-grade dog food, even though most brands can be a bit pricey.  Like most pet parents, I try to do the best I can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right.  Most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are disturbing.  Newmans Own is more affordable, and I feel good about the company's ethics and practices so it was worth a try.<br /><br />My dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other brand.  They gobble it up! I now have it on subscription so we don't run out.

review/summary: Dogs Love It
review/text: I read all the reviews before buying this food and overall I was impressed with the product myself.  The dogs like it, they have no ill effects as 1 reviewer alleged (looking at her other reviews I think hers should be tossed by Amazon) and I can get it for even less on a subscription with Prime which means 2 Day No Cost shipping.  Whats not to love?  I do mix this with some Prescription Diet J/D since I have one "older' dog and 1 with some allergies and the combo seems to help.  Bottom Line:  It is a good product and after doing a ton of reading (I don't buy my animals cheap food or ANYTHING that I think comes from China) I think it does everything it claims.

review/text: This is a great product. Very comforting for owners that it is all natural (and mostly organic) with no by products and preservatives.<br /><br />We gave our dog (a 7 year old lab mix) PetPromise before. After the transition it took a couple of days for her to get used to it, but once she did she loves it. My dog is quite picky about her food and she likes "junk food" better rather than wholesome food and treats (of course!). She is very used to Newman's own now and it gives her very good bowl movement. Always a plus!
