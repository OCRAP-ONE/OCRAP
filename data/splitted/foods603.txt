review/summary: Magical
review/text: A slightly aggressive approach gives way to a fullness that is unmatched by the other so-called extra bold varieties. The finish is crisp, clean, and ultimately satisfying.  After several cups, one begins to contemplate that there might be an even darker, more fulfilling blend out there somewhere, perhaps being plucked from deep within a jungle or rain forest, or the side of a volcano.  Perchance there is, but until that is discovered, I must continue to let the magic wash across my taste buds, and deal with the sadness that follows the completion of a cup, knowing that the next cup has yet to be poured.<br /><br />Salut.

review/text: We have had our Keurig for over a year.<br />When it arrived, we let out a cheer.<br />So convenient, so quick, one might not think twice<br />But the waste with the packaging isn't so nice.<br />Green mountain coffee is certainly fine<br />It's the one we usually buy all the time.<br />The price through Amazon was reasonable for sure<br />And in no time at all it arrived at our door.<br />My husband goes with the kcups, but I use the insert<br />And make my own coffee and feel smug and superior.

review/summary: Green mountain coffee extra bold ,breakfast blend
review/text: I don!t have a Keurig coffee myself but i buy Green mountain blends for my daughter in-law and a niece. We all are very satisfied with it. It!s a great cup of coffee. Not too strong, not too weak and the price is right especially when they are on sale.I am very happy with my purchases from AMAZON. Not only coffee, but other items as well.<br />Books, a very large selection, something for everyone. I will only buy the items that come directly from Amazon.<br />The packaging is flawless,the shipping is always on time or earlier. Amazon is a good company to purchase from,I place my trust in them.<br />  Kay Raccuia

review/summary: Arrived as described
review/text: I ordered these K-Cups with points from my credit card.  They arrived as described, but without much packaging - - they were just sitting loose in the box, which works for me.<br /><br />The coffee is what I expected after trying a cup from a co-worker.  It's a fairly dark roast, but not as bold as the Newman's Own roast.  I like it for my breakfast coffee.<br /><br />I don't have anything negative to say, although I'm not sure the K-Cup route in general is the way to go for me because of the cost.  I purchased 50 cups just so the cost would be somewhat reasonable.<br /><br />I think you can get a good single cup in other ways, by using something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B194FY">Cilio Porcelain No. 4 Coffee Filter Holder</a>.  I haven't tried this yet, although I saw one at World Market for $7.  You can heat up your water with a water kettle like this one: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBV0IM">Bodum Bistro 17-Ounce Mini Cordless Electric Water Kettle, Black</a>.<br /><br />The convenience of the K-Cups is awesome, but I think I'd like the flexibility and cost savings of a different way.

review/summary: Nice Cup That's a Little Stronger - But Not Too Strong
review/text: If you're looking for what I consider a true "bold" cup of coffee, I think you are going to be disappointed and may want to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emerils Gourmet Coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, but this one does just fine for me with no bitter aftertaste.  I enjoy this one more so than most breakfast blends, and if you like this kind of coffee you might, too.<br /><br />To put it in perspective, I seem to alternate between the bold and what I consider a "regular" cup of coffee with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emerils Gourmet Coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LSM98O">Newman's Special Blend Extra Bold (24 K-cups) Keurig</a>, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)]], and (believe it or not) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>.  Divergent, yes, but alternating between different levels of taste depending upon the time of day (or attitude, I guess).<br /><br />Bottom line is if you enjoy any of the other brands I mention above, give this one a try - I don't think you will be disappointed.

review/summary: OK - BUT NOT A WINNER IN ROBUST FLAVOR
review/text: The "experts" say that the k-cup method of making coffee is wonderful for its ease and quickness and makes a very nice brew for those that like favored and/or medium roast coffee, but is not capable of making a robust cup for those that like their brew powerful!! I would have to agree!! I have tried just about every dark roast, french roast, italian roast coffee sold by Amazon and the only one that comes close to robust, in my opinion, is Coffee People's "Wake-Up Call". "Dark Magic" has a sweetness to it, which is not to my taste. Overall, OK, but not a winner in robust flavor!!

review/text: Purchased 3, 24-count boxes of Dark Magic based on the reviews; in my search for a palatable replacement for Starbucks Verona.  ....Yuck!<br /><br />Quick background... bought a Tassimo a year ago in hopes of discovering that near-perfect cup of coffee.  Soon after the purchase, finding that Perfection in "Starbucks Verona".  Wonderfully Bold and Strong, but oh-so-smooth!<br /><br />Three months ago, I bought a 3-month supply of Starbucks Verona (not cheap), and then a week ago... to my dismay!!!  I find that Tassimo (Kraft) and Starbucks have parted ways... like a couple of Hot-Tempered, Irresponsible Children... with absolutely no regard to their Loyal Customers... dissolve their relationship and quit shipping the "Starbucks Verona" ...... AAAAAAARRRRRGGGHHH !!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Back to this Dark Magic crap.... Strong... but very acidic, bitter and this very unfavorable "flavor' sticks with you in the form of a lingering aftertaste!<br /><br />Those of you who thought that this was actually a "good coffee"... you really need to... well, find some good coffee to make a comparison!<br /><br />I mean... who samples and then actually approves this stuff for production????

review/summary: Hits the Spot in the Morning
review/text: My Doctor only allows me two cups of caffeinated coffee per day, and if that is all I'm going to get, then by George this is the brand and the roast I'm going to be drinking!<br /><br />Rich, full bodied and aromatic. A hint in the aroma of spices, deep dark color, a taste that will perk you up and get you ready for the day.  There is  no bitterness, and this Dark Magic makes an excellent iced coffee as well as a superb hot coffee.<br />I also drink this later on in the day, (I drink more cups than I would like to admit in public) decaffeinated and it shares the same attributes as the fully caffeinated one.<br /><br />As far as expense goes---well yes it is more expensive than a store brand, but it truly is worth it. Not everyone shares my addiction so it won't be as costly for you as it is for me, and I think it works out to be about 66 cents a cup (without additives of sugar, creamer etc.) a far cry from anything you can get from any coffee shop, or drive thru.

This selection is a little stronger but it tastes like a bit more roasting is all that separates the two. If you use this for a travel cup (8oz or more), it will not be as flavourful. I found that this flavour "grows" on you and a work colleague of mine absolutely loves this one.

review/summary: Not the same quality!
review/text: I compared the 18 cup Dark Magic (from Target) to the 50 cup Dark Magic(from Amazon), since the labeling and k-cup is markedly different.  The coffee did not taste as rich, so I became more curious.<br /><br />I opened the k-cups to find the 50 cup filters have a visible cross hatch pattern, as compared to a dense firm paper style.  I used a microscope to see the difference in density, as well.  The weave of the fibers of the 50 pack is not as closely bound.<br /><br />The coffee granules are finer in the 18 cup, giving the coffee a different texture on the fingers.  The 50 pack ground coffee appeared 50%-100% larger under the microscope.<br /><br />I hope that Keurig can shed some light on my findings!  I have photos I can submit.  I notice amazon is out of stock, currently.  Perhaps, Keurig is looking into the matter.

review/summary: Disappointed that they changed the product
review/text: I have been buying Green Mountain Dark Magic for a long time....not only did my recent shipment have different packing inside, but the coffee too has changed, and not for the better....it is much weaker, and I am sorely dissapointed....I even emailed Green Mountain regarding this change, and they did not even have the courtesy to respond! I will not be buying Green Mountain anymore.

review/summary: Not the same quality
review/text: I just received the 50 count frustration free package of Dark Magic K-cups this am and I am extremely disappointed.  I usually purchase this at Publix, Walmart, or Target in the smaller boxes.  I had the first cup and it tasted stale, so I thought I would give another one a try and same taste.  I would not recommend this product to a true lover of Dark Magic; the coffee is inferior, disappointing, and nonreturnable.

review/summary: Nice bold taste
review/text: My partner was getting distressed with the lack of taste in her K-cup coffee (my bad, since I'm the one who buys the coffee), and she requested something with a bolder taste. So, I tried this. We have used Green Mountain Coffee before, but not this particular product.<br /><br />Bottom line. My partner really enjoys this. The taste meets her expectations. Indeed, although I am supposed to keep my intake of caffeine fairly low, I have also tried this on occasion--and I, too, am satisfied.<br /><br />So, if you want a bolder flavor, this is worth considering.

review/summary: Dark and lovely
review/text: This is a robust, aromatic and satisfying blend with balanced acidity and no bitterness.  It's a complex roast that's reminiscent of espresso with a subtly sweet taste, I love it.  I have had a difficult time finding truly strong, yet flavorful coffee for my Keurig brewer--Timothy's coffees are too acidic and Van Houtte blends lacked complexity--and  I've finally found several extra bold flavors from Green Mountain roasts that really deliver that morning one-two punch.  For comparison, my other favorites are the Espresso blend (sadly now discontinued) and Double Black Diamond (a bit more of a smoky flavor).  And for the most potent flavor profile, the Barista Prima Italian Roast is magnifico!

review/text: Wow, I am thrilled with this coffee. I received a sample of Barista Prima K-cups and fell in love--tasted like rich, dark coffee you'd get in a coffeehouse. I went onto Amazon to purchase a box and discovered they were at least $1 per cup! I couldn't justify spending $1 per k-cup when I usually drink several cups of coffee each morning. I did a search for extra dark coffee and found these for significantly less.  This coffee is perfect.  Rich, dark, flavorful, not at all bitter.  Smooth and delicious.  If you like dark roasts (French, Italian, etc) and have a k-cup machine, this is the coffee for you.

review/text: I just recently got my first Keurig machine (I say first because I love it, and plan to get the bigger pro model eventually), and a couple of sampler boxes. This was the best of the flavors I sampled, and that says alot because I loved most of them. I am a lifelong espresso drinker (Cubans start giving their kids sips at like age 3) so I like a strong coffee. This one is definitely that. It doesn't, however, suffer from the bitter aftertaste or "burnt" flavor of many bold blends. Best of all, with the Keurig machines you get the same flavor EVERY time.

review/text: I've bee subscribing to this coffee for months now and have had multiple shipments, all quality until this last shipment.  I opened the new box today, made a cup, and wondered why it was so watery. Made a second thinking it was a fluke. It was not.  Seems now 3 kcups into the box, the whole box is full of kcups with about half the coffee in them there should be.  Instead of it being strong and bold like dark magic is supposed to be (I've drank this coffee daily for two years now so I should know)... It's weak and watery even on making a smaller cup of it.  Amazon won't let me return it.  I'm a dedicated amazon customer and use subscribe and save for many items.  If they won't treat me like a dedicated customer I might be stopping my membership.  Hoping they'll make it right.

Have pretty much decided that the 50 count or 100 count "value" packs offer the best price available. Others swear by CostCo so it does help to shop around but the 50 cent K-Cup is still elusive. Extra Bold K-Cups as a whole seem to have better flavor than the regular variety.

These things actually taste like decent coffee and aren't watery or acidic. Thanks green mountain for an awesome product and for curing my morning zombie woes! Oh and although a small gesture, I noticed that they shipped me 51 k-cups, thanks for the 1 extra!

review/summary: Good as Dunkin's Coffee
review/text: I needed to change up from the coffee that I was drinking due to it being so much money. I tried a breakfast blend but it was so weak I gave the rest away. Decided to give this a try and so glad I did. The taste is right up there with my old favorite Dunkin Donuts coffee and the cost is much lower. I use fat-free half and half and splenda so it does make it alittle weaker, so thats perfect for my taste buds.

review/text: CatSure....This is a miracle product...I have almost lost my senior cat (18yrs) twice in the last 3 months and this product brings her back...she has end stage feline chronic renal failure.  This product has all the right amino acids and the potassium chloride and potassium iodide that she needs right now.  She loves it - it is a life saver....I have made a decision to give her the recommended daily amount from here on out and not stop when she gets better as I feel this is how we once again got into a crisis stage of her illness.

We freeze the whole can in Ice cube trays and give her one a day. She loves it. She seemed to come alive again. Shaking it in the can dosen't mix it well. We use a can opener and pour a bit out and use a small electric mixer to mix it (A lot of it settles on the bottom)  But she loves it.

review/summary: Great for elderly cats; be careful if your cat has IBD or allergies
review/text: My cat is, like those of the other reviewers, quite elderly at nearly 16 years old. In addition, for his whole life he has had what we thought was IBD. Diagnosed at the age of 2. A couple of years ago I changed vets and found out, to my surprise, that it wasn't so much an inherently bad case of IBD but a mild case of IBD that has been made worse by an allergy to grains!<br /><br />We got him stabilized and at a better weight than he's been at in years by switching to Acana food, but he still has bouts of irritation that make him vomit and lose weight rapidly when he can't and won't eat. It's really quite hard to watch since otherwise, he is a very strong and happy cat.<br /><br />Anyway, he had a particularly bad bout last year and we used KMR, Kitten Milk Replacer, to stimulate his appetite and get him some moisture and nutrition while he recovered. But that really isn't for a senior cat so I ordered this for the next bout.<br /><br />Sure enough, he started a small bout of it again a couple of months ago when he got hold of a pine needle someone dragged in on their shoe and I immediately began giving him this to help him hold it off.<br /><br />He loves this stuff and would drink it by the gallon if I let him. And it certainly worked to keep the calories up. But I noticed that after giving him this for a couple of days, approximately 2/3 of a can worth, he seemed to increase in nausea right after drinking it in any high quantity. I cut back and diluted it and he proceeded to heal as he did before using the KMR. There are no grains listed on the ingredients nor anything that I can think of that would act like a grain, but something in there doesn't agree with a sensitive tummy. It may simply be that it is too rich straight from the can for some kitties.<br /><br />If you have a cat with IBD, and I know there are a lot of them out there, I would highly recommend this, but I would suggest trying it diluted with water. It is an excellent supplement with all the right nutrients and is clearly very palatable to the cat sense of taste.<br /><br />It is a bit pricey and each can only lasts 3 days when open, but my vet suggested I freeze it in ice cubes in order to extend the life. I can't vouch for what that might do to the nutritional content. I did try that with some CatSure diluted 50/50 with water and once it was melted, my cat seemed to enjoy it just fine so I don't think the taste is changed negatively by it.<br /><br />I also recommend this as a very nice treat to the elderly kitty. They tend to absorb less nutrients and calories with age and this is a great way to make them happy and improve their physical lives.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: Bought this for our 15-yr old cat w/ mild chronic renal failure and poor appetite.  It does the trick.  It gets more liquid into her.  The reason we stopped buying this is b/c our kitty likes KMR kitten milk better, and that has a lot more fat than CatSure.  Since our kitty needs to gain weight, it's a better product for us.  If your senior cat is already fat, then don't use KMR--stick to CatSure.  Also, your cat may or may not drink CatSure.  Of our 4 cats, 1 is CRAZY for it, 1 thinks it's just OK, and 2 won't touch it.  So, probably a 50:50 chance your cat will drink this?  FYI, it helps to pour this into ice cube trays and melt 1 or 2 cubes at a time.  Otherwise, your cat may not be able to drink the whole can in the 3 days or so it's still good.  It's too spendy to waste.  Overall, CatSure is pretty good, and may benefit your cat.  Good luck!

review/summary: Great Product for Older Cats
review/text: We had been giving our older cat Kitten Milk for extra nutrients, when the PetsMart lady suggested CatSure for Senior Cats! (It is cheaper on Amazon, so we got it here.) While he took some time to get used to as preferred the Kitten Milk, he now asks for it 2-3 times a day! Plus the product and his meds have taken him from nearly comatose to chasing lizards again! He is 16 years old! To get him to switch we first added CatSure to the Kitten Milk, increasing the amount of CatSure each day until it was all that product. We highly recommend it.

review/text: Our 9 year old cat was wasting away. After 18 months, going from 8lbs to less than 4lbs, multiple trips to different vets, diet changes, blood tests, urine samples, fecal samples... they couldn't find out what was wrong. She had gotten to the point where she could barely jump up onto a chair. I was sure she would be dead within weeks.<br />My wife even asked one of the vets if there was something like Ensure for Cats. His answer? "Not that I am aware of." Then we found CatSure. 3 weeks later, she's gaining weight again, back to her usual energy, etc. We are convinced that CatSure has saved her life.

review/text: this is the worst tea ever.  you definitely get what you pay for, and actually far less.  the flowers used here are far inferior to drinkable rose flowers.  i highly advise against purchasing this item if you want to use it for tea.  even the smell is very pungent and unappetizing, so i would not use this for any type of herbal infusions.  unfortunately, because it is a grocery item, i cannot return it.  the first time i tried rose tea was in seoul, and it was so delicious.  i cannot even imagine that the buds here come from the same species of flower.
