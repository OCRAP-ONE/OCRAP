review/summary: Yum
review/text: These are excellent tasting, especially when fresh.  They are chewy chocolate caramels with a dark chocolate coating that matches perfectly with the chocolate caramel inside (not too dark tasting for me).  They are made in Germany.<br /><br />These individual "candy bar" size of Riesens are difficult to find in stores in my area, so I ordered from Amazon.  This product provides a sort of portion control for me, since there are 5 caramels in each package - when I buy a larger bag of individually wrapped Riesens, I tend to eat the whole bag or at least, too much of it.  With this "candy bar" size, I am limited to 5 Riesens (or suffer my self-imposed guilt for eating multiple packages).  I also like that it is less packaging, since the 5 Riesens are not individually wrapped, also making them easier to eat.<br /><br />One drawback of this packaging, however, may be that the caramels do not stay as fresh - they were a tiny bit hard at the edges, compared to bags of super soft and chewy individually foil-wrapped Riesens.

review/text: These peppercorns are exactly as advertised: sweet and fruity with a  tangy pepper overtone. I am still experimenting with which pepper to use with what dish, but I did try this on a lemon salmon and it was very good.<br /><br />I also want to note that the customer service from the company was excellent. I had a problem that I did not tell them about but I did put it in a review. A customer service representative contacted me and resolved the problem very quickly and at no cost to me. You can't beat that kind of service. I will be using Olive Nation again.

review/summary: Nice addition to my kitchen
review/text: I had never used pink peppercorns before and must admit to my surprise that they are actually a very good addition to my spice rack.<br /><br />These are very mild peppercorns and as described, they do indeed have a sweet, somewhat fruity flavor mixed in with a wonderful peppery taste.  Let's face it, they also look pretty cool.<br /><br />I have been using them on different fish dishes (I use it as a rub) with quite a lot of success.  I also used them with several other spices and herbs in a bottle of olive oil for salads.  They added much to the flavor of my mix.  Do take warning though, you use these rather sparingly as the flavor can overwhelm other spices you may be using.<br /><br />This is not a spice that I use everyday, but it is one that I am glad I added to my cooking arsenal.  The same old spices dish after dish gets a bit old and it is nice to be able to dazzle things up a bit from time to time.<br /><br />I like this product.

review/summary: Great Product - New Experience
review/text: I like these peppers in everything I've tried them in: salads, stews, and soups. I've never bought pink in bulk before and am still experimenting to find their place in my kitchen. (Thus, I cannot compare them to others' of the same type.) So far, I have found that pink peppers can be used anywhere greens can be. Their taste is slightly lite with a little snap and a great aroma. I'm guessing that this first-time purchase will be repeated. However, one pound of peppercorns will last a long time. The price from the single vendor, JR Mushrooms, seems very good. I'm guessing (due to lack of experience with the pink) that this purchase was a good bargain.

review/summary: Go Go Goji!
review/text: I took this one to work with me today and it just about saved my life. It gave me the much-needed energy to deal with with busiest doctor in our practice. It was light and sweet and painfully refreshing. I had some while it was hot, but by the time I was able to find time for finish my thermos-full, it was cold. Even better! My thermos is vaccum-sealed, so I carefully shook it to mix it up again and downed the rest...oh yes. This will definitely be an amazing addition to my summer smoothies. Never mind that it snowed today. Anyway, the berryness of this was just right, not overly sweet or fake, just amazingly delicious. I'm only familiar with goji berries in tea, but this is the best goji flavored tea I've ever had. To be honest, I kept taking sips and being surprised by how good it was. I have the memory span of a goldfish, so it was like I given a gift of amazing tea every time I took a sip. If you're a berry fan who isn't really into strong greens, this might be the tea to get you into matcha. It wasn't overwhelmingly bitter like some matchas can be, it was just a smooth, tasty sip for a long workshift.<br /><br />I am very impressed with their matcha, I have to say. My wife recently bought me a matcha whisk (so much easier!), but I was making it with a regular whisk in a cereal bowl and I have yet to encounter a clump. Like someone else said about their matchas, it's not flavoring added to cover an inferior product.

Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are "meaty" and sweet.

review/summary: Not the same as the canned version
review/text: I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond "Roasted Almonds - Honey" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very "off" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and "other natural flavors", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not "slivered" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned "Honey Roasted Almonds" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased.

review/summary: Too Much Sugar!
review/text: This is basically candy masquerading as a "healthy" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.

review/summary: Like Snickerdoodle cookies!
review/text: I love these almonds!!  They taste just like a snickerdoodle cookie, but make for a much healthier snack!  One of my favorites of the Blue Diamond Oven Roasted varieties.  Buying them in a 6-pack is more cost-effective for me, especially now that I can't find them in my grocery store. I wish they came in the large resealable bag like some of the other flavors, but for now I'll stick with the 6 container pack.

review/summary: Delicious and healthy treat!
review/text: I wouldn't call these almonds sweet, but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat.  The taste and texture of almonds doesn't particularly appeal to me, but they're such a healthy snack that I'm glad to find this delicious option.  Also, the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car, or use as stocking stuffers like I plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends!

review/summary: Should almost be labelled a "BOLD" flavor
review/text: Butter Toffee is not a flavor I thought I would like - for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor. However, I became hooked at first bite. This flavor is much sweeter than the Honey Roasted. It certainly becomes my top "dessert almonds" when in need of that sweet replacement.<br /><br />Absolutely great for those on a low-carb or Keto diet - only 6 Net Carbs per serving. The bold, sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Best Almonds Hands Down
review/text: After trying every kind of almond out there over the years, I will take these flavorful Blue Diamond almonds any day.  They are fresh, salted just right and not greasy/oily.  I try to eat a handful a day, usually as a mid-afternoon snack for optimum health benefits. The handy container is easy to use and even indicates portion size.  Unfortunately, this type of almonds is getting more and more difficult to find in my local stores, so I was happy to be able to order a 6-pack from Amazon to have in my pantry.

review/summary: Yummy in my Tummy :)
review/text: I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

review/text: I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

Almonds roasted only with sea salt are soooo good. Blue Diamond makes the best tasting and these are hard to find in stores.  I love the 1 lb bag of these, but can't seem to find them. Buying these in bulk was the best deal out there and I will have to purchase again.  Thanks, Blue Diamond for a superior nut!

review/text: So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

review/summary: NOT as good as the ones in the tins
review/text: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that "oven roasted" + "honey" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

review/text: I purchased the 4 oz size, and it arrived with a few sample packs of other salts as well. This stuff tastes very good, and is hot, although in my opinion, it wont kill you like other ghost pepper oriented products might. I've been using it on eggs and also threw some in with my beer when making brats the other day. Both have been excellent uses. I would say use it sparingly, especially if you are sensitive to heat, but the flavor is good and the extra kick is nice. A definite winner IMO.

review/summary: Very impressed
review/text: I ordered a one pound package for my Dad this Christmas, so I can't really comment on the flavor yet, though my Dad has liked pepper flavored salt before.  However, I was very impressed with the speed with which The Spice Labe sent it.  I was also expecting to get a sigle large box or bag, like you'd see on a store shelf.  Instead, the salt came in eight 2oz. vacuum sealed, durable plastic bags, so I know that the salt will maintain its freshness no matter how long it takes for my Dad to get through it.  Very nice.  Also, they included several differnt little sample packets so I could try some of their different flavors of salt without having to order tons of it.  My package included a sampler of himalayan sea salt (larger chunks), french grey salt, himalayan salt (with crystals sized like table salt, hickory smoke salt, and haba&ntilde;ero salt.  Very cool.  I will be getting more stuff from them.<br /><br />ADDENDUM 12/26:  About flavor:  my Dad says this salt tastes better than other ghost pepper salt he's tried.  He attributes it to both a better product and better packaging (see my above comments).

review/summary: Has been great for my dog.
review/text: I see that someone has copy-pasted the same negative review for multiple Bil-Jac products so I decided to provide a counterpoint. I realize that the overwhelming number of dog food choices requires people to have criteria to quickly separate "good" and "bad" dog foods. Nevertheless, critical thinking is important and I don't think most of the reviews available for Bil-Jac products are particularly well thought-out. Meanwhile, a lot of premium pet food brands (even ones I like) are increasingly using tricky ingredient labeling to hide shortcuts, and this goes largely unnoticed.<br /><br />I am not affiliated with Bil-Jac or any pet food company and, for years before I began to really look at pet foods critically, would never have used or recommended it. The main issues people have with Bil-Jac are that it contains corn and chicken byproducts. Both of those are common in many low-quality pet foods so this is understandable, but Bil-Jac is not a low quality food.<br /><br />Byproducts are almost exclusively the domain of low-quality foods, because, generally speaking, they could come from anywhere and contain almost anything. They are used because they are cheap. Bil-Jac's chicken byproducts are specifically identified as organs, which are nutritious and which your dog would almost undoubtedly choose to eat even if you wouldn't.<br /><br />Corn used as empty filler, or especially corn gluten meal used to inflate a food's protein level, are bad. Whole corn meal used to make kibble stick together -- as with rice, oatmeal, potatoes, peas, or any other starch -- is not necessarily bad.<br /><br />Conversely, if you read enough pet food labels you will be surprised at how many premium pet foods use multiple "better" starches in combination so that meat bubbles up the ingredient list. If you see meat followed by "rice, barley, oatmeal," "whole brown rice, rice bran, rice flour," or "peas, pea protein, pea fiber," you should be very skeptical of the amount of meat in the food. This practice is disturbingly widespread. Bil-Jac is one of very few brands that discloses the amount of meat used in most formulas, and it is a lot more than most dog foods.<br /><br />The reason I tried Bil-Jac to begin with is that the manufacturing process is unique and makes it very easily digestible while still containing a large quantity of meat. The sensitive systems formulas in virtually every premium brand achieve their digestibility at least in part by reducing the amount of meat in the product to make it more bland.<br /><br />My aim here is not to disparage any particular brand of food but to encourage critical thinking when evaluating pet foods. Guidelines are useful but not universal.

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!

review/summary: Weak Hot Chocolate With A Fancy Name
review/text: Very disappointed in General Foods International Coffees! I've purchased their retail tins previously and thought these bags were that same product in bulk...NOT EVEN CLOSE! I'm still waiting for the French Vanilla taste and aroma. At best this is a very weak hot chocolate AKA flavored hot water :( So when I greedily purchased TWO BATCHES on the cheap to enjoy throughout the rest of the year, I'm the one that got the bad deal. The product will be used as a coffee creamer, hot chocolate enhancer, and a donation to the local food pantry.<br /><br />BE forewarned and DO NOT fall for the "Cappuccino" label OR the General Foods International Coffees reputation. I CANNOT recommend this product even at rock bottom prices of 2 bucks a bag.<br /><br />UPDATE: This item is not labeled for retail sale<br />DIRECTIONS: Recommended gram throw for for vending or automatic dispensers is 3 to5 grams of cappucino mix per 1 fluid ounce of water, depending upon desired flavor strength...French Vanilla Creme

review/summary: Great new product for my family
review/text: We try not to drink beverages loaded with high fructose corn syrup, but is it tough to find them.  This is the perfect choice for my family to stay hydrated and healthy.  My kids love it, and so do we.  We keep a case in our fridge at all times, and the smaller size is perfect when we're on the go.

review/summary: Too good! I can get into trouble with these
review/text: So often the sugar-free version of a favorite candy classic is disappointing. Not these sugar-free peach rings! They're tangy but sweet and refreshing -- and, I'm sorry to say (in my case, at least), addictive. One of the nice surprises is finding that instead of being coated with flecks of too-acidic sugar or sugar substitute, they're coated with flecks of something that doesn't sting the tongue or distress the palate with too sour a sensation. The gummi texture's just right and the flavor's irresistable. Try some. If you like traditional peach rings, I think you'll be pleased.

review/summary: These are sugar free??
review/text: By taste alone, you would never think that these are sugar free because they taste like the real thing, although these have a little tart sprinkle to them. If I was rating these on taste alone, they deserve 5 stars however when I received my package, I did not like the fact that there were no labels on ingredients or nutritional facts. I did however manage to find the information on their website sweetgourmet.com<br /><br />Ingredients: corn syrup, sugar, gelatin, citric acid, sorbitol, natural & artificial flavors, fd&c yellow 5, blue 1, yellow 6, red 40, vegetable oil(Coconut origin), carnuaba wax (used for anti-sticking).<br /><br />I don't know what exactly carnuaba wax is but I don't like the sound of ingesting wax, even if it is meant for anti-sticking... In addition, I wonder about the nutritional facts. This is sugar-free but why is sugar & corn syrup listed and why is there 0g of sugar but no sugar alcohol listed when sorbitol is in fact a type of sugar alcohol? There are some conflicting informations here.<br /><br />I know for a fact that these contain sugar alcohol b/c a couple of hours after eating these, I had a gassy cramping feeling in my stomach. This is a common side effect. Sugar alcohol can cause abdominal discomfort and they also have a laxative effect. Because of my discomfort, I have to drop the rating to 3 stars.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving Size 3 pieces (20g)<br />Calories  50  Cal from fat  0<br />Total Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium  5mg<br />Total Carbohydrate 15g<br />Dietary Fiber  0g<br />Sugar 0g<br />Protein 1g<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />But hey if you don't care about the ingredients used or its nutritional facts, then go ahead and buy these to enjoy. From their website, these are currently listed for $4.99 but it costs $13.88 to ship it to you!

review/summary: Beware
review/text: They taste fine but definetly not peach. They're a bit softer than Haribos, which I prefer. The sweetner used causes a laxative effect, fast acting I might add. It would be different for everybody but for me I can safely eat 7 or 8 rings. If you exceed the amount your body can tolerate you better plan on staying very, very near the bathroom for an hour or two. If you need a laxative these work well but you'll be sorry if you eat too many. NOT FOR CHILDREN!

review/summary: Oh My
review/text: I have loved peach gummy candies since I first found them.  Now that I am older and watch what I eat, carbs, sugar, and so forth, Albanese peach rings are great. They are flavorful, really do taste like peaches, have no after taste, and even have that sugary coating that the original peach candies have. Give them a try.  They are worth it.

review/text: Very, Very good! Almost too good...have to be careful not to eat too many. Only complaint, and reason for 4 stars instead of 5...no nutritional label. Need that information for dieters and diabetics. Have bought this product from another source, in a smaller quantity, so got nutritional information from there for my personal use.

review/summary: Rich and Delectable
review/text: I love this brand since discovering it 6-7 years ago, and I have hooked my father on this cranberries & almond bar, and raspberry bar. A little goes a long way, and the slightly tart-sweet cranberries and crunchy almonds bring out the rich dark chocolate flavor, and are a delicious complement. This brand is also amazingly among the lowest priced for "natural" chocolate.  A warning: if you are not used to dark chocolate, then I suggest maybe starting with an Endangered Species milk chocolate flavor first, and working your way up (too bad they don't still make the Panda bar, a blend of dark and white chocolate!). It may even be better for some novices to begin with a different brand of dark chocolate with 55-60% cocoa content, like Godiva or Chocolove, and then gradually work their way up (since to my knowledge E. Species doesn't have any dark chocolate with less than 72% cocoa content).

review/text: A friend in Tampa turned me on to this chocolate, so when I got home to my rural town the only way to get it was through Amazon, at a dozen bars per box - which is no problem!  It's delicious and rich, a little piece of a bar is plenty to satisfy and a bar makes a great gift.  I haven't tried the other variations but love this particular one and will continue to order.

review/summary: Love Endangered Species Chocolate
review/text: My naturopath had recommended Endangered Species chocolate a few years back and now it's pretty much the only chocolate I eat.  It's natural, organic and amazingly good.<br />My only comment on this particular type - with cranberries and almonds is that I wish the cranberry and almond pieces were bigger.  You can hardly tell they are in the bar.
