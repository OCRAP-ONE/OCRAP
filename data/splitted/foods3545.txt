review/text: Green tea is good for you, loaded with antioxidants, boosts your metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda, but I never quite warmed up to the taste.  Until now.  The lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor.  And it is SO great that I can just add a packet to my water bottle and go, without the bother of brewing it.

review/summary: Powdered Green Tea by Stash
review/text: Powdered green tea with lemon & ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags. Simply pour in water bottle, shake and be on your way.<br /><br />Product used to be available in local health food stores but is no longer carried. Much easier and more cost effective when bought in quantity on Amazon.

This is a nice, pleasant beverage. The flavor isn't too strong.  I add a packet of Splenda to make it a bit sweeter.  The powder dissolves easily in cold water.  The flavor is natural not fake.  I was impressed enough with it that I have signed up for auto-delivery.

review/summary: Great product - at last!
review/text: LOVE this!  I dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that I could add to my s/s water bottle (gotta be good to the environment, right?)  The flavor is great, ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all.  I can drink my green tea with or without sweetener.  The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!

review/text: I used to always go to Jamba Juice for the Match green tea shots...after trying this iced green tea powder I was hooked.  This flavor is lightly sweetend and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea.  I don't mind the funny green color...after all it's green tea.

review/summary: Beware, if you have a corn allergy!!
review/text: The first ingredient in this mix, before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin.  If you suffer from a corn allergy, please do not forget to read the label & unwittingly drink this.  I have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product, the tea itself.  I realize this is not a review, let alone a "helpful review", as I did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product. I couldn't review this product, if I wanted too.  I want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea.  I didn't know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews.  I could not give the product more stars, as it contains more maltodextrin, than tea itself.

review/summary: lightly sweetened green iced tea powder
review/text: i have never liked green tea but i knew it was good for me so i have been drinking it for a lot of yrs. i grew up living in the western usa and our neighbors were japanese. they were sweet and gave us tea from japan. my father enjoyed it every morning and added a tablespoon of honey and a little cream to it. he smoked all his life and died at 92. anyway, i found when at times i would quit drinking it i wouldn't feel as good as i did when drinking it. i got tired of boiling the water with the teabags and then getting everything in a container to put into the frig. i really drank a lot of it.  well, i stumbled onto a warehouse to pick up some things i had ordered and noticed this tea. i was immediately interested as you get to drink the whole tea leaf which gives you 10 times more antioxidants. wow, that was good for me so i got a couple cases and when i ran out searched the internet for stash brand. i really love it. i love that it is LIGHTLY SWEETENED, i love that i can just open a packet and throw it into my tumbler, add ice and water and be on my way. it's just right. but more then anything else i love the way it makes me feel. so much more energy and i truly believe it is helping my well being. no getting around about it i don't get sick often for sure. now i haven't tried the other brands and i feel i don't have to because i am so satisfied with this one. the price is also cheaper. i don't think you can go wrong with this choice.  perky

review/text: I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and can't get a refund.

review/summary: Pretty good stuff, with the right sweetener
review/text: This is one of my favorite water add-ins. I think it has a really crisp, clean taste...with a hint of grassy-ness. The tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle, if left standing for more than a few minutes, so I have to shake it up periodically. There are times when I feel like I'm drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower, but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener. It tastes great when I use stevia, but when I use Sweet & Low...I get a bitter-ish grassy taste.

review/summary: Don't bother
review/text: I bought this "flavor" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.<br /><br />If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to "stash" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this.

review/text: When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this.

review/summary: Its cheap, but it has too much added flavoring
review/text: No...  I didn't try it myself and my dog loves eating it, but it smells like it has too much flavoring, seasoning and salt added. Smells like canned spam. Its mostly corn and mystery meats, but it has so much stuff added to make the dog like it that they become quite picky afterwards. This stuff is like human fast food. It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency. After first week when he became accustomed to it, which was more runny.<br /><br />The price is good, but your dog will become more picky with blander foods afterwards.

review/text: I never knew you could by dog food at Amazon until one day I just happened to bounce upon it.  To my amazement it came right when it was promised and no shipping to top that off was a delight.  My dog is happy too because she never has to wait for her meal like in some days she did when I would run out and have to go to the store.  This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.  Boy that was disappointing.  But now I will always order her food this way.  I hope to add the cats food next time.

review/summary: Good food!
review/text: My dog is quite finicky on the food she will eat.  She won't really eat dry food but seems to like her wet food.  This was a very good deal for 24 cans of Pedigree.  Love the fact that I could choose the kind I wanted to buy for her. Would recommended ordering this item and from this company. Item came well packaged for shipping and for storage. Item arrived on time as well.

review/summary: Tempted my 14 year 8 mo old dog to eat!
review/text: I tried some of this on my old guy, an American Staffordshire Terrier that is 14 years, 8 months old. He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )

review/summary: HONEST REVIEW!
review/text: I live in Manhattan and i have a beagle (5yr old) n i ordered this food because the economy is bad and i need cheap afforable dog food. People talk about this food as if its garbage so i did my research by a co worker who used to work for pedigree and online. The food is proccess is nasty! but if has all the vitamins and protien needed for all dogs. I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.

review/summary: Delicious Meaty Dog Food
review/text: Pedigree  smells delicious.  It is an enticing smell, good enough to make humans turn their noses toward it.  A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: This is another one of our favorite Kernel Seasons flavor.  The BBQ and Nacho Cheddar are the other favorites.<br /><br />It's good to mix things up a bit and have different flavors on hand, because you certainly can get sick of eating the same flavor over and over, especially if you eat popcorn almost every night like we do!<br /><br />These six packs at Amazon are the best deals, but you may want to order a single pack of various flavors first to try them out.  Unfortunately, the Ranch and BBQ and several others are usually not sold at grocery stores (although you can get the Nacho and White Cheddar easily at most stores).

review/text: I bought this for popcorn but have tried it on a bunch of different things. It's great, even on veggies. It seems to lose flavor when it gets heated too high, so I advise to use it after food is finished cooking and before serving as opposed to cooking with it. This product has encouraged me to try other flavors, but not sure I want a pack of 6 of anything besides Ranch since Ranch is generally so versatile. I am going to experiment with making ranch dressing with this product, just not exactly sure how yet. Probably buttermilk and whole milk equal parts to start.

review/text: I am soooo glad I found this seasoning for my popcorn. I use a hot air popper(Orville Redenbacher's) which I had just purchased from Amazon, of course. I now have this seasoning on a regular delivery schedule from Amazon because I can use it on so many things...popcorn, salads, hamburgers, vegetables. Hot air popcorn is really quite dry; so, I use Wabash Valley Farms Buttery Popcorn Topping (from Amazon) first, then lots of the Ranch seasoning, and top it off with popcorn salt and thoroughly enjoy finger-lickin-good popcorn. I want to thank the reviewer for the recipe for the most delicious Ranch salad dressing; its better than any prepared one I've tried in the last 50+ years and so simple to make. Got any other great ideas??  God bless.

I make chicken curry with it. First I cook the vegetables(potatoes, celery, carrots, etc.) and add pieces of cooked chicken and the sauce. My husband likes it hotter so he adds SB curry powder, and if you want a thicker consistency you can use corn starch or flour, but be sure to dilute with water first.

review/summary: A Must for New Parents
review/text: As a new dad I was excited to announce the birth of my first born child. To commemorate the event I wished to offer friends and family a traditional cigar. Since I'm not a smoker and few people that I know are smokers I opted for a more politically correct option of bubble gum cigars. I defy anyone to find these anywhere but Amazon or other select online retailers. These are just hard to find, period.<br /><br />When they arrived I was pleased to see that the products matched the listing.<br /><br />Here's a detailed breakdown of these bubble gum cigars:<br /><br />Shipping - Fast!<br />Appearance - Great retro packaging. This package is reminiscent of 1940's-1950's artwork. Great look. The bubble gum cigars had flat sides, perhaps from sitting on a shelf for a while? Each of the cigars was labeled and individually wrapped. Great for giving as gifts.<br />Taste - Look, these cigars aren't going to please many palates. They are adequate to get the point across, but not very enjoyable to chew. The texture and taste are reminiscent of the gum that came in packs of cards back in the 1980s. I'm not sure if sports cards and novelty cards still come with those dry sticks of gum, but these taste to be of a similar recipe. Very Bazooka Joe like, however less flavorful and the flavor it does have is lost very quickly. That said, they aren't made to win taste awards, they are a simple gift for a new dad to express his pride.<br /><br />So, overall these cigars are a great way to commemorate a wonderful life event without being un-PC. I would buy these again if the need arises. I do recommend these to all new dads as a fun handout to friends, family and co-workers.

For the new jar, cheese powder is #4.<br />Oh well, I have lived long enough to see a lot of good things go bad.

review/text: Sooo dissappointed!  We have used this cheesoning for years and absolutely love it.  However, the cheesoning pack we just recieved is very much a golden color as apposed to an orange color that picture shows and that we have always received.  Unfortunately it does not have the cheese taste and is nothing like what we have used for years.

review/summary: Reese Cheesoning
review/text: My order from Amazon.com was for 6 bottles of Reese Cheesoning.  The box seemed to have plenty of padding yet one bottle was broken.  I could not contact anyone about this problem for a replacement. This is the first opportunity I've had to report this problem.  I've used this brand of cheesoning for many years.  I opened one of the bottles and it smells and tastes stale.  I'll put up with that but want a bottle to replace the broken one.

review/summary: good product, shipping tricky
review/text: I love Cheesoning, and turned to Amazon when my grocery store stopped carrying it. I even brought it to work and got a couple of my coworkers hooked. Great on popcorn and veggies (although you do have to be careful about overdoing it - too salty)The problem is that the thin box-board box of six bottles is just put in another Amazon box with no padding, and I've never received one without breakage of at least one bottle. I see another customer had this experience. It's weird, given that every other shipment from Amazon is ridiculously over-packaged.

review/text: I believe these Dental Chews caused my dog to get sick. After eating these (no more than 2 a day) for several weeks, she began to vomit and had to spend 2 nights at the vet on an IV. She came home but got worse and her blood work indicated either pancreatitis and/or liver failure.  We had to put her down. She was only 9 years old and had previously been healthy.

review/text: This is one product that works just as advertised. My 3 year-old Cocker spaniel had terrible breath issues and trying to brush her teeth is just a horrible experience and leaves her traumatized. This product has been a godsend. She absolutely loves these things and will chose them over her regular dog treats every time if given a choice. Her breath now is fine and her plaque appears to be reduced as well. It is much cheaper at Costco, a little over $12, so if you have a membership I strongly advise getting them at your local store.

review/text: These are good for their overall health, teeth and coat. Plus they love them. The best dog treats on the market. If you are near a Costco they are a staple there, always stocked next to the dog food. Cheaper there too however, wherever you get them, whenever you get them ... you just must get them! You will notice a change in your dog's coat first, energy and health later. The BEST.

review/summary: HORRIBLE doesn't begin to describe this product!  Very disappointed!
review/text: The product description says: "Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange."<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful. Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them. I had a "taste test" with my cat and dog, who *love* caviar) and they both turned their noses up at it. NOT a good sign.  :-(

They are delivered via express mail in cold pack. The products are all fresh and good condition. They are all taste as it should be, how ever the American product was better than Canadian product in my taste buds but the Russian product were even better for my taste buds.<br />In view of these, I recommend all of the product equally, but Russian is my choice for my taste buds.

I wish the prices were as good on other cereal on Amazon.<br /><br />As a bonus, these boxes came with a Spider-Man movie ticket promotion.  So I ordered more to get free tickets for my family via the promotion.  Consider that, the cereal was almost free.
