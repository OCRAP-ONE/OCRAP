review/summary: Solved my cat's digestive problems
review/text: My female cat, Mistique, was having problems with blood in her stool.  I tried adding canned food to her diet, which helped, but didn't solve the problem completely and was expensive and making her fat to give it to her everyday. I did some research on the internet before giving in and taking her to the vet and found out that this can be caused by harsh grains like corn in the pet food. I switched her and my other cat to this food and the problem went a way. Both of my cats are more energetic now and their fur is super soft. My male cat is more behaved, probably due to having steady protein in his system rather than corn which turns to sugar giving him a sugar hi. Also my cats used to go for the dog's food because it smelled better and we had a hard time keeping them out of it. Now my cats snub the dog food and enjoy only their cat food. I love the price compared to most natural cat foods it's a real good deal.<br />A note about switching pet food: don't expect your cat to immediately go for the new food without transitioning. You have to slowly introduce the new food mixed with the old. Reduce the amount of old food each week until there is nothing left but the new food.<br /><br />Update: my cats have been on the new food for 2 months and have stopped having hairballs completly. They continue to have very good health from it.

review/summary: Made in the USA
review/text: I recently got a new cat off of Craigslist. The previous owners had said that he was not a very picky eater. I went to the store to find what I thought I should get for my new pet. I had looked at IAMS indoor formula and was going to with that. However, I saw Evolve and what really caught my eye was that it is made in the USA. I couldn't find where IAMS was made; it wasn't on the package. So I figured that I would give it a shot. Mind you, Evolve only cost 3 more cents than a 7lb of IAMS. My cat instantly took a liking to it. What I had noticed for the first day or so was that my cat's stools smelled really bad. However after a few days on Evolve, that smell has greatly reduce. It could have been what the previous owners were feeding him. The only problem that I do have with it is, yes, the stools are generally soft and can sometimes get on fur. But, if you love your cat enough you are willing to do anything for him. Overall, my cat and I really like this pet food and I would recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Best Help for Our Kitty Yet
review/text: I just got online to write this review and saw that the product is currently unavailable I hope it comes back! Our 17 yr old cat has struggled with constipation for a few years now. We've tried everything to help her out. Metamucil in her water does help but these treats have solved the problem! She is so much happier and goes once a day now as opposed to once every two or three days now! I should mention too that she is very picky about what she eats and gobbles these things up :) it really is a great product!

review/summary: brambleberry-licious!
review/text: This Brambleberry Tea is my favorite flavor by Tazo; it has a strong note of juicy flavor to it - a bright, *ripe* Blackberry juice taste. The tea note is more of an undertone and is very mild. It has the right balance of sweetness like a really great piece of fruit. I agree with the other review that it *does* have an especially good thirst-quenching quality to it.<br /><br />To me, this flavor is most refreshing when served very, *very* cold. Price-wise, I can find this locally for much less - usually about a dollar a bottle.

Absolutely not worth the money. I have paid litterally less than three dollars for the same amount of licorice. Unfortunately I moved and none of the stores close to me sell it. If you are thinking of buying this DON'T. find someone who lives where they sell it. Have them ship buy it, charge you double, ship it to you, and it might STILL come out cheaper.

review/text: If you try this tea without honey or stevia it might not taste that good. But what tea does? This tea is flavored with real fruit juice concentrate and is made mostly with apples, hibiscus, blackberry leaves, orange peel and licorice root. Now I can't really taste the licorice it is far too subtle. This is just slightly tart and has a lovely deep burgudy color. Not a tea I crave but something different. I'd try out one box before I bought a whole bunch.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I tried Bigelow's Pomegranite Pizzazz tea about 4 months ago and I've pretty much forgotten about all my other faves. I love the fruity taste that finishes without the bitterness or tartness of some other herbal teas. I drink this tea more than I drink water, which USED to be my "go-to" drink. I drink this morning, noon and night ~ sometimes even in the middle of the night! So if you like your tea to be lightly fragrant, rich in flavor and beautiful in color, this tea is for you. Now if you will excuse me, I'm going to go make myself a cup of Pomegranite Pizzazz tea. Later on, I might try it iced since it's received good reviews when iced! ENJOY!

I recall ordering from OS years ago, receiving fabulous fillets that could be easily cut with a fork-this was not the case. For the price, I will likely have better luck requesting special cuts from the local supr market.

I have a sign on the door saying that I am refusing shipment.<br /><br />Get a confirmed delivery date before you hit "Buy".

review/summary: Fantastic and worth every penny!
review/text: I received a Christmas gift coupon to Amazon, and decided to splurge on The Fantastic Feast. Everything in it was beyond expectations.  The hot dogs were the best we have ever had. They are HUGE!  So tasty too.  The stuffed sole was better than restaurant fare.  Great juicy beefy burgers.  I wasn't expecting much of the chicken breasts, I figured boneless chicken breast is boneless chicken breast... but they were unbelievably moist and delicious.  The center cut pork chops were flavorful and juicy!  Of course the sirloin steaks were wonderful as well, and the potatoes were a quick and delicious side.  So much in that magical cooler!  The quality of Omaha Steak products is truly exceptional.  I would not hesitate to purchase one of the combo packs again.  My only negative is that the shipping prices are high. I was actually ordering 8 hot dogs earlier today for 9.99 and they wanted 14.99 for shipping!  I decided against that purchase... Money is tight, and lower shipping costs would help us all out!  Fortunately for me there is a retail store nearby my home, which I plan on visiting soon!

review/text: I ordered this sampler for my aunt for christmas.  I called her after they arrived and she was THRILLED!  She said they are delicious, and also commented on what a wonderful gift idea.  She lives alone, and in another state, so this was the perfect gift and size for her!  She can even invite a friend over to enjoy with her.  I just ordered a larger Rib Eye package for my husband and myself to enjoy!  I can't wait to receive it.

review/summary: so disappointed ~ will not order Omaha steaks again
review/text: I finally decided to order a variety package deal knowing I could get stuffed sole (scallops and crabmeat) with steaks as well as various other things. Tried the steaks first and while I was disappointed with the size I do say they are way more properly portioned than what I usually get. They are quite thin and are okay at best but definitely not worth the money. Next we tried the potatoes au gratin and I liked that they were different than the sliced stuff in a casserole dish I remember having as a kid (never liked them before) but these were potato balls and while they looked really good they fell short of what I was expecting and my expectations were not that high. One of those deals where the first bite is pretty good and it just goes down hill from there ~ by the time I was done with the first one I didn't care to eat the second one. They seemed like processed frozen food rather than a gourmet type item. I had just always thought "Ohama Steaks" and figured for the price everything would be that of a high-end steakhouse in quality but it isn't even in the ball park of a high-end steakhouse.<br /><br />So... what has prompted me to finally write (I wasn't going to) was tonight I tried the stuffed sole. I had one a while back "just to see" and while it seemed really bland it was so-so, so I thought I'd prepare a side dish (my own mashed potatoes) with it this time and give it another shot. (I'm a nut for anything crab and scallop.) Being hungry I baked 2 of them. Again I was disappointed with how bland it was but when I started finding BONES in my mouth that was it. BOTH of them had little bones.<br /><br />It was obviously a waste of time and money and I don't even care about the rest of the food. I may try to see if I can give it away. I am simply not interested and having paid that much money for this stuff and it tasting like some cheap clearance item, not to mention the BONES!! That is just not acceptable to me. I'm glad it wasn't one of my kids eating it.<br /><br />I would have left this review on their website but, oh my, I couldn't find a page to do that on their website. I wonder why??

review/text: I have an ice cream maker at home, which has been gathering dust for a while.<br />I came across this product and thought to give it a try. As I expected, it was really<br />easy to make. Just mix with half and half and dump it into the machine.<br />I have tried chocolate and vanilla so far, and they turned out to be pretty delicious.<br />I do love the flavor and aroma. For a richer texture, I added a little heavy cream, and<br />the ice cream was smooth and creamy.<br />We received our ice cream maker as a gift a while back and are finally putting it to good use.<br />My kids and I had fun making ice cream at home... It is a time-saver and tastes great too!

review/text: Matouk's West Indian Hot Sauce is the worst hot sauce I have ever tasted. The quality control is atrocious. You're better off with something else. They also have a real problem with shipping. So much so that they have a form letter they send to people who receive a USPS box full of broken glass and hot sauce to clean up. The bottom line is that the product may create problems for he person you're trying to send a gift to, instead of enhancing their life. I'll never order from them again.

review/summary: Dog Hates Artemis
review/text: Artemis is a very high quality food ingredient wise, and since my dog is moving over seas with us I wanted to get her on a food available in both countries.<br /><br />Artemis was very nice and sent samples of the Fresh Mix Adult and Fresh Mix Maximal dog, and my dog loved it so we bought 2 30lb bags from amazon.<br /><br />She ate a little bit of it initially and then totally refused to eat it. She picked out the old dog food from the Artemis, and only ate her dog food when she was starving. She hasn't even eaten half a bag, and the second bag wasn't treated any differently.<br /><br />Two months later she still hates it and has lost weight so I gave up and bought her Canidae, which she loves and eats no problem at all. She is not a picky dog, but she just hated the Artemis - it gave her horrible gas all the time and she had diarrhea several times.<br /><br />Changing her food she is back to being a happy little porker.<br /><br />I don't know if it was a bad batch or what since she liked the sample packs, but it definitely didn't work for her at all.

review/text: These are wonderful! The flavor of the frosting and filling is perfect, rich and sweet, but not too sweet. It's perfect for a light snack. I used to pull off the crust of poptarts because I hated the stale taste, but the crust on these is DELICIOUS. It tastes so moist and fresh, reminding me a little of what a real pastry tastes like. I don't get a stomach ache from these like I did after eating poptarts... and these are organic! I am definitely buying these from now on!<br /><br />If you are wondering about the ingredients, they are:<br /><br />Organic wheat flour, organic evaporated cane juice invert, organic palm oil, organic evaporated cane juice, organic brown sugar, organic whole wheat flour, organic corn starch, organic vital wheat gluten, organic dextrose, organic molasses, organic rice starch, sea salt, leavening (baking soda, cream of tartar), natural brown sugar flavor, organic maple flavor, organic cinnamon, organic honey, organic rice bran extract, organic cocoa, organic caramel flavor, organic vanilla flavor, organic caramel color, algin sodium citrate, monocalcium phosphate, whey protein isolate (milk).<br /><br />The Frosted Strawberry ones are really good, too.

review/summary: My kids love these
review/text: I don't like toaster pastries, but my husband and children love them. We've been really watching for hidden sources corn syrup in things for the last year or so, and the big name brand toaster pastries do use corn syrup. We found these, and they don't contain corn syrup or gelatin. They are shelf stable for longer than it takes my family to eat them. Not nutritious, but you don't expect toaster pastries to be nutritious. It is a snack that I don't feel guilty about having on hand.<br />This is my son's favorite flavor, and my daughter likes them a lot as well. She prefers the chocolate though. The pastry part is much like the big name pastries in consistency and texture. The frosting is sweet, and the filling is a true maple flavor.<br />If you look at the ingredients and don't know what inverted sugars are, they are sugars that are made sweeter, usually by heating and adding a bit of an acid like lemon juice, which makes it an organic and natural alternative to high fructose corn syrup.

review/text: If you a Pop Tart loving adult...these are great!  But...let's face it, the majority of the "toaster pastry" population is school age so here is a review from my kiddos (ages 7 & 12):<br /><br />-Thin layer of icing is just sweet enough...more of a hint than a mouthful of hard sugary coating.<br />-Tastes even better when you toast them!<br />-The inside is the best part...its not gritty or jelly-ish.<br /><br />We buy a lot of organic and sometimes there just isn't an organic approach that my kids love...but this brand and flavor is a HUGE exception.  My son has ADHD so I try to keep HFCS, refined sugars, and ALL artificial dyes out of his diet.  This brand helps me AND he sees as a treat.

And my poor son, who is four, had never so much as tasted a Pop-Tart due to all of the nasty additives and HFCS in them. I'd tried health-food-store versions before but they tasted like dog biscuits and they never even had the option of frosted ones. Enter Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries. We are huge fans and keep them on hand all the time now. Fantastic guilt-free treat!

review/text: It's been my goal to try all of the flavors of these toaster pastries.  The Brown Sugar Maple was another tasty one.  I might like this one the best because of it's richer flavor. As far as the fruit flavors go, I'd say the Strawberry is the best, followed closely by the Apple, and Cherry Pomegranate.<br /><br />The only two flavors I haven't tried yet are the Blueberry and the Chocolate.  I'm sure the Blueberry will be just as good as the other fruit flavors.  The chocolate I'm not so sure about.<br /><br />Remember, whichever one you do choose, always go for the frosted versions.

review/text: These things taste much better than the Pop Tarts version of the same flavor.  My kid has problems with dairy and soy (though he can tolerate baked-in dairy), and so Pop Tarts were off limits even though he likes them.  I read the ingredients list and saw that these were soy-free so we tried them and they are significantly tastier than Pop Tarts.  I don't think I could persuade my child to go back to the brand-name product if I wanted him to. I love eating them myself.  Amazon has them for a great price too.  I think this flavor is my son's favorite (except for chocolate, which unfortunately contains non-baked dairy).

review/text: While I can't attest to the particular box the first reviewer received, I feel compelled to speak on the behalf of an old companion, See's� Chocolate Bordeaux. Some 50 years ago I was fortunate to select a milk chocolate from a box of assorted See's� chocolates. Attracted by the tiny chocolate sprinkles which covered the piece I was drawn to, I chose it and bit into a a succulent creamy-center, which I would now describe as pure ambrosia. If this chocolate were a claret it would be a vintage "Ch�teau Mouton Rothschild," were a landscape it would by C&eacute;zanne, and if a novel it would be by Hemingway. With its two varieties of milk and dark chocolate it should appeal to any chocoholic. Quite simply, it's the best of the best, and I would recommend it without reservation to all.

I keep these with me on days that I can't prepare a meal or when I am tired of my diet food and want something that has a little more hearty flavor. Caveat is: just like turkey-jerky, if you didn't know you were eating ostrich you might think that it tastes a bit different. Keep in mind that ostrich tastes more like chicken than beef.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Compact (will fit in cargo pocket)<br />Tasty<br />Fairly low salt<br />Semi-Moist (good or bad depending on your taste)<br />80 calories<br />Great for diets<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Hard to open sometimes<br />A bit large to fit in pocket (won't fit in standard pants pocket)<br />Co-workers think you are weird to eat Ostrich<br />A little expensive<br /><br />So, with all that said, I keep a box of these in my cupboard at all times just in case I need a snack and I don't want to go off-diet. Buy a box and see what you think.

review/text: These taste great, are really healthy and not too expensive as far as real jerky goes. I like to eat them after hard workouts, and I've taken them backpacking and they were always my favorite snack on the trail.

review/summary: Has Sucralose!!!
review/text: This is suppose to be a "healthy" snack. Then they shouldn't sneak artificial sweeteners in. I do like the taste, but I'm going to have to go with another flavor. I got the applewood also and it looks like it doesn't have sucralose. So just be aware that different flavors will have different ingredients.

review/summary: The JERKY GODS are happy!
review/text: The jerky GODS sat high atop Mt. Olympus and pondered how they could make a delicious jerky that combines both beast and foul.  The solution was OSTRIM and the result is amazing!  This high protein, low fat tasty stick of goodness is the perfect snack on the go.  I pack this in my kids lunch boxes, in my workout bag and in my bedside drawer for a late night snack (kidding- but I totally could!)!  If you havent tried this yet- do it!

review/summary: Tasty source of protein
review/text: I didn't order these snack sticks from Amazon, but decided to give my review anyway. I'm required to get 60 grams of protein per day, so I have to be resourceful. I thought I'd try these sticks based on the many positive reviews. At first I was reluctant to eat them because of them being made from ostrich, but I couldn't taste anything different in them. They are delicious! They remind me of Slim Jim's but a lot better. They're not greasy and they're thicker. They are a bit difficult to chew, so be careful about that. Also, they're very filling. I could only eat half a stick at a time. I highly recommend this low-cal, high protein snack.

review/text: I am on an ultra low calorie diet. The foods I am allowed to eat are severely restricted. I'm also diabetic. For someone like me that is used to the taste of the various artificial sweeteners on the market this is a great dressing. It isn't as thick as regular dressing.<br /><br />The flavor is close. I love the stuff. Don't use as much as you would normally use!<br /><br />If you aren't already used to the taste of artificial sweetener it may take you a while to get used to, but it is worth it.

review/summary: Walden Farms Thousand Island is my favorite.
review/text: I tried the Walden Farms Thousand Island No calorie dressing after reading about it last year in a low carb forum.  I really like it!  Of course, it doesn't taste exactly like regular 1000 Island and it is not nearly as thick because it is not Regular 1000 Island.  In the past, my favorite regular dressing was full fat ranch but I would pick 1000 Island if it was not available. If I had picked a fake Ranch, I don't think I would have liked it at all because it would have just been "off".<br />That's my suggestion to anyone going to any kind of fat free alternative in salad dressing.  Pick something you are not used to having so you are not ready for an exact taste when you put it in your mouth.

review/summary: Great Vegetarian meat substitute
review/text: I've been using this mix for years.  It is a dry mix that is reconstituted by mixing boiling water into the mix in a one to one ratio.  Let it sit 15 minutes and then fry.  I shape it into patties and fry on both sides to a deep golden brown for burgers.  For tacos, I fry the same way and then break up the patties for taco meat.  I have tried baking the patties to reduce fat, and they are okay that way but very dry.  The wonderful thing about this mix is that the company is not trying to create a mock meat.  This has a wonderful flavor that not meat-like in any way.  As a comparison, Boca Burgers taste like dry cardboard hamburgers, super YUCKY.  This product, instead, has a fantastic flavor that is not mimicking meat in any way.  The patties do not barbeque well on a grill, they tend to break up.  It's best to pan fry them.

review/summary: The Best Rice Cakes Around
review/text: I received my case of these delicious, crunchy gems a couple of days ago. I am going to have more delivered in just a few weeks because I am enjoying them so much for breakfast and snacks. They are slightly nutty, fresh, and much better than other brands I have tried. They arrived in perfect condition. The price for this as a Subscribe and Save item is about $2 lower for each package than the price in my local grocery store, giving me a savings of about $24 per case. I love having a big supply around, as I am eating gluten-free. This is truly the best-tasting rice cake on the market. It is hard to understand why one reviewer didn't like the taste. I"m guessing that he or she doesn't like rice cakes. However, if you already know that you like rice cakes, you'll love these and save yourself a lot of money by ordering from Amazon.

review/summary: Oh my, these are good.  And I don't even like rice cakes!
review/text: I learned about Lundberg Farms rice products quite by accident at a forgotten health food store a few months ago.  Since then I have consumed Lundberg rice products exclusively.  This rice actually has flavor and these rice cakes are far ahead of their competition in every category except the crumbly category.  But even that seeming shortcoming is actually further proof of their superiority.<br /><br />This rice is clean when it is cooked and it is not held together by an abundance of starch and man made binders that you will find in the big name brand rice cakes in your supermarket.<br /><br />I put mine in a simple sandwich baggie, fold top not zip lock, and eat it plain and the baggie catches the crumbs for me.<br /><br />Additionally a recent study suggests that white rice is a contributor to diabetes in some people.  I quit white rice a few months ago and the health benefits have been very noticeable to me and others.

review/summary: Flavorful but fragile
review/text: Stumbled across these, and tried them on a lark. MUCH tastier than almost every other rice cake out there -- perhaps because they use brown rice rather than the more bland white rice. The crunch and chewiness is quite good.<br /><br />The one downside is they are significantly more prone to crumble and break-up than other rice cakes. Without fail, in every bag there is at least a half-rice-cake's-worth of crumbled bits in the bottom by the time I've eaten them all. Often at the top there will be one cake that self-destructs beyond eatability (must be due to rough handling in shipping). The fragility leads to a mess on my desk, lap, keyboard...Enjoy them quickly, 'cause in a couple weeks they'll break up faster and uglier than Donald Trump's marriages.<br /><br />But enjoy them nonetheless, because they are really tasty!
