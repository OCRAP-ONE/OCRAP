review/summary: Nice black coffee k-cup
review/text: I've found with so many k-cups that they just don't work too well for black coffee drinkers. Since I'm on the Atkins diet, using the new plan (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439190275">New Atkins for a New You: The Ultimate Diet for Shedding Weight and Feeling Great.</a> I'm allowing myself a cup or two of black coffee daily. This is one of the better k-cups for drinking black or with a little sweetener (I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139YUVW">Stevita Flavors PEPPERMINT Flavored Liquid Stevia Extract, 1.35oz</a>. It's a nice medium body coffee with very little bitterness and rich coffee flavor. I also like the fact that this is labeled "Fair Trade" and "Organic".<br /><br />Also, the expiration date was 7 months out.. so the coffee was very fresh.

review/summary: Good Coffee - One Bad Box
review/text: We were subscribed to this coffee until recently.  We got about a half-dozen boxes during our subscription.  The coffee is robust in flavor, and makes a tasty large cup.<br /><br />The only problem that we had was that, with one box, about half the box had coffee loose in the bottom part of the pods.  When you brewed the coffee, you'd get a cup full of wet grounds.  We found that if we checked the pods against the light, we could see which had loose coffee, and we could trim one corner to empty out the loose grounds.  There were still a few in each cup, but at least it was drinkable.<br /><br />Good coffee - it's a shame they canceled the subscription.<br /><br />K

review/text: I have tried many, many different flavors of k-cups and this one is right up there with my favorites. Of course, it's hard to trust anyone's opinion on whether the taste is good because tastes vary so much between us all. As far as the quality of the product itself, I could tell no difference between this and k-cups purchased through Keurig directly.

review/summary: Dutch Amazon Coffee Drinker's Club
review/text: When the Dutch went to the Amazon, they found this amazing bean that was accidentally crushed, boiled and sipped for medicine.  Soon others started drinking it in the morning and their day was filled with joy and energy.  Being enterprising people, they found that by not killing the insects nor putting additives in the soil, that the bean magically turned organic.  From the dirt to the cup if you will.  When merchants from Vermont finally arrived, they named this amazing drink Van Houtte Cafe Amazonia.  America soon became the coffee drinking nation of the world.  One of the insiders nicknamed "Starbucks" moved to Seattle, and the rest is history.

review/summary: These dried shiitakes have a slightly smaller average diameter than Havista's 3-5cm shiitakes
review/text: Havista's "3-4cm" dried shiitakes have a slightly smaller average diameter than Havista's "3-5cm" dried shiitakes.  The big picture is that there wasn't much difference between "3-4cm" and "3-5cm."  I counted about half as many 5.0cm to 5.5cm diameter dried shiitakes in this product as I found in Havista's "3-5cm" dried shiitake product.  The tiny 2.5cm to 3.0cm dried shiitakes were slightly more numerous in this product than Havista's "3-5cm" product.  Apparently, Havista believes that kilogram for kilogram, their tiny shiitakes are worth slightly more than their larger shiitakes.  Interestingly, the Japanese believe just the opposite.  In Japan, the largest shiitakes are called, "donko," and separated from the rest to be sold at a higher price per kilogram than the rest.  The quality of these dried shiitakes is about as good as any other brand of dried shiitakes.  About 1 mushroom in 30 to 50 might be defective (taste sour or look decomposed).  That's not worse than other brands.  These dried shiitakes will fully occupy just slightly less than 5 1/2 one-gallon plastic jars.  Product of China.<br />Caution:  Havista's dried shiitakes are extremely rich in vitamin D2.  Without even contacting Havista, I can tell that these shiitakes received plenty of sunshine where they were farmed.  I get hypercalciuria (calcium sand in my urine) after eating only two-thirds of the dried shiitakes in a 1-gallon plastic jar.  Hypercalciuria is a symptom of hypervitaminosis D (vitamin D overdose).

review/summary: Smooth, rich, dark.
review/text: I picked up two bags of this coffee for a good price on a Friday only sale. I am very happy I decided to try it. The flavor is rich and dark, with a smoky undertone and no bitterness. Just the way I like my coffee. I enjoy a good amount of cream in my coffee (no sugar!), so I need a blend that will stand up to the cream. This coffee definitely does just that. Even if you enjoy your coffee black, this coffee will not leave a bitter aftertaste. It is extremely smooth. I would rate this just a notch darker than a typical french roast coffee, and not quite as dark as a traditional espresso roast. It is just perfect. By the way, I use the Aero coffee press to brew my coffee, but I am sure this coffee would yield a delicious cup with all brewing methods. Try a cup; you'll like it, too.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a>

review/summary: Edgy
review/text: This coffee, brewed in an automatic drip, strikes me as having a truly Italian taste, agree that it is rich and smoky (yes on the burnt cedar aspect). But something, as it hits the palate, is harsh and edgy. I make a strong brew and enjoy it with 2/3 cup skim milk heated in the microwave before addition of coffee. The third pot I got just right with 3 parts of this grind plus 1 part of a good German Arabica called Beaumont House Blend that I get at Aldi's. That reduced the edge to exactly where I like it.<br /><br />Very soon I noticed that this Tully's Italian Roast makes a brew high in caffeine, a real plus in my world. I've always read that the darker roasts have less caffeine. It would seem, not this one. Ah, it's such a pleasure to be awake!

If you've ever had the recipe  "Savory Snack Crackers" the oyster crackers with that coating on them, they have a hint of that flavor + delicate cheese though. These are better though, w/o all the oil.  SUPERB!!!

review/summary: Flaxseed - add to foods without knowing it's there, even fool the kids.
review/text: Flaxseed's Latin species name, Linum usitatissimum,  means "most useful." Couldn't have picked a better name myself. Flaxseed is a really useful addition to your diet. It contains alpha linolenic acid (ALA) which is an omega-3 fatty acid that helps with heath health, bone health and is an anti-inflammatory.<br /><br />Plus it is great for cholesterol. A study compared people with high cholesterol who added 20 grams of ground flaxseed to their diet. These people were compared to people taking a statin drug. After two months, there were significant reductions of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in both groups.<br /><br />So, clearly it's good for you, but lots of things are good for you. Question is, how difficult is it to add flaxseed to one's diet? This is where flaxseed distinguishes itself. Flaxseed can be sprinkled on all kinds of food. I put it on my cereal, in my smoothies, on my sandwiches and I don't really notice it. This is where flaxseed shines, it is invisible.<br /><br />Alright, so I don't notice it. How about other people? I put flaxseed to the test by sprinkling it on the cereal of a very picky 7 year old I babysit for. He ate the cereal and drank the milk without a word. Passes the test.<br /><br />Adding flaxseed to your diet is a no-brainer. Hope this review was helpful - enjoy.

review/summary: Reduces chlolesterol and tastes somewhat like wheat germ
review/text: My daughter, who is a dietetics major in college (a curriculum which requires many of the same courses as pre-med, including organic chemistry, biochemistry, and comparative anatomy), recommended flax seed meal to me as a way to reduce my cholesterol level.  It is easy to just put the mandated two tablespoons in my cold cereal with milk every morning.  This 16 oz bag contains 34 such two tablespoon portions, so at that rate it should last you about a month.  It tastes somewhat like wheat germ, but at little milder.  Flax seed meal is also similar to wheat germ in color, but is finer grained by about a factor of ten.

review/text: I have been using flaxseed for about a year now, i use it in just about anything,<br />yogurt, salads, cold cereal, hod cereal meals just to name a few.  I have a hard<br />time being regular and flaxseed helps alot to keep the bowels moving.  I had my health evaluation and my doctor was amazed at how good my cholesterol and blood work came out, good stuff.  I usually buy from the grocery store and i can't get it there anymore.

review/text: I was super excited to see these at Safeway for only $3. I have seen them at other places for as much as $4.50 and the competitor, Happy Melts Yogurt Melts, on sale for $5. I have to say, go with the Happy Melts version. The Gerber ones lack the flavor and texture of the Happy Melts version and are actually kind of chalky and bland. Happy Melts are all organic and are smaller, which is better for your baby and for you. I prefer the strawberry flavor but the wildberry is also quite good. I think the way they melt in your mouth is quite similar to astronaut ice cream.

It's nice to have the option to use them whole in recipe, or roast and grind them to have freshly-ground cumin on hand.<br /><br />The only "bad" thing is that Barry Farm only offers these in a smallish 2-ounce size.  Still, 2 ounces should last a while.

review/summary: Want your dog dead?  If so, buy this product!
review/text: I was in a hurry as I shopped at my local pet food store late on a Saturday night.  My dogs needed dog food.  I buy a high quality dog food, it's ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these "gourmet" chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time, they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag "not for human consumption, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product"-"made in China" would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat, which caused bloat because nothing could pass, salmonella and e-coli poisoning, and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery, 7 sets of xrays, 2 ultrasounds, multiple blood tests,an ecg and we're not done yet.  She is still in recovery, tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past, never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart, which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn't take the time to carefully look the product over. Thank you, Cadet and IMS Pet Products for contributing to my dog's pain and suffering.

review/text: Nina is in love with the Chicken breasts.  Every time she gets one, she jumps into her bed to savor it. She has a very delicate stomach and when she was diagnosed with gastrointestinal problems, we were concerned that she would never enjoy treats again.  What started as a trial became a standard purchasing item.  We give her no more than 3-4 per week and so far, so great.  The treat smells very good and it does justice to the "natural" descriptive.

She has also always had itchy skin in the late summer to fall, I found these treats last fall and this past summer her skin was so much better, hardly any itching. I would recommend them. Be sure to read the directions though, the amount you give your dog is recommended by their weight. They are also good for dogs if they tend to eat grass.

review/summary: A Happy Dog is a Green Dog
review/text: My wife and I share our home with the Three Muske-Terriers: A male Westie, a male Cesky and, the Empress-of-All-She-Surveys, a female Scotty. The Empress is alergic to wheat, (along with corn and soy), so I had my doubts concerning Pet Greens Roasted Chicken Recipe w/ Wheat Grass Dog Treats - wheat grass after all is just "juvenile" wheat. But apparently not to worry! We're half way through our first bag and no allergic reaction, (you haven't lived until you've seen a crazed Scotty in the middle of an allergic frenzy chewing on her tootsies). Now, putting aside her allergies, the Empress will eat almost anything - and so will the Cesky. But the Westie gives new meaning to the term "finicky" - and Asta gives these treats five barks - I mean, stars. So what's up here?<br /><br />The treats are mostly roasted chicken meal, supplemented with dried chicory extract, organic ground wheat grass powder, lecithin, salt, cultured whey and garlic, preserved with "mixed tocopherols," (I'm not a chemist, but I think that's a fancy name for vitamin E, sourced from vegetable oil). The wheat grass doesn't contain any wheat glutten - which I think is the reason it doesn't trigger the Empress' allergies. Wheat grass is an excellent source of any and all of the nutrients contained in fresh vegetables.<br /><br />The treats are small "jerky-like" rectangles - no more than an inch by 3/4s of an inch, and maybe 1/16 of an inch thick, (they may be more appropriate for small to medium size dogs - a large dog would want three or four at a time). They're great for a quick reward and at only about 4 calories a piece, there's not much danger that your dog is going to put on unwanted pounds, (however I wouldn't suggest that you carry them loose in your pocket or purse - they smell strongly of garlic - I keep 'em in a zip lock baggie).<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the ingrediants are all natural, but only the wheat grass is organic - if you are interested in organic treats, I suggest that you check out those made by Wagatha or Robbie Dawg.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I think that Pet Greens offers both a change of flavor and a change in texture from most common dog treats. The Three Muske-Terriers are scarfing 'em down - your furry buddy probably will too.

review/text: I was looking for a product that is not made in China, contains mostly meat and does without a long list of unhealthy ingredients. Having older rescued dogs with very few teeth, the treats also needed to be soft enough for them to chew. Pet Greens Treats fulfilled all of these requirements. The dogs aren't crazy about them, but will eat them. With all the dubious treats coming from China, this is a good choice.

review/summary: No Soy!
review/text: Like the previous reviewer my daughter had issues with colic, spitting up & diaper rash which was thought to be acid reflux. Turns out she has a sensitivity to soy. (Unlike an allergy a digestive sensitivity doesn't show up on any test. The only way to know if something can't be digested is to stop eating/feeding it and see if the issues resolve.) I feel terrible that it took so long to figure out since she spent months on reflux meds to ease her tummy troubles. I'm glad it's an easy fix, no soy - no problems! Unlike the other baby cereals on the market the Beechnut rice cereal does not contain soy. I look carefully at all labels since soy is a filler in so many products, especially baked goods, bread, pre-packaged snacks & cereals. If not for this Beechnut cereal & the Happy Baby line of products I'd be sunk in my efforts to make sure my child receives balanced nutrition while avoiding soy!

We had originally gotten a diagnosis of acid reflux and a prescription of Prilosec, but after switching to Similac Spit-up and Beech-Nut rice, we really don't need it anymore.  Love this stuff.  I read somewhere that the Gerber rice had some extra not-so-kosher ingredients too, not sure if that's related.  Definitely sticking with the Beech-Nut for the time being.

I think I bought it at a local Fresh and Easy Market and I've had it in the pantry for some time. Well, I was surprised. It was a fairly good-sized can but had only two sardines. Well, I read somewhere that there is no legal definition to the word Sardine, so anything can be used as far as small fish are concerned. It doesn't say what kind of fish these are, but they're said to be wild caught and a product of Morocco. The hot sauce is zesty but not particularly flavorful. All in all, it's a good can of sardines, but not a great one.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

You may also find the French vanilla to be quite delicious and creamy.<br /><br />There may also be a milk chocolate, dark chocolate seduction, extra dark chocolate, strawberry n' dream, cappuccino, roasted almond, double chocolate raspberry or a key lime truffle.

review/text: This is a great snack, low calorie, tasty, and healthy.  I noticed, though, in a couple of boxes that a few of the sesame seeds were falling out of the unopened packages.  I'll still buy the crackers and their sister, Suzie's multiseed flatbread.

review/summary: Excellent Quality
review/text: I grew up in an Italian household and this was the only pasta my father would cook with. It was always available in the grocery store on the east coast when I lived there. I rarely see it where I live now in the mid west. When I do it is outrageously priced and a very limited selection.  I love this pasta and ordering it online is cheaper and easier than going out to the store. I also use subscribe and save which reduces the price even more and there is no shipping cost. It is a staple in our house.  The quality is excellent.  Cooked as directed the pasta holds its form and texture.  It doesn't become mushy or fall apart.  Even if you like your pasta soft and not "Al Dente" it holds in shape.

review/text: We purchased 2 different orders from this vendor.  One box, the fruit was all acceptable,<br />very delicious and no issues with any of the fruit.<br /><br />The 2nd box, some of the fruit was over ripe and a couple of the apples were bad in the center.<br />I made a comment to the vendor to advise of the problem with no expectations of anything from them.<br />I was only wanting to advise them like I would do on a survey or watever.<br /><br />I received a response from the vendor and there were some questions of how the fruit was handled<br />ether in transient or after receipt.  However they offered either a refund or a new replacement of<br />the fruit.  I chose replacement.<br /><br />The new box of fruit arrived 4 days later,  It was excellent!  Every single piece was some<br />of the best fruit we have ever had.<br /><br />No matter what product you are selling, especially perishable foods, the odds are that something<br />will go wrong at some time.  It is how the problem is dealt with that determines customer satisfaction.<br />This vendor chose to rectify the problem at their expense as a way to stand behind their product!<br /><br />It is sad that some people would falsely complain just to get something extra.  That is sad and<br />also stealing.  Hopefully that does not happen too often.<br /><br />We are a very happy customer and will definitely be ordering future products from them.  Also,<br />I am new to online ordering this year and this experience has not only given me confidence<br />that I am secure using this method of shopping but it is so much easier.

review/summary: Black Rice -- Great
review/text: The black rice is well priced for a very fine product.  You have to boil it for a long time (around 30 minutes) in order to break the outer skin.  The effort returns a very tasty rice which makes eating the usual white rice seem to be a waste of time.  The only small fault is that it is just slightly soggy, but only slightly and this comment should NOT put you off from buying what is GREAT high value-to-price ratio product.

review/text: Grapeseed oil is high in mono-unsaturated fats.  It's almost tasteless (which is a good thing sometimes) and has a high smoke point.  This oil lends itself to flavoring with other ingredients (like chili pepper, truffles or spices).

It's also good in baking recipes for the same reason. We use it very often for cooking and are quite satisfied with it.

review/summary: marvelous marzipan
review/text: Neideregger makes the best marzipan treats that I've ever tried; these little loaves are very dense and have a wonderful almond taste to them. This brand has the truest almond flavor in my opinion and is less sweet in a good way than lower quality brands. They are enrobed in a thin coating of dark chocolate that is just enough of a contrast in flavor to heighten the almond flavor. Although this is shaped like a traditional candy bar, they are so rich I tend to eat them as shown in the picture, a small slice at a time. If you like the flavor of almonds this is definitely an excellent confection to give a try.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.

The other problem, I feel their chews are just too hard/tough.  Quite a few pieces had a waxy, dry hue to them--like they were old.  I sampled two assorted (one mix, one dark).  Felt the cremes in the bunch were the best of the lot--some nice flavors and thick texture.  I know I will probably sound like a shill but Loweryscandies out of indiana are my favorite, but hey, look at my other product reviews--I'm no shill!

review/summary: Among my top 5 favorites; The Very High End of Basic Chocolates
review/text: Whenever my husband flies out west he brings me back a dark assortment of See's.  The milk and dark assortment is the very first See's chocolates I ever tried, and I remember saying, "Wow, these taste like FOOD."  Silly, maybe, but what I mean is See's really gives you something to chew on and contemplate.  They are rather dense and hefty; I would never call these "fine" because there is nothing delicate, sissy, or nouveau riche about them.  Just good flavor and a good mouthful.  I consider See's on the very high end of utilitarian, if that makes any sense.  I prefer the darks, with chewy nutty centers, so when I splurge I order a custom assortment from their web site.  Sure wish we had See's in the North East!!  (But maybe it's better that we don't, so they stay "special" for me.)

review/summary: See's, I told ya!.
review/text: Thanks to an Amazon friend (they know the most amazing things), I found about See's Candy, and as I write this I am looking down at a beautifully decorated gold box with gold ribbon. I bought a 2 lb. box of See's Gold Fancy from their website.<br /><br />This is not your Whitmans's Sampler where the boxes got bigger and the candy got smaller. It is not your Godiva where the sugar rush is so intense I would start chasing cars shortly after eating them. This is PREMIUM chocolate. The truffles are soft to the palate with the right texture. The nuts are covered in a rich chocolate but do not crumble with the crush of enamel. They are a variety that can only be described as superb.<br /><br />But that's not all that makes See's special. It's their customer service. I ordered the box in the dog days of late July here in New York. I was extremely annoyed that the product might perish after the UPS man did not leave them at my door as I requested. That's when I called See's and got help and assurance from a phenomenal customer service representative named Theresa. She listened. She didn't interrupt. She didn't use cliche's. She contacted UPS to try to have them redeliver. When I asked how much longer she would be on duty, she told me "31 minutes." (Sweet Savannah! She kept you abreast of every detail)! If she put me on hold, she told me when she would be back, and she was. (Anyone who has been put on hold for three minutes begins to wonder if the person at the other end forgot you, doesn't care, or doesn't know any better). Before she called UPS she asked me which number was the best number to reach me. Sure enough, Theresa called back in 6 minutes and apologized for taking so long. She even offered to send another box, without charge, through a different carrier, no questions asked. It was here the next day.<br /><br />The chocolates were in a very decorative box with bags of ice on top to ensure freshness. The chocolates and ice were wrapped in cellophane and bubble wrap to protect against damage and insulate the cold. Then there was the product itself. Wow!<br /><br />This kind of product and customer service is what makes a customer for life. I hear that their maple peanut butter brittle is highly prized, and I am waiting to try it, and make up a customized box of chocolate. Yes, you can do that too, but you can only get that from the source--the See's Candy website. It's definitely worth it.<br /><br />There is no Godiva, Perugina, Whitman's or any other brand from now on. This is it.<br /><br />I expect my Amazon friend will comment--"See's, I told ya!"

We're Californians and the premium chocolate brand out there (Peases? i think) just does not live up to See's. They ship the chocolates in a little cooler with a piece of dry ice so it will not melt during shipping. Honestly the best chocolate money can buy imo.

review/summary: TOP QUALITY!
review/text: I became acquainted with See's Candies when I lived in the Western part of the United States.  This package was sent promptly in a carefully wrapped chilled and insulated package, and the quality of the candy is still top notch!  You will not go wrong with this company!
