review/summary: Great Wine from South Africa
review/text: I fell in love with "Roodies" when I first taste-tested it in Vancouver, BC about 12 years ago.  I'm not a fan of mixed varietal wines at all, but this one is always stocked in my home.  HOWEVER, it is very, very difficult to find anymore!  I beg wine stores (yes, literally "beg") them to keep it in stock.  It must be popular, because it is never on the shelves when they do have it.  Wine merchants must really be snobby about "Roodies" or the import fees (and feds) must be giving KWV a really hard time!  One can find the 2008 wine easily available, but mostly through NY/NJ merchants.<br /><br />No need to comment on my comment.  It's all about taste, and I, personally, and my wife truly love this wine.  Great with steak or chocolate desserts!

review/summary: Perfect for a morning Iced Americano
review/text: I bought my CBTL machine in hopes of making Ice Americanos in the morning. This is by far one of the best espresso capsules I have ever tried. It has a great flavor and is strong even when mixed with the water. I have started saving a ton of money buy making my own with these capsules compared to buying for the local coffee shop. Living in Seattle we have a ton of coffee options, but I prefer my CBTL capsule to many of those options.

review/summary: Too sweet and packaging flaws
review/text: OK, we love the apples in this line, but the pears are just too sweet and the packaging was not able to keep the pears from crushing into dust.  At first, the order arrived and all of the bags were just crushed to pieces.  I called Amazon and they were GREAT and sent me a replacement; however, the second batch wasn't much better which made me think it was the composition of the pears that crumbles during shipment.  The taste is too sweet, which is surprising since there is nothing in there except pears!  I prefer the apples in this line, and if you are looking for a great snack this is perfect.  I love to give them to my toddler (one bag = one apple!) as a snack when we are on the go.  And my fifth grader loves them in her lunch - they are what the "cool" kids have as they are a bit pricy (but come on what would you rather spend $1.25 on...organic apples or some high fructose junk which you know you'll end up buying in those little packs that cost twice as much per oz.!)<br /><br />So bottom line - love the crispy apples, pass on the pears unless they revamp the recipe and get a new pear variety.

review/summary: I bought these for baking
review/text: I bought these for baking and once they arrived, realized that they were not the baking kind of fruit at all. I guess I just did not pick up on the "Crispy" detail in the title. I thought they were just your average dried fruit that I could cut up and put in breads and cakes, but they are certainly not that, so do not make the same mistake with them that I did.<br />Otherwise, they are pretty nice. Now, as you might guess, I am an adult. So once I realize that I had a snack item on my hands, I decided to try it out in that capacity. That is where I became disenchanted with this product to some extent. The little packages of pears are not NEARLY enough for a snack for an adult. I have to eat 3 of them to feel like I got a snacks worth, and I am not a heavy eater. A whole candy bar is too much. A whole pear is almost too much, but these little packages are just not enough. The package says it holds the equivalent of one pear. My guess is, that these are mighty small pears.<br />They are nice and sweet though. That is the biggest positive about this item. The taste is GREAT. I really do like that part.<br />One reviewer mentioned that these tend to crumble easily and they do. About an eight of the product is at the bottom of the bag in a mess of crumbs. That is a disappointing factor. Since I had expected dried fruit, I guess I also expected that these snacks had a little more body to them than they do. The big pieces that hold together are quite good, but an awful lot of the product ends up at the bottom of the bag.<br />I finally gave these 3 stars. They taste good, but there is just not nearly enough product. It crumbles. It is an awful big package with very little in it. I would say that this is a snack for a 5 or 6 year old and not for an adult.<br />Well, that is my two cents on this product. Hope it helps you decide to buy or forgo. I will opt for regular dried pears myself. This is kind of an expensive hassle just to avoid eating the real fruit.

review/summary: Simply the BEST
review/text: I am hooked on these chocolate bars of perfection...  Amazon's price is actually cheaper than the company's own website and if you're a Prime member, you get free shipping... it's SO worth it.  One bar typically lasts us 3 or 4 days (depending on whether or not we choose to share it),  it's very rich and satisfying, so you don't need to eat a lot (I eat about 4 squares a day).  They aren't readily available in stores so stock up!<br /><br />EDIT 06/23/2012<br />Well I spoke too soon!  While the chocolate is still nothing short of amazing, it arrived a soupy mess due to being mailed USPS from WA to NJ without any sort is insulation to protect it from the summer heat....  The last time I ordered this chocolate, I ordered from the company that makes it.  They shipped it overnight in an insulated box that was packed with ice and, despite temps in the 90s, it arrived fresh and cold;  I'll be using the manufacturer from now on!

We all brought Tastykakes to school and traded sometimes. What I love about the chocolate Junior is the rich moist yellow cake and the chocolatey icing layered in between the cakes along with icing on top. TASTE IS PERFECT!!! GO FOR IT!!

review/summary: Tastykake Junior
review/text: Grew up in the Baltimore area and always had Tastykake products, in my opinion, far superior to Hostess and others. Moved to Colorado and very difficult to find Tastykake products here. When you do find them, the variety is very limited. Anyway, I was glad to see that I could purchase Tastykake Juniors online through Amazon (at a bit of a price with shipping, but hey, when you are an addict). I received them on 29 Apr and the date for the "best by" was 21 May (not bad) --- the Juniors were fresh and undamaged on delivery. Product taste is excellent. I am only writing this review so that others may consider purchasing Tastykake products and they will continue to be available online.

review/summary: For the sake of your taste buds avoid this snack.
review/text: Chocolate Juniors appear to be an average tastykake comprised of cake and chocolate icing. Beware. They aren't as pleasing to your mouth as they are to your eyes (not that theres anything special with presentation of this snack). The sheer smell of the snack will make you question taking the first bite. The reason you choose these over krumpets was probably because they were half off (they're always half off)or they simply ran out of what you wanted. When I was the victim of this snack, I was hungry it was late and I had no alternatives.<br /><br />As you munch into the unholiness of the awful sponge of a once preservative soaked cake your eyes may glisten with regret, sorrow, and dismay. Yes you paid for this. The aftertaste is fortunately easier to deal with than blocking the memory of this horrid cake in the future. Please beware of purchasing this snack. It was one of the most unpleasant encounters with food if had in a while.<br /><br />The next day I shared the snack with some friends and even they too agreed on the terrible taste, and those cakes were from a box purchased in a separate store. The cake I ate was actually fresh and from a nearby factory from where it was purchased. Tastykake has no excuse to sell this product to people. Do they hate us?

review/text: I love asparagus. The only problem I have with this asparagus, are the several stems that end up in each can. I have used 6 of the 12 cans and every can, without exception, has had a MINIMUM of 8 inedible stems. They look the same as the other firm (but edible) stems so I can't pick them out prior easily prior to cooking. I don't mind buying them, but I may cancel my subscription if the next batch is the same as this one.

review/summary: Whoa!-the old wive's tale is true!
review/text: I read somewhere on the web that putting a can of asparagus, juice and all, in the blender and adding 4 tablespoons of the resulting puree to a glass of water or juice twice a day was good for just about anything that might ail you. I already eat a lot of vegetables, so it was hard to believe this would make a difference, sort of like carrying coals to Newcastle, but it really did! It tweaked something, I know not what, that made a difference, a BIG difference. I have blended up the expensive long spears as well as this chopped asparagus (which is probably lower quality than the whole spears) but they both work the same for my purposes. In fact, this Libby's cut spears works so well I have a standing order for 2 cases a month. I'm quite sure the difference I feel is not the placebo effect, because I suspect if it were I would eventually tire of it and no longer feel the effects. After several months of using it every day (almost) I still feel it is fantasmagorical.

review/summary: Outstanding Tea for Connoisseur or Non-Connoisseur Alike
review/text: Like many, I have drank tea for many years, decades, actually, and have had the opportunity to sample everything from the standard bagged teas available everywhere to some of the most expensive hand-made teas developed in Europe using traditional processes. I won't try to pretend this St Dalfour tea is the equivalent of these highly esoteric (and incredibly expensive) teas, but what I can say is that this is a truly great tea for the bagged varieties, and, due to its unfamiliarity, would certainly qualify as a "sleeper" find. I can recommend this particular brand and variety as one of the best I've had.<br /><br />What makes this so good? First, the ingredients are all natural, with no artificial flavors or fillers (check your labels carefully and be surprised to see how many flavored teas rely on artificial flavors). To take it a step further, the ingredients here are all organic (see the information on the boxes and on the website to read about this), with no pesticides, artificial colors, or flavors added. At first blush, one might not be immediately attracted to a "black cherry" tea, but the manner in which St Dalfour blends this results in a flavorful tea that contains a subtle flavoring and aroma of black cherry that is really wonderful.<br /><br />If you prepare the tea correctly, you'll end up with a very smooth and delightfully flavored tea that may become your favorite. One secret for this, or any, tea is to not steep the tea more than 60-90 seconds MAX, and then remove the bag. It might seem like too short of a time at first, but if you force yourself to keep to this time, with a few dunks at the end, you should begin to see how tea can really taste if it isn't over-steeped and allowed to turn bitter. (Everyone has a strength preference and so you'll have to experiment at first, but if you can keep it to no longer than 90 seconds, that should be ideal.) Further, if you have a water boiler that allows you to select temperature, if you use a water temperature right below the boiling point, that smoothness can be extended further.<br /><br />An easy recommend to the tea lover, this tea is one of my favorites. Five stars.

review/summary: Calming tea but has no flavor
review/text: I do not suffer from insomnia but occasionally I get stressed out and find myself worrying too much about things I have no control over.  I have used Bach's Rescue Remedy in the past for this and while that helps relieve anxiety it also makes me spacey and a little sleepy. This tea IS relaxing and calming.  It does not make me sleepy or lose my focus - I can have this during the day and go on with my activities.  The directions say to pour boiling water over the teabag and let it steep for 2 minutes.  I let it steep for 4 minutes in order to get some flavor out of it.  I find the tea rather bland.  I add no sweetener or lemon, just drink it plain.  It is not a bad tasting tea, it just has a faint herb-y taste, and that is fine.  The package says it relaxes muscles and mind.  I have noticed that after drinking the tea my neck muscles loosen up a bit.  To summarize, this tea will not hurt you, and the flavor will not be offensive to you.  It MAY help you loosen up and lighten up a bit.  If you have serious anxiety or insomnia you won't find a solution with this product and should discuss this with your doctor and consider a pharmaceutical solution instead.

review/summary: Amazing Spice Tea
review/text: This tea is so good you have to try it.  It has a zing.  It reminds me of chocolate chili flavor when I drink it.  I am addicted.  If you like the good earth original herbal tea, you will like this even better.  All my friends want to know where I get it from.

review/summary: I'm drinking it as I write
review/text: I hope you'll buy this tea. I want it to be extremely popular, so Yogi will never discontinue it. I'm crazy about it and drink it after dinner every night.<br /><br />I drink high-test Japanese green tea in the morning and herb tea at night. It's hard to find an herbal tea that doesn't seem wimpy after my intense green tea buzz. Yogi Aztec Sweet Chili tea is the herbal tea I've been looking for all my life - mysteriously full-bodied and satisfying.<br /><br />It's made from organic spices that wage war between sweet and peppery tastes. These contradictory flavors are amazingly stimulating, without the aid of caffeine. Ultimately this lively sensation turns into a warm serene feeling.<br /><br />Ingredients include licorice root, orange peel, ginger root, fennel seed, anise seed, cinnamon bark, cardamom seed, clove bud, cayenne, black pepper and cocoa shells - all organic.<br /><br />I suggest you use a covered cup or pot and steep the bag well over five minutes to bring your tea to full strength. Use one teabag per person.<br /><br />Aztec tea makes a wonderful substitute for a bedtime snack. It's curiously filling, without the aid of calories.<br /><br />I buy mine at my local co-op, but now that I know you can get six-packs through Amazon, I might try that. It would be nice, never to run out.

review/summary: Very Striking Flavor, A Must-Try If You Like Horseradish.
review/text: I bought a few bags of these chips without wasabi a month or so ago, very much enjoyed them, so naturally I wanted to try this. I wasn't quite sure what wasabi was until I tried this but apparently it is the Japanese version of horseradish, which I absolutely love. I wasn't sure what to expect when I thought of combining shrimp and horseradish, but I figured "what the hell". Anyway, the bag got here a few days ago and I was pretty shocked with the flavor in a good way. The wasabi is very pungeant and you might need a few seconds to reel after your first fry, but you'll want more. Check it out; you'll never know until you do.

review/summary: No corn or chicken! Don't be fooled!
review/text: This is only a box of beans! It has no chicken or corn or any other necessary ingredients to make a soup except a spice/condiment pouch inside the box! In fact, the instruction tells you to buy your own chicken, tomatoes, corn, okra and others to make it a soup. The image and title of this product is tantamount to false labelling and advertising. Who needs beans to make corn and chicken soup???? This is like just a recipe you are buying and nothing more! The other soups from this company turn out to be more of the same! Don't be fooled.

review/text: While I will admit I had the same visceral reaction as the other reviewer when these arrived and I read I had to add the corn and chicken myself in order to make the corn and chicken stew, I have found myself especially surprised. In fact, it's on the counter to make tomorrow. I buy a bag of frozen corn, a bag of frozen okra and throw in some Tyson grilled chicken strips and there you go - it's dinner. I don't think you even need to add the chicken. It will still have plenty of protein without it considering the beans. Several people have come to the house to sample this and ALL have liked it...from my picky 'I always need meat' husband to my Earth Girl best friend to my 3 year old and his constantly changing palate/food mood swings to my 9 month old who discovered he loves okra from this recipe. I have made it twice and everyone eats it. I don't know what it is! Using my last box tomorrow and ordering more cause it is still an easy dinner that everyone can agree on!

review/text: That Hain Celestial company that is manufacturing Health Valley and other brands has gone crazy of late, balancing purity with excess calories and lack of nutritional value. If you know anything at all about nutrition, and you review Hains other products, you will see the consistency. Hains canned products in fact all come in cans that develop metal whiskers that can break off into the sauce. I think Hains should be banned, and all its subsidiary products along with it, like Health Valley, for customer fraud and endangerment.

review/summary: Hazelnut Coffee
review/text: This is one of my favorite coffees, and I'm fussy when it comes to coffee.  The hazelnut flavor is noticeable without being too pronounced, and the coffee itself is from quality beans.  There is no burnt or metallic flavor, which sometimes happens with beans of a lesser quality.  Eight O'Clock coffee of any flavor is excellent, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  Using whole bean rather than ground coffee is the best way to make fresh-tasting coffee every day.

review/summary: Healthy substitute for Rawhide.
review/text: We had decided not to give our dog rawhide, but he is an aggressive chewer and needed something to chew on.  I ordered the SmartBones hoping for a substitute for the Dingo Bones we had given our previous dog.  Bogie loves the SmartBonese, and they last quite a while, although not as long as a rawhide bone.  The fantastic part is they are made from vegetables and are easily digested.  We are dedicated SmartBone users.  I give them an A++++++++++++.

review/summary: MADE MY DOG SICK!
review/text: I bought these from PetSmart, not Amazon (though they are about 4 bucks cheaper on Amazon). My dog was born without enamel on the tips of his teeth.  This means he can't chew on anything hard or else his teeth might crack.  I was extremely excited about these bones since they were pretty soft and weren't actually rawhide.<br /><br />My dog loved them, but I don't The bones are extremely flimsy.  In the bag I just felt to see if they were softer then rawhide and they were slightly softer.  My dog had the bone destroyed within 25 minutes.  He also ate all of the bone and left sticky remains all over the floor.<br /><br />I gave my dog another one several days later and a third a few days after that.  At the end of the week I woke up to him throwing up at 3am.  His vomit was all the Smart Bone material.  He threw up several times and has continued to throw up since.  Do not buy this brand.  It just isn't trustworthy.  These bones were the only change in his diet and the only plausable cause for vomit.  (He has since stopped after switching to a different brand).  I wish I had seen the other reviews before I purchased it.  After reading the other reviews about some dogs becoming ill I've switched to buying my dog chews at a local, small run dog shop that can tell me the ingredients in each bone and what is safe and what is not.  Why do so many companies make such unhealthy/dangerous things for our dogs?

review/text: My dog did enjoy these bones, but they are so soft that he obliterates them in less than 10 minutes. There is another brand that looks similar to these that has a much stiffer/dryer texture, and it takes him several hours to work through those. Additionally, with these SmartBones, he was able to bite off the end entirely, which can be a choking hazard. I won't be getting these bones again.

review/text: I typically order the cheapest bag of whole beans from Amazon that ship with Prime;  I tried this bag on a whim and I'm very happy.<br /><br />I grind 4 cups automatically each day and it is a nice flavor.  Not too strong, not too weak.  Good morning blend. (If you have never had freshly ground coffee, and are not scared of paying for freshly ground each day the rest of your life, hop on a bag on sale on Amazon and give it a try.  I use a Krupps integrated auto-grind unit, and I'm a big fan.  And the unit has broken once and I had it repaired!)<br /><br />I'm not a cofee snob but this stuff is night a day to pre-ground coffee;  I much much prefer this brand to the Jeremiah's bags of beans (I believe I had the Jeremiah fogbuster earlier which was not great...)

For generic coffee, it is a decent blend, certainly no worse than what you would buy at a local coffee chain, but much less expensive.  An undiscriminating coffee drinker would find it acceptable.  But don't expect any special flavor nuances from it or try to compare it to 100% PNG coffee.

review/text: This product, although still usable, is not what I would call high quality onions. The color most of us are used to is white and the texture very fine. This is not the case with this product. It is a medium brown color and tastes as though it has been toasted to a degree. To me, it does not do as well in recipes as other brands on the market. It plumps up much more leaving a grainy texture and throws off the color of recipes.<br />It is not a replacement for onion powder by far, and I really will not purchase it again.<br />On the flip side though, if you are looking for a coarser texture with a very mild onion flavor, you might like it.

It is a little stronger than most American brands, but your taste quickly adapts to it and you do not want to go back to regular coffee.  To me, Brazilian coffee tastes better than Colombian coffee and is smoother to drink with a good flavor.  I would recommend that anyone try a bag and see for yourself; just use a little less than usual to keep it from being too strong.

review/text: Blue Sky Juiced Energy is the only energy drink I like. I LOVE that they don't use fake sugars. If they ever start it will ruin this fine beverage. They certainly could cut back on the sugar a little though. This drink doesn't need a lot - the sweetness of the juice is plenty enough.<br /><br />Amazon - your price for this 12 pack is more expensive that my local hipster health food store! Unbelievable. Occasionally they put this drink on sale for $1.75 per 16oz can. I expected you to be priced around there. Oh well, back to the over priced hipster store I go.

review/summary: Very Good Product From Blue Sky
review/text: I have been sampling energy products lately and wanted to try this variant of Blue Sky energy drink.  The taste of this product is very good and quite different than the original product.  In my opinion it is definitely better tasting than most energy drink products you find on the market.  I like the fact it contains 50% juice and they don't use any artificial sweeteners.  My only compliant would be it tends to be a little on the sweet side and it does contain 58g of sugar.  I would recommend Blue Sky cut back on adding sugar (sucrose) since the product is probably sweet enough already due to the fruit juices.  Overall I would purchase again if I do find a better product.

review/text: These cookies are delicious... I was looking for an alternative to the junk out there that's loaded with extra preservatives and artificial sweeteners, and this stuff pretty much fit the bill.<br /><br />You can actually guess at what you're eating by looking at the box.  Very simple to understand, and the ingredients list isn't a mile long!  As an added plus, the preparation is VERY simple -- just an egg and a stick of butter, and you're off and running!<br /><br />Give them a try, and maybe you'll have a new favorite ;)

review/summary: a different, tasty chocolate chip cookie
review/text: When you think of a chocolate chip cookie, I don't think the first word that comes to mind would be "hearty".  These cookies are hearty. Both the oatmeal and whole grain flour create an unusual consistency and flavor.<br /><br />At first, I didn't think I would buy these again; the whole grain took a little time for me to embrace. Now I am hooked.  One would think that because the cookies are whole grain, they are more nutritious.  While I am not a nutritionist, I believe that a lot of the nutritional value may be compromised when the baker adds the stick of butter that is cited as an ingredient.  I guess it is important to consider that while the butter adds fat, these cookies are so filling that eating one or two is completely possible.  After eating one or two, I can walk away feeling like I got a cookie fix (try eating one or two out of a box of commercial cookies, it would be rarely possible to feel satisfied).  When short on time, I have even used two cookies as a meal replacement (recall my previous admission that I am no nutritionist).  The cookies keep me stabilized for several hours when necessary and they taste better than most protein bars.<br /><br />It should be noted that a suggestion is given on the box to replace half of the stick of butter with applesauce in order to reduce the fat and calories.  As I did not try that option, I cannot comment on how it impacts flavor.<br /><br />If you are baking these for the first time, take note that the bottoms of the cookies brown quickly.  When they come out of the oven, they will still be soft on top and appear slightly undone.  Let them cool for 15-20 minutes and they will be fine.<br /><br />While I really like these cookies, I am only giving the product four stars because of the price.  I will be trying more of the Kodiak brand in upcoming months.

review/text: I used to eat marshmallow cones all the time when I was a kid, so I was really excited to find them on Amazon, and for such a good price!  Unfortunately, this particular brand was a major letdown.  The marshmallow tops had very little taste at all -- definitely not like I remember them -- and the cones tasted stale.  If I order any marshmallow cones again, I'll definitely try ordering from a different manufacturer.

review/text: These come individually wrapped in plain plastic inside a larger tub. A large majority of the marshmallow "ice cream" tops were half falling/oozing off of the cone. The only thing worse than the appearance was the taste. Obviously I wasn't expecting anything great but these had almost no flavor at all. My 4 year old handed it back to me after 1 bite.<br /><br />I had intended these for use in treat bags but because they looked so bad and tasted worse I won't be using them after all.

review/text: I did get it for my baby girl announcement. Thinking I'll try it and will get 10 more boxes, if I like it. Good thing I ordered only one. The idea is great, but very ordinary milk chocolate taste. What i was even more surprised about - it was hallow inside!!! So I am giving 2 stars just for the idea of chocolate cigars instead of real cigars for your friends who don't smoke. But not 5 stars, because it is too expensive!!! I think the fair price would be at least $1 per 1 cigar in the box, but $12 per box of 4 or 5 plus shipping charge - sorry, I think it is too high, specially that it does not even have some kind of filling inside.

NOT included are wheat and corn, which some dogs react poorly to, and which may be contaminated, especially if imported.<br /><br />These biscuits break in two fairly easily, but are firm enough give the dog some crunchy chewing exercise. I only use rewards to train my dog, and these are very motivating for him.

review/summary: All natural ingredients, great taste
review/text: We have a 12 year old Akita dog that has developed food-related allergies and intolerance as she has gotten older. Akitas as a breed are also more sensitive to chemicals. For this reason, we're very selective about what dog food and dog treats we buy. Wet Noses is one of the few dog treat lines which meets all our requirements, and our dog LOVES these treats! Wet Noses uses all organic ingredients and stays away from ingredients such as corn, wheat and soy to which dogs are more likely to be allergic. Every ingredient appears to have been selected to give exceptional nutrition for the money and for the calories it provides. We bought the sweet potato treat, a flavor dogs seem to love but which is rarely found in commercial dog food. (Before we found this line of dog treats, we used to add pieces of sweet potato to our dog's regular commercial dog food.) We were also impressed that Wet Noses uses quality ingredients such as rye flour, turmeric, sesame paste, cumin and cinnamon. All of these ingredients appear to have been included not only to make these treats taste good, but also for their health benefits. I would highly recommend this product. The treats are a little over an inch in diameter.
