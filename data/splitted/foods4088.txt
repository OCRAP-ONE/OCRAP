review/summary: A Delicious and Healthy Snack!
review/text: When I first tasted this snack I couldn't believe it! Not only was it healthy, but it was utterly delicious! The only problem I had was with the cost at the local store. As usual, Amazon.com stepped in and saved the day with a great price and selling me a sufficient quantity to last a while. I highly recommend this product for people who like snacks, but like to eat healthy!

review/summary: Sometimes gooey, rich peppermint!
review/text: Yum, I think that's about enough to say! These are an absolutely FABULOUS after dinner mint, not the usual mint either. The filling is very strong and refreshing, and can also spice up the after dinner coffee drinks you may be serving.  The center can be gooey but I've found that if I place them in the freezer, take them out about 30 minutes before serving, that this completely solves the problem.  I don't normally mind gooey myself, but I do know that others don't prefer mints with goo.  Great dropped in a mug of hot chocolate too - I'm known as the neighborhood gourmet hot chocolate lady! The dark chocolate adds an extra richness to a regular cup of chocolate.  Great, great stuff.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: I love this Ghirardelli Mint Chocolate. Perfect for after dinner or dessert. It tastes just right.
review/text: This Ghirardelli Mint Chocolate tastes really good.  The chocolate isn't too sweet nor too bitter. It is also not too creamy or milky. As far as the mint filling, it adds some more sweetness to the Chocolate, but at the same time the mint is very refreshing. Perfect to have after dinner or as dessert.<br /><br />If you like Mint Chocolate, you might also want to try the After Eight Mint Chocolate. they are very good too.  Also try the Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark Chocolate which is kind of interesting taste (a combination of chocolate/dark chocolate with white chocolate and peppermint crust).

review/summary: Warning - These contain beef gelatin
review/text: These are delicious.  However, those who are trying to avoid eating products with gelatin should be warned that as the date of this review, Amazon's ingredient list is missing the fact that these contain beef sourced gelatin.  That's why I can't eat them anymore.  On the bright side, though certain people may consider this slumming, I think that Haviland Thin Mints <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YEJRZ6">Haviland Dark Chocolate Thin Mint Candies</a> are every bit as good, and contain no gelatin.

review/summary: It's just one thin little waaafer...so good
review/text: I get a bag of Ghiradelli Squares every year from my admin, for my birthday--it's a tradition. Last year it was caramel. This year, I'm going to leave bags of these around so he gets the hint that I like MINT chocolate, too.<br /><br />The squares are my favorite little treat. They are just enough to satisfy a sweet tooth and not so much that you feel you've overdone it. And the individual wrapping makes it hard (well, a bit harder) to overindulge. One square seems to work for me. The chocolate is nice and dark, the mint is creamy and minty enough to show up and make you take notice. They remind me of those "After 8" mints that got so popular in the 80's and made a cameo in a Monty Python film, with disastrous results. But as long as you don't mix up all your dinner in a gallon bucket, you should have room for a little one of these for afters. Nice to serve with coffee to guests, by the way.

review/summary: Delicious Addition To Any Cold Vegetable - Turned Salad
review/text: Have been ordering delivery from a local steak-house, each time with a large salad.<br /><br />When remembering how I loved peas & corn, I ordered those and the California mix frozen from Schwan's plus of course the Pfeiffer Ranch Dressing. I spoon a portion of either veges in a bowl, sprinkle some nutmeg <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00269YPBS">Simply Organic Nutmeg Ground CERTIFIED ORGANIC 2.3oz. bottle</a>on top and let it thaw. When I am ready to serve, I mix in the Ranch Dressing.<br /><br />The dressing is just right! It is perfectly creamy, adds a wonderful freshness and brings out the vege-taste without overpowering it.<br /><br />The definite plus? It's less expensive than freshly delivered salad, and just as good.

review/summary: good soup, but rip-off price
review/text: This is my favorite of the Thai Kitchen soups.  The broth has a tangy taste, and since the noodles are not fried they are lower in calories and better for you than the ubiquitous instant ramen noodles.  I like to add some frozen veggies and/or precooked meat to the soup to turn it into more of a meal.<br /><br />But....  Amazon's price is something of a rip-off.  I can get these for $.79/packet at a local natural foods store and I'd expect to pay less than that when buying them in bulk.  I'm sticking with shopping locally for this item for now.

review/summary: Best chips around for protein and iron
review/text: 31 chips in a serving and I have to count them out or I'll eat the entire bag and have all 4 servings at once!  This is an outstanding product that only suffers from having more sodium than I usually consume.  Regardless, the light, crisp, dippable, scoopable, stuffable snacks are now the favorites of my family and friends.  When I find a product that I like, I tend to give it as gifts so that others can enjoy my discoveries.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D693CS">Simply 7 Lentil Chips, Sea Salt, 4-Ounce (Pack of12)</a> is my personal favorite variety, seconded by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D6044O">Simply 7 Lentil Chips, Creamy Dill, 4-Ounce (Pack of12)</a>.  I'm not sold yet on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D67K78">Simply 7 Lentil Chips, Bruschetta, 4-Ounce (Pack of12)</a> variety, but many of my friends prefer the Italian seasonings.  The chips remind me of mini pappadams.  These are so simple to slip into the mouth and kids adore them, too.  If you're looking for a new healthier savory snack, I don't think you can go wrong with these.  It's amazing just how tasty lentils can be!

review/text: My son loves all the Ella's Kitchen fruit & veggie pouches (along with Plum Organics as well). But this chicken meal... yuck. Not only does it not smell appealing, but it tastes awful. My son is 11 months and eats everything I put in front of him, but this Ella's Kitchen chicken meal (along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Z9W4X6">Ella's Kitchen chick-chick Chicken Casserole with vegetables and rice - 7 pk</a>) is something he refuses to eat. I literally spoon it in his mouth and he sticks out his tongue and pushes it out as quick as he can.<br /><br />The only way I got him to eat this is by mixing it with fruit baby food (with a ratio of 2:1 fruit to chicken). I recommend sticking with homemade chicken. I have not tried other meat-based baby foods but given how Ella's Kitchen tends to be incredibly tasty, I can only imagine how bad other brands' food must be.

I can't recall the exact names of the other types of "Greenies" out there and there are only a few, but regardless, she didn't like any of them.  We moved on to another type of treat because I didn't think there was ever going to be another "Greenie" type treat that would measure up to the original.  On the outside chance she might like these, I gave them a try.  Turns out she really, really likes them.  So my search to replace the original "greenie" is finally over!

Thanks to Amazon for not letting the strawberry newton fall victim to what I regretfully refer to as "Hydrox-ing."<br /><br />As for my order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA15B8">Fig Newtons, Strawberry, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>, I didn't think that my expectations could be exceeded (after all, I was ordering an entire case of my favorite treat.) But the package arrived promptly; furthermore, Nabisco has designed a new "freshness seal" alleviating the only drawback of the newton - the stale, dried-out cake resulting several days after a package has been opened. This, plus a healthy dosage of sodium benzoate will ensure the existence of strawberry newtons for many months to come.<br /><br />Thanks to all who were involved in this. You made my day.

review/text: I used to buy this from Trader Joe's until they stopped selling it. I have no idea why they did, because this is like crack. (Trader Joe's sells private label merchandise, and The Spice Hunter produced this product for them.) Thankfully, The Spice Hunter sells it as well! We were overjoyed that this product is still available because it's simply the most ridiculously good spice combination we've ever had. It's salt free! It also works tremendously on chicken and fish! This is a must-have!

review/text: Tradder Joe's may have discontinued this combinaton of spices (and it went by the same name) but I have now found it at Amazon.com. Sprinkle on your beef and enjoy a great tasting meal. The spices in this blend are a little bit more coarse, especially the pepper, but the flavor you get is wonderful! I have used it on cheaper cuts of beef such as chuck steaks and beef ribs, and cooked them on my Farberware electric grill and the results were comparable to cooking them on an outside charcoal grill. Delicious! This blend is salt free and you may need to add a little salt for taste. I would highy recommend this item.

review/text: I read the book 'Water and Salt' several years ago which is why I began buying this wonderful salt. If you've ever researched salt, you'd find that typical white table salt in it's 'cleansed' state is a lifeless chemical. As a result, the body sees it as a poison and must work very hard to try to eliminate it. This is why many people are ending up with high blood pressure as most of the American diet is full of processed foods full of the (white salt) poison. Himalayan Crystal Salt is very healthy and safe to cook with and helps to balance the body as it is loaded with many trace minerals. It is also more healthy than sea salt. Think about it....our oceans are getting more and more polluted. It is a bit expensive, but your health is worth it. Check it out. Then you'll get rid of all your table salt and replace it with this too!

review/summary: incredible product and useful for helping asthma or any other lung problem
review/text: I am using this product now. I will discuss both the himalayan salt inhaler and the himalayan salt itself and how I use both.  I am asthmatic and have been so since I was 3. I find the salt inhaler helpful but I still use my regular inhaler which is minimal. What I am finding out is that when I drink the himalayan salt twice a day that is helping cut down my asthma. I drink one teaspoon in the morning and the evening. It doesn't taste to bad but I get it down fast. I also use warm water. That approach is making some differences. I use the himalayan salt inhaler along with my other inhaler. The salt inhaler makes my lungs feel good. Asthma is a lower tract problem visiting the lungs or at least if you read about asthma ascarsis it has a full cycle from the lower tract into the lungs. Not a fun problem. My dad and grandfather had asthma and who knows how far back the problem exists. It isn't genetic but a bacterium that is very hard to kill. The drinking of the himalayan salt helps to alkalize the body but it also does some unique tricks of its own for what it is. It is an wonderful mineral supplement of many minerals in addition to the salt. Salt kills anything and is a killer of germs. The process has to be used daily as once asthma and lung problems exist, the fight is on to keep the lid on it. It isn't an easy street problem that can be quickly resolved. I use the himalayan salt drink now to kill what causes asthma and I will continue to use it to keep the problem at bay. It has cut down my allergies tremendously so I'm a big fan of it. The inhaler I really like. It makes my lungs feel good. I can breathe a lot deeper with it I've noticed. I've had mine over about two months now and progress is with both techniques I am talking about. Please note I am not talking about table salt or sea salt of any kind; I am talking about the himalayan salt. It is the only one that has this incredible balancing and healing property to it. I am seeing some wonderful results by drinking it. And believe me asthma has been so miserable for me that drinking it is nothing. If that solves the problem and gives me my life back and my energy, I can handle it.<br /><br />Update on the above:<br />I use the "sole" that you make with the himalayan rocks. I have gone to using just one teaspoon of sole in a glass of water in the morning on empty stomach. It is far more effective than doing this teaspoon a day with regular himalayan salt which is what I started out with originally but modified the procedure as time went on and as I learned more about the uses of himalayan salt. I'd not suggest to anyone using a teaspoon of regular salt in a drink of water; it is too much salt for anyone with asthma. It is incredible stuff, but creating sole is with the himalayan rocks and water. You add the rocks to a glass container of water that has a lid and let it sit. You keep adding rocks every 24 hours until the rocks stop dissolving and then the sole water is ready but just do one teaspoon in a glass of water and preferably on empty stomach waiting for one hour to get the best impacts and then you are done for the day until the next time. The sole is highly concentrated at that point. When the water gets down add more water and more rocks and let it sit for the 24 hours before taking anything out. If the rocks dissolve add more rocks. A box of the rocks will last a very long time.<br /><br />Hope that helps clarify the process.  Use the himalayan rocks to create sole water and do not drink the himalayan salt by itself--too much salt for anyone in that fashion.  The salt inhaler is impressive.  Tiberius

review/summary: Salt by Mother Nature
review/text: I'm not sure about the validity of the "scientific" research the maker claims, but this is what I do know about this salt.  This product although expensive is superior to grocery store salt.  This is mined from deep in the earth before we started trashing the planet.  Regular sea salt is from sources that can't help but be at least a little polluted.  The popular pollution free option in these modern days is to make table salt.  This manmade salt is pure sodium and chloride, and lacks the minerals that makes salt nutritious leaving only negatives and no, "salt of the earth" left.  It's a sad state that we live in that it costs so much to buy a quality salt that has the natural trace minerals we need for good health.  (these minerals are available from plant sources, but you have to eat tons to get the same amount)  On a positive side, a big bag of this lasts my two person household about a year using only this to salt food or cook.

review/text: I ordered this a month ago and have been using it in place of table salt since. I have to say, I want to believe the claims of this salt so I am hoping it's true. Everyone that has seen it thinks I fell for another scam from the over-hyped nutritional market. I will go one using it until I see data that proves contrary to this companies claims. It is moist (and pink) and I am keeping it in a glass jar. I do believe that table salt (Morton's etc.) is nutritionally devoid of minerals,etc. and it always burned my mouth/tongue like a chemical, so I never cared for table salt. But our bodies need salt so, Himalayan Crystal Sea salt is natural and nutritional--but expensive. Well, anything that has value today is expensive!!!!

review/summary: Himalayan Granulated Original
review/text: My adult daughter ( who has long been out on her own, raising her own family) recently stayed with me for a week. Several times, she asked what made my food taste so good and because of "Mom pride" I attributed it to her just eating Mom's cooking again. But then I remembered that I never was a very good cook and my kids all turned out to be far better cooks than I. After much discussion about "taste" we narrowed it down to the Himalayan salt that I use. We went immediately to the computer and I ordered a box of the Himalayan salt to be sent to her house.  Now, she's back at her home and she told me how much better her food tastes since she's been using the salt.<br /><br />I've been using the salt for quite a few years and I've never noticed a salty after taste in my mouth, especially in the morning. But when ever I have to eat in a restaurant (or someone else's cooking) I do notice a salty taste in my mouth in the morning. I'm not saying this salt changes my life drastically but it does add enhancement to the taste of food.

review/summary: Incorrect information about fluoride
review/text: It is very unfortunate that something finally IS amazingly helpful to human beings and people would try to squash its spread by creating false claims about it. The science on Himalayan salt is actually very clear...the mineral content of the Himalayan salt is extremely well balanced and there is absolutely no way that someone using Himalayan salt therapy would end up with an elevated level of fluoride. For those spreading these rumors, how about you also present some scientific research? Extensive studies on the benefits of salt therapy have been conducted in Poland and China, and the bulk of this research (mostly unknown in the US) supports the use of Himalayan salt. As for the location of where the salt comes from, the salt does come from Pakistan--but "Pakistan" is just a human-created boundary. This salt was created as the original primal sea began to evaporate--the salt crystals were formed simultaneously as the plate activity created the mountain ranges in that area. The salt crystals that resulted were therefore tucked up inside the mountains. So it's all in how humans choose to define their borders today whether it is from Pakistan or some other country...who cares where it actually comes from if it is safe and helpful? And that's really the bottom line for me...as someone using Himalayan salt for several years now, I have personally seen a huge benefit.<br /><br />The one way to make sure you are truly getting Himalayan salt, though, is to look for the light pink variety--because this light pink color comes from only one mine in the world! Hopefully the unscrupulous business people will not try to color rock salt, too!

review/summary: Good, but with a caution
review/text: This is a very nice, clean tasting salt that is less "salty" than regular table salt.  However, you should be aware that it does not contain iodine (only the slightest trace), so if you do not eat a great deal of seafood and kelp you will have to take an iodine supplement.  As far as it containing "80 additional minerals," there does not seem to be any solid evidence for this, although the pink color would suggest some iron content.  If you're checking out this salt as a result of reading the book "Water and Salt," be aware that there is not a shred of scientific evidence to substantiate any of the health claims made in that book.  It is purely the work of a vivid imagination.  But the salt is nice and I use it.

review/summary: use less salt with this...also nice taste
review/text: Surprisingly, I need less salt with this product. The other minerals (other than sodium chloride) must give the saltier taste. Also, it adds character to whatever you use it on. It's a faint creamy color, fairly fine, and comes in a cloth bag. I put the bag in a tight jar, and took out just enough for a covered shaker. I think it might get hard like the old-style salt used to if exposed to air...just a hunch. I really like this, and hope that it doesn't have any (bad) contaminants. It comes from Pakistan. It's a bit pricey, but should last a while, and it's worth the adventure. ;)<br />I'm ordering a second one as a gift for relatives who love to cook.

review/summary: Best non-whey non-soy alternative
review/text: Edit: Upgraded to 5-star.  They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!

review/summary: Egg Protein Review
review/text: I found this to be a good alternative to whey based protein powder. I have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering. Before I get into my review, I might mention that I never thought of myself as whey or lactose intolerant, but after 3 months of taking quality whey protein I knew that what I was experiencing was not typical. (I'm talking about bathroom habits including frequency and consistency). I asked a few older guys in the gym what there experience was with whey, most if not all where fine with it and experienced no problems or side effects. One natural BB that is about my age late 30's suggested this egg based protein product and noted that one of his training customers found it to be an acceptable alternative to the milk based protein products.<br /><br />I did some research and to be honest the manufactures web site for beHealthyNFit is totally useless and outdated with little or no useful information. Their poor web site almost made me not buy this product. It sure didn't invoke any consumer confidence and in my opinion is totally unacceptable.<br /><br />How does it taste? I bought the chocolate (I'm not a chocolate lover but I think chocolate flavoring is the best option for protein powders) The flavor is chocolate but its defiantly not a rich milk chocolate and it wouldn't fall in the same category as a dessert. More of a taste that you can get used to.  I have also seen this flavor described as chocolate with a hint metallic. I'd agree with that. It has an after taste that some may find metallic.<br /><br />How does it mix? I mix this with water directly in a 16oz. ready to drink water bottle. I drink 1 or 2 ounces, usually down to the top of the label. Then I place a funnel in the top and dump in one scoop. Usually I will need to shake or tap the funnel to get the powder to pass through. Then I screw the top on and shake well. I have found that if the water is very cold the powder will clump more often and mix poorly. Room temperature water or water that is cool but not ice-cold works best. I use a wine fridge to keep the water at 50.( I don't like clumps) Note: The consistency is exactly like water, if your expecting this to be a thick or heavy drink then will be disappointed.<br /><br />I found that if you live in a humid state like Florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight. If you expose this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly.<br /><br />General tips for drinking protein drinks. I have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps. First biting the granola bar then taking a drink. I found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable.<br /><br />Is there room for improvement? Yes, loads of room for improvement. Is there anything better? I haven't found it yet but I am still looking. I will give this high marks until I find something better. Please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product.

review/summary: Superb when you can't take whey or even when you can
review/text: This product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat. The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea...

review/summary: a tip for improving consistency
review/text: I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion- not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular brand is the best I've found.

review/summary: This is a great alternative to whey
review/text: I've been a fan of HnF's egg protein for a while now as whey bloats me and gives me indigestion (that being said, the ONLY whey I've found that doesn't bother my stomach at all is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BOTGTM">Optimum Nutrition 100% Platinum Hydro Whey Turbo Chocolate 1.75 Protein</a>).<br /><br />The chocolate tastes pretty good with water (although I don't really care about taste), and is actually pretty darn good with rice milk. It also tastes good in smoothies (I use frozen bananas and rice milk).<br /><br />Only downside is you may get gas initially and you're going to smell things that no human should smell. This passes pretty quickly (huhuh) though.<br /><br />Oh and don't buy the vanilla flavored powder because it tastes like soap. I use it in smoothies and it lends a little vanilla flavor but it's still not very good.

review/summary: tasty...but too sweet
review/text: compared to other egg proteins I have recently used, this one is very sweet.  It is sweetened with splenda, so still very low in actual sugar/carbs.  I prefer to use an unsweetened version and put fruit in the blender with it to naturally sweeten it, but my wife likes this one b/c its easy to instantize in milk (we use almond milk) with a spoon.  No blender required.

review/summary: Low calorie, high protein, great taste
review/text: I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs.

review/text: I use this as a whey/soy protein alternative. I am allergic to soy and have sensitivity to whey and this product seems to be free of both. I actually haven't used it as a shake, but I use it to make protein pancakes. I find I have to add extra cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey and stevia to make it more sweet. At first I came out with some really awful pancakes, but after I found the perfect ingredients to doctor it up, they all come out amazing!!! So if your looking for an alternative to whey and soy, I definitely think this is a good choice!

review/summary: The Best Protein Out There
review/text: In my opinion, this is the best protein powder out there.<br />I've used a lot of different protein products, from Dymatize to Optimum Nutrition (Gold Standard) and CellTech (MuscleTech), BSN, many others as well.  The reason that I tried this one is because I've been doing a lot of research, talking with my doctor and nutritionists regarding the subject of protein and protein suppliments in general.  The conclusion that I have come to is that the whey products are ok, but they are not the magic dust that everyone thinks it is.  Sure it is good, and the protein is not bad, but it can be better.<br />For those who have issues with dairy, whey is not an option.  Whey is a dairy product, and actually a bi-product of diary production.  Dairy is not the best choice of protein out there, many may disagree with this but it is a fact.  America has an infatuation with dairy and sweets.  If you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact.  Eggs and Fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body.  Eggs are around 88% effeciency, while fish is around 70% and chicken around 60%.  Whey and dairy are below all of these, this is precisely why whey is so cheap, and that is why it is so popular.  Sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive, but it is a better product.<br />As far as taste and texture, I find it just as good as the whey products that I have used, and even better then some.  I've tried some whey powders that were just aweful.  I have a 5lb tub of "Metabolic" whey that I tried, it is still sitting in the back room.

review/summary: Very good nutritionally, but expensive and clumpy
review/text: The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix

review/summary: A Protein Powder to make you Gag.
review/text: I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new "worst" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've tried a number of protein powders over the years.  Most problems I encountered ranged from poor taste, to not mixing well, to leaving me bloated.  The Healthy n Fit egg protein is only 100 calories and you get 24 grams of protein with no cholesterol, no fat, no carbs, minimal sodium (in the big scheme of things) and even some potassium.  Add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I don't feel bloated with this at all like I did with other products like Muscle Milk light.  I usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then I use it straight right after a good workout.  Again, it tastes great on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I strongly recommend this product.

review/summary: Best Natural Protein
review/text: Having a lactose intolerance, I've tried multiple egg proteins as well as some Whey Isolate proteins as well. This is hands down the best tasting protein powder out there. Vanilla and Chocolate are both delicious (I would stay away from Strawberry, it has a strange artificial taste to it, this was the updated formula too so they still haven't worked it out). I prefer to mix with some Vanilla Coconut milk and it's actually something I look forward to drinking (as opposed to some that I had just choked down as quickly as I could). I have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well.<br /><br />Another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame.<br /><br />If you can't handle Whey/Casein protein then I would absolutely recommend this one (even if you can but want to try something else). Best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good.

I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AND CAME ACROSS THIS.  SINCE ONE OF THE REVIEWS SAID THAT IT WAS SOY FREE I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE TASTE WITH ALL OF MY HEALTH PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT A LOT IN THAT DEPARTMENT.  IT JUST TASTE LIKE WATERED DOWN CHOCOLATE TO ME.  I DRINK IT WITH WATER OR SOMETIMES WITH RICE MILK BECAUSE I NEED THE EXTRA CALORIES ON DAYS THAT I CAN'T HANDLE SOLID FOODS.  HOWEVER,ON RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, IT DOES CONTAIN SOY. HOW MUCH I COULDN'T SAY AS IT WASN'T LISTED ON THE INGREDIGENT COLUMN.  I FOUND IT MENTIONED ON THE BACK OF THE LABEL STATING THAT IT CONTAINED SOY LETICHEN(THINK I SPELLED THAT RIGHT).  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH.  IF SOMEONE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INFO. ALSO,I NOTICED THAT IT HAS GONE UP ABOUT $10.00 SINCE I PLACED MY ORDER LAST MONTH,SO IT MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE ANYMORE, BECAUSE THAT PUTS IT ABOUT EVEN WITH WHAT I WAS PAYING FOR THE JAY ROBB EGG WHITE SHAKES.

I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint.

review/summary: Best Mint Ever
review/text: Tried these for the first time on vacation in Australia.  I could not find them anywhere back home in the states.  Thank you Amazon.  These are the best mints available for my money.  Shipping is prompt.  Items always arrive in perfect condition.  Price is comparable to what I paid in Australia - a bargain.

review/summary: the salesman's secret
review/text: I work in sales and often take clients out to eat.  When I need to get my breath fixed in a hurry, I reach for one of these!  Love the taste and love that they're sugar free.  And my dentist loves that too! :)<br /><br />If you're doing something where you need fresh breath, I highly recommend these.

review/text: Good mints, I am hooked on them as they helped me quit smoking cold turkey 3 years ago. Amazon also has a decent price too, cheaper than most supermarkets and other stores around here.

review/summary: Go-to mints
review/text: These are hands down my favorite mints. I wouldn't say they are stronger than Altoids per se, but them seem more effective as a breath freshener. Can't seem to find them locally anymore, so as long as Amazon keeps them in stock I will keep buying them.

review/summary: Fresh Mints!
review/text: I love Eclipse Mints and lately I've had a hard time finding them in stores, so I ordered them from Amazon.  The mints arrived in a timely manner, and were very fresh!  I like that I don't have to go from store to store, only finding tic tacs, etc.  Most stores carry the Eclipse gum, but not the mints.

review/summary: Great product and evengreater service!
review/text: My husband, a reformed smoker, goes through quite a number of Eclipse mints every day. The local wholesale house used to carry them years ago and stopped. While the price from Amazon.com is only about 2 cents less per tin than our local stores, it's convenient to be able to order 16  or 32 tins and get free shipping (when I combine this purchase with others). The service and delivery were great, so I ordered more this week!

review/summary: Still the Best
review/text: The eclipse mints started with the Pepermints then went to Winterfrost and after Winterfrost went to other flavors.  They will never surpass Winterfrost.  Its the best on the market.  Too bad they aren't cheaper.

review/summary: Awesome Delicious Relish
review/text: Patak's has been a favorite of mine for years. This particular relish; 'Hot Mango' is very good! Not only does it have just the right amount of spice but the body of the relish has plenty of flavor that does not get overridden by the 'Hotness' of it. It goes very well with couscous, baked into a casserole, or as a side to curry.
