review/summary: Italian sweet cream
review/text: This creamer actually tastes (and smells) a lot like sweet whipped cream with no other strange flavors added to it. It was also good when added as a topping other foods that you would normally put whipped cream on.

review/summary: Sweet Cream Coffee Creamer
review/text: I drink my coffee BLACK, but as a treat or wanting a cold iced coffee, I will add creamer and make my own rather than purchasing expensive coffee drinks. This flavor is perfect. Has a nice taste without tasting overly sugary, which I personal can't stand. I would recommend this flavor. I cannot get it on my store shelf either , so the subscribe and save is a good deal. I get six containers and the expiration date is in June of 2012. So it's a ways out there. I also add this to warm milk or boost a cup of cocoa. It is versatile and really good. Two thumbs WAY up!!!

Getting an economy size case of this via Amazon it is pricey, but worth it in my mind.  So glad they stock it :)

review/summary: sweet....my aunt bibby!
review/text: i agree with all the positive reviews regarding taste, speed of shipping, etc.  my complaint is with amazon.  it seems that they are not restocking their "sold and shipped by amazon" in a timely fashion.  is this a ploy to get their third-parties a chance in the market?  if it is, it is not working on this customer.<br /><br />case in point....purchased this sweet creeam november 4, 2010 - 6 pack for $25.20.  this was sold and shipped by amazon.  now you have "madselling2011 asking $64.95 with prime", "world wide sales asking $53.99 and $10.82 ship". and bringing up the rear is "taj4u with $59.98 plus $17.99 ship.<br /><br />amazon doesn't sell....so....i am going to pay almost $100 for four small ounce jars of cream.  no one is getting my business when business is done like this.  it is the same with the 2 pack of maxwell coffee.  amazon stopped sell/ship for $20.00 so their third-party can sell same for $35 plus shipping.  this is a no-no win for amazon and their third parties.  it seems like all my "suff" is being put on hold by amazon for longer than i care to think about before they pick up again.  i go to the grocery/drug store now instead of amazon when i have to deal with third-party over-over pricing.<br /><br />p.t. barnum said something about "a sucker being born every minute"...well...not in brooklyn...and this review is from someone who really loves and uses amazon....a lot!!!!!

review/summary: Oregon Vanilla Chai Tea is easily the best chai tea on the market
review/text: Slightly less sweet than the Dunkin Donuts' version, Oregon Vanilla Chai Tea shares an otherwise similar taste, but at half the calories. I got hooked to the DD version about 5 years ago and went on a search for a similar product I could make at home. After sampling every other chai tea available, I can say with confidence that Oregon easily makes the best product. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is the high sugar content. In fact, sugar is the ingredient listed first on the ingredient list, which means there's more sugar in this drink than anything else. Of course, it's still less sugar than DD, but that's my only reservation about the mix.

I prefer the depth of flavor and sweetness of these to other brands such as Tazo or Big Train, or other lesser brands too. Bolthouse makes a good one, but it must be purchased refrigerated, and these mix with water, milk, or soy milk easily and well.

I've never cared for the concentrate versions (they always seem a little too sweet) as much as the individual powder mixes from Oregon Chai.  It's all about adding just a bit of milk to make it taste just right!  As mentioned in another review, for some reason stores everywhere seem to no longer be carrying this particular product and I have no idea why when the shelf was always sold out when they did stock it.  I'm just happy to be able to stop searching now that I've found it on Amazon so it's never a crisis when I run out.

review/summary: The Classic American Ale Yeast
review/text: This is the ubiquitous "Chico strain" used by legions of home brewers and professional brewers alike.  This yeast strain was developed by the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, and is what is used to ferment Sierra Nevada Pale Ale among many other beers. The Wyeast "smack pack" is a great delivery system for yeast.  After smacking the pack to burst the inner pouch of nutrients, the rate and amount the whole thing inflates tells you how active and viable the yeast is.  Quite an effective system and I can't say enough how much I respect Wyeast products.<br /><br />I have used this particular yeast strain extensively as a home brewer and find it to be great choice for almost any kind of american style ale in which you want to showcase the flavors of the hops or malt used instead of focusing on flavors derived from the fermentation process itself. Wyeast 1056 works exceptionally well in hoppy beers like pale ales, India pale ales, and double/imperial IPAs, as well as American interpretations of amber ales, stouts, porters, etc.  It has pretty good alcohol tolerance (higher even than what Wyeast reports, I believe).  Some say this yeast doesn't flocculate very well but I have found that is not a problem so long as the finished beer is left in the refrigerator undisturbed in a keg or bottle for a week or two.<br /><br />All in all this is a superstar yeast that everyone should consider a staple in their brewing arsenal.  I know I surely do!

review/summary: A staple for the home brewer
review/text: 1056 is one of the best yeasts out there, especially for IPAs.  It is clean, attenuates well, and gives you a fairly speedy fermentation.  Every time I've used it, major fermentation was complete in about three or four days.<br /><br />With this packaging, creating a starter isn't necessary, even for higher gravity beers.  Take it out of the refrigerator first thing on brew day, smack it, and by the time you're ready to pitch you have a fully activated (and hungry) yeast colony.<br /><br />1056 is my go-to yeast whenever I have a big beer.  It's a great strain and the Activator pack makes using the liquid culture hassle-free.

review/summary: Salt Rationing
review/text: This was a fine product. The amount of salt was recently reduced<br />by 30%. To me it tastes like a 75% reduction. It can no longer be called<br />a "SALTY STIX". The new name should be the "BARELY SALTED THIN DIET PRETZEL".<br /><br />I complained about the lack of salt and they stated that customers wanted<br />a less salty pretzel. They also sent me another case of the "BARELY<br />SALTED THIN DIET PRETZELS". More trash.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LS2PEG">HK Anderson Salty Stix, 3.5-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JRRUG">ANDERSON SALTY STIX BOX</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L7HZ8U">HK Anderson Ultrathin Pretzel Stix, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: From Best to Worst in an Instant
review/text: I used to love these and even used to travel to Chicago to buy them at Meijers. Then I found them on Amazon and ordered a case every month or so. Like others, when I got my last case (a few months back), I though it was a bad batch and we called the company, only to hear what the others here heard. They deliberately made them inedible (for me and my wife, and others it would seem). If I want unsalted, tasteless pretzels, I don't have to order them online, I can get them anywhere. So Sad. Does anyone realy like these things anymore? More importantly, does anyone know where to get any real "Salty Stixs" since these aren't them?

review/summary: Went from great to crap
review/text: In 2011 the salt all but disappeared.  These use to be a great small 'salty' pretzel.  first I thought it was just a bad batch.  Nope.  I contacted the company and was told they had listened to their customers and reduced the amount of salt....... that's an understatement.  If you like a small salty pretzel these are not what you want.

review/summary: Terrible remake of a once great pretzel
review/text: After raving and recommending Anderson's pretzels, I just received my second case. Indeed, they retooled the recipe, and there's almost no salt. What a shame. I'll be throwing the entirety of this shipment in the trash, and then touching base with those I'd recommended them to and tell them not to bother.

review/text: New Review<br />Well, as some other posts noted, they dropped the salt content in these and now they are just like any other bag I could go get at the store. No more order from me until they change back.<br /><br />Old Review<br />These pretzels are just like the old Mr. Salty's. The first order I received must have been handled roughly in transit because they were not as salty as the order I just got. Great snack, great value. Not too long ago, HK Anderson's also made a version of these with a light honey coating, but I think the regular ones are the best... very nostalgic.

review/text: This is an outstanding product I live in Nothern California and have searched all of the supermarkets in my area looking for thin pretzels.  I could not find any.  I found the "HK Anderson Salty Stix" at Amazon.  These are exactly what I wanted.  They are very thin, crunchy, and salty.  Im very happy that Amazon sells these pretzels when I run out I will buy more.<br /><br />HK Anderson web site claims to sell thier pretzels at Costco.  I found that they do sell peanut butter filled pretzels at Costco but not the ultra thin "HK Anderson Salty Stix".<br /><br />I am getting low and will place another order with Amazon soon.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />3589

When we found them, we had to order a case immediately. These pretzels are crunchy, salty and very thin sticks. Just the way stick pretzels SHOULD BE. We've tried other pretzel sticks but they are thicker and not as tasty as these.

review/summary: Date on case ordered was expired
review/text: I was very disappointed to receive a case of pretzels in September which had an expiration date of July!  It was easy to obtain a refund from Amazon, and I contacted H.K. Anderson to let them know of the problem.  They initially responded quickly and asked for additional information so they could track the problem.  I haven't heard their findings in almost two weeks.  Regardless, I am taking a chance and placing a new order today.  I have also been disappointed in the quality of the pretzels and recently learned from these posts that a change was made.  Not only are they less salty, but they are also not as thin.  Fingers crossed on the new order!<br /><br />01/26/12: Just want to provide an update that Amazon and H.K. Anderson have corrected the problem, and provided me with pretzels that are great.  Will continue to order these, and appreciate the good service!

review/text: I have loved ultra thin pretzel sticks since Mr. Salty used to sell them.  Then for decades I never saw an other ultra thin pretzel sticks and didn't even know if any were available anywhere.  Then I saw them at a local department store and was ecstatic.  But then, after going twice, they discontinued them - these are the ones that were at the department store.  I was disappointed but decided to give Amazon.com a shot and see if I could find them here.  And I did!  They even have a subscription plan where you can get a case every month, 3 months, or 6 months and the price for a case is reasonable (especially if you go with the subscription at which time your shipping is always free - just buying a case costs WAY too much with shipping).  I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of having to have a subscription just for free shipping but you can cancel at any time.  And I found that having a case on hand is nice and so we're getting them every 6 months - that gives us time to eat what we want, share with our grown kids and grandkids and still give us time in between orders to not get sick of them.  It's great - I highly recommend these - especially if you love ultra-thin pretzel sticks like I do.

review/text: As expected these pretzels are wonderfully thin and salty. So much better than pretzels found in grocery stores! Why we can't get them locally is a mystery to me.  I don't eat potato chips and love pretzels so these are worth getting via Amazon.  Could be saltier like the ones I've had in individual serving bags in the past.  This case will last awhile but I will buy these again.

review/summary: Best Pretzels Ever
review/text: First off, you should know that I love pretzels. They're my favorite snack by far. I've had hundreds of different styles and pretzels. Good ones, bad ones, great ones.<br /><br />As the title states, these are probably the best pretzels I've ever had. They're the perfect pretzel, in my book.<br /><br />The pretzels are very thin, crispy sticks. Not too hard, not too soft, the perfect crisp to them. They're baked to the perfect level.<br /><br />They have a great amount of salt on them. For such small pretzels, they manage to get a good amount of salt on there, and they also manage to actually make it stay on the pretzel fairly well also.<br /><br />In short, these are high quality pretzels at a great price, and are the perfect snacking pretzel. Order them, and enjoy!

review/summary: excellent drink !!
review/text: I have enjoyed the apple drink very much, especially on cold afternoons, or a late evening "snack".  I still drink it but not as often in hot weather.  I find that ordering it by the 3-box amount is very convenient.<br /><br />Thanks for carrying it.<br /><br />I purchased this at Amazon.com

review/summary: One happy diabetic
review/text: I got one of these kcups in a sample pack a few months ago.  I've been hesitant to try it as I am not the biggest cider fan.  I looked up the nutritional info- 10 calories, 1 carb- if it's not sweet enough, I have Splenda.  So I brew it and my kitchen starts smelling like a caramel apple.  I found myself fanning the steam from the cup towards my face.  My first sip was heavenly.  I decided to put it over ice since it is summer and it's great cold as well.  I am one happy girl right now as I keep drinking it.  Try it.  You'll love it.

review/summary: My favorite K Cups!!  Only 10 calories!
review/text: I was a bit scared to order these, because of the mixed reviews...I honestly cannot figure out how it's possible to NOT love these!  They are probably my favorite K Cup beverage...AND the cheapest, to boot!<br /><br />I am used to drinking artificial sweeteners (diet soda, Splenda, etc.) -- maybe some people didn't realize that these were sugar-free (i.e., people don't know how to read product titles & descriptions)?  If you're used to straight-up sugar, maybe these would taste off, like people think diet soda tastes bad if they're used to regular.<br /><br />As a diet soda drinker, these taste awesome to me!  I seriously want to drink one or two of them every day when I get home...and by the way, it's June now, so I imagine in the winter they'd be even better.  :-)  I think these also taste good cold.  I make them on the 10-ounce Keurig setting -- 8 ounces and they're too sweet...which is great, since I get 2 more ounces of cider.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd say give them a try...they're cheap, and I think they're awesome.  I guess just make sure your taste buds are used to artificial sweeteners, and you'll probably love them too!

review/summary: OBSESSED!!!
review/text: I am absolutely OBSESSED with these k-cups. I don't want to admit to how many of these boxes I've gone through in the past few months. It's embarrasing.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, sweet and tangy. It's better than any other hot cider drink I've tasted and the best part is, it's sugar-free and only 10 calories. As a treat, I like to top with fat free whipped cream -- it seems like SUCH an indulgence, but it's very low in calories!<br /><br />As someone who is always watching watch I eat, I do not like to "drink" my calories if I can help it -- which is why I shy away from the other hot cider/hot chocolate/teas for my Keurig. Most clock in at around 60-80 calories, so I only have one every few days or so. I can't drink one after another...like I do with these. See? I told you I was obsessed!<br /><br />All that said, I am someone who is USED to eating/drinking artificially flavored/sugar free drinks. I'm a diet soda/Crystal Lite drinker, so the taste isn't anything "new" to me -- in fact, I don't quite understand what all the complaining is about these k-cups on here is all about.<br /><br />You can't beat the price -- I'm on the subscribe 'n save plan but I am already ordering more frequently than that because I drink these k-cups like a fish!

review/text: I love Grove Square Spiced Apple Cider Cups (single serve cup for Keurig K-Cup brewers).  I am not a coffee drinker like my husband and wanted to try something more than just hot chocolate with his Keurig.  I thought I would try the Spiced Apple and love it.  The bonus to this product is that it is SUGAR FREE.  I highly recommend this-- winter or summer.

review/summary: Tastes Like Chemicals
review/text: I was very disappointed.  I love good cider, having grown up and gone to the mill each year.  I like most grocery store cider as well.  This stuff was really bad, tasted to me like raw chemicals.  Went through 4 or 5 people who spit it out directly.  Not my machine, they liked the tea and coffee and even ran hot water between to see if that was it.

review/text: Like many of the reviews here this household agrees that the taste of this sugar free cider is horrible.  Don't know if it's the heat with the artificial sweetner or what but it's horrible.  We tried it hot and over ice.  Either way it's horrible.  We are a household that drinks plenty of diet soda too so it isn't that we aren't used to artificial sweetner either.

review/text: I was excited to get this and had high hopes. I've been pretty disappointed with anything not coffee. I found the taste of this strange for Cider. While it isn't terrible, it isn't good either.<br /><br />I think it is just the artificial taste that got me.  It is a bitter sweet taste that wasn't all that appealing to me.<br /><br />I tried 3 different settings for this.  The smallest setting was down right bad.  The medium and small-medium are alright.

review/summary: Great for a diabetic
review/text: As someone who is used to artificial sweeteners, I have to say that these were exactly what I hoped for.  Are they a little extra sweet?  Sure.  But let's be honest, I haven't had real apple cider in years and this was close enough for me.  If you're watching your blood sugar and would like a non-coffee/tea treat for your keurig, I recommend these.  The caramel ones are decent too, although they are stronger than these in my opinion.  A single 24 pack is a fairly reasonable price, try it out for yourself.

review/summary: Too Sweet
review/text: The sweetener used in this over powers the flavor.  It has a decent aroma but the closest approximation of taste I could give it is hot apple juice with extra sugar.  It may appeal to someone that likes very sweet drinks without the calories.  I enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AWTR6M">Green Mountain Naturals Hot Apple Cider</a> and was hoping this would be a caramel flavored, less calorie laden, version but was sorely disappointed.

review/text: I'm not a picky eater but this is by far the worst tasting thing I have every had (and I've had Moxie). It has a bitter taste almost like warm pennies and the flavor stays in your mouth. I couldn't even finish the cup and don't plan on using any of the others. Not only does it taste bad but the smell itself as bad as the flavor. I would not recommend this product!

review/text: In December 2011, my husband and I visited Colonial Williamsburg VA. Their cider is absolutely fantastic and I just loved it. I thought I would never find anything like it at home.  When I saw this product, I thought perhaps it might be similiar and I wasn't mistaken.  It is so great. Drinking it brings back the memories of a wonderful vacation to Williamsburg.

review/text: I buy little powdered cider packets at the store by the hot chocolate and occasionally simmer my own hot cider. My Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider was the third K-Cup I tried (I just got my machine for Valentine's Day). I figured it should be used at a lower water setting so I went with 8. It smelled great while brewing but tasted AWFUL!!! I now have 23 K-Cups I need to find a home for.

review/summary: really strong flavor
review/text: When I made the first cup, I was not sure about the taste. It is more caramel than apple flavored and seemed a bit too sweet. But after making it again, it was more like having a dessert! Now I am enjoying it. There are so few sugar-free k-cups available with the various fancy things, so I appreciate finding this.<br />UPDATE:<br />I made another cup of this drink today and I chose the largest size cup to brew in my Breville k-cup brew machine. That was a good thing, as the flavor was not so highly intense. It was most enjoyable when the flavor was not as concentrated.<br />Next, I will try using the "iced drink" setting and see if this flavor is good when done as an iced beverage.

After a few days of debating, I finally decided to purchase it, and I am so glad I did. It is very sweet and a little bitter, but what else would you expect from something that is caramel apple? In my opinion, it has a nice rich flavor, without the artifical or chemical tastes.

review/summary: Best spiced apple cider for Keurig Yum!
review/text: All of us love this hot apple cider brewed on a 10 oz setting with a cinnamon stick or two in the cup.  It tastes like hot apple cider and has 0 calories, great for diabetics, and it has Vitamin C.  Other hot apple ciders have no Vitamin C so why not have a little something extra?  I drink in the evening and after working outside in the cold.  I plan to buy more to make sure I have enough on hand thru the spring/summer.
