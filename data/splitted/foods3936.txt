review/summary: How to stir the best peanut butter on the market
review/text: This is by far the best peanut butter I've ever had. This is all I need if stranded on a desert island. There is an easy way to stir this peanut butter. Take a hand drill and attach a beater from a hand mixer. The hand mixer itself isn't powerful enough.

review/text: The jerky tastes good, the texture is good, taste is good, not oily, not dry.  The pepper taste is very light - I have had some pepper jerky that almost made me choke on the pepper (I like pepper) and this jerky just tastes good - the taste of pepper is there but very mild.  This is well worth trying.

review/summary: Tastes just like a slim jim
review/text: DO NOT be freaked out by the ostrich! This tastes exactly like a slim jim- it is shorter and fatter in size, but the flavor and texture are the same. You would never know you weren't eating 100% beef. Gave it to a few friends telling them it was a slim jim and they loved it. They had no idea it was anything but. I wanted a high protien snack that was not as fatty as a slim jim- they leave a gross oily residue in your mouth. This product is low fat, low carb, high in protein and tastes great (seriouly, just like a slim jim). *The Ostrim Natural has no nitrates.

review/summary: This stuff is awesome - VERY TASTY!
review/text: I bought the Ostrim with a little apprehension never having eaten any Ostrich meat.  After I had my first bite I KNEW I would be ordering more!  This is one of the best beef sticks (ok beef and Ostrich) that I have tasted, not only that it is very low calorie and high protein (which helps you feel full longer) and is all natural.  I'm not even half down with my first order and I already ordered a second batch.  This is just really good stuff, if you like beef jerky and beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  When you eat it the stick has a snap to it, tastes clean, not oily / greasy or fatty.  You taste just meat and before you know it you've eaten the whole thing and are thing about another.

review/summary: Acquired taste and great when delivered fresh
review/text: This tastes nothing like a slim jim to me so for those that claim it does, either they haven't had one in a long while or their mind is tricking them.  Most of my friends get a whiff of it before they try it and turn it down.  I'm Asian and trust me half of our food doesn't look tasty or smell good, but is often very good.  I love these sticks.  I will admit they are probably going to be an acquired taste for some.  I've only bought the natural from amazon.  I tried some of the other flavors and found them a poor product.  Their additional flavors were in harsh contrast to the natural flavor of the ostrich meat so I can see how some would see it as a turn off.  My personal opinion though.<br /><br />Like a few other said, I don't like the inconsistency.  Sometimes the quality is good, sometimes not. I'm wondering if there are dips in the ostrich meat market where they have to sometimes use meat they normally wouldn't.  Or if they were left in bad conditions too long during transport.  If the saltiness and dryness were consistent each time, I'd be much happier.

review/summary: Teriyaki Flavor
review/text: Got to say when I bought these I was worried about the ostrich, not  going to lie.  When they arrived however they  tasted great, on top of that they're low in fat and great for protein.  This is the exact reason I bought them because I'm trying to lose the last few pounds while gaining muscle. The thing is though that I still think Jack Links tastes better.  Jack Links Slim Jims are high in fat however but on the other side there jerky is low in fat and on top of that around 20g of protein per pack. I gave this product a 5/5 because it was so low in calories and still tasted good but I will say when I finish off with this last bit of body fat then Ill probably switch over to Jack Links because the higher amount of protein. Still great product because it's healthier, 5/5 stars.

My favorite flavor is the original, followed by the peppered. This is also a great price per oz.

Honestly, one stick and piece of fruit is a substantial "snack" that keeps you full for a while.  It's great that Amazon offers them on ship and save - - makes the price really affordable, too!

review/summary: Addictive, healthy beef jerky
review/text: As I become more aware of the nutritional values in foods, I try to find a good balance between taste and nutrition.  Ostrim has done it with this product.  I love regular beef jerky, but wanted a lower fat/sodium snack.  At 60 calories per pack with 1.5 grams of fat and only 290 grams of sodium, I found the nutrition I wanted in my jerky.  The taste actually exceeded my expectations, yes it is lower in sugar and sodium, but it still has a good meaty flavor and is much like a lean cut of meat.  The pepper flavor is light, but compliments the meat instead of overpowering it. I have now been eating this jerky for over a year and still think it is a good "healthy" snack for when I have to have some jerky.

review/text: Finally, a high protein snack which really is just that- high protein, without excess fat or carbohydrate. VERY good for almost any diet, but especially for a low carb OR low fat diet. Require no refrigeration, easy to carry around, fairly easy to open. These sticks, at 1.5 oz., are larger than many similar products out there. One consideration- these are a bit higher in sodium than I would really like to see, though no higher than other similar products. The only problem I have had with these is eating too many! I have tried another flavor of these, and found the teriyaki flavor to be better.

If your are not a vegan or vegetarian, you will find that these are a good tasting and uncompromising way to get high quality protein as a snack instead of some garbage at the convenience store.

review/summary: Best Jerky Ever
review/text: I purchased an Ostrim High Protein Snack at a juice bar after the gym one day, because of its high protein/low carb/low fat properties, expecting it to taste like a stick of cardboard, and was surprised at how good it was. I purchased a second snack as a novelty item (Ostrich meat) for my teenager, who loves beef jerky, and was stunned when he thought it was delicious. I immediately ordered two cases of Ostrim from Amazon (MUCH cheaper than buying them retail), and now my son takes one to school everyday for a midday snack. Who knew there could be healthy beef jerky that tastes great? Ostrim is AWESOME!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CU0N36">Ostrim High Protein Snack, Beef & Ostrich, Natural Flavor, 1.5-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 20)</a>

review/summary: Healthy snack alternative
review/text: These snack sticks pack lots of protein, have very little fat, and best of all, taste great.  They tide me over til the next mealtime, and I can feel good about eating them.  I've tried several flavors, and they're all very similar in taste, and they all taste kind of like Slim Jim's, except they are drier (less fat).  It's an easy, healthy way to incorporate more protein into your diet, without adding unwanted fat and calories.

review/text: I love the fact that this product is not greasy.  I love the fact that I can throw it into my purse at the last minute on my way out the door to work and then later onto a night class at the university.  It keeps me from going crazy at the vending machines.  You do need lots of water.  It is a little twangy, I guess is the word I would use, but it tastes good.  I am so excited to have something with high protein and low fat that is so easily accessible.  Thank you.

review/summary: PERFECT PROTEIN SNACK
review/text: These snacks are great!  The natural flavor is a lot like the Slim Jims we ate as kids.  Only these are healthier!  Great to carry in purse to keep sugar from getting low while on the run.  Also, my job has me on my feet with no breaks!  It's easy to grab one and enjoy it to keep going.  Low in fat and calories but high in protein.  Forget that mid day sugary candy bar.  Grab on of these! A no-guilt snack!

review/text: These taste great, and are very low in fat compared to other beef sticks.  They are very low in calories, and most of the calories come from protein.  I have used these while hiking, and usually keep a few in my car for a healthy snack so I am not tempted to go get fast food.

review/summary: Good, recommend
review/text: I bought the Ostrim while looking for a lower fat alternative to a Slim Jim. This is one of the best beef sticks that I have tasted. It is not oily or greasy like a Slim Jim.  It is low calorie (80 per stick), low fat (1.5g and only 15 fat calories) and high protein (14g).  If you like beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  I've tried the Pepper and the Natural flavors. Both were good, but I liked the pepper just a little better. The pepper flavor is not overwhelming, just a little spice to it.

review/summary: Tasty but why dairy?
review/text: Looking for low carb snacks without dairy or egg (which I am allergic to), I thought this would be a great snack.  It tasted awesome - but I read the label (my fault for not doing sooner) and saw it contains milk.  Would get 5 stars if I could eat it.  Ingredient list is missing from Amazon website, and that information would have been nice to know before I ordered.  However, at least the guys in the house love the taste.

review/text: I got these because I don't usually like the grainy protein chocolate bars and these are better but high in salt.  My favorite flavor by far is bbq, it doesn't taste like bbq chips it takes like a mild slim jim.  The worst in my opinion in the teriyaki, basically because its too salty and not very sweet like you would want a teriyaki.  Original and pepper are ok but I actually look forward to eating a bbq

review/summary: OK Tasting "Protein" Snack
review/text: I bought these as an alternative to protein shakes, tuna, or cold cuts when I wanted a quick protein-based snack.<br /><br />I have only tried the Natural flavor.  They're a bit salty and taste very similar to slim jims, but they are less greasy and MUCH larger.<br />Packaging is easy to open and not messy.<br /><br />The problem is the protein content: Just 14g/42g according to the nutritional info.<br />For reference, a standard can of tuna has two servings of 14g/58g protein.  A scoop of protein powder is about 28g of protein.<br />Also, despite what the product description states, it has 1.5g grams of total fat per stick.<br /><br />In short, a decent, but expensive, product if you are looking for a slim-jim style snack.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to protein powder for cheap protein, cold cuts/tuna when I want a protein-based snack, and some nice specialty Jerky when I want splurge on something chewy and flavorful.

review/summary: Major Ostrim Fan gets Major Food Poisoning - Timeline of Events
review/text: As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks.  I was dead wrong.<br /><br />After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.<br /><br />About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets.  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below.  Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill.  I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.<br /><br />The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.<br /><br />Timeline of Ostrim Food Poisoning<br /><br />Event..........Date..........Time<br />Order from Amazon..........2/11/2011<br />Package Arrived ..........2/16/2011<br />Discard of inflated (decomposed) ..........

review/summary: Pretty tasty for what it is, maybe a little too big?
review/text: High in protein, low in fat, not greasy but you know you're eating a meat snack.  Smoky flavor is pretty good but I find that about 3/4 of the way through I'm about done with it, it starts getting just a bit too dry and a bit too bbqy.  I've been breaking them in half and eating the other half later.  My dog was quite thrilled with it when I left it on the table.  After reading that it was the #1 sports nutrition meat snack on the label, my 7 year old son started requesting them for his school snack, then began asking for extras for his friends.  I wonder if there is a #2 sports nutrition meat snack?<br /><br />I use these and several similar products to boost my protein intake on days when I'm running a bit low.  Perfect as one of a handful of tools suitable for that purpose.

review/text: I like this product a lot and I think they're very tasty, but SO SALTY. I'm one of those people who love a lot of salty foods and will always add salt to everything I eat, but even I think these are way too salty. Luckily I like them enough and the nutritional stats are great, so I'm going to stick with them. My only other complaint is I just got my second order and the outside of the stick is SO tough, like it's stale. I'm hoping it's just a fluke with the one box, but if it continues, I may have to cancel my order, as it was pretty bad.

review/summary: Great Tasting and Satisfying!
review/text: I've been looking into finding more high protein snacks with low carbs and calories and this snack fits the bill.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the high sodium content.  I'd really like to see a lower sodium version of these sticks, even if it's just removing 100mg of sodium would be great.<br /><br />But it tastes great, everyone in the family likes them.  I've tried the spicy pepper from a local store and loved it, but it would have been too spicy for the kids so I purchased the 2 boxes of terriyaki from Amazon.  I'll probably buy the spicy again and just horde it for myself while getting bbq as well so the kids can have those.

Not sure if it's the milk content (I am lactose intolerant), or what other ingredient may be causing it, but I now only eat one or two of these a week. Again, could just be me, but wanted to warn others of this benign, but potentially humiliating, side effect.

review/text: Maybe I should have picked up on the name "Jerkee" but this is not even close to regular jerky. I don't actually mind the label on front that says "nonfat dry milk added, chunked and formed" but I'm weirded out by having sucralose added to my jerky. I can also say that although the flavor (pepper) is nice, I am definitely not a fan of pink soft flat moist "jerkee."  Its texture is kinda like eating raw hamburger meat yet it's extruded appearance makes it even less appetizing. Some people may love it but just be aware that this is not jerky. I used to buy the Wild West brand of jerky here on amazon. It's flavorful and not very sinewey or tough, yet it's real jerky. I'll force myself to finish this stuff and then go back to that or try another brand.

review/text: One of our two finniky cats loved the little "shredded wheat" pillows. 50% in this case is excellent, since both had been repulsed by a half-dozen or more previous products (mainly the tube-lube genre).  Effective?  I planned on including the results in this initial review but decided a month was not long enough, so  the verdict on how well they work will have to wait another month.  Procedurally, however, I fed the one cat on both the regimens for existing hairballs and for preventing potential ones.  A month in and no hairball contributions.  I can, however, report now on my opinion of the manufacturer's customer service:  LOUSY:  I emailed a few questions relating to using the product most effectively and received no reply whatsoever.  If Amazon allows, I will update this review mid-November, 2011.<br /><br />UPDATE.  Two months in and no hairballs. Strange and amazing.  Strange in that M&C is just the usual petro-malt "tube lube" formula in a crispy coating. Even my "non-picky" cats do not "prefer" the tube-lube experience BUT yet they relish the M&C treats, even when broken open and the petro-malt is exposed. The secret is not in the coating, since I scraped some off and used as a flavor enhancer with no effect (See my CAT-MAN-DOO SPRINKLES REVIEW).  Amazing in that after the front-loaded dosage for existing hairballs, I cut back on the dosage even further than advised.  Instead of the recommended two "pillows" every other day I reduced that by half to one "pillow" every other day. And most of the time I would even skip weekends, which amounted to a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule. This stretches the [65] "pillows" in the 50 g. package from two months to four months of servings and reduces the cost to a little over a dollar a month. NICE. Also nice is that M&C is available on Amazon, PetCo online, and PetCo stores for about the same price. The only thing better would be if our pets unanimously agreed on M&C as their preferred hairball treatment.  Unfortunately our pickiest pet has chosen another brand (VET*BEST CAT LUBE, reviewed separately). It works for her (so far) but I doubt the practicality of splitting the tablets of the VB product into small enough (effective) servings to make it as cost-effective as M&C; even if I ground the VB tablets into powder. But I probably will try. ONE FEEDING TIP: The 'pillows" are fairly large and look more "bite size" if divided. THE ONLY NEGATIVE:  M&C still has LOUSY customer service: no response.<br /><br />LAST UPDATE: See my separate review of PET NATURALS HAIRBALL CHEWS for a summary of my experiences with all three products.  Hint: M&C comes out on top for value and PN for acceptance (and ingredient quality). M&C is now called HEALTHYBITES HAIRBALL REMEDY in a white instead of the metallic bag. And my apologies for the scattered information.  I would have preferred to review them all in one place but the separate trials extended over such a long period and I did not work out in advance a way of consolidating them into a neat package.

review/summary: These treats are great for hiding pills
review/text: I have a cat that has hyperthyroid disorder. Unfortunately, he does not like the Greenies Pill Pockets. He just eats around the pill and will spit the pill out. I found the Defurr-UM treats are perfect. He loves the crunchy texture. I break the treat in half and push the pill into the gooey middle. It helps to give a non-pill treat first, then the pill treat, and while he's eating the pill treat I give another non-pill treat under his nose on the floor to make sure he swallows his pill. Works like a charm every time. Plus Defurr-UM treats are cheaper than the pill pockets. It's a must have in my home.

review/summary: Defurr-UM cat treats
review/text: Fussy cat who benefits from hairball medications.  He takes these as treats and they help a great deal.  I give two per meal (twice a day) plus two as treats in the evening.  They have a crunchy outer shell.  Have not found a way to get gels into this cat.  I used to use product from Pounce, which they discontinued.  Pounce had soft shell and I could hide medicine inside them; can't do that with Defurr-UM.  Conversely, these work better, help much more with the hairball problems.  Recommended.

review/summary: Been pleased going on 6 years now!
review/text: (I started purchasing these "good-for-them-treats" at a local pet store when I adopted my first cat.  When they stopped carrying them, I had to start ordering via online.)  My cat is usually a picky eater- she's not big on anything "human food" related.  I was at first hesitant to give her these, seeing as I'm all about ingredients; and she usually won't eat anything new unless it smells like fish.  However, first scent smelled like a baked piece of chicken, and unlike the hairball pastes, she didn't seem to mind the malt flavor filling!  She chooses to eat theses first over any "treat" she's given (except a can of tuna fish ;)).  I think they're supposed to be "crunchy" on the outside, but the filling always makes them more "soggy".  I usually break one in half and give it to her every few days.  She is now almost 7 years old, and has only ever had a few hairballs in her lifetime. Giving these ever-so-often, a good dry food, and a brushing every other day during shedding season has saved us a lot of trouble.

review/summary: package we got was dried out and no good
review/text: I really don't know what the product is suppose to be like or if it works.  When we opened the package they didn't smell very appealing and our cat had zero interest in them.  The picture on the package indicates the centers should be soft and rather liquid.  When we cut one in half the ones we received seemed dried out and somewhat hollow in the middle.  It may be the package was old or defective.  We did not try to return them but just disposed of them.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised!
review/text: I purchased these about a week ago for my long-haired tuxedo.  The cons are the smell (the cat doesn't seem to mind, though) and the size.  My cat has a relatively large mouth and teeth but has trouble eating them.  Despite this, he loves them and is happy to eat more!  Most importantly, his random hacking noises and actual hairballs have stopped thus far.  In the past, I've tried hairball remedied food as well as some pastes that I've purchased from the vet (he hated those) and nothing has worked as quickly as these.  Highly recommended!

review/text: These treats are great for my cat, Arthur who is the pickiest cat ever and they work!  I agree they are very expensive especially with the shipping charge but I'm from a small town so by the time I drive to buy them it's worth the price.  Would love to hear about any stores in SW MN that sell them cheaper.  Another trick I have found with hairballs is buying Purina One cat food for Sensitive Systems.  It's very reasonably priced, my cat loves it and it has really reduced the amount of fur balls on my carpet by a great deal!  Purina did not pay me to write this.

review/text: I love the clean, crisp taste of Zevia, and the Cola flavors have always been my favorite. The caffeine free Cola is probably the best in this pack for me, as I love having one with dinner, but do not like drinking caffeine after 4pm. The regular Cola is just as delicious, and its great for waking you up early in the morning or after lunch. Lime Cola is great as a cocktail, the lime flavor is just right, not too much not too little. The cherry cola is similiar to other cherry colas, but for some reason, though I like Cherry Coke Zero, I always give this to my husband, who is only too happy to drink it. ;) Great price, great flavors. I just cant resist this case of Zevia!

review/summary: Tooth breaking!
review/text: My 12 year old dog was never touched these treats... that is, until I had to put him on steroids (prednisone) and anti-seizure medications (phenobarbital) that made him ravenously hungry! Previous to his medications, he would turn up his nose to any of Science Diet's dry treats - they weren't palatable, were too hard and dry, and were hard to chew into. Now that he's on his medications, he'll eat them, but with no real zeal. He jumps and begs for other treats, but simply carries these dry, hard treats onto his bed, where he eats them at his leisure.<br /><br />So, if you have a chowhound who will eat anything, go for it. That said, if your dog has dental disease, I'd avoid them - these treats are so hard and crunch so loudly, I worry it actually hurts my dog's teeth to chew on these.<br /><br />My dog's review of this treats palatability: two thumbs down.

review/text: I have 3 adult German Shepherds, who were having some tummy problems about a year ago on the food that they were currently eating.  It was also Lamb and Rice, from another manufacturer.  My vet suggested we try Natural Balance because many of the other dog food manufacturers were upping the amount of grain in their mixtures to cut down on price and Natural Balance was grain free.  We've been on it for a year and the constant diarrhea is gone.  My dogs love it!  Sometimes for a treat I mix some of the bison and sweet potato in, they love that too.  Even better is that we can buy it from Amazon for less than Petco even if we pay tax and shipping.  Great deal.

review/text: These are just basic M&M's so if you go to the store and look at the bags by the register, you are getting the same product. This just happens to be about 4 times the size for about 8 times the price. but i guess that's the price you pay for solid colors. That being said it is the same product, same flavor, same freshness as store shelves. one thing to consider when buying is your vendor. I purchased from M&M directly and got a nice bog with padding and a reusable cold pack. Maybe lost one or two to cracking. I ordered from a 'Free Shipping' vendor on Amazon and received half of each bag shattered and it arrived in a poorly padded envelope. At least it wasn't melted I guess.<br />Great product, if you like M&M's, somewhat market priced, nice gift/theme idea.

review/summary: Not a good deal at all
review/text: First off - that photo is misleading, it shows you a BOX of formula leading one to think you're getting five boxes of them. Not true. Bought at a store, the box will have two packs and if you buy this item, they will send you five of those packs and not five of those boxes. Second - simple math. Five packs = 2 1/2 boxes. One box of formula at a store is about $30 (conservative estimate). Therefore, you're paying $114 for something that'll cost you at most $80 if bought at a store. Where's the savings??<br /><br />I admit it, I did not read through the fine print and like a chump ordered the five pack congratulating myself on such a great deal. It's not a deal, it's overpriced formula and I'm kicking myself for buying it. Shop around. Walmart sells four boxes for about $135. THAT is a deal.

review/summary: Not What I Would Expect From Son Kite.
review/text: I was first introduced to Son Kite back in 2000. I was going through my psycho trance phase and decided to give this group a go after a native of Sweden recommended the duo. So I did, but I had a very bad migraine that night and learned that headaches and trance are not a happy union. The collective eventually grew on me and that was around the time when their first CD Minologue came out. Shoot forward four years, and along comes Colours. This CD is pimp. It is much more dance-friendly in my opinion than other things Son Kite have created. While Minologue was flat-out psychedelic trance, Colours ventures out into different genres. I can hear tidbits of progressive house, epic trance, and even a jazzy feel in these nine songs. Personal favorites include Jukebox, Games and Watch, and Focus. <p>I recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of somewhat underground dance music.

review/summary: Crunchy yumminess
review/text: I am a sucker for all things crunchy and these are some of my favorite crackers. They are not fat or very salty and are USDA organic. They are very thin and go with everything from peanut butter to cheese. I love the kick from all the different seeds they have, like anise. I snack on them all the time!

review/summary: This is the catnip spay to use
review/text: I have used catnip spray for many years. I generally put it on new scratching posts that I want the cats to use and I renew the spray from time to time just to keep them acclimated to the use of the posts and not the curtains. When toys are no longer interesting, a bit of spray livens them up. If the cats are bored, I spray the toy of the moment and that  gets kitty minds off the mischievious and back onto the game at hand.<br />I noticed that the bottle of spray that I had been using had lost its ability to interest, and it IS about 5 years old, so I decided to get a new bottle and naturally turned to Amazon as the easiest source for my need. I was dismayed to note that many of the sprays for sale had gotten bad reviews. Writers had stated that this or that spray smelled bad, or did not work, OR Smelled bad and sent the cat away instead of providing entertainment. So I carefully looked through the availability of various sprays and settled on this one.<br />It is made by a reputable company that specializes in products made from naturally grown herbs.<br />When the spray arrived, I first used it on a cat scratching product that had been a favorite, but had lapsed into disuse. After carefully spraying it, I waited a few seconds (literally) and here came my grey kitty with huge dilated pupils. He looked at me briefly and plunged right in and began rolling, playing and scratching. Then the shyer girl tiptoed over to see what the fun was and joined in.<br />So that I could get into the fun fest, I sprayed "Da Birds" (one for each cat) and hung the birds just out of reach of the kitties. Here they came and the games began. We played for about 15 minutes.<br />So I am well pleased with this products and so are my kitters.It was just what I had in mind. As usual with catnip spray, I can detect no odor, though I believe some people can smell a bit a a minty fragrance.<br />I certainly recommend this product as "The catnip spray to use!"
