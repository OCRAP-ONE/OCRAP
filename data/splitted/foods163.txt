review/summary: Perfectly Fancy!!!
review/text: My 9 year old absolutely loves it!  Of course she is a fancy Nancy fan and whenever I sit down to have my Latte, she feels all grown up to have her fancy hot chocolate with her Mommy.  Love the taste and aromatic coconut scent.  I think its great she loves it and its different, she loves it and that is the most important thing she feels she now has her own special drink like Mommy when we cozy up to hot drink.  I have to find some more as she is upset she has ran out and we were lucky to find this one at Home Goods, now have to see where I can order some.

review/text: This cocoa is like any other cocoa, other than it is white and turns pink when touches liquid.  The tin is cute, but 2 cans were dented when they arrived. Not sure if it was from shipping or the seller.  A bit over priced in my opinion as well.

review/text: I bought these along with several other Raggedy Ann & Andy hot cocoas.  The Beary Blue and Pink Hot Chocolate both came with dented cans. I'm not sure if they came from the seller that way or if this happened during the shipping process, but I decided to keep them anyway.  This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin. Kids seem to love that it turns blue once it touches the milk or water.

review/summary: Luck O' the Irish Hot Chocolate Mix
review/text: Good thing I got this from the bargain bin or I would really be perturbed. Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the "cauldron" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of "hot chocolate" per container if you like the "flavor" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand.

review/summary: AN ACQUIRED TASTE
review/text: Purchasing the Glace De Volaille Gourmet Gold Roasted Turkey Stock from Amazom. I used the reccomended old world gravy recipe of sauteing onions, carrots in duck fat with a cup of wine. It did not inspire me.  The traditional basted American Turkey with pan drippings for gravy cannot be substituted.  The aroma of a fresh turkey in the oven stirs the senses, exciting the cook to prepare for a perfect gravy.  This cannot be duplicated in a gravy package that is designed for a gourmet market that prefers its gravy, deaden in wine, brown onions and thyme. Maybe the old world tastes are more astute, but my American gravy will remain simply traditional.  The Glace De Volaille Gold Roasted Old World Gravy recipe, well it went into the trash.

review/text: These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment.

review/summary: Awful aftertaste
review/text: I love white chocolate.  This one didn't taste anything like white chocolate usually tastes.  It had a flowery mixed with off milk taste that I found offensive and had difficulty getting out of my mouth.  It was expensive so I managed to get it edible by melting the block and mixing it with a substantial potion of pure cocoa butter and pure vanilla.  I can not recommend this product at all.  I was shocked considering that Callebaut does make good chocolate, but not this one.

review/summary: THE BEST CHEESE EVER!!!
review/text: If you haven't been introduced to Saint Andre soft cheese you are not living.  It's like Brie mixed with butter.  The flavor is milder then Brie and the texture is very much like fresh butter.  It's firmer inside then Brie, especially a ripe Brie.  I can't imagine it is very heart healthy but makes the absolute best baguette for breakfast instead of butter.  I am a cheese person and I eat cheese from a number of EU countries and this ranks as one of if not the best.  Enjoy and keep the red wine flowing.  Buon appetit!

review/summary: Mild and flavorful
review/text: I ordered this in mid October 2009.  The bags were dated February 2009.<br /><br />A friend of mine had visited this region of Guatemala and had brought me back some of the coffee beans from his trip.  I was astounded by how the coffee lacked the bitterness you can find in most other coffees.  There also seems to be some hints of cherries or some other nutty/fruity flavor.  I have used multiple grind settings when using this (drip coffee maker) and found that it tolerates a very fine grind well.  The looser grinds and small amounts of the coffee can leave this weak though.<br /><br />Highly recommend this coffee.

review/text: The listed ingredients at Amazon are correct but incomplete. Item also contains beef base (FIRST ingredient) & MSG (THIRD ingredient), neither of which we will eat in our household. Those ingredients were omitted on the product page by accident, they say. Really?!?!?!?!<br /><br />Moreover, the package we received contained crusted seasoning on the container, and the package was dusty & yucky. I literally had to wash the canister & use a bit of elbow grease before even reading the ingredient list! This is a food item, for gosh-sakes. Should have repackaged and refused delivery right then & there.<br /><br />A bad experience with Amazon with this one, that's for certain. Would have never purchased in-store, much less handled or brought into my home. I can't believe Amazon is shipping food products in this condition. I'll definitely reconsider my purchase of grocery items here.

review/summary: Product is great....packaging/shipping is so-so
review/text: These biscuits are excellent and have become a staple in my cupboard. I will have to agree that the packaging and shipping from Amazon leaves a lot to be desired. I have received two shipments on this product. The first shipment was great with little to no crumbling or crushing....as good or better than what I found in my local grocer. The second shipment arrived in very poor condition. The box looked like it had been dropped kicked a couple of times. There is no effort to cushion or protect these biscuits from shipping damage. The six biscuit packages are simply put in the shipping box, and shipped. My first shipment was obviously a lucky shipping experience without need for cushioning, but the second shipment had obviously been mishandled. If you're listening amazon....you need to start using air pillows with this product, and enough of them to actually work. My last experience has left me wary of ordering again without improvements to the shipping packaging.<br /><br />Product = 5 stars<br />packaging = 1 stars

review/text: I love these biscuits with tea in the morning and haven't been able to find them anywhere locally. I was delighted to find them available at Amazon and after reading a few reviews that sounded as if the packing problems had been taken care of, I ordered a box of 6 packages. The biscuits are great, the packing...not so much. All six packs were stuffed into a small plastic bag which was crammed into a bubble bag which was wrapped in bubble wrap and placed into a box with air pacs stuffed around it. Four packs are mostly crumbs, the other two had a lot of breakage on the ends. I think they might have been ok if they hadn't forced them into the too-small bag and bubble bag in their zeal to over-protect. Maybe carefully wrapping each pac individually in bubblewrap and placing them in the center of a box of air pacs would get them delivered in one piece, but I doubt that will happen so will not bother to order them from Amazon again...

review/summary: An English Classic
review/text: "Rich Tea" are the quintessential English tea-time biscuit, to be served mid-afternoon with a fine cup of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3WS7K">English Tea</a> (taken with milk, not lemon). And McVitie make the finest "Rich Tea", having exactly the correct texture and firmness and delicate flavour which these biscuits should have. "Rich Tea" are also the ultimate dunking biscuits, for which purposes they must, of course, be entirely whole and not cracked even in the slightest, otherwise they will instantly fall in half and disappear to the bottom of the cup. Even whole, these biscuits present the maximum challenge to the dunker -- leave the biscuit in the tea just a fraction of a second too long and, again, you'll wonder where your biscuit went (and why you have blotting paper at the bottom of your cup).  [American readers please note that dunking is, of course, entirely frowned upon in English high society, as an activity undertaken only by the peasant classes. It is thus to be indulged in only when entirely alone and in the privacy of one's own home, when there is no danger of being observed by the servants.]<br /><br />Should your biscuits arrive broken, as may, unfortunately, be all too likely (as these are a fragile biscuit and McVitie's packaging consists of no more than a paper wrapper) do not despair; all is not lost. Simply tip a quantity of the broken biscuits into a bowl and pour hot milk over them. The result may look like soggy blotting paper, but the eating experience is exquisite!

review/summary: Perfect snack
review/text: I'd purchased these based on the reviews here and their reputation abroad. A delightful little tea-time/anytime snack, these little cookies do remind you of graham crackers in taste, but they're not as sweet and have a slight baking soda aftertaste that remind me of Violet Crumbles. The consistency is course grain but crumbly. In your mouth, the cookie falls apart into small crumbs like what you'd find on a graham cracker pie crust.<br /><br />Amazon did a wonderful job in shipping. I know a lot of people have stated that theirs came in crumbled, but almost none of mine were broken. Mine arrived as a box inside a box and had bubble wrap and tacky tape that tried to keep each roll stationary. But another reason for their good condition might have been that they didn't have to stay in transit long. It looks like mine came out of Florida, and they were delivered to South Georgia. Either way, I'm extremely satisifed with the quality and shipping of my purchase.

So I went to Amazon.com and searched for it, and here it was.. the delicious biscuits with the red and blue cover. I ordered it right away and I received it within two days. I have to admit that the biscuits were tasty, however the packaging was not vey good. Once you tear the wrapping cover you notice that the biscuits on the top and the bottom are crumbled. The problem is the biscuits crumbles very easily, so I am not sure whether it is fair to blame the packaging for the crumbled biscuits.<br /><br />Would I order it again from Amazon.com? most probably yes.

In order to protect the biscuits bubble wrap has to completly wrap the product.

review/summary: Selling McVitie  Biscuits close to expire April 2011???
review/text: Believe that it is not right to sell a package of 7 boxes of McVitie's Digestive Biscuits less than a month before they were scheduled to expire on April 2011.  If I had known you were going to do that I would not have bought them.<br />Please do inform your customers the expiration date when you advertisement on your website.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: These biscuits go very well with the PG Tips tea I ordered, and they even taste good on their own. Normally I'm not big on this kind of biscuits - they're either too sweet or too bland - but these have a mildly sweet taste that's surprisingly addictive.<br /><br />I'm not happy with the packaging though. In the pack of 7, only 3 turned out perfect, 2 were slightly crumbled, and half of the last 2 were badly smashed.

review/summary: PACKAGING
review/text: Love, love, love the biscuits!  Like other reviews, the packaging needs attention.<br /><br />Our boxes arrived in a huge outer box - with many of the balloon-type bubbles to protect the biscuits. The biscuits being heavier than the bubbles, the boxes were on the bottom of the box - unprotected - and the bubbles were all on top. We did have some breakage.  I would suggest bubble-wrapping the boxes with the large sized wrap.<br />Otherwise, very pleased.

review/summary: Bad Packaging
review/text: These cookies are very tasty. Mildly sweet & satisfying. However, they arrived shrink wrapped to one flat piece of cardboard & a lot of the cookies were broken & basically all of them were damaged around the edges. These cookies have a scalloped edge & by the time they arrived at our door all of the scallops were in crumbles. We've discovered that the crumbles make an excellent crunchy topping for ice cream sundaes, but we're disappointed that these cookies didn't arrive in good enough condition to serve to guests.

review/summary: Excellent source of these hard-to-find biscuits
review/text: I have ordered the 7-pack of these Digestive Biscuits several times. They are delicious with a cup of tea, and are a slightly healthier version of a "cookie" but with more fiber and perhaps not as sweet as the traditional cookie. I agree with previous reviewers that Amazon packaging has been insufficient in the past, resulting in crumbled and crushed biscuits. However, my most recent shipment (ordered January 8, 2012)arrived in nearly perfect condition, in improved packaging, with all biscuits intact. Since this brand is difficult to find in a regular grocery store, I highly recommend purchasing from Amazon with Prime shipping!

review/text: Just received my order. The box was a little beaten up from outside. I was worried that some of the cookies might turn into crumbs. When I opened the box, the worry was gone. It was so nicely packed!! Each pack was wrapped with bubble sheets individually, and any space between the wrapped packages and the box were stuffed with plastic airbags. (See pictures that I uploaded) I will definitely order from them again! However I think the current order can last me for a while :)

The 5 stars is for the product, because mine arrived like the picture above with a few pillows, not enough to keep things from roaming in the box. All had crumbs in them, but I saved them in an airtight container for later use.<br />Amazon what's up with the packers?  I received a case of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V0PXNU">Bisto Gravy Granules for Chicken - 12pk x 170g</a> and they were shrink wrapped together and had so many pillows an ant could not get in, nothing short of stepping on them could hurt these anyway.

review/summary: These biscuits are a staple in my home
review/text: I'm originally from Singapore, and I used to have these for tea-time (around 4 in the afternoon) with my family (a common practice back where I'm from). When we moved to the States seven years ago, I looked all over for these tea biscuits and finally found them at an upscale grocery store, selling for much more than its retailing on this site. I've been buying it from the grocers all this while mainly because I'm concerned at the packaging issues mentioned by many reviewers here.<br /><br />These biscuits, though extremely tasty (sweet but not overly so, and great for dunking), are also prone to crumbling. The mildest pressure will see the biscuit crumble into itty bitty little pieces so if this is being shipped to customers, the packaging has to be able to protect the biscuits and prevent crumbling. The biscuits themselves are superior in quality and taste, no complaints!

review/summary: Excellent product, very addictive, great flavor 3 varieties
review/text: I love McVitte's Digestives, plain or with milk chocolate or dark chocolate topping.  This brand of biscuit, as they are called in England, are a cookie with a slightly less sweet taste than American cookies.  They have a malty wheat germ taste that no other cookie/biscuite has. The closest thing we have would be the Graham Cracker.  The name of the biscuit, Digestive,  is as distinctive as the taste.<br />While they are great for dunking, ya got to be fast! They soak up hot tea or milk like a dry sponge.  If you are not fast enough it will break off into your beverage pretty fast.  It's a game I love to play and quite addicting.  Usually Amazon.com has the best deals available for most English foods.  Check on some of the subscriptions for food and you'll find even lower prices.<br />No, I don't work for either company.<br />I am however as English as Winston Churchill and have lived in England several times in Suffolk County. Very beautiful part of England.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: Excellent product, slightly different than anything available in the U.S. Digestives Biscuits (cookies)are only slightly sweet with a wheat-malt kind of taste.  They are super with a cup of PG Tips tea and a biscuit I would recommend along with other McVities products for informal entertaining.  One warning! OK two.  If you use a Digestive (the name doesn't do it justice) to dunk in your coffee or tea, be QUICK!!! They are actually light and crisp and soak up liquid faster than a Bounty Paper Towel. You'll be fishing out big chunks of soggy cookie.  I've somewhat mastered the art of being a Digestives dunker, but once in a while I have to get a spoon.  The McVities come in three flavors (or flavours) plain, with milk chocolate coating and one with dark chocolate coating.  ALL ARE GOOD! Warning number two: My problem is once I open a packet of McVities, they usually don't last the whole day, even if I'm home alone. They are that good.

But if it says McVities, it should be good.  While you're at it get some PG Tips Tea bags, now you've got a great way to relax.

I would never take it again from amazon, i get it way cheaper in indian groceries, just that stock there keeps getting over and i have to find the right time to get it . but it is better than eating powder.  So somehow review is complicated, since the product is good and amazon has nothing to do with it, the only thing amazon has to do is handling and shipping, which is very badly done. So unfortunately my bad rating will affect the product, but please remember this is a good product, i am giving bad rating for amazon handling and shipping ONLY.

review/summary: The original--albeit a bit tamed
review/text: I went to graduate school in Buffalo, and spent quite a bit of time at the Anchor Bar. On weekends, there was live jazz. Good food. But it was the chicken wings that made visits there special. Once, several of us scored tickets for a Buffalo Sabres' hockey match at the Aud. Before going there, we had dinner at the Anchor Bar. Unhappily, the first one to order requested hot wings. Filled with testosterone, the rest of us simply had to go along. Result? Lots of sweat, a deep burning sensation, red faces. . . . It was a fine adventure--but not necessarily enjoyable! Man, it was raw fire! The medium wings there bring heat--but at a tolerable level.<br /><br />This product represents the Anchor Bar's own recipe. But it is pretty clear to me that it is tamped down a bit, and not as spicy as the actual "medium" wings that you would get if you ate at the Anchor Bar itself. My son and I just tried this wing sauce and ended up adding some Texas hot sauce to ramp up the heat. Perhaps the "hot" version that one can purchase also would be more like the "real" medium sauce at the Bar. That will be our next experiment.<br /><br />Still and all, this is a tasty sauce for chicken wings and I would be happy to recommend it for others. It tastes better than the sauce I made just a couple weeks ago, before I discovered that one could buy it online. However, if you want the fire, maybe have a little Texas hot sauce to spice it up a bit.

review/summary: THE ABSOLUTE BEST
review/text: This is the original wing sauce from Buffalo and it does not get any better.  The best part is that you can avoid deep frying(even though instructions say to do this)...just put 2 lbs. of wings on a cookie sheet sprayed with PAM-bake for 20 minutes at 425-turn over and finish for 15 more.  Toss with 1/2 cup sauce and you're done!!!!

review/summary: The Fig Newmans are an excellent choice for those who are looking for wheat- and dairy-free cookies!
review/text: I'm a big fan of all the Newman cookies, although I can't claim to be Cookie Monster.  These Fig Newmans are delicious, but not quite as good as their competitor we all see in the grocery store.  One important fact that many would like to know it that they are not a gluten free product.  If you need anything wheat- and dairy-free, these are probably some of the best cookies you'll find.<br /><br />Many people do have certain dietary restrictions or things they like to avoid, so I added the ingredients and basic nutritional information below.  I did find a few differences between my packaging and that listed on the Newman site, something that you might want to take note of, especially if you have food allergies.<br /><br />Taste?  They were excellent, but I did find the outer cookie coating to be a bit drier than expected.  Fig Newtons are a bit moister, but these definitely an excellent choice considering the ingredients.  They aren't tops on my list, but were quite palatable.  One of my all-time favorite cookies are the peanut butter Newman-O's.  If you do want a wheat- and dairy-free fig cookie, you can't get much better than this one.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Organic Barley Flour, Organic Sugar, Corn Syrup, Organic Figs, Organic Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Corn Flour, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Water, Glycerine, Natural Flavors, Leavening (Sodium Bicarbonate, Monocalcium Phosphate), Vanilla, Xanthan Gum, Salt, Natural flavor, Soy Lecithin (an emulsifier).<br /><br />A couple of brief notes on the ingredients:  The contents listed on may package differed slightly than those on Newman's site and also in the order of the ingredients.  For example, mine lists vanilla as an ingredient, but they did not.<br /><br />***  There is a cautionary note on my packaging that states:  "Manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, other nuts, and milk powder."  ***<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION:<br /><br />Serving Size - 2 bars (38g)<br /><br />Calories per Serving 115<br /><br />Calories From Fat 15<br /><br /> Total Fat 1.5g<br />  Saturated fat  0g<br />  Trans Fat  0g<br /><br /> Cholesterol 0mg<br /><br /> Sodium 170mg<br /><br /> Total Carbs 26g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber 1g<br /><br />Sugars 12g<br />Protein 2g

review/text: In this cereal, there are muligrain flakes, pecans, and the raisins and dates add sweetness naturally.  I like sweet cereals but don't like the sugar that comes with them.  There is still sugar added (brown and regular both), but there is less due to the dried fruits in the cereal.  Good taste, good texture and visually appealing -- what a great combination.<br /><br />It's very filling and often a bowl of this and a piece of fresh fruit are my choices for lunch during the week.

Amazon's own price is EXCELLENT compared to my local supermarket.<br /><br />This cereal is not too sweet, and quite filling.  I'm on Weight Watchers, and the points value is quite reasonable.  The added raisins, dates, and nuts contribute to the texture, which I find very satisfying (a little chewy, a little crunch ... ).<br /><br />Really good stuff!

review/summary: Loose 'English Breakfast' style Tea (assam), at a good price
review/text: If, like my wife and I, you're blessed with soft tap water, and like a good robust "English Breakfast Tea", I've found that this blend (mostly dark assam) is a pretty decent choice, and a good value.  I believe it's packaged by the same company that makes "PG-Tips" in the handy pyramid bags.  The quality is comparable.  I generally buy the brooke bond loose for making everyday tea by the pot, and I buy pg tips pyramid bags for travelling.<br /><br />Anyway, I buy the Brooke Bond loose on a regular basis - either online, or at a local indo-pakistani grocer.  I've also bought the Taj Mahal label by the same company, but they appear to be interchangeable, and differ only by the art on the box.  The loose tea is in small granule form, and comes sealed in a foil pouch, for freshness ... it's not flushed with neutral gas, and they dont vaccum pack it because they dont want to crush the tea, but otherwise the quality is pretty decent.  It comes in a variety of sizes, buy the most common size I buy is 900 grams (2 lbs) or 1800 gr (4lbs).<br /><br />The resulting tea is not quite as floral as some assams I've had (hey, it's bulk tea), and there's often a modest amount of tea dust in the bottom of the pouch, but the dust is easily removed by pouring the dry tea into a fine strainer, and tapping the strainer over the garbage (to winnow it), before brewing it.<br /><br />In my household, I generally buy loose tea in bulk, de-dust it, then repackage it in one or more 40 fl oz glass jars using a univeral vaccum sealing lid (see Tilia Food Saver), and then I use those to periodically refill a smaller 16-24 oz convenience container that I keep near my stove, for whenever I want to brew a fresh pot of tea.<br /><br />I've found that 1/4 cup of loose tea is sufficient for a 6 cup pot, and 1/4 - 1/3 cup is sufficient for 8 cups.  After brewing is done (3-5 mins), I pour the brewed tea through a fine tea strainer into serving cups, and the surplus goes into a lidded glass carafe that gets stored in the fridge (after it cools) for subsequent reheating by the cup (re: microwave), or for use in iced tea by the jug (just add some simple syrup and fresh lemon juice to taste, and some optional bruised mint leaves, and you're good to go).<br /><br />Bottom line - for an inexpensive loose bulk tea, this brand is very decent all purpose choice, suitable for both hot and iced tea.  Recommended.

With the sheets they pop right out and there is no waste. The boxes also hold up since you are not pushing on them trying to cut. I never cook without them.

The flavor is similar to Pirates Booty but the texture is more like a thick chip.  It has a very satisfying crunch.<br /><br />These sell for $3.99 per bag at my local grocery store which makes the Amazon pricing a great deal.

review/summary: Pretty darn tasty
review/text: These are pretty good! They have a nice crunch and satisfy that snacking urge.  Sometimes, the amount of flavoring is uneven but that may just be settling.  A good snack.

review/text: I enjoy popcorn, so when I saw these on Amazon I thought I would give them a try.  WOW!  They are really good and solve that 'need to have something crunchy' urge.  I'm getting more.  Often.  Highly recommend getting your own.  I don't share these.

review/summary: MMMMM so good!!
review/text: This is my new addiciton.  I would relate this white cheddar flavor to Smart Food's popcorn cheese flavor, which means it is my favorite cheese flavor!  A very full flavor but not too tangy and no real aftertaste like some others.
