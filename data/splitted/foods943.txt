review/summary: Wonderful Litter!
review/text: We are a one cat household so I'm not sure how well this will work in multi-cat homes but for us this is wonderful. We converted when we were living in a very small studio and the litter odor was killing us. We have an elderly cat so she urinates a little more than normal and the smell was killing us no matter how many times we cleaned. We slowly weaned her off of the clay litter and onto this and we've never looked back. There is *no* odor to speak of and it is so clean and sanitary compared to that awful clay litter. My cat doesn't have it all over her paws and ingesting it and she seems to have taken to it well also. The only negative and it just might be my cat is that she drags the pellets out with her and they get on the bathroom floor, but I'd rather clean those up than clay!

review/summary: Easy and odor free
review/text: this product works very well for me.  The cats got used to it in a few days.  Now their litter boxes don't smell bad. This litter is the only one I've ever found that really reduces odor. From reading other reviews it sounds like some people don't know how to use this.  the used litter needs to be sifted out, which is why the special box with the screen works well.  Then you can clean up the litter box every day or two.  You can also use a regular scoop to sift out the sawdust part (throw away) from the granules (keep) if you want.  I get this delivered regularly through Amazon.  No shipping cost, the price is as good or better than I can get it at the store and there is much less carrying.  Works well for me!

review/summary: Best Kitty Litter EVER!
review/text: This cat litter works very well. It stays in the litter box, instead of getting stuck to my cat's feet and ending up around the house like other kitty litters do. Once I switched, I switched for good and this is the only kitty litter I use now. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a cat!

review/summary: Powerful enough for multiple cats
review/text: We have two cats, a kitten and an adult cat. We tried all kinds of litters in the past, ranging from the traditional litters to clumping that you scoop out. This was the first that didn't make us feel guilty flushing it down the toilet, nor throwing it away down the trash shute.<br /><br />The scent is not over powering, and we are able to keep the litter box in the guest bathroom without embarassment. In addition, we generally only need to change the litter box every week.<br /><br />One thing to note: The pine pellets turn to wood dust when in contact with kitty waste, so I would suggest having a mat in front of the litter box to brush off dust on the cat's feet, otherwise the dust can track throughout the house.

review/summary: Best Coffee on the Planet!
review/text: My husband is a coffee lover; a connoisseur.  Okay, in reality, he's a coffee snob.  He likes his coffee strong, dark, robust, flavorful,  and piping hot.  Being from Minnesota, his usual preference has always been Obsidian flavor from Caribou Coffee.  However, the day he tasted his first cup of Kicking Horse (Kick Ass), he deemed it the "Best Coffee on the Planet" and has not since found any other that comes close!<br /><br />We first discovered this coffee while on a camping trip in Canada.  There, in the midst of six national parks in the heart of the Canadian Rockies (fondly known as Kicking Horse Country), we purchased our first container of Kicking Horse Coffee, primarily for its name.  We were deeply enjoying the beauty of the land around us and happy to support the local economy.  Back at camp we brewed our first pot and I've never known my husband to enjoy his java more intensely.<br /><br />Since that time, Kicking Horse has come to mean much more to this family than our endeared vacation spot.  The term now resonates as reference to the premier coffee.  I'm so glad we can now purchase it online;  my coffee-loving husband is a happy man and It saves a bit on gas!

review/text: By far......hands down......the BEST whole bean coffee.  With every can comes the freshest beans and every pot produces the most aromatic, KICK ASS cup of coffee.  My husband and I.....not much on specialty, expensive mochacino types.  We grind our own beans and use only distilled water.  We've tried dozens of whole bean brands and nothing comes close to Kicking Horse Coffee. Each one offers an outstanding flavor.  Try them all.  We highly recommend.

review/summary: Really, really good coffee for the price
review/text: Edit: March, 2012 - So it's been a few months since I bought the coffee and I haven't grown tired of it. I still stand by my original review. I have subscribe and save and, depending on whether we have guests, the coffee may run out between shipments. Well, I have to buy an "emergency" bag while I wait for my Kicking Horse. I usually buy new brands trying to discover a better coffee. Well, none have convinced me so far. I'm sticking with Kicking Horse for my everyday coffee needs.<br />---<br /><br />I am a coffee snob and I am not embarrassed to admit it. I never used to drink coffee until I went to graduate school. At that point, I needed coffee and, if I was going to drink it, I was going to drink something good. I also refuse to drink the sock water they try to pass as coffee at work, so I have to take a thermos in every day.<br /><br />This coffee is really good. I know that true coffee snobs do not like dark coffee, preferring to savor the flavor of the beans, without the toasty flavor getting in the way. However, I do like a bold coffee, and this is a good one. Really nice, bold, rich flavor without hardly any acidity. And, for the price (especially the subscribe & save price) it can't be beat.

review/summary: Some of the best coffee I've had in a long time!
review/text: Coming from a family of snooty coffee drinkers, I'm pretty picky on what I drink. My dad ordered and sent me the two pack tins of 454 Horse by Kicking Horse. He did it as a joke thinking it would be too strong and horrible. It turns out that it is fantastic coffee. Not too bitter and less of an aftertaste than that other big name, retail on every corner, coffee shop. After consuming the 454 Horse and being hooked, I decided to try the Kick Ass Dark. It's a touch milder that the 454 but still very good! If you like the dark, oily beans with bold flavors, I'd recommend both of these types.

review/summary: The Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado. The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags. The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored. Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas. He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us. We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room. The smell of peppermint was overpowering. It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint. What a rush! The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry. For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea. Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder. The events of that day have changed my life forever. Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet. I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer. On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour. Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/summary: Can be made with soy milk (really!)
review/text: Though the package directions say not to make it with soy milk I have no problem getting the pudding to set when using Silk unsweetened soy milk.  Preparing in the microwave is easy and the warm pudding is very tasty, too.  Since I have to watch sugar and carbs very closely this preparation is ideal and though the taste is slightly different I actually think it tastes better than regular milk.<br /><br />Also, try adding a teaspoon of flavored extract (almond, raspberry, orange) for a new twist.

review/text: This is good, but not as tasty as the stuff you buy in the stores already prepared. It does have a slight aftertaste, and since I'm more calorie-conscious than worried about suger (not diabetic), I went back to the regular pudding; tastes 10 times better and more chocolaty! :)

review/summary: SOOOOOOO good!  LOVE it!
review/text: I tried this when in CA for my cousins wedding and we had it in her suite to eat with cream cheese and crackers as a snack.  I LOVED it.  It's very good.<br />So, when I came back to Hawaii, I had to order it! AMAZON has the BEST price for this, FYI!  The Earth and Vine company is STELLAR!  ALL their stuff is sooo yummy!  You can really get creative with what you use it for...  I have tried it on warmed brie, its really good that way for sure.  Just warm the brie in the oven, and pour on top in the oven and take out and use some nice CARRS crackers.  This steller is AMAZING!  They will only charge you the $5 or so to ship as many as you want.  I ordered 6 so I wouldnt run out.  It's the perfect appetizer to bring with you to any party to make it seem as if you worked really hard...  lol!  My husband used this on meatballs the other night, and said they were fantastic!

Serve it on the side of a great creamy goat cheese or double creme Brie and rich crackers.  Put it out for a dipping sauce for Crab Rangoons.

I poured it over a log of chevre (similar to others' recommendation on using it with cream cheese) and then warmed the whole thing slightly in the microwave.  It was beautiful and my guests kept asking me where I got the jam.  Not too sweet, not too spicy.

I bought the fruit variety and vegetable variety packs for my daughter-in-law and also had the same shipped to me because I care for him while mom and dad are at work. The other fruits and veggies he is ok with but he goes bananas for the bananas.  I am ordering a case of just bananas because he likes it so much. I hope to have the time to start preparing homemade baby food by the time he runs out of what I already have.  If not, I will keep supplementing with Earth's Best brand of baby food.

review/summary: Repulsive!
review/text: These look, smell, and taste vile.  I try each food first before I give it to my baby and have been very happy with all of the Earth's Best varieties we've tried so far. The bananas however are quite disgusting.  It could be the citric acid used, but it smells and tastes like it is spoiled.  I have been feeding fresh banana up to this point, but bought a 12-jar variety pack of fruit which included banana, so I decided to try it today.  So much for saving money by purchasing the variety pack.  I will be throwing away all four jars of the banana.  I will not feed anything to my baby that I wouldn't eat myself.  Like one of the other reviewers said:  do not stock up on this before you try one jar first.  It's just nasty.  I wouldn't give it any stars if that was an option here.<br /><br />Update:  I still won't buy these bananas again, but I wanted to say that I contacted Earth's Best to complain.  They ended up sending me coupons for a dozen free jars of baby food.  So, I just wanted to add that I really am happy with the company.  Just not this particular product.

review/summary: Best. Baby Food. Ever.
review/text: My baby loves that Earth's Best Carrots. And everything else by them.  Their food is of exceptional quality.  I know--because before it goes in my baby's mouth, I try it first.  I hate peas, but the E.B. First Peas are absolutely sensational.  These carrots cannot be beat.  I have compared Earth's Best baby food to Gerbers and Gerbers Organic, and there is simply no comarison.  The Gerbers food--especially the green vegetables--are simply bland and a bit bitter.  I cannot tell you how wonderful (or maybe I'm trying to now!) the E.B. 1st stage baby foods are.  So good, in fact, that I've already stocked up on the variety packs of 2nd stage foods (also conveniently available on Amazon.com for a great price plus the free shipping).  If you love your baby--and I know you do--and you want him to know just how delicious fruits and vegetables can be, BUY THIS STUFF.

review/text: These do not taste like banana's and are an odd pink shade. I'm sure it's difficult to preserve pureed banana, but citric acid (predominantly found in citrus and berries) makes this food less than ideal to introduce to an infant. Citrus, berries, fish and egg whites are listed by our pediatrician as "wait until they're old enough" foods due to allergies or the irritation they causes some infants.<br /><br />BTW we normally love Earth's Best products.

review/summary: Our twin 7-month olds love this one - carrots
review/text: I subscribe to the 4 oz. version of this baby food.  Considering price, I think the 4 oz. jars are a better deal.<br /><br />Both our twin babies love this one with carrots as we discovered with the vegetable variety pack.  Other parents have told me their babies like carrots so this one is likely to be a winner.<br /><br />I've tried many Earth's Best baby food in the jars products on my babies.  They like all of them with only a couple exceptions.  I've discovered they're not fond of peas or onions, but I've also discovered that as they get older they will eat more types of foods.  If you get something your baby doesn't like, maybe you can keep it on hand for when your baby is a few months older and try again.<br /><br />Several other varieties of Earth's Best contain carrots.  I think this is to make them sweet so that babies will like them more.<br /><br />The ingredients are simply organic carrots and water.  One 4-ounce jar (not this 2.5 ounce jar) has 40 calories, and daily value: 4% protein, 150% vitamin A and 4% calcium (that's all of it; no iron for example).<br /><br />Compared to other Earth Best varieties, this has very little calories but is very high in vitamin A.  I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult.

review/text: Not bad! I used it to make a coconut flan and it was pretty nice. The texture was a bit too gooey, but it wasn't bad.  The instructions on the box said to gradually add milk, bring to a boil stirring constantly, and refrigerate. I can do that, it's flan for dummies! Instead of milk, I used coconut milk to make a coconut flan. I made my own caramel sauce and sprinkled some shredded coconut on top of the chilled, caramel-coated flan. (see photo)<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, dextrose, calcium carragheen, salt, vanillin (an artificial flavor) and artificial color including FD & C yellow #5. Contains no eggs.

review/summary: St. John's Wort is a miracle.
review/text: I really bought this tea thinking the placebo effect would work on me - mostly because I have little faith in marketers promises now-a-days. The results? I really don't think this was a placebo.... It did exactly what it said on the description.<br /><br />I noticed it calmed me down when I was stressed or even worse, depressed. And while I didn't like the taste initially -smells like strong curry with licorice- I soon found myself craving it whenever I needed it and the taste wasn't so bad anymore. Actually I started to like it.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone looking for relief from depression. As a sufferer, I know how much a moments relief feels like glorious heaven.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />::EDIT:: I left this on the counter and my younger, 15 y/o sister who ISN'T depressed tried this, not knowing what it was. She said she suddenly started feeling giddy and happy inside and that's when she asked me what this tea was. So I'm guessing it really does work...

review/summary: The taste gets sickening after awhile
review/text: I don't know if the St. John's Wort herb tastes really bad or something, but this tea definitely covers up the taste. It tastes really licorice-y, it's like a slightly milder version of their Egyptian licorice tea. You can somewhat taste the other spices like cardamom, but the strong licorice taste got to me after awhile and I really did not like it. But if you love licorice tea, then I'm sure you'd like it.<br /><br />I decided to edit this review, since not everyone though it was helpful. Ok, first of all, I mention the licorice part because, well, if you know your herbs, licorice is also good for heart burn, but has the side effect of being a mild laxative. As for the St. John's Wort herb part: the herb is not too strong in Yogi's tea, and I prefer to use pure St. John's Wort from Alvita. Yes, it taste awful and I have to put a teaspoon of honey for half a cup of tea, but it works for me (I use 2 dosages and 4 pills of Enzymatic Therapy St. John's Wort pills because I can't drink that many cups of this herb with its taste. But the tea is more effective for me--I think my body absorbs it better in a natural form, which is normal for vitamins). And another note: just like perscription medication, this does not work in an instant. For me, it takes about a week to truely get the effects. My review is for people who decide to do alterative therapy who are diagnosed with mild to moderate depression.

review/summary: Wonderful natural remedy that WORKS!!
review/text: I'm so happy with this tea!! St Johns Wort works wonders. I drank my first cup of it yesterday evening and very shortly afterwards, my mood was great and I was bouncing around singing and cheerful.<br />My husband came home, hungry and out of sorts. I asked him to drink some, and he drank half a cup. He said he felt calmer and in a better mood just a few minutes after!<br /><br />I normally take 2 capsules of St Johns Wort most days for mood swings and depression, which mostly happen on PMS weeks. I have noticed a great improvement after taking the capsules, which are 300mg each. My symptoms nearly vanish when I keep up on the capsules. I notice if I neglect taking St Johns Wort before and during PMS, I have horrible mood swings.<br />The box says one tea bag contains 843mg of St Johns Wort, which may be why it works so well!<br /><br />I recommend this tea to anybody who needs help with unhealthy moods or depression or PMS.

review/summary: This tea tastes great!
review/text: I decided to try this tea after hearing the Consumer Report that it is effective for depression. While not depressed, I do have a lot of anxiety so I thought I would try a tea with St. John's Wort. I was unable to find this tea in my grocery store and I thought this was a really great price for a six pack of tea.<br /><br />I drink this every day and it has a really nice taste. I usually have to add sweetener to tea but this one tastes great on its own, I like the natural sweetness of the licorice. I don't know if the supplement is actually working but I do think I've become less anxious over the time I've been drinking this tea. I will definitely order again when my supply runs out.

review/summary: Ugggg. The taste...
review/text: I saw the rave reviews for this tea, and I decided to do an experiment and try this tea along with the Traditional Medicinals St. John's Wort Good Mood tea. They should have been similar, although it looks like the Yogi tea has more St. John's Wort in it. I've had several cups of both now, and without a doubt the Yogi tea tastes way too licoricey and like it has a fake sweetener in it. The Traditional Medicinals tastes WAY better to me, with a more subtle licorice flavor and no weird fake sweetener taste. Also, it makes me feel better than the Yogi tea. It gives me a little boost, which I'm not feeling with Yogi. Sorry, but I tried it a few times to make sure! If anyone else wants to try the same experiment, I'd be interested in your opinion as well!!!

review/text: Here at the office we started a "tea catering club", and we are actually hooked with Yogi teas. We have tasted over 15 different types but I have to say I like this the most. It has a mild flavor (find it a little bit sweet too) and I definitely feel my mood changing after drinking it, I have seen it in others too (Someone asked me right away what this is and after drinking it became a fan too!), so for me, it's not placebo.<br /><br />We continue our tasting with other brands and types of tea, for Yogi I also like hazelnut, spicy and others, but when we make and order I always ask for this one. Best tea I tried.

I tried so many different teas and nothing was hitting the spot.  I tried coffee substitutes etc and even fell off the wagon and began drinking coffee again.  After my initial high wore off from the coffee, I began to feel terrible and looked awful.  Dark circles, double bags under my eyes and my skin would break out and looked unhealthy.  I found this tea and I was so grateful.  I love it so much that I am off coffee for good and I look forward to this every morning with the added benefit of feeling great and my skin looks great too.  No more dark circles or bags.  My skin cleared up and I do not have the afternoon lull.  Plus I love the taste!  I highly recommend this tea!!!

I love drinking tea; most of what I drink is tea and I drink a multitude of different types from matcha, chai, red zinger, etc, But this tea just taste god awful. It isn't vomit inducing awful (excuse the mental picture) but it is not pleasant at all. This doesn't mean someone else won't like it, but I don't. Someone said it taste like black licorice, and that may be, but I couldn't say as I have never had black licorice. I don't like licorice of any kind though, so it probably does taste like that. At any rate, I would recommend buying 1 box first, just in case.

review/text: This is one of the most pleasant Yogi varieties I've tried so far. Admittedly I'm not quite as intensely focused on the potential nutritional / medicinal benefits as the taste of the tea; but Yogi makes some GREAT herbal tea. It's full-flavored, complex and interesting. A great alternative if you're trying to cut back on caffeine or just relaxing before bed.<br /><br />This one is a mild to moderately sweet tea that is predominantly licorice with a slight bitter herbal undertone. It's a very rich, flavorful, fragrant tea that's great to drink without any gussying up - no milk or sugar or honey needed. It is highly recommended and will be an ongoing fixture in our tea cabinet.

The flavor is really good, but the candy is a little brittle if you chew it right out of the wrapper. If you suck on it for a little while first, it becomes nice and chewy like they should be. Overall, I'd say it's a good product. You get a lot for your money and the candy is tasty.

review/summary: WARNING: made in mexico
review/text: Either the description did not display "mexico" when I ordered or sadly I did not notice.  But the description does (now) display "Country of Origin: mexico".<br /><br />This is likely why this item was less costly that the other very similar Now and Later Banana:  amazon id B0028MFNVO  (edit: no.  that other amazon id is shipped by Candy Crate.  The Candy Crate item is ALSO made in MEXICO, but not fulfilled by amazon.  This item is a better deal as it is fulfilled by amazon thereby eligible for free shipping -- made in mexico either way)<br /><br />I do not eat food made in mexico as a policy of good health.<br /><br />Yeah, sure, it is an American company, and there might well be standards to which they aspire, but that's not for me.<br /><br />--<br /><br />edit: I have increased my star rating to 4 as some other people here are happy with the candy.  According to those indifferent to country of origin the candy tastes exactly like every other banana now and later ever eaten.
