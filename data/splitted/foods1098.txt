review/summary: False Advertising
review/text: This was listed as 14 oz packages. It really is 12 oz. Beware. This has been slowly disappearing from the shelves around my part of the country, I thought I would grab these up. And since they were advertising this as 14 oz, I trusted that they would be that size. So, product - 5 stars. Advertising - 1 star.

review/summary: Great food for non-picky eaters!
review/text: This is one of those foods that again, you just need to sample a can before committing to an entire case. Thinking my male cheese junkie would love it, I grabbed a few cans for him.  Well, forget it!  Hates the stuff so badly that he will starve himself over eating it.  My female, however, goes gaga for all of these new cheese varieties.  Sorry, but tuna and cheese just sounds nasty to me but to her, well, get out of her way or she will mow you over on her way to the dish (if she doesn't slide there first!).  Anyway, great product, try to find it for less elsewhere because here in forgotten Ohio, this is a bit pricey.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Spoiled Ragdoll cat,LiNa..demands the best in everything including treats
review/text: LiNa, my beautiful Ragdoll cat is so spoiled, I think she was already spoiled when I got her. Even in teats she demands and deserves the best. I can buy this on Amazon and get a better buy than going to my local pet shop. One thing I love about shopping at Amazon is that they stand behind the products they sell.

review/summary: four paws up!!!!!
review/text: With six cats in the house, let me say I was THRILLED that Amazon.com offered this in their vine program. My cats eat anything that doesn't run away from them, but everyone from the year old cat, to the seventeen year old diabetic kitty LOVED this food. Even my mom's cat, who is known to be pretty finicky loved it.<br /><br />The food looks like "real" food, not the loaf-type food so often seen in canned cat food, and it smells great. Not stinky at all. The cats gobbled it right up, and I like that there is plenty of broth and liquid on the food, because that helps my eldest cat, who is missing several teeth, eat it just fine.<br /><br />I've been feeding wellness and Eagle Pack Holistic food in addition to prescription food. This ranks right alongside those expensive foods. Good stuff!!!!

review/summary: Mixed reviews from the house felines
review/text: Dash loves it. Jasper does not. Dash Hoovered both his bowl and Jasper's, while Jasper took two bites and then moved over to the kibble bowl. We've tried three different flavors so far, and the verdict has been the same. So safe to say, not ALL cats want to eat "people food." I don't know much about this product except what's on the label. The fact that it's a product of Thailand concerns me a bit -- I don't know what their standards are for pet food, and after the scandal with the lead in Chinese-manufactured toys, well, I'm a little skeptical. It's also an expensive product. Since I don't have a consensus among the house felines, I doubt I will purchase any more of this product.

review/summary: My Two Cats Inhaled The Stuff
review/text: OK, so I couldn't personally taste this cat food and give you a review. But all I can say is: my two cats (14 and 15 years old) virtually inhaled it. Clawdette is the older one and she is fussy. She likes a cat food that has seafood and tomato in it. Chappie is less picky, but he can turn up his nose at some supermarket brand cat foods. So more often then not I buy the canned cat food at petshops (or on Amazon). I fed them each of the cans in the Variety Pack...and its as if the food vanished off the face of the earth within a few minutes. The bottom line: they loved it, it left their coats nice and softy and glossy, and they had lots of energy. So I (or, rather my cats) give it five stars.

review/summary: If your cat likes people food, this may be for you.
review/text: My cat George never quite finishes a 6-ounce can of cat food, so I thought I would try these 3-ounce servings. However, George is not terribly fond of people food, and he has only finished one of the cans that I have given him so far - the Sesame Chicken, as it turns out. He clearly likes the broth in the Chicken Pot Pie, but he doesn't finish his vegetables, or even all of the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Of course, we can hardly blame him for abandoning one can to attempt to get into the turkey liver I was cutting up. Some people food is too good for cats to pass up!

review/summary: My cat went nuts!
review/text: My fiancee brought this home from his moms and my cat went crazy! She inhaled an entire can in seconds and then begged for more. I completely grossed my fiancee out when I tasted it and let me tell you as someone who is an avid cook the Chicken Pot Pie is very good. I make chicken pot pie and reading the ingredients were like reading the ingredients in a chicken pot pie you would make or buy for yourself. The chicken did not taste processed. The first time I saw the can of food I thought it was gourmet tuna and had to read to make sure it was cat food. I can't say that I blame my kitty for enjoying this so much. We have a local health food store that carries it so it's easy to find for me but the deals online are amazing! I'll be going via Amazon from now on. My cat reacts to this the way she reacts to fresh tuna, she goes nuts!

review/summary: More like "human" food than Cat Food
review/text: My cats are crazy for this food, including the one that has turned up her nose at all wet food for 6 years! Unfortunately the price makes it prohibitive as an every day meal since I have 5 cats. Also, I've heard that too much fish is not healthy for cats, they need meat too and they aren't that crazy about the Petite Cuisine Chicken.  I still buy the tuna and just feed it occasionally as an extra treat. The food itself looks and smells just like tuna for humans, maybe even a little better. Some of it has tiny little (whole) shrimp and some pieces of codfish - it also has a lot of tuna oil, which I guess is what the cats like about it because the first thing they do is lap up all the "gravy". I thought maybe if I bought human tuna in oil and spiked their usual soft Friskies, they would enjoy it more, but that didn't work, so I continue to buy Petite Cuisine.

review/summary: Hard to find cat food!
review/text: Directly above it says this review is FROM Petite Cuisine Cat Food. In actuality it is FOR Petite Cuisine Cat Food!!!<br /><br />I used to purchase this cat food at Winn-Dixie stores. About six months ago they stopped carrying it. Amazon was the only place I could find besides the manufacturer that would sell me this at retail. Since the manufacturer wanted an exorbitant amount for purchase at retail Amazon was the only retailer left. Fortunately for me the Amazon program of monthly purchases worked out perfectly. It enables me to buy the food at a price that is acceptable and keeps my cats happy at the same time.<br /><br />As far as the food itself is concerned all I can say is that the cats love it, and it gives them very healthy looking luxurious coats and satisfies their appetites at the same time.

review/text: Otis is what I call a very picky eater. The fact is, until now, he would not eat the same cat food twice! He is 10 years old.<br /><br />I was in the habit of buying food one can at a time for obvious reasons. I did that for the Petite Cusine as well....the Tuna and sole. He inhaled it. I bought 2 more. This time 2 different varsities of the same brand. Again....gone.<br /><br />Since it is not cheap, I looked for it on line. Amazon had the best deal and I bought 4 cases of variety packs. That was almost a year ago. He still loves it!<br /><br />The other things I like are the ingredients. They are healthy for him.....no fillers.

I wonder if other people's cats do. I couldn't find any fault with the food, but then again, I'm human. I'd say it probably depends very much on what your cat's taste is. If your cat enjoys fresh organic food... then buy this. If they like Fancy Feast - don't!!

review/summary: Ho Hum Response
review/text: Any review of this product, necessarily, must be based upon observation of the four footed furry feline friends (barring any truly dedicated and odd reviewers). We have two cats that deign to call us their owners, at least at feeding time and when the litter box needs cleaning.<br /><br />This is soft food in the petite cans favored by the feline haute cuisine products. However, the similarity seems to end there as the product is flaked rather than sliced or diced, and the sauce is clear with an oily consistency (somewhat like vegetable or olive oil), the pot pie cans were considerably more fluid.<br /><br />The boy, Otis, will eat just about any soft cat food put in front of him unfortunately we were disappointed with his response to this product. The girl, Crystal, is the pickier of the pair and will usually lick a little of the food or sauce before abandoning any soft food (leaving the remnants for Otis), but would not touch this product. I was gratified to see that the product did not come out of China after the problems of the past year.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the cats did not seem to like the product as much as other soft foods. The poor response from the cats means that this one will not make it into the rotation.

review/text: My finicky cat LOVED these petite cuisines.  He would scarf them down.  The ingredients are wholesome, lots of juices and you could actually see the real tuna, mini shrimps and so forth.  The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because it is really expensive in the stores.  But if money is no object for your little 4 legged feline friends, then I highly recommend this cat food.

review/text: This food is a delight to give to one of the most important members of the family.  She's a bit choosy & will walk away readily from many foods. So, it is really something to watch her just gobble this down!<br /><br />The smaller sized can is nice as well for it insures that she'll eat the whole thing-down to the carrots. With the larger cans, she'll leave a third or more sitting there and it goes to waste.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine may cost a bit more, but nutritionally it is a very good meal for the kitty and she likes it, so none goes uneaten!  So, in the long run, it is a good value.<br /><br />On inspection of the cat food, it is composed of very good ingredients and is a high quality product.<br /><br />Our kitty loves it and gobbles it down at one sitting!

Granted the one cat does like spicy food but he did eat it throughout the days. They both like it but it's hard for them to get a hold of the pieces because the chicken is kind of stringy and not cut into smaller pieces and some of it ends up on the floor.<br /><br />But now that they kind of used to these they do definitely practically yell at me when I don't give them the stuff as soon as I open the can, lol. But it would be better if it were smaller cut pieces to reduce the amount that ends up on the floor.

review/summary: Warning: Contains Menadione
review/text: According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione "produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung." Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.

review/summary: Almost...
review/text: I've got 2 cats that love their wet food!!  We figured this'd be a big hit & for the 1st couple cans it was.  My cats are used to your everyday  mushy cat food (Friskies I think), so when we opened this stuff I was surprised to see that this stuff actually looked almost some what edible.  It kinda looked like tuna with peas & carrots, although it was really juicy (seemed like almost half the can was just liquid).  Anyway long story short the cats devoured this food when we first gave it to 'em.  However I must admit the cans were a little small for 2 cats, but a can this size would be perfect for a 1 cat family.  (Here comes the only 3 star rating part)  Anyway, after the 1st couple cans it seemed as though the cats loved it, but then, all of a sudden they just stopped eating it.  I gotta tell you with my cats that's a rare thing to be sure.  Everytime we've tried to give it to 'em since they've completely turned their noses from it.  I can't really say that this stuff isn't good, all I know is that suddenly my cats stopped liking it, your cats might love it.  Granted, my cats are used to the mushy stuff I mentioned earlier, but to be fare they also like canned tuna/chicken (it could just be the big veggie chunks they didn't like, who knows).  I guess in closing, it's kinda up in the air as to whether or not you'll get the most out of your purchase or not, I know I won't ever buy it again, but again your cats might love it, kinda hard to come to a real definative conclusion:(.

review/summary: If it looks good, is it good for the cats?
review/text: My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term "all about tuna fish".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.

review/summary: The cats weren't impressed!
review/text: When I ordered the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack, I thought it would be a real treat for the seven cats in our household and that the cats would provide an unbiased and impartial panel of judges. When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!

review/summary: 5 star for quality, but 2 for price
review/text: This is basically shredded white chicken in a seasoned gravy like broth. ALL 5 of my cats inhaled it and licked their bowls clean. It appears as human grade food. That said,and since it is not organic, it is more cost effective to buy a can of broth, add some seasoning and add a mashed can of chicken. I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off. Just a note-the greatly higher amount of chicken you get in this flavor vs. the pot pie watery flavor is considerable.

review/summary: My Cats Love It
review/text: My cats really seem to like this food. It does look like people food (the tuna and shrimp variety even has little shrimps in it). It is quite a bit more expensive than my usual brand of canned cat food (Fancy Feast), but it obviously contains whole seafood, which Fancy Feast does not.<br /><br />I dinged it one star because it is very watery, but otherwise I have no complaints. Unlike some canned cat foods, Petite Cuisine does not smell bad (as long as you don't mind a fishy smell). I would buy this again if I saw it on sale, but I probably wouldn't pay full price for it.

review/summary: the kitty she is purring
review/text: I haven't tried this product myself, although it does smell yummy and is marketed as "People Food for Cats."  Our cat seems to like it better than her regular canned food, Fancy Feast.  Nutritionally it seems on a par, but at more than a buck a can I wonder whether "people food for cats" is really "ploy for people who think their cats are people."<br /><br />It is nice to know that, if we're snow bound for a few days, we can eat the cat's food.

review/summary: Loved by more than half.
review/text: Out of 4 cats, one simply wouldn't go near it, one liked the broth and played with the food and the remaining 2  liked it immensely (nom nom nom). The cans are a good single serving size and it really smells like human food. Literally, they smell like cold leftovers. The food is in a broth and very wet, which your cat may or may not like. They only similarity in cats is that they are all different.<br /><br />To be fair, the one that didn't like it is insanely picky.  The food is not overly processed and I am happy to feed this to my cats. When I saw that it was made in Thailand, I was a bit wary as we all have heard about the melamine in, well, everything, in China. Then reading further, I saw the company addresses this and says that the food doesn't use Chinese products.  They seem a thoughtful company at the least, which when it comes to pets, goes a long way with me.<br /><br />As good as the food may seem to me, they are the ones that have to eat it.  It's a little more expensive, but not prohibitively so, especially if your cat likes it.

review/summary: It's OK for some cats... But not all.
review/text: Of my three cats, only one likes this food. I suspect the problem is that there are actual chunks of carrot in the food, and most cats aren't fond of carrots blocking the smell of the chicken in their meal. While the ingredients list is admirable, the chunks of chicken are very appetizing-looking, and it does appear to be as advertised- All natural- it's also not very popular in my household.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie flavor is especially disliked by my cats, as it's very watery. The label describes this as a sauce, but it's really more like a weak broth that apparently tastes more like carrots than chicken, because even my chicken-mooching cat will not consume it. The Sesame Chicken flavor is a little more interesting to him, but he still just picks out the bigger chunks of chicken when he's really desperate, and leaves the carrots behind.<br /><br />Honestly, I really can't believe any cat would eat those carrots!<br /><br />My suggestion is to try before you commit to this size of a package, because cats' tastes vary, and in my experience, 2 out of 3 cats will only eat it if they're very, very hungry. The third is the kind of cat that will eat anything, and so she'll dig in. If you have a cat that will eat anything, then you might have some luck with this food. If your cats are a bit more picky about their food, then you may want to hold back and see if you can dig up a single can before buying a 24-pack like this.<br /><br />I respect what the company is trying to do with their food, but I really question the person who decided they were going to put chunks of vegetables in a cat food. Cats are carnivores, and sticking a carrot in their bowl is kind of an insult to them.<br /><br />...And we all know that insulting a cat when it comes to food is one of the greatest sins against cat pride one can commit.<br /><br />Remove the carrots, thicken the "sauce" and you might have something here.

review/summary: High quality - two paws up!
review/text: My cat enjoyed this food very much. He is an older cat and can be finicky. He *really* showed great interest in this brand, and liked the amount of juice in the food.  He preferred the chunky chicken in the pot pie flavor rather than the shredded chicken in the sesame entree, but hey he ate both with gusto!<br /><br />So if you have a picky eater, who likes a fair bit of gravy, this could be a winner for you!

review/summary: 5 PURRS FOR THIS DISH
review/text: Our cat is 6-years-old and has eaten (voraciously) the same brand of food in both the chow and the canned variety for all of his life.  He's not at all a picky eater (even given to nabbing a potato chip if he can).<br /> Nonetheless, we were a bit reluctant to try a new brand of food but no worries there.  With his first can of the Petit Cuisine Chicken Pie we knew we'd found a winner.  He didn't hesitate for a second, not even the unfamiliar smell slowed him down.  He seemed to particularly enjoy the liquid, lapping every bit of it.  A full tummy, a grateful rub of my shin,  and he slept for a few hours.  What a life!<br /> Five purrs for Petite Cuisine!

review/summary: Good quality, but ultimately it depends on the cat's personality
review/text: I have been giving this food to my cat for a couple of days, and I have mixed feelings about it. The chicken pot pie flavor has a lot of broth in it. Fortunately, my cat likes broth, and whenever I buy food that has either a lot of sauce or a lot of broth, my cat enjoys the extra moisture. However, this depends on your cat. What I found, however, is that the chicken pot pie has more broth than actual food.  The chicken is very chunky and looks very natural, and is exactly the consistency my cat enjoys.  However, it contains carrots, and my cat doesn't really eat vegetables. Cats in general don't eat vegetables, because they are naturally carnivores, so I question its inclusion.<br /><br />The Chinese Chicken is actually "sesame". It has a slightly odd aroma, which doesn't seem to bother my cat, and plenty of sauce, which my cat enjoys. However, the meat in this flavor is shredded, which my cat does not enjoy. It has fewer vegetables than the chicken pot pie, but my cat will barely touch the meat in this.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective, these foods have about the same (or slightly better) protein content than my cat's regular brands. This is a plus, especially if you have an overweight cat. This food contains plenty of protein and plenty of moisture, which are really critical in quality cat food.<br /><br />Based on what I've seen, I would conclude that these are quality cat foods. They look better than what my cat eats on a regular basis. Ultimately, though, it depends what your cat enjoys -- consider the consistencies I've described before buying. In my situation, since my cat will not eat the Chinese "Sesame" Chicken, I have quite a few cans of food that I will not be able to use -- an issue of the mult-flavor, multi-pack design.

review/summary: GOOD GOURMET CAT FOOD
review/text: Feeding this to my 12 year old cat, she enjoyed the chicken pot pie quite a bit...and went through an entire can in one sitting. (Not sure if this is a good or a bad thing though!) The chinese chicken she ate, but didnt seem thrilled about. Giving a container to two other cat owners produced the same results. So, if I were to buy in the future, which I very well may, I would hope I could buy a carton of the Chicken Pot Pie by itself. But all in all this is quality food, and seemed to sit in my mature cats stomach easily - very important as all pet owners are still very cautious after last years awful pet food poisonings.

review/summary: my 10 cat review.....
review/text: yes, that's right, our family has 10 cats (all rescues), so you can imagine I was pretty stoked when this product came up for review.<br /><br />Now, since I have so many cats, my cats normally only get can food as a treat, maybe once a month. About a third LOVE can food, a third can take it or leave it, and the last third do not like can food at all. When I tried this product on my cats, over two thirds gobbled it up, only one or two showed no interest, and one (who has a sensitive stomach anyway) got sick within five minutes of consumption.<br /><br />The product has a lot of "juice", which I find my cats tend to enjoy. The smell wasn't overpowering like many cat foods.<br />In conclusion, I'd buy Petite Cuisine for my cats but only as a treat.<br />3.5 stars.

review/summary: My cats seem to like it
review/text: When reviewing cat food, you really can't go with taste since cat food is disgusting, but my cats really seem to like it. When I open a can they run to the bowl. Not that they don't usually run to the bowl but they are very enthusiastic about this stuff.<br /><br />The main problem I have is that it's in little cans so there's not much. I have three cats. And it's a little too watery. The food and "gravy" quotient is heavy on the "gravy" side. Also it stinks a little. Most cat food stinks but I distinctly smelled this one. So it stinks more than usual.<br /><br />Beyond that, if you can afford it and you have finicky cats, give it a shot.

review/summary: A bit watery, but impressive ingredients
review/text: With all the nonsense about pet food recalls and melamine, it's important to know where your pet food originates. This food does not originate in China and contains no wheat gluten. The chicken pot pie is a bit too watery to me so one star down. However, watery is not necessarily bad as it provides additional hydration for cats that eat dry food. All three of my cats do eat dry food (Nutro). I like to provide them with moist food on the side to encourage their appetite and hydration. I am frankly scared of most canned foods available because of the melamine thing. The cheap ones have ingredients almost always originating in China, and the expensive ones aren't cost effective for me to provide as a snack. This food does fill that gap in that it averages a dollar a can (through Amazon, less through subscribe and save) and it contains high grade (human grade) ingredients. I thought about putting my cats on a raw food diet (BARF for cats). It's messy, requires counter space, time and storage space for ingredients and the finished product. Therefore I try to get the best dry food I can and supplement it with canned food like this.<br /><br />All three cats liked both varieties of food. 3 cats = 2 cans once a day. The dry food is at will - they munch on that when they like. So far, so good. No increased mess in litter box from soupy ingredients, either. Their appetites remain strong for both this wet food and their dry food.

review/text: I do have to say that the cat food is quite nutritious and appealed to my cat's sense of smell as well as my visual sense.  He also did not throw up this food, which is a rarity for my sensitive-stomached cat.  On the downside, he didn't eat much of it, either.  I don't know what about it didn't interest him beyond a few bites, but most of it got left in his bowl.  My dog, on the other hand, loves it!  I give three stars because it's potentially interesting to other cats, but mine wouldn't eat more than a little bit of it.  I gave some to a friend, and her cats loved it.

review/summary: I have three cats
review/text: I typically feed them dry food, and once a day I split a can of Fancy Feast to give them a treat with their supper.<br />They love it. They have never turned down any canned cat food. Sometimes one will refuse or just nibble at a particular flavor, but they usually like their canned food<br /><br />I tried out both flavors on my three kitties, None of them did more than nibble, I tried it on my dog, just out of curiosity, He ate it . Continuing my experiment, I went to my friend Margie's house. She has three cats as well. Much like my feline family, one is a senior and two are young. Sadly, I had the same result. None of them liked it.<br /><br />Before receiving the food I looked online to learn as much as I could about this food before subjecting my furkids to it. Everything looked good, safe and worthy of Morgan, Rosie and Emmie. I was quite disappointed that they don't like it, to tell you the truth. It looked so good that I really wanted them to like it.I will be dropping off the rest of it at the shelter tomorrow. I certainly do not want it to go to waste, as it is a good quality product.

review/text: One of my cats liked this food, although not as much as he liked the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food, and my other cat wouldn't touch this food; however, she does like the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety. This variety of food comes with chunks of chicken, chunks of vegetables and gravy. I'm guessing my finicky cat was turned off by the vegetable chunks. On the positive side these cans are easy to open and you can pour the food out without having to use a spoon. However, because one of my cats wouldn't touch this food I won't buy it again. I'll stick with the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food.

review/text: My two cats love this seafood variety canned food. One of my cats is very finicky, so I was surprised when she gobbled up this food without hesitation. The cans are small, easy to open, and you don't need a spoon to get the food out. You can easily pour the food out of the can, as it is a mixture of small chunks of seafood and gravy. I divide a can of this food between my two cats morning, lunch and evening, so my cats are eating about a can and a half each of this food daily. My cats' fur is shiny and they are both active and content. I recommend this food and will purchase it again.

review/summary: Looks and smells high-quality, kitty likes it
review/text: My cat, who is of average pickiness, loved both of the chicken varieties.<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken looks and smells appealing, even to humans.  It's very recognizable as shredded white-meat chicken, finely diced carrots, and broth.  No chopped-and-formed meat by-products here!<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier, but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy, but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots, which I would not have anticipated.<br /><br />Both products list high-quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten, so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other brands.  It is made in Thailand, and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.<br /><br />I like the size of the mini-cans, as they are just right for one meal for one cat.  I hate keeping smelly half-open cans of pet food in the refrigerator!

I was glad that I ended up picking this from the Vine program because my cat did like the Chinese Chicken one. She devoured that in an instant and licked the bowl clean. She wasn't all that impressed with the Chicken Pot Pie. It was very watery and there wasn't much in the can.<br /><br />My cat 99% of the time eats fancy feast, and I usually split the can in half. Half in the morning, half when I get home from work, and half before I go to bed. But with these cans (which, again, are the same size), there is no way you can split them. I gave her the whole can at once. It just isn't worth it, for this price.<br /><br />On the plus side, the food actually smells good-like human food almost. It even looks good-for cat food. Probably one of the best looking types of cat food I've ever come across.<br /><br />So out of 24 expensive cans, my cat likes only half of them. It would be nicer if they had different varieties in the case, not just 2. However, I think for the most part, cats would generally like this cat food.

review/summary: The cats weren't too impressed
review/text: I really wanted to like this product.  I hadn't heard of the brand, so visited the company's website.  I was pleased that the company stated it did not use any ingredients from China, especially in light of the well-publicized problems in that country's food supply.  (I was not, however, pleased to see that the product arrived in a box labeled "Made in Thailand".  I would not have willing chosen the food from the store if I had seen that label.)<br /><br />My cats don't eat wet food too often...I tend to think of it as kitty junk food.  But they are always pleased when I serve it, meowing loudly until I get the food onto a plate and down to the floor.<br /><br />On the first day, we tried the Chinese Chicken.  When I opened it, I actually thought it smelled fairly good.  (Not that I was going to taste it, but it did not smell like yucky cat food.)  The chicken was clearly identifiable as white meat chicken with bits of carrot.  The cats' first reaction was to sniff the food cautiously (I assume they were confused by the scent).  The younger cat ate a few bites and walked away.  The older cat (who is fatter and usually licks the plate clean) ate a few more bites, then he was done.<br /><br />On day two, we tried the Chicken Pot Pie.  As I was opening the can, I noticed that it sounded very watery, and upon opening the can, this was confirmed.  The food had chunks of chicken, carrots, and some type of small white bits.  The cats did not like this food as much as the Chinese Chicken.  They licked up the sauce and left.<br /><br />Except for its country of origin, I was pleased with the quality of the food.  The chicken looked like chicken, the carrots like carrots, etc.  At less than a dollar a can, it is comparable to other retail brands.  Unfortunately, my cats don't eat it, so I don't plan on buying it again.  I rated it 4 stars for the company's effort...they can't please every cat's taste buds!

review/summary: A Petite Treat
review/text: At first, my cat Timmy was hesitant to try the unusual looking cat food I put before him--a cross between spam and chicken soup. But after he gave it a few sniffs, it was chowed down in minutes. Timmy quickly devoured what appeared to be a delicacy to him.<br /><br />To me, it looked too healthy to appeal to a feline, with its obvious chunks of veggies and solid pieces of meat, nicely moistened by a broth. The can is compact and easy to store and the portion size is just right for one cat's healthy appetite. Normally, a regular can of food like Friskies or Whiskas will only get half eaten, but there was no waste here. The food was polished off with a meticulous licked-clean plate, evidence of Timmy's approval of this latest offering.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine is not cheap, but it is on the lower end for the "gourmet" cat foods and you get quality ingredients.  Each 4-pack I received also came with coupons worth up to $2 in savings so that is an added bonus.<br /><br />All in all, a good cat food worth it's cost.  Timmy has already put in a request to sample the fish flavors.  :)

review/summary: Just like homemade!
review/text: We used to make our own cat food & this is a excellent substitute!  It looks & smells wonderful!  Get out your fork for the Chinese chicken or your spoon for the Chicken Pot Pie & dig in!<br />We have six cats & all six of them loved this!<br />The Chinese chicken is shredded white meat & a little bit of carrots in broth.  Mostly shredded meat.  You can smell the sesame!<br />The Chicken Pot Pie has cubes of white meat in a broth with carrots.  This isn't as filling for the kitties.  They did enjoy the broth a lot!  Later they went back for the meat.  The Chicken Pot Pie would be perfect if for your kitty if you are trying to get kitty to get more liquids in their diet.  One of our males, Door Knob Head, had crystals & blood in his urine.  The vet said it could get really expensive if the first round of treatment didn't work.  It didn't work.  Cats can eventually die from blockage if left untreated.  I researched the condition & got him to drink tons of water.  It fushed him out & he's doing great for many years!  My life would have been a lot easier if I knew about the Chicken Pot Pie.  It would have been the perfect way to get more liquids into him!<br />Each 4 pack box comes with a coupon for $1 off your purchase & if you fill out your info. on that very same coupon, they will mail you another coupon for $1.00 off a future purchase.  Not too shabby!  Yeah, this stuff is pretty darn expensive.  A fine example of you get what you pay for.<br />My only complaint is I would like the option of purchasing one or the other, as in no variety pack.<br />I highly recommend this for your kitties!  Six kitties tested, two kitty parents approve....

review/summary: The fish is better
review/text: The quality of the Petite Cuisine cat food is not the problem.  There is no question that the food is high quality.  There are no meat by-products and if you know what "by-products" are you will be happy about that. The problem is that my cats don't seem to like it nearly as much as the fish flavors.  The four cans have only two varieties and my cats weren't thrilled with either one.  In fact, two of my cats don't like these at all.  The sesame chicken is made up of thin strips of chicken which two of my four cats seem to think is tasty enough.  The chicken pot pie is liked by only one cat.  I think the other cats don't like it because it has too much liquid.  The liquid isn't a gravy but rather a watery broth and there is just too much of it.<br /><br />So before you buy this 24 pack size, you will definitely want to try the 4 pack to see if your cats like it.  If they do then this size pack is quite a savings over the 4-packs so it is worth it. If they don't then you only lost a few dollars.

review/summary: Quality Food
review/text: First thing I did was check the ingredients.  No wheat and no corn.  That's good.  The main ingredients are good animal protein sources.<br /><br />There were two flavors in the pack I received:  Chicken pot pie and sesame chicken.  The sesame chicken smelled great!  I literally could have been fooled into eating it myself.  It had a high moisture content and the chicken was shredded.  My cat at all the liquid and then went to work on the meat stuff.  Shredded isn't his favorite texture at all, but he finished all 3 oz in good order.<br /><br />Next was the chicken pot pie.  Decent smell too.  It was very watery though.  My cat didn't seem to mind so why should I?  He ate it all.<br /><br />Bottom line...good ingredients, cat likes it.  Five paws up.

review/summary: Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie)
review/text: Well, my kitty did not like this at first.  He was really annoyed with me.  Left the food in the bowl and walked away all angry and poofy looking.  Ouch.<br /><br />But, then he came back a little later and starting scarfing.  And from that point on, he's been joyfully eating this.  I'm so glad!<br /><br />The food is very good looking and doesn't have that 'cat food' smell, which is very nice.  I hate getting that cat food smell on my hands!  Blech.  This food is not smelly at all.<br /><br />I like the 3-ounce cans.  I've tried to save some money by getting bigger cans, giving him half and covering and storing the other half for later in the refrigerator, but he doesn't like his food cold (I don't blame him) and it seems to just get wasted.  So, I like the smaller cans.<br /><br />Ultimately, as long as the food is ok for him, the only thing that matters to me is if my kitty will eat it and be happy with it.  And he is.  So, I'll get him this again.<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />UPDATE - 15 December 2008<br /><br />We just finished the last can last night and my kitty enjoyed every single one.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie was a little bothersome because it has so much liquid in it.  If I wasn't careful as I opened the can, I would wear some of the juice.  Yes, it's very nice juice, but I still didn't want it on me!  My kitty really liked the juice so it was worth the extra effort to be careful as I opened the can.<br /><br />I will order more of this and cycle it in with his other canned food.

review/summary: Almost worthy of five stars
review/text: I did not hold out much hope for this product. We have two pedigree Persian cats, and they are as finicky eaters as any cats alive. My wife and I have tried all kinds of different wet and dry foods, but our cats usually just turn up their noses and look at us like we're stupid, until we give them something we know they like. So, when this arrived and I opened the chicken pot pie to see it was full of chunks of chicken and carrot (and something else, potato maybe) in what looked like chicken soup, I braced myself for packing up the remainder and donating it to the local animal shelter...but, NO! Both of our cats dug right in. Both ate up all the soup, and one cleared his bowl. The other left the larger chunks of chicken and all the veggies (he never eats veggies). For our cats, that's a rave review. The second kind, shredded chicken in sesame sauce, they didn't like as much, but they still cleared out all the liquid and a good portion of the chicken. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised they ate as much of the new stuff as they did. It must be good. For us, these single serving size cans are perfect, because we can split one between the two cats (they don't eat much), or give half in the morning and half in the evening, so it comes in quantities our pets are comfortable with. Also, packaging two kinds in one box is helpful, as our cats also thrive on variety. Because our cats did not eat it down to the bowl like they would their current favorites, I can't give the product five stars, but I do give this product a hearty four and half stars, and I think we are likely to buy this brand in the future if its price is competitive with our cats' current favorites.

review/text: Janie Marie Appleseed prefers the Chinese chicken to the pot pie, and especially laps up its saucy goodness, so score one from the kitty's POV. Me, kitty Mama? I think it would be cool if they were available as one or the other to the box. Or even singly, but guess that probably wouldn't make sense through Amazon. I like that Petite Cuisine is available in small cans, as she never finishes a 6 oz. meal in a single sitting, but wish there was a little plastic lid the right size to fit when she doesn't even finish 3 oz. Also, for my druthers, it's overkill on the packaging. Lose the inner boxes, just stick the 24 cans in the one outer box. Oh, kudos on no food coloring.

review/summary: Three out of four cats approve; owner less enthused
review/text: My gang is typically not very fussy when it comes to food - if it doesn't move (or, at least move too much) they'll eat it. So, I was pretty sure they'd like this up-scale food.<br /><br />Surprisingly, one did not - while she didn't turn up her nose at it, she didn't really want to eat it either.  The other three gave it their licked-clean food bowl seal of approval.<br /><br />The cans are small (the "mini" can size much like Fancy Feast) which is a good match for single cat households since you don't have to deal with leftovers. The smell is much better than the low-cost can foods, and about on a par with the more premium brands such as Hills. The chicken pot pie was VERY watery, however - more like a soup than a stew. The sesame chicken was a bit more solid. The watery nature of the product also makes it messy to serve. To me, it's not a very good value especially considering that you're paying for a lot of water.<br /><br />I don't think I'd get this again given the cost and the mess factor, plus the fact that  there are several other brands that provide top-notch nutrition at a lower cost (and less mess). I also try to purchase items that are US-made, and this is made in Thailand. But, the majority of the cats snarfed it down, so it's deserving of at least 3 stars.

review/summary: Looks Fantastic!
review/text: I have two Kitties and they love their food. I saw this cat food here and because I care about the cats,I decided to investigate this food because it looked good. With the problems with the cat foods from China recently,I was concerned about the wheat gluten and other foul additives which are not good for the kittens.<br /><br />This company has a really good website where they state that none of those foul additives are in their foods and because of the classy looking website I was relieved enough to get this for my brood.<br /><br />On opening the can,I was surprised and pleased at the look of the food.<br />Bits of carrot and beautiful chunks of white meat chicken in a rich looking gravy. They say it's "People food for cats" and it truly looks THAT good. But enough of my palaver, the important judges spoke up in the way that counts most,they concentrated on the new food until the plate was empty followed by contented grooming. The little girl cat is primarily one that picks at her food a few minutes then leaves and comes back later for more eating and on & on,but with this stuff she was parked in front of the dish till everything was consumed. I take that as a good sign

Nice sized chunks of chicken and vegetables in a lot of gravy.<br /><br />That being said, Ms Casiopia lapped up all the gravy and left the rest.

If your cat will eat chunks and vegetables, this product is for you.<br /><br />I have donated the remainder of the package to a less fortunate friend.<br /><br />Thank you.

review/summary: Chinese chicken and Chicken pot pie
review/text: All 5 of my cats liked both flavors preferring the Chinese chicken to the very watery pot pie. Although it does not state it is human grade, it certainly appears that it is by sight and smell. Both appeared to have a cornstarch based "gravy" with shredded or diced white chicken meat and diced carrots. I took my cats gobbling it down that it was tasty. I was surprised all of them liked both flavors as 2 of my cats are rather finicky. This cat food reminds me of a similar product Whole Foods used to carry in their brand name that I bought on a clearance sale. I alternate buying dry and canned food by Castor & Pollux's (regular and organic), Natural Balance, AvoDern, and By Nature (regular and organic). I feed them regular canned during the week and organic canned food on the weekends. The only issue I have w/ this product is the price point. The brands previously listed range from 5.5 to 6.5 oz. (By Nature-only 12 6.5 cans) and none are watery. They cost the same per can or you could view it as almost half price since the weight is almost double. Since I'm feeding 5 cats approximately 3oz. canned per day and all the dry they can eat at about $2/oz., I try to be as cost effective as possible while only purchasing those high quality products which I also consider this cat food to be. If you read up on pet food in general, you will no longer purchase poor quality food such as Friskies, Iiams, Science Diet, Fancy Feast, etc. If you go to PETCO or Care A-Lot(they carry better brands than PetSmart) and read the ingredient list you will be shocked, appalled, and enlightened. Cats do not well tolerate wheat, corn or soy and NO pet should EVER be fed animal by-products (see pet food at About.com for more information). Since Amazon currently has a [...] coupon off of [...] purchase, I will likely go ahead and purchase the crab flavor and the mixed fish case. Keep in mind you should limit the amount of tuna fed to your cat as well as to your children and any adult (see FDA website for tuna cautions and listed safe fish to eat). I hope in the future Petite Cuisine produces a more cost effective 5-6 ounce can sold in a 24 can case.

review/text: Petite Cuisine is labeled as "People food for cats." That's about right! If I didn't know it was for cats, I might have tried it because indeed, it looks and smells quite wonderful. The kinds of fish, too, are to my liking. Anytime I go to the sushi restaurant I get yellowfin, snapper, and tuna. However, and this is a big one, my cats have looked at it, tried it, and declined it. They usually eat Fancy Feast - the grilled kind - and I don't understand what in Petite Cuisine would not be to their liking. Maybe it's too healthy. It does have the ingredients one should like: fresh fish, juicy sauce, vitamins...<br />So I have to assume that to any reasonable and average cat, this would be perfectly satisfactory and more than that. I'd give it 5 stars if my cats ate it.

review/summary: Only the best for my Pussing Foot Kitties
review/text: Petite Cuisine Chicken Pot Pie for Cats: This is an expensive bit of tomfoolery for my kitty cats. When the humans in the house get a special bit of food, the kitties do also. They are my all day companions and when the humans celebrate so do the cats.  The biggest CON for the product is the cost, which depending upon the specials in force at the time make it about a dollar a can which is 3 oz--filet migion anyone??? But on the PLUS side, the kitties lap up the entire can without the usual bits of this and that left over depending upon how well they like the daily fare. ALSO, both of my cats are male which makes them prone to urinary tract problems. In addition to pure white meat chichen, this has a watery sauce with it which they "slurp" right up which adds to their daily fluid intake. After reading many books on cats and kittens, I decided that these male animals needed at least half of their daily fare in "wet food" to avoid urinary type probs. This really helps as cats are not noted fluid imbibers unless the fluid is sauce based (or is my lemonade which they make sure to contaminate--UGH!). So I love them and spend a little extra from time to time. The humans in the house make out well too!!!! Best wishes to all and hope this helps. December 2008

review/summary: Surprisingly good quality.
review/text: I share some of the views of other reviewers, particularly the fact that this product is from Thailand.  Upon opening the first can of the Sesame Chicken, I was struck by how high the quality looked (the shredded chicken looked as if it had been plucked from the bone), as well as the yummy smell.  I was tempted to heat some up and try it myself!  Resisting that urge, I served it to my cats and they went after it like white on rice, lapping every bit of it up.  And I have some picky cats!<br />The following day, I gave them the Chicken Pot Pie variety; it smelled good, but looked more like chicken soup, with a lot of liquid (and yes, it was somewhat messy).  My cats (except for one) dove into it nonetheless, although they did not wolf it down in one sitting as they did the other flavor.<br />All in all, my cats give the product a big paws-up; however, like another reviewer, I would tend to give this out as a special treat versus daily feeding.  For that purpose, I do recommend this product.

Upon opening the little can, I see flakes of fish & some liquid.  Smells like fish that you eat.  Check the ingredients, hmmm fish.  How about that?  No by products?  Where are the guts they scrap off the floor?  All that yummy stuff not fit for humans to eat...even though a small percentage does end up in our food supply.  The box says "People Food for Cats"  They weren't kidding!  That's why this is so expensive!  It's FOOD!  Such a novel concept!<br />Do the cats like it?  Oh my yes!  We have 6 cats & they simply LOVE this stuff & why wouldn't they?  This food, it is worth it!  Good food equals healthy cats.  Healthy cats don't go to the vet so darn much.  Less vet visits equal more money!  Yippie!<br />To ease the price burden, each 4 pack box of food contained a coupon for $1.00 off the next 4 pack purchase.  If you fill in some info on the coupon itself, they will mail you an additional $1.00 off coupon for your next purchase.  Not bad!

Almost $1 per can for the small 3oz size is pretty steep.  There are other choices out there in canned cat food without by-products for much less.  And choosing the larger 5.5 oz cans in any brand, while not as convenient, will save a lot of money.

Chicken and rabbit are often more recommended for cats.  The first ingredient is fish broth, making it somewhat high in moisture.  I've heard that cats often need more water than they drink, so I'd assume its a good thing to get more moisture down them, but this is an expensive way to do it (you could just add a little water to their food).  The good news is that there appears to be no grains in the ingredient list, looks like almost all meat based (except for the usual additives).  The grains in most catfoods are thought to not be good for the cats.  This catfood is not cheap, but it appears to be a better than usual cat food.

review/summary: Looks and smells like human food
review/text: What can you say about cat food?  Actually this looks and smells good enough to eat (but I'm not going to try it myself).  So I gave it to all four of our cats when they were not particularly hungry (not at a normal meal time) and they all seemed to enjoy it (even the one that often completely refuses to eat anything but "crunchies").<br /><br />Reviewing the label it sounds healthy.  The high taurine content is definitely very healthy for cats.  The only "fault" I could imagine is the relatively high price (tiny cans and the fact that it has a high moisture content - the moisture is healthy, but you're paying for water).<br /><br />If you can afford to spoil your cats, give this food a try (be careful your kids don't try to eat it by accident {laugh}).

review/summary: My Cat Has Enjoyed Petite Cuisine
review/text: Naturally this review is based upon my cat's intake of Petite Cuisine. She's not a particular picky eater, so I can't say much about that. However, she looks to really enjoy this brand of cat food. I have tried some brands of wet food in the past that have made her sick (I know cats seem to have digestive systems that are prone to upsetting!) Petite Cuisine did not have any effect there, and she really enjoyed all the flavors. I don't feed her wet food often, usually just some tuna fish now and then. So, although this food is expensive if you used it at every meal, it is priced about the same as tuna, so it fits my needs perfectly. I'm sure my cat will enjoy the rest of this case, and I can keep the canned tuna to myself for now :-)

review/text: I'm not too sure why they named this chicken based cat food with names like "Chinese Chicken", but my 2 cats seem to know.  Both of them eat this stuff up like it's the last supper.<br /><br />Based upon the ingredients, I feel like I'm feeding them something far more nutritious than Fancy Feast (which they love, except for the salmon, which makes them puke).

review/summary: Cat Tested, Owner Approved
review/text: We have made friends recently with an abandoned tabby cat we call Mr. Whiskers. I am sure he would be grateful for most anything on a plate at this stage, still he appears to be a gentleman of discernment. And at first whiff of Petite Cuisine, he settled down to some serious feeding and joyously licked his whiskers afterwards.<br /><br />This is an obviously high end cat food and looks and smells good enough for humans. (Let us hope in this economy it does not come to that.) As long as I can afford it I will continue feeding him this brand. I have seen pets fed cheap food develop terrible tumors on their poor little bodies, so I am committed to serving him the best I can find / afford.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you care about your pet and can afford it I highly reccommend this brand. I was quite impressed by the quality.

review/summary: A NEW BRAND FOR ME
review/text: I admit it, I had never heard of this brand of cat food before trying this. I was dubious to the hilt for I have a 16 year old cat that puts a new meaning to the term finicky feline!! I cannot tell you how many times I have put food in front of her only to have her walk away. She wants what she wants!! So trying this product I went in with a wary attitude. Alas, she went right for it! So far I have tried three of the flavors and she has liked each one. Being so old I have had trouble finding brands that worked well with her digestive system. I have had no problems with Petite Cuisine so far. Looks like this is a winner in my house. If you have a fussy eater try this one out. You may be pleasantly surprised!

review/summary: Very healthy cat food. Much better than almost any other
review/text: This is some of the healthiest cat food on the market. It is all natural and doesn't contain food byproducts. What comes out of the can looks like real food (just below human quality) not a mash-up of mysterious goop. The fish in these cans has texture, and smells better than other cat food.<br /><br />My two cats absolutely love it.<br /><br />If you want a healthy cat food that is natural and not made in China, give these a try. I can't guarantee your cat(s) will love it as much as mine, but if they don't like it, they need to grow taste buds!

review/summary: Our kitties LOVE this food!!!!
review/text: I wasn't sure how my cats would like Petite Cuisine, because they are Friskies cats.  Man, do they love their friskies: seafood, chicken, or maybe a little turkey (but they don't like beef)...as long as the friskies aren't in that big glop they call "classic pate."<br /><br />No 9Lives, no science diet, no canned tuna, no non-friskies brands, thank you very much!  They're cats.  They're picky about what they eat!<br /><br />So I tried this Petite Cuisine, assuming that - just like everything else - they would reject it.  BOY was I wrong!!!!  They literally lapped up the entire plate of the stuff within the first hour after I first put it out.  And it seems to be easy on their digestive system: they don't seem to be barfing it up like they sometimes do when new food comes into the picture.<br /><br />Since it looks like real fish that you or I would eat from a can, I am worried that - just like canned tuna - it's going to cause horribly smelly you-know-whats.<br /><br />I want to check with my vet to see if he thinks it's healthy.  But from the taste point of view, my cats have rated this five meows!

review/summary: the kitties say "more, please!"
review/text: We have six cats ranging in age from a year old to seventeen years old (with diabetes and hyperthyroid). The eldest guy gets mostly canned food (Wellness and Eagle Pack, plus prescription food mixed in) because he's missing teeth and tends to be a picky eater. Everyone loves this food.<br /><br />I love it too because it looks like real food and smells like real food. The fish isn't stinky at all (I got some wellness shrimp & sardine that about ran me out of the house once, LOL!). There's plenty of liquid to help the old guy eat it, and even my mom's cat who is finicky loves it too.<br /><br />I like the fact that I'm feeding high quality, human grade food to my cats. This is good stuff, and I'm going to look for it locally. Thanks!

review/summary: The kitty committee has reached a decision.
review/text: My three cats, two females and a male (well, they used to be anyway), all have extremely different personalities and tastes in cat food. I tried an experiment to see which of the flavors of Petite Cuisine would appeal to tough-guy, and which ms. whiner would like best, and whether or not clingy-dependent had a preference. I think I can state for the scientific record that the appeal of all four flavors of Petite Cuisine transcends even personality-based inclination.<br /><br />The cans may be small, but once you pop the top and tip one into your cat's bowl, you see how much was packed in there. The pieces of fish are large and fresh looking (although I was not tempted to go for the bread and mayo, they smelled good, too). My cats ate every morsel of the food, instead of sucking up the gravy and leaving half the solid to petrify onto the sides of their bowl as they do with other sliced cat foods in sauce.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine is pricey, but I think I might keep a carton on hand for occasional special treats. I wouldn't be able to afford it all the time, despite the fact that it's actually worth the price.

review/summary: Even for a picky cat
review/text: I tried these out with my cat in the hopes of finding something she would like!  She tends to not like canned food very much.  I was truly surprised when she showed immediate interest in the snapper variety and then actually ate the whole can.  She was not very fond of the yellowfin--she nibbled a bit and then wanted dry food.  I am thrilled to finally have found something she likes.  She will eat thr tuna, but not with the enthusiasm she has for the snapper. I also like the smaller portion size--no more covering cans and keeping them in the fridge--only to have to warm them up for the next meal.  Definitely try these out.

review/text: My cat, an 11 year old tabby who is not at all finicky, nonetheless went a bit wild when I opened up one of the cans of this "people food for cats" entree. It also contains flavors I have never seen on offer before, such as Yellowfin and Snapper. I am always a bit hesitant, after last years awful pet food poisonings, in trying something new, but all seems well. One thing - open the cans with care. They are packed full and can be quite messy if not opened over a sink or trash can.

Is gluten free an issue for cats?  As far as safety of ingredients, additives, and processing, who knows?  And unless one can be assured of safety, why pay so much more?

review/summary: Kitties declare it a winner!
review/text: The kitties seemed to know the package from Amazon was for them and meowed loudly while I opened it up. Petite Cuisine Variety pack was here!<br /><br />This product comes in a 3 oz can which is just the right size to split between the two cats. (Of course, my food obsessed male cat could have eaten the whole can himself and then some). Upon opening the can, the food itself looked better than even "people tuna" with nice large chunks. The kitties' heads did not move from their bowls until every last morsel was gone. Nigel (foodie cat) kept looking around for more, checking out the kitchen, the table...<br /><br />The kitties certainly enjoyed it, but as their caretaker I also appreciated the ingredients. Fish and fish broth, and NO gluten or by products. Exactly what I am looking for.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because of the price, I would probably consider this more as a treat or a meal supplement than a primary food. The serving suggestion is one can for each 2 1/2 pounds of body weight per day. Let's just say that for my two kitties, and Nigel Cat in particular, this would add up to a LOT of cans of food.<br /><br />However...I definitely plan to keep treating them!

review/summary: Please check the controversial ingredients and decide for yourself
review/text: While several reviewers have alluded to the healthfulness of this product, I think that we owe it to our beloved pets to pay closer attention and educate ourselves about the actual ingredients.<br /><br />The overall appearance gives an allure of wholesomeness to this product, but an item listed in the ingredients is actually controversial with regards to our pets' health. (And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione "produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung." Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one.

review/summary: Looks like a winner
review/text: I'm a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves.  I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food.  They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China.  It's a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China.<br /><br />What they do use was also reassuring.  White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals.  The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn't something that should necessarily  be fed often, but it's a minor consideration.  While it's never said that the ingredients are "human grade" they are listed as safe for humans to eat.  I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't want to feed my pets anything that wasn't safe for me to eat.<br /><br />The carton arrived and was marked as "Product of Thailand" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site.  They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food.  (It's also listed as "dolphin safe."  This is a pretty politically correct company.)<br /><br />Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating.  My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting.  The chicken pot pie, not so much.  It smells wonderful, but is very watery.  Again, this is a minor consideration.  If my cat likes it, that's the important thing.  He's a picky boy, in part because he can't eat beef or lamb, so he's limited to poultry and certain types of fish.  He doesn't tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods.  But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let's just say, he doesn't hate it.  I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he's getting a quality meal.<br /><br />Your mileage -- or your cat's -- may vary, of course.  Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they're going to take violent dislike to.  I can't tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards.  Yes, it's pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you'd give to any member of the family, you probably won't balk at the cost.<br /><br />The rest is up to your cat.

review/summary: a review from Trixie the Wondercat as told to her person....
review/text: I had been told that finally the day would come when my own package from amazon would come and today it finally came. What was in the box was basically the winnings from some cat lottery.  A case of seafood dinners-Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, & Tuna & Shrimp.  I was sleeping when my person stood with my treat dish poised above my nose.  "Don't bug me" I thought as I sleepily eyed what she had in hand....A TREAT!<br /><br />I quickly followed into the kitchen to partake of a delicious entree of Red Snapper.  This totally looks like peoplefood!  I scarfed down a half a can immediately and if there was a pattern at the bottom of my bowl I would have licked that off as well.  That was one clean dish.  I've been told that tomorrow we'll try maybe Yellowfin, which sounds equally good.<br /><br />Likes:  looks like peoplefood, smells good, not overly fishy, and they add vitamins and no wheat gluten....hm, not sure about that one, but apparently wheat gluten isn't good.  Anyway....it is delicious and it is much like my other favorite, "Sheba".<br />Dislikes: My people wouldn't just leave me the whole can because they don't think I'll stop eating, but that's really more of a personal issue.<br /><br />Four paws up on this one!

I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings.

review/summary: Crab meat layer thin as veneer
review/text: The crab meat layer on top is about a 1/4" (I'm being generous in my measurement)w/ the rest being tuna and a substantial share of broth. Of course my cats loved it and each devoured a whole can. I felt it was quite overpriced for tuna and will not purchase again. I think it's much more cost-effective to buy a can of Phillip's crab meat from the grocery store so my cats and I can both enjoy it.

review/summary: Warning: Contains Menadione
review/text: According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione "produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung." Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.

review/summary: The cat seems pleased.
review/text: The cat went right for this food, no hesitation.  I rate 4 out of 5 stars because the canned food is too low in protein and fats to use the main pet diet.  I recommend this product with the caveat that you supplement it with additional protein and fats (a dry food would be good).

review/summary: Quality ingredients; unfortunately, not a hit with my cat
review/text: The first test for a new canned cat food is the ingredient list.  The ingredients in Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (chicken flavors) passed this test with flying colors: Chicken, Chicken Broth, Carrots are listed first and there is no wheat gluten. Unfortntately, the 2nd test is whether my cat will eat the food and this ended up with a big thumbs down. Not sure if it was the significant amount of broth in a serving or the fact that it is chicken (he usually has fish-based canned food), but after a 1st bite, he just walked away.<br /><br />If a cat is accustomed to eating chicken canned food, I would still recommend giving this a try because of the quality ingredients.

review/summary: My cats love this stuff!
review/text: I wasn't quite sure my cats would eat this because I've never fed them anything other than dry kibble.  I needn't have worried; my cats love it!<br /><br />I like that it has human grade ingredients (no bad odors here) and that it contains absolutely no gluten (the ingredient that caused a massive pet food recall a few years back).  Something I didn't know before ordering Petite Cuisine is that it comes in recyclable aluminum cans, which means it won't contribute to the overflowing landfill problem.<br /><br />All in all, my only complaint is the cost, but I will probably buy more for my cats as a special treat.  They will love me for it.

review/summary: MMMEEEEEEOOOOWWWW!!
review/text: Let me start here by admitting that we have 5 cats that live with us now (I know, don't even ask it's a loooong story).  I've always been a big fan of the Fancy Feast and recently the fishier varieties of the Aristocats soft foods.  On occasion I will purchase Friskies but honestly I just can't stand the smell of the latter, even if the kitties just love it.<br /><br />Just for a fun little test I decided to put three cans out, to see which was favored by my cats (Fancy Feast, Aristocats and this Petite Cuisine).  Well, long story short, they gobbled this brand up, quick as quick before moving on to their usual favorites.<br /><br />This brand looks and for the most part smells similar to canned tuna, one of them even has tiny whole shrimp. Bonus!! They eat it all up, so no kitty food sitting in the bowl when they are done. It is made from quality ingredients, not full of ash (like some), has added vitamins and the texture & smell that the cats really enjoy.  I admit that quality cat food has gotten a bit on the expensive side but, this isn't bad at all considering the prices of the other comparable brands.  All in all my kitties really enjoyed this food & I will certainly be back for more.

review/summary: This is not Fancy Feast
review/text: Petite Cuisine is a proposed competitor to Fancy Feast.  Insofar as taste, well, my cat, Matt, will eat anything, and this is no exception.  He plowed right through all four flavors:  red snapper, tuna and sole, tuna and shrimp and yellow fin tuna.  Matt is a food addict, and I have to control his intake, giving him four measured meals a day.  Only one of those meals per day is a half of a 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast or a worthwhile substitute.  The caloric intake is such that giving him any more than that would double his already 17 pound size.<br /><br />In any case, I compared the Guarantee Analysis of Fancy Feast to Petite Cuisine, and here are the numbers:<br /><br />1.  Crude protein:  Fancy Feast...minimum 14.0%; Petite Cuisine...13%.<br />2.  Crude fat:  Fancy Feast...minimum 3.0%; Petite Cuisine...1.5%.<br />3.  Crude fiber:  Fancy Feast...maximum 1.5%; Petite Cuisine...1%.<br />4.  Moisture:  Fancy Feast...maximum 78.0%; Petite Cuisine...85%.<br />5.  Ash:  Fancy Feast...maximum 3.5%; Petite Cuisine...3%.<br />6.  Taurine:  Fancy Feast...minimum 0.05%; Petite Cuisine...0.1%.<br /><br />In particular, I noticed that Petite Cuisine is much runnier than Fancy Feast, which has a fairly thick consistency in ground varieties and much thicker gravy in those versions as well.  All together and based upon the comparison of content, I would prefer to purchase Fancy Feast; however, another factor you should consider is overall cost, especially if you are feeding more than one cat.

review/summary: #1 Ingredient is Mostly Water
review/text: I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a "fair shake", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a "bad batch" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat "favorites" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into "fish broth", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on "fish water" doesn't sound like a good deal to me.

review/text: My cat is diabetic and was on insulin twice a day. I started researching and found that this was the highest protien lowest carb wet cat food I could get. My 15 year old cat now eats Petite Cuisine morning and night and has Purina DM Diebetic management dry food available 24 hours a day and he is no longer on any insulin. He loves the Petite Cuisine it is ALL Natural and looks and smells like people food. I'm afraid to taste it but the ingredients are all good enough for humans so they are great for my cat!! I strongly recomend this food.

review/summary: My cat likes the broth
review/text: I read the reviews before I signed up for a subscription for this cat food but, as usual, I didn't believe the negative ones. I was sure my cat would like it because it came in those cute little cans. She does like the can and she'll meow and whine until it's opened. Once in her bowl, she'll lap up the broth and then grudgingly eat the chunks of meat but the smaller ones have to be dumped. I'm signed up for a shipment once every six months but I'll have to rethink that. It was supposed to be a treat for her but if she doesn't like it, it isn't much of a treat. You think?

review/summary: Seems to give our cat more energy.
review/text: I have a huge, overweight cat that I adopted from the pound.  He doesn't eat that much, but he doesn't move much either, which I think causes his weight problem. He normally eats an expensive dry cat food recommended by his vet. When I chose Petite Cuisine, I was a little concerned that it would add to his weight problem, but it seems the opposite has happened.  Within a week, he seemed  to have more energy and has been up playing and chasing invisible mice around the house.  We've never seen him move this much in the two years that we've had him.  I don't know if his diet was missing something that this cat food contains, or if it's just coincidence.  I haven't weighed him, but he seems a little lighter, and he sure acts like he feels better.  We're feeding him half a can a day in addition to his dry cat food.<br /><br />The only downside to the fish flavors is that I notice that the smell hangs in the house, even if I scrub up everything after he eats.
