review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I bought this for my dad since he was getting into making his own sausages. He received it and was absolutely pleased with the product! He said that the instructions were great and said the seasonings were fabulous! He's already mentioned how he wants to buy another package and eventually start making and experimenting with his own seasonings. All in all, great buy!

review/summary: Just made a batch and it's great!
review/text: I hadn't tried this seasoning for summer sausage prior to today and I just finished smoking up 15 lbs. and it came out great. I used 75% venison and 25% beef in my mix just to get a little bit more fat in the mix and it came our really good. I found the flavor to not be "too much or too little" making the sausage exactly as directed on the package.

review/text: I'm just getting into making my own sausage, and bought this kit to try breakfast links.  However, it contains corn syrup solids.  Corn syrup is one of the many terrible things I've removed from my diet and will never add back.  Returning it immediately.  I'll buy casings on their own and try a recipe from scratch.

review/summary: Great gift basket @ KILLER PRICE!
review/text: Awsome. I first started eating these snacks when I found the LAST bag of the Valdosta Pecan variety. I thought they were awsome, but I could never find them at Costco again. I have been trying out a few of Amazons subscriptions and it hit me that maybe I should search them up. Of course they were available and I got a subscription to the Valdosta Pecan. Then I found these gift packs on sale for LESS THAN MY SUBSCRIPTION! YES! And it's a variety pack, which makes it even MORE AWSOME! Each flavor is unique and is AWSOME in it's own way...@ 60% off, I plan to buy a ton and keep them in stock and give a few away as gifts. These are REALLY GREAT snacks! I am certainly hooked!

review/summary: Good Enough!
review/text: A person with sugar restrictions does not have a wide range of options when it comes to sweet options. Now, imagine a person in this category with a very demanding "sweet tooth" and obviously there is going to be a need to compensate the desire with what is reasonably allowed under this type of strict diet. Enter Maple Grove Farms Vermont Sugar Free Syrup and of course, some kind of mix that will make tasty waffles or pancakes and is low on the carbs. Those that suffer from this kind of problem can certainly enjoy a couple of pancakes, okey, maybe three small ones with syrup and sugar free whipped cream let's say each Saturday morning and do not have to feel like the whole world is coming undone based on this wish. I have found very little faults with this brand. Hey, no one is competing with all the varieties available to mankind so once that is understood and the expectations in general are safely toned down this product is Good Enough for that moment of indulgence. I am surprised no one had reviewed this product and that is why I have. 4 Stars is a solid rating and I believe it deserves it but please recognize that I am way past the "demanding" stage, expecting more than what I am probably allowed to have and in that context this is good syrup to use. I have been using several mixes to make the pancakes or waffles, mostly expensive and not too pleasing, of which I am not loyal to any in particular and of course, some are better than others. Atkins is about to release a new mix (mid August) that supposedly will be very tasty (would they say otherwise before release?) and if it works then that aspect of my existence would be taken care of. A real low carb mix, a sugar free syrup and good luck to all in amazon who have to contend with these kind of  limitations. I have learned that no one is better than another just because they can have something the other can't. Those that are better are the caring, creative and always filled with pleasant humor that make the arduous journey of life a thing of beauty. Wow! Once again I probably overdid it but my heart, I think, in in the right place. 4 Stars for Maple Grove Farms Vermont Sugar Free, 12-Ounces (Pack of 6) and start making them at home and put IHOP as a last alternative!

review/summary: Easy to mix, no film - the old "classic" formula is back!
review/text: It seems Enfamil learned the same lesson Coca Cola did with the new Coke - if it ain't broke, don't fix it! If you tried the "new and improved" Enfamil Toddler formula and hated it, good news! This 5-pack 15oz Enfamil appears to be the original toddler formula that our kids loved, that doesn't leave a greasy film and doesn't curdle. It is NOT the "new and improved" natural milk flavor one with corn syrup as the second ingredient that has parents up in arms.<br /><br />The packaging and label on the amazon listing look the same, but it arrives in a plain box with five refill bags. It has:<br />* nonfat milk and vegetable oil (palm olein, soy, coconut and sunflower oils), instead of the whole milk of the "new" version<br />* corn syrup solids as the third ingredient, not the second<br />* no natural flavoring added<br />* the formula doesn't curdle after an hour and there is no greasy film, so washing bottles is a whole lot easier.<br />* the same 160 calories per 8 fluid oz as the new version; however, protein has been reduced, from 6 to 4 grams. Carbohydrates are down as well, from 21 to 16.8 grams. Fat has increased, from 6 to 8.5 g. 860 g of linoleic acid now appear on the label. In terms of vitamins Iodine, Selenium and Vitamin B12 have been added. Please see comments for additional nutrition information.<br /><br />I've also found cans with the same "old" formula recently in stores (with nonfat milk as the first ingredient), mixed in with the new version with whole milk. It can be confusing so you'll need to read the label to know which is which. It's not clear if the manufacturer has quietly started phasing out its new and improved version (the refill packs with the non-fat milk formula have a 2013 expiration date vs the new formula which said 2012). In any case, it's great if they have as I haven't found another alternative for toddler formula I liked.<br /><br />The Enfamil Toddler formula is balanced nutritionally for toddlers. However, it is expensive so for my twins, I'm looking at other alternatives to supplement their meals, instead of toddler formula. with a balanced diet is just as good nutritionally and a lot less expensive.Carnation Instant Breakfast No Sugar Added, Chocolate, 8 ct (Quantity of 4) can provide added nutrition and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ARPKBW">PediaSure Nutrition Drink, Lactose Free, Vanilla, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 24)</a> is indicated for weight gain and to fill in nutritional gaps, especially if you have a picky eater.<br /><br />As always, check with your pediatrician when making a change in formula or diet.

review/summary: The perfect rice for making sushi
review/text: Kokuho Rose is a variety of medium-grained rice developed and grown in California by Koda Farms. It is very similar to Japanese rice (japonica), which is short-grained and fat. Introduced to the American market in 1963, it is well-suited for Japanese cuisine because it's very sticky and glutinous, having the same taste and texture as Japanese rice. It is a very popular choice for making sushi because it is relatively easy to find and inexpensive.<br /><br />To make sushi rice, the kernels have to be washed until the water is clear, then steamed. I use an electric rice cooker like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009E3F68">Panasonic SRG06FG 3-Cup Automatic Rice Cooker</a>, but you can get fancier ones that cost upwards of $100. Cooked perfectly, the grains are firm, slightly elastic and have a shiny, pearl-like luster.<br /><br />You should be able to find this at your local Asian supermarket, as it is a widely distributed brand. Some bigger American supermarkets may also carry it. Another popular brand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HQKHUI">Nishiki Premium Rice</a>. These are the two major brands I use and recommend. If you can't find either of these, a third brand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MCHN8Q">Botan Rice</a>.

review/summary: Inferior to other sticky rice brands
review/text: I tried this brand along with about 5 others while on a recent sushi making kick.  This rice was significantly inferior to several brands of other California grown sticky rice, as well actual sticky rice from Japan.  Rice came out more mushy than other brands - almost like it was overcooked, and on several occasions I would find a few hard pieces of rice mixed in with the rest.  It's passable, but definitely not preferred, especially if you are trying to make sushi or something else where rice texture is important. At the time of this review the price is $14.95 for a 5 lb bag, compared to $7.20 for the same bag at my local Japanese supermarket - the review grade does not reflect this price differential, recognizing that it could change.  I should point out however, that at $15 for a 5 lb bag, you can buy premium sticky rice imported from Japan in a decent Japanese supermarket.<br /><br />Update: Have added additional brands to my comparison list, this one really is on the bottom by far, I question whether the 5 star reviewers have tried any other options (just about any California short grain variety, Botan Calrose from the supermarket, Nishiki - all significantly better than this.)

review/summary: An astonished and ecstatic novice user
review/text: I'm quite the novice when it comes to rice, so I'm not going to deliver any lectures on the genetic and cultural history of sticky white rice. I just know that I like the sticky rice that I've gotten from the better Chinese take-out restaurants. I also know that the precooked rice packages I was preparing at home were too expensive and not that good. And it also seemed like a good time to stop eating too many potatoes.<br /><br />So I bought a bag of this rice, a bestselling Aroma rice cooker, and a good rice washing bowl. My selections weren't based on expertise. I just went with things at the top of Amazon's bestseller lists that were in an economical price range. I carefully rinsed enough rice for a dinner party of four, threw it all in the cooker, pushed two buttons, and checked it an hour later.<br /><br />Boy, was I ever amazed. This product produced the best sticky white rice I've had from anywhere--home cooking, take-out, restaurants. It has that nice glutinous quality that allows the rice clump to together in some of the most favorable mouthfuls I have ever had so far as white rice. This stuff is really a keeper. At the rate I'm going through  it, one bag might last 5-6 weeks. And that's for just one person.<br /><br />I guess this rice is good for sushi. I wouldn't know. I just like to load it on a plate, use some salt, crushed peppercorns, and soy sauce, and put something else (like an entree) off to the side. The rice is so good by itself, the entree is almost incidental.<br /><br />So I expect to be buying more very soon and highly recommend this. I also recommend the Aroma cookers, which are quite the bargain right now.

review/summary: Versatile and easy to love
review/text: I'd never tried this rice before, despite seeing it around forever and hearing good things about it. Finally picked up a bag when we ran out of our Lundberg Akitakomachi rice (good stuff -- try it), and was pleasantly surprised. I did rinse it several times until the water ran clear, and brought the cooking water up to just about my first finger joint. Brought it to a boil, then covered and let simmer for 15 minutes, then shut the heat and let it steam for about 20 minutes more.<br /><br />It has a very pleasant gloss and stickiness, along with a subtle, clean flavor. It's perfect for sushi, but I'll also use it alongside other Asian meals, since it's very chopstick-friendly. Our staple is usually Golden Phoenix Thai Jasmine, which is exceptional -- if you're lucky enough to find it, don't miss it; but I'll definitely start adding this rice into the rotation. The texture is quite delightful and a nice change of pace. If you enjoy moist, stickier rices for general eating as well as sushi, you'll find a lot of ways to use Kokuho Rose. But shop around, as the listed price is quite high for the amount of rice.<br /><br />I also picked up a bag of the same producer's sweet/glutinous rice, specifically to use for homemade rice wine. I was surprised to find it too bland for eating, but it worked just fine for the wine.

review/text: Sooo happy to have found some ground walnuts. I have a wonderful recipe for a walnut cake that uses only ground walnuts, no flours at all. Yummy and healthy.  Grinding walnuts is such a pain and have searched high and low for ground ones.<br /><br />I have rarely found ground walnuts, and when I have, it was extremely expensive. It was unexpected to fine it here, and at a reasonable price compared to any other souce. AND free shipping.<br /><br />Came in super quick, as with all items purchase from or through Amazon.

review/summary: Organic? Not certified.
review/text: I am not convinced this product is organic and will therefore not buy it again. The packaging on this product leaves me wondering how organic "Healthyway Organic Goji Berry" really is. There is no independent verification authority to confirm that this product is really organic. As far as I can tell, it is not certified organic by any authority other than the supplier and distributor. The 'Nutrition Facts" on the label have some strange entries like "Quantity of Heat" and "Thick Protein" which I do not understand. They sound like direct translations of Chinese to English. It is a "Product of China" as are most goji berries I have seen. My concern at a time when there is so much bad publicity related to food products coming out of China is that this product may be "organic" in name only and not in fact.

review/summary: I love these baking cups
review/text: It may seem like a lot of muffin cups to buy at once, but these are absolutely the best ones to use.  Not only are they one small step in saving the environment, but they work better than regular ones.  Muffins come out so much more easily.  I like the look of the little brown boxes.  Some of mine will be used for small gifts for family and friends.  I live in a remote area now and don't have access to stores that carry specialty items like these so I have to buy in quantity from the internet.  I was so happy to find them available at Amazon.

review/summary: quality and economical cups, great for portion/ fat content control
review/text: These are the sturdiest cake papers I have come across in a long time, yet they aren't so hard that you can't pull them off easily. Having a nice neutral color is refreshing as adults, but when I want to decorate them, they go with anything I want!! My only regret is that the size is the TOP of the cup, not the bottom, they fit in the standard 12-cup pans wonderfully. (I was looking for the larger ones.) These are so economical and you don't have to grease which is nice for calorie/fat counting. Also, the product stays fresher and you have great portion control.

review/text: This is a great deal and a superior product.  They are earth friendly - made of unbleached paper with a non-toxic silicone coating.  They can even be reused 3 or 4 times before you throw them out because they are so non-stick and are so sturdy.  And you can't beat the price - over 1400 for $30 - works out to about 2 cents a piece.  I would highly recommend these to anyone!

review/summary: Perfect cups. I won't have to buy again for a long time.
review/text: First, I should note that when I'm writing this review, the price is almost $50. I paid about $30 when I bought these a few months ago. You may want to shop around. At the price I paid, I'm happy. I might not be quite as willing to pay another 20 bucks.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I've been very happy with these. I've given several boxes to my mom, who also bakes, and she's loved them, too. I still have lots left. I tend to make small batches of muffins, so if I use 6 at a time, this case is good for 240 batches.<br /><br />I've never had anything stick to these. Also, they're easy to separate into single cups when you're putting them in the pan (I've had trouble with other brands sticking together).<br /><br />I uploaded a couple quick snapshots to help provide some additional info about these. They say they're unbleached in the title. That means they're brown! These aren't for you if you need bright white cups. Also, I uploaded a photo of the side of the box showing some of the attibutes they want you to know about.

review/summary: great price if you bake a lot!
review/text: I got tired of planning to make cupcakes or muffins and not having enough (or any!) baking cups, so I decided I should try and buy in bulk. In looking for baking cups, I found out that the ones I usually used were bleached and bad for the environment. I considered buying reusable sillicon cups, but I don't trust kids to remember to bring them back! So I found these. They are unbleached and amazon.com sells them in a set of 24, so you get 60 x 24 = 1,440 for the price! I'm so relieved because I can bake without worrying that I'll run out of baking cups! Also note that they are as thin or possibly thinner than the cups you get at the store. This means that if you have a very fatty cake or muffin, grease will show up on the sides. I personally don't think this is much of a problem because it would have happened with any paper baking cup.

review/summary: The best baking cup I've met
review/text: All other baking cups I've ever used would consistently take part of the muffin when I peeled them off, no matter how carefully I peeled. In frustration I tried silicone muffin trays, which took care of the sticking problem, but left the bottom part of the muffin with a slick, unbrowned surface. These "If you Care" baking cups fairly drop off the muffin, and the muffin is left with a nicely browned surface that matches the degree of browning on the top. Two reviewers have complained that these cups are not large. They ARE large, as opposed to small cups. What they are thinking of should probably be termed a jumbo-sized cup.  It's just semantics, although the manufacturer could make it easier on folks by providing dimensions in the specifications. For the record, these cups fit muffin trays with a mean diameter of 2.5" and height of approximately 1.3".

review/text: As others have said, these are the regular size baking cups (not mini or jumbo) and they are awesome. I've never had a baking cup release without pulling part of the muffin or cupcake with it. I've used plenty of different brands with those results. These do not stick together, so they are easy to place in the muffin tins. They are not flimsy, but not too stiff as other grease-proof cups are. The neutral color is great and goes with any decor being used. These do not absorb the grease as other store-bought baking cups do; no need to double up in that situation. Can't beat the price either.

review/summary: GREAT LARGE BAKING CUPS!
review/text: If You Care Unbleached Large Baking Cups, I have been Baking with the Large Baking Cups and I think they are Great, is just like Baking with Parchment Paper which also I use all the time. I make many Muffins and they don't stick to the Cups and the Cups are easy to peel off the Muffins. I really like the fact that the Baking Cups look pretty much the same before and after they are Baked, which is always good.<br /><br />It is one of the better ones to Bake with, no problems with Inks and dyes like in some of the Colored Baking Cups, due to the strong dyes the ink can bleed into the Muffins, it has happened to me. Now I stick to the Parchment Paper as I call them "If you Care" products or just plain white Baking Cups. Besides they are gluten free and allergen free and as I understand there's no Chlorine used in the production, Good for the Environment. Thank You

review/summary: Magic Baking Cups !
review/text: I wasn't sure I wanted to place this order at first because I had to buy so many baking cups all at once.  It seemed like a huge quantity for my personal use.  But, I am so glad I did!<br />I can't eat gluten, so I do most of my baking with almond flour and/or coconut flour.  If you have ever baked with those types of flours then you know that they can be quite sticky and difficult to remove from a pan.  I figured out how to use parchment paper when baking in a loaf pan or a 9x9 pan, but I was still used to losing half of each muffin either to the muffin pan or to the muffin pan liners when I peeled them off.  After reading the reviews for this product, I figured I might as well give them a shot.<br />These liners are perfect!  My husband can't believe how they peel off without taking half of the baked goods with them!  Sometimes, they even fall off the muffins as I am dumping them out of the muffin pan!  How's that for clean!<br />I know I sound silly, but I can't say enough how much I love these muffin liners.  They are worth it!

review/text: Not only are these liners eco friendly, but the baked goods release from the liner in a way that I have never experienced before. My daughter asked me if they were reusable. I bought mine at my local supermarket, and they were cheaper than the popular brand. While I agree with the one reviewer that it would have been more helpful if they had labeled their sizes mini, regular and large (or jumbo), it does not negate the fact that these liners work better than any I have ever had. I cook gluten free, so liners are a must. I have used them on all types of muffins and cupcakes and nothing has stuck to them yet.

review/summary: Can be used for over-sized muffins
review/text: I've been using these large liners in my over-sized muffin pan and they work great.  I make nut muffins due to a gluten allergy so the batter is really heavy and thick.  I just spoon a little into the center of the cup without touching the sides of the pan, flatten the batter a little, then put another small spoonful on top and keep adding being careful not to touch sides of pan.  When they bake, the batter stays put and the liners expand a little but still hold it all together.  I don't know how they would do for cake batter but for a stiff batter, they do the trick.

review/summary: Not a good value, but tasty
review/text: The packs are really small. I thought I was saving by buying in bulk, but it was not a lot for the money.  As usually the beef jerkey tastes great.

review/summary: Delicious, BUT it contains MSG!
review/text: If you're not into a healthy lifestyle, get these - they are DELICIOUS! "You can't eat just one!"<br />It contains MSG and other "stuff." - You've been warned! It's very delicious, though...

review/summary: jerky is yummy
review/text: I can't always get to the store on my bicycle, so it is quite handy to use Amazon & order something I hanker for.  The beef jerky, high in protein & low in calories, fat & carbs, absolutely hit the spot when it arrived nice & quickly!

review/summary: Too pricy
review/text: 28.99 dollars for one pack? Are people stupid, you can buy these at the neares supermarket for less than 28.99, aybe 7 or 8 dollars, but not 28 for one pack..  I know is easy to buy online, but buying this, is just playing lazy!

review/summary: Good, healthy and protein filled snack.
review/text: I only have one major issue. Because of the texture of jerky in general it really gets stuck in your teeth and becomes a bit of a chore to eat.

review/summary: seem old, not worth it
review/text: Bought this thinking it cheap and more convenient, but i was wrong. The meat in the package seem dried and old. The price was also higher comparing to my  local samsclub.<br /><br />I like it when the meat is more tender and moist. And this doesn't deliver that. 1 star.
