review/summary: Pom loves this brand
review/text: my picky pom loves this brand.  I rotate between 3 flavors (he won't eat same flavor more than 2 days).  I love that they are grain free, organic, and small enough for his tiny mouth. He has rejected several other "natural" dry or dehydrated raw dog foods -- Orijen, Addiction (he liked this for awhile), Canidae, Stella and Chewy's, etc. No digestive problems, no stinky breath (why would I want pizza or even fishy dog breath?).  I have tried all the Acana dry foods --I order the trial size so they stay fresh -- and the price is reasonable for the quality.

review/summary: my dogs LOVE it
review/text: I just started my dogs on this food 3 days ago and they love it.<br /> No trying to add things to get them to eat, they clean their plates.<br />I have used Orijen in the past and my dogs have always enjoyed that food. It is a bit too expensive for me since I also have to buy very good quality canned for my diabetic dog.<br />My daughter decided to try this since it is made by the same company as Orijen. With all the food recall scares lately, this company has a very good reputation, uses quality ingredients, they have their OWN factory and they have had no recalls.

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: I disagree with the other reviewer.  I've tried the Stash brand lemon and ginger tea, and it is very tame in flavor.  The Twinings lemon and ginger tea, on the other hand, has a strong spicy flavor.  The ginger bite is quite pronounced, and the tea actually tastes spicy and zingy.  It's delicious, though the flavor might be too strong for some.

review/text: This is the bigger pack of these teabags than you can get in the store and is a great value. The ginger gives a bit of a bite to the lemon tea. I love it with some honey. It is very tasty hot and is even good when it cools off. The Twinnings version of this flavor of tea is definitely the best tasting one that I have found. I have this on automatic delivery and I know I will be drinking much more in the cooler weather. Nothing better than tea when it is cold out!

review/summary: This thing really works!
review/text: Like the first reviewer, I thought it wasn't working for the first two days, so much so that the "fly trap report" became a family joke.  Turns out the "lure" material had to have a little time to work itself up to smelling like--um--like something that flies would like? Goes without saying that this isn't a smell we humans would like, so don't hang it near or in your house.  We have ours in the garbage area, where it works wonderfully. It isn't a strong smell, but it is noticable if you are within, say, three feet.  And occasionally I get a whiff of it on the breeze.  I'm happy to live with that minor inconvenience for the number of flies it collects, literally hundreds in a short time.

review/summary: victor fly trap
review/text: This really works. We were overcome with the little black deer flies that bite! We put up two of these fly traps and, within a week, most of the flies had been caught or disappeared allowing us to enjoy our garden. However, after a short amount of time these traps stink. But, that is the lure that attracts the flies. So it's best not to put them too close to a sitting area. You'll be amazed at how many flies are trapped. And, it has no effect on bees or other beneficial insects.

review/summary: Instead purchase Rescue...
review/text: I tried this flytrap because my store was out of the Rescue brand (Sterling NFT-D Disposable Fly Control TrapWith Attractant).  This Victor has not caught one fly in four days, while my existing Rescue trap has and is catching 50+ flies per day.  Yes the Rescue does smell bad - you have to put it 10+ feet from your porch, but it works!  I place one in the trees approx. 20' away on 'each' side of the house.  I recommend buying the Rescue flytrap - Amazon search "rescue fly trap".

review/summary: Works Great! (See failure note)
review/text: Purchased this trap after ordering and using their smaller version first.  This trap works extremely well.  Up for 4 days and almost half full.  It does have a very potent smelling bait that you definitely do not want right near your area your sitting.  We have our trap hung about 20 ft. from the porch and we don't have any flies where we sit anymore.<br />The trap is easy to set up...  all you do is lift the lid,  add water to line and re-adjust lid to expose trap's holes and hang.<br />The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the shrick-wrap holding the trap had split and the item was delivered on a very humid day and by the time I opened the package you could easily smell the bait....  not pleasent...<br />but we got it outside fast and set it up and now the flies are loving it!!<br /><br />>>>>>>>> one month later  >>>>>>>>>>>>><br /><br />we have since used 4 traps and have had our first failure!  Went out today to se that the "bag" had separated and fallen off the top.  The bag had been about half full and we have had twice as many flies trapped in previous uses.  I will keep shoppers informed as we think the traps are good but if your going to have a failure 25% of the time is it worth it....  going to order more will keep everyone updated.......

I have to throw it out as there is no room for flys to go into the bag.<br /><br />My only recommendation is if you have a lot of flys go for the quart(M380) or gallon(M383) product that is reusable and can be re-baited.

review/summary: Best Fly Killer Around
review/text: The best product for easily catching and killing outdoor flies in summer. Using it will also cut down on future flies. I see some one- and two-star reviews and the only explanation for the product not working is that the instructions were not read and followed. I have to buy it through Amazon because my local stores can't keep these in stock. Add warm water to the plastic bag, and give a little light shake to mix the powder solution into the water, then hang up outside.  You will be shocked at the number of flies it catches and kills.  Also, in my yard, because so many flies were exterminated it cut down on the future fly population that would have resulted from reproduction. The product does stink, and that's what attracts the flies so don't hang it near the BBG grill.  The hanging catcher also is easily disposed of - be sure to snap down the yellow plastic top into the holes and the bag will be sealed for throwing into the garbage. Also be sure to replace with a new fly magnet at some point because there will be too many dead flies in the liquid for the scent to still be attracting new flies. Most importantly, Read All The Instructions. Buy the fly magnet, and take back your backyard.

review/text: I don't know if this product is going to rid my yard of flies but I put out two traps yesterday and they have caught 100's of flies aready.  I plan on going to get a couple more today and spread them out in the yard.  People say that this product smells but I haven't been able to smell it at all.  The bait when you first put it in the contianer doesnt smell too great but once you add the water that smell goes away.  Maybe it starts to smell if you leave the dead flies in there too long?  Anyway, it really does work and it is fun to watch.  I wish someone would post a video on YouTube!  I just might have to do it myself.

The smell is so repulsive I couldn't be in the same outside space with it (and believe me, I've made it through skunked dog, everything).  Now I can't work in the garage and just run to the car to get the heck out of there as fast as I can. I haven't noticed any flies getting anywhere near it. The only reason I still have it is that I can't imagine how to dispose of it.  I mean, it wouldn't be fair to my garbage man, would it?

review/text: Bought this can of spotted dick from a local European shop. I don't know if this is authentic or how it compares to something in a restaurant in Europe, but as a canned sponge cake, it was surprisingly moist and fluffy. It's very easy to make and it definitely has a better cake texture than Twinkies or other packaged snack cakes. Unfortunately, despite the picture showing the custard icing on the cake, the can does not contain any custard, so you would need to buy that separately. So if you like raisin cakes, this is definitely a good one to try.

review/text: These seaweed snacks were an impulse item, and I'm so glad we tried them.  There are 12 individually sealed packages in the box, and each package has about 20 super-thin seaweed snacks.  They're almost thin enough to read through, and the whole container only has 2 carbs, making them perfect for low-carb dieters.  They're surprisingly filling, and not overly salty.  They are extremely crispy and the entire package should be eaten soon after opening.  Humidity will make them gummy in just a short time.<br /><br />The nutrition information from Annie Chun's website says that each package of this sesame flavor has: 60 calories, 2 grams protein, 140 mg sodium, 5 grams of fat, 70% of daily vitamin A, 12% of daily vitamin C, and minerals (unnamed on the ingredients list).<br /><br />I like that these are all-natural and don't contain preservatives or food coloring.  I like that it's a novel way to eat vegetables, and that my kids love them. Next we'll try the wasabi flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint about this product is that they use canola oil in them.  Canola oil is in so many foods we eat, and the process used to make it (hexane - a petroleum product, and high heat) causes it to produce free radicals in our body.  Free radicals are linked to obesity, heart disease and degenerative diseases in our bodies.  I would much prefer that all foods be made with cold-pressed oils like olive, peanut or sunflower oil.<br /><br />But canola oil aside, these seaweed snacks are delicious, filling, low carb, and we'll be buying them again.

review/summary: Great Snack!
review/text: I have tried the Trader Joe's Seaweed snack, and now this one and I can't really taste a difference.  I like them both and will continue to use the Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks because you can get a pack of 12 vs a pack of 6 of the Trader Joe's Brand. I've just ordered the other flavor from Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, Wasabi?  Hope it's just as good as the others :-)

review/summary: Yummy snack!!
review/text: Our family LOVES these!  They are thin, crispy with just enough salt!  Delicious!  Annie Chun does an excellent job!  The Korean seaweed makes a thinner, crunchier snack than the Japanese Nori, which is good for sushi.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these.  We go through them like potato chips.  Once you open the package, remember that the air WILL make the strips less crunchy, so when you open them EAT THEM while they have that crispness to them.  Really good!

review/summary: Try them!
review/text: I tried these because of a friend's recommendation.  I was weary.  One bite was all it took for me to get hooked.  These are a far more nutritious salty snack than potato chips are.  Sure the taste is different, but I usually grab potato chips when I want something salty, not potato-y.  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Weird at first but good
review/text: Completely different from anything I've ever had before. My first impression of these seaweed snacks was "salted cellophane," but then I gave it a moment, tried another, and another.<br /><br />They're very mild in taste. Like paper thin greens kissed with salt, that start out crunchy and completely soften in your mouth. I tried a single pack bought elsewhere and liked it enough to come back here for the case. They're tasty, but messy. If they were a a little narrower, you could more easily fit a whole one in your mouth and eat neatly. And they tend to disintegrate and stick to your teeth so I wouldn't eat these at work, but at home with dinner, or as a snack, sure, no problem.<br /><br />Snackable vegetables, seriously. While they're not particularly filling, they're kind of fun to eat and are supposed to be pretty good for you. High in vit. A and 30 calories for half a package. (20 calories fat of the 30, from the oil)<br /><br />I ate these 3-4 sheets at a time and stored the open package in the fridge. They stayed crunchy until I finished the package, which took me about 3 days.

review/summary: Go-to snack
review/text: I ordered some of these Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks after watching a friend much on roasted seaweed.  After searching on amazon, I chose these and two flavors from Sea's Gift.  I chose the Roasted Sesame flavor over the other flavors because the ingredients are simpler.  Each package has small (but not tiny) rectangles of seaweed lined up on a tray.  I fold the pieces in half and stuff them in my mouth.  I find that if I bite the seaweed, I get more "crumbs."  Either way, I still wind up with pieces of seaweed on my shirt and have to check myself in the mirror after eating (also pieces get stuck in my teeth like spinach, so I have learned to check that, too). I like the texture of this seaweed-paper thin, light, and crisp.  I like the flavor-mild.  I prefer this brand to Sea's Gift because of the milder flavor.  They seem fresh.  I did not detect any off-tastes or rancidity.  I appreciate the high vitamin content and the low calories.  I reach for these when I want something crunchy.  I eat them as a snack in between meals to keep me from eating crackers. I also eat them along side a meal instead of crackers.

review/text: My 7 year old daughter's favorite snack is seaweed, and we have a hard time finding it here in Tennessee.  We tried Annie Chun's Sesame Seaweed on a whim and it's been a favorite ever since. The seasoning isn't too strong but adds a great flavor.  I like that the packs are generous in size --- plenty to share --- while being only 60 calories each.  My kids enjoy a pack every day.  We have subscribe and save for extra savings.

review/summary: Addicting
review/text: I usually buy the wasabi flavor, but decided to try this flavor out.  I actually didn't like them the first time I tried them, but the 2nd package I enjoyed a lot more.  It's a bit salty and not as much sesame as I would like, but still pretty good.  I enjoy the texture.  This is thin and crispy seaweed/nori so there is a "fishy" taste if you think nori tastes fishy.  I enjoy it and can sit and eat a whole package on my own.  It's very low cal and satisfies my craving for a salty snack.  The sodium also isn't bad either 140mg for a 2 servings and they are full of vitamins.  Overall, I'm satisfied but will probably go back to wasabi flavor.

review/summary: Where is the sesame oil?
review/text: I have eaten and tasted a lot of seaweed products. This was good, but I could not taste sesame in the product at all. Was very disappointed. Ann Chun makes a sticky rice bowl. I rolled a small amount of sticky rice into the seaweed sheets, it was good. I also tried cream cheese and a sour cream mix, it made for a very good snack. Seaweed is healthy for you, but not for everyones taste. Next time I make Undon noodles, will add the seaweed snacks to the bowl.

I found these at a local "dented box" store and tried them to see if they were just as good.  In my opinion, these are even better than Trader Joes!  They are a bit salty, but that is part of what I love about them.  I am so happy to have found a salty snack that I can feel good about eating, rather than guilty.  Even my three year old devours them!  So happy to have found them here for less than half of what I paid locally!

review/text: This very tasty but so salty.  10 thin sheets of seaweed = 70mg of sodium :(.  But I like that fact it has 35% of Vitamin A, and 6% of Vitamin C.  The package said that the seaweed was roasted with sesame oil but the ingredients listed as follow: seaweed, canola oil, sesame oil, and salt.  Well, canola oil is healthy as well.  I'll do more comparison w/ other roasted seaweed products to see if they are as tasty but lower in sodium.

review/text: My wife and I love these and we had these on subscription, but they just got to be too expensive. Then we found similar snacks at one of the local Asian Grocery stores. They had products from several manufacturers, so we tried a bunch. They ALL basically tasted the same, so we now just buy the ones that are on sale. They are under $4.00 for 8 pack and 10 pack units (depending on the brand). THIS IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE PRICE OF THESE ON AMAZON. Since we eat these all the time, this is much more economical for us. My wife hates the "fresh" taste of fish, but she loves these, so I am surprised that people found them too "fishy".

review/summary: Delicious, and no wheat!
review/text: This product has a few simple ingredients and delivers great flavor without the MSG you often find in other seasoned seaweed products. It's also free of soy sauce, which usually contains wheat, so it suits my gluten free diet.  I drink soy milk and take a supplement with soy isoflavones which tend to bind iodine, so the super boost of iodine in the seaweed is a great benefit for me.<br /><br />The seaweed sheets are crisp and we eat them like potato chips or sometimes we wrap them around warm rice. Make sure you have a napkin. The healthy oils on this seaweed can be a little messy on the hands.<br /><br />My kids love this stuff. - They were introduced to seaweed at a young age. I have to fight them for my share.

review/text: I ordered these because I thought they'd be a great snack when kayaking. A lot of bulky packaging. I had no idea what to expect. These are oily to the touch, bland and salty. (Yes, I know seaweed is salty) but the flavor was just oily salt. I'm not a potato chip person, so maybe if you're a chip-person, these may appeal to you a bit more. I had to use a lot of hand sanitizer to degrease my hands afterwards. (Don't carry napkins in yak) I'll be eating them elsewhere with some chipolte powder.<br /><br />Interestingly, no fiber in these, so it wasn't filling at all. Kinda pointless. Not a lot of calories, but not enough nutritional bang.<br /><br />And a warning - plan on brushing your teeth afterwards - had pieces stuck in my teeth the rest of the day.

review/summary: I really like these; they've inspired me to make my own
review/text: I'd been curious about seaweed snacks for quite some time.  After trying a pack of Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, I have to say I am a fan.  The snacks are perfect as just that -- a snack.  They have 60 calories per container so you don't have to feel bad about eating one or two containers.<br /><br />The seaweed is thin but has a crispy component.  There is a bit of salt but I wouldn't say that these are anywhere near as salty as a Lay's potato chip.  Initially, the smell of the seaweed seemed very strong.  I don't eat fish but that was all I could think of when eating the first few pieces.  After a while, I didn't notice the scent so much.<br /><br />There are two things that I don't like about this product.  The first is the amount of packaging.  The second is the use of canola oil.  To deal with both, I've started to make my own snacks.  I use nori and apply coconut oil or sesame oil and salt and place it in the oven for a bit.  For those that think these are too salty, the make your own method allows you to control the amount of oil and salt.<br /><br />Made in Korea.<br /><br />If interested in trying a single package of Annie Chun's and your grocery store does not carry the product, try iherb.com. If interested in iherb, you can use code LEK375 for a discount.

The combination of toasted sesame and salt infused into miniature nori-type sheets make this crunchy, slightly salty, sweet, and better than potato chips. Delicious and suprisingly low sodium.

review/summary: Insanely yummy snack!
review/text: Just picked this up at Lassens Health Food Store and LOVE it! I gave my doggies a sample and they loved it too! Highly recommend. I dont think it's too salty as some other reviewers said, but I do like my food very flavorful. I really would be surprised by anyone not liking this. Plus, if It's good enough for model, Alessandra Ambrosia, then it's good enough for me (although not sure which seaweed snack she eats)!

review/summary: Salty, Nutritious Snack for the family
review/text: My kids, elementary and preschool aged, devour each package. They taste like extra thin, salty potato chips.  I absolutely hate the taste of fish and most seafood except shrimp and seaweed used for vegetarian sushi.  This snack does not remind me of fish at all.  I have not noticed any type of offensive smells and I am normally disgusted and lose my appetite around fishy smells.<br /><br />The best part is that these snacks are actually nutritious.  I like that we're getting a 1/3 of Vit A daily needs from them. It's really not that much salt (3% of DV) vs. a lot of processed foods that have much more salt per serving.

review/text: I'm a huge fan of seasoned seaweed snacks, which I understand isn't for everyone.<br /><br />This is a bit different from the standard packs I get from the Asian markets, which tend to be seasoned with soy sauce but still great.  It's a more delicate flavor in contrast but great for snacks.<br /><br />[[August 28, 2011]] You can't beat the deal with S&S + Annie product discount.

review/text: These taste very much like the Trader Joe's and Sea's Gift brands.  The only difference is they are saltier.  Not sickening so but definitely noticeable.  I still like them but if given the choice, I would pick the less saltier brands only because I've gotten used to less sodium in my diet.  But to their credit, they are still tasty.

review/summary: Amazingly good!
review/text: I'd never tried flavored, roasted seaweed snacks before (however, do love seaweed and make our own sushi) but ordered both the Sesame and Wasabi due to low price and good reviews. Loved them! Love the Wasabi due to the Wasabi flavor/spiciness. The spiciness definitely adds up as you are eating them and will clear your sinuses after awhile but I think it's great! Love the Sesame due to the saltier flavor. I acknowledge I may be odd for that but I've always been a salt fan and these are so much better than chips! Only one of my co-workers was a fan but my BF loves them as well as one of his co-workers. Just ordered another case of each for us and his co-worker.

review/summary: The Perfect Snack for us
review/text: I have to admit, before I opened up the Seaweed Snacks, I was expecting a thicker snack because of the picture on the box. When I saw the actual product...I thought...* Wow!...They are sooo thin!.. *Will they have flavor?..*Would they be filling?...  *Will we munch half the boxes up in one sitting trying to feel like we ate something?, and *Did I waste my money?*... Our answer: Definitely NOT wasted money! To our suprise, yesterday, my husband and I shared one .35 oz. pkg, which, with a drink, and found that not only was our serving of the "wafers" filling enough to take our hunger away until dinner, but was also very tasty!...(Actually, it was so tasty that today, I ate a whole pkg myself!... They're sooo addicting!!!). The seaweed flavor is strong enough for its taste to come through, but yet, subtle enough to not overwhelm the tastebuds...Yummy!!<br /><br /> My husband and I liked the snack so much, I told two of our neighbors about them and let them try some. They also liked them alot, so I gave them each a pkg. to take with them. We even broke the snack into little pieces and let my neighbors' 6 mos. baby suck on them until soft, (when put in the mouth, the hard *wafer* texture  almost immediately  dissolves into the texture of cooked spinach). Once softened she ate about 3 wafers right down!  (If you do let your young child try it..I would strongly recommend an adult breaking, holding, and feeding the small wafer pieces on his/her fingers for the child.) My neighbor said to her husband, *She, (the baby), loves them, too...We have to buy some!*<br /><br />I'm  glad I've found this snack, as being Seaweed, it has soo many more nutritional benefits,(necessary vitamins and minerals, and being low in fat), that I believe it is a great alternative to many of the other snacks that are being sold. It does, however, have a little more salt on it than I would like...(health wise).  It would be nice if they came out with a low,(or at least a lower salt), seaweed snack package...but even if they dont..I will continue to buy these due to their delicious flavor!<br /><br />Anyway, to summarize it all we decided that  [[ASIN:B003NUYBV8 Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, Roasted Sesame, 0.35-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)] will be the Perfect Snack for us and would definitely recommend them!<br /><br />  Sarah

review/summary: Good, but not something I'll buy again
review/text: I've pretty much loved most of the Annie Chun line so I figured that I'd give the seaweed snacks a try. I figured that they would make for a nutritious & low calorie snack.<br /><br />The Good: The treats are very filling & while the serving size is about 10 pieces, you'll really only need a few in order to feel full. (I chalk that up to the sheer amount of nutrients there's supposed to be in seaweed.)<br /><br />The Bad: This stuff is so salty that you'll really only want to eat a few of these at a time. There's a little hint of a fishy flavor, but it's not strong enough to put me off of eating them.<br /><br />Overall these are decent enough to where I'll finish the rest of the bag, but I'm not thrilled enough with this to where I see myself buying more. This is sort of a "you like it or you don't" type of snack. I purchased the wasabi flavor as well, so perhaps I'll have better luck with those instead.

This prouduct was the antithesis of TJ's product. I cannot recommend this product in spite of it's excellent price...

So not. These taste awful. They tasted like fish and not in a good way. I think this must be what the bottom of a river tastes like. I had several of my co-workers try them in case it was just my taste. They all told me they tasted terrible and were surprised that I had bought them. One girl even spit her bite out into a tissue. I do not recommend these.

Not because i never have an opinion, its just that i've never fully been moved to take time out of my day to give my two cents about something that someone is just going to read, ignore and go find out their own opinion anyway. But this seaweed snack that everyone is raving about is by far, bar none the nastiest bucket of yuck i have ever tasted in my entire life! it tastes like fermented ocean A**. Again i feel compelled to tell you the truth about this sea-garbage because every other review here is obviously someone who works for trader joe's and just trying to pitch the new product that they cant move off their shelves because there are no return customers. this seaweed snack has completely ruined my day and if it weren't for this beer in my hand to rid my tongue and nose of these rotting aromatics id probably take my own life just so that it would end. thank you for your time, and never buy this s***.

review/text: I first read about this product in First Magazine for Women. I knew roasted seaweed was very good for you, but these things are awful. First of all, they are very pricey; $1.19 per package. I picked them up at Whole Foods, because if I hated them, I would not be stuck with 14 bags. Anway, these things are just large seaweed sheets cut up in bit size and so spicy, you can't eat them. I expected them in a chunky chip, because the magazine touted them as a very filling snack. You could never get filled up with these thin things and the spice and salt are just too much. If you want something like this, just cut up the large sushi sheet seaweed and season; much cheaper.

review/summary: A good all-around tea.
review/text: Earl Grey is the quintessential flavoured black tea.  Twinings makes a good inexpensive version of this type.  This brand was my introduction to earl grey and was my first love when it comes to tea.  It has a good tea base without too much bitter or robustness to carry off a delicate, though discernable bergamot flavor. It's classy enough to serve at afternoon tea but not so fancy that you couldn't drink it every day.
