review/summary: Does this dogfood make your dog pass gas a lot?
review/text: I have a chocolate lab who is allergic to chicken so, we are trying this dogfood instead of his usual fish/potato Blue Basics.  He seems to be fine with the dog food since he is not itching and has not had any ear infections.  But, he has horrible odd smelling breath and he is very gassy.  I am wondering if there is just something in the ingredients that he doesn't tolerate.  Has anyone else experienced this with their dogs on this dogfood?

review/summary: Lexi loves it
review/text: I have an extremely finicky eater with skin and stomach issues. So I've spent a buck or two in the past 3 years trying to find a food she would eat, while not contributing to her itchy skin and delicate stomach. I purchased a bag of Innova Red Meat from Petsmart in hopes of it being the one. She was previously on Royal Canin Hypoallergenic HP, but they discontinued their large bag and the price went up on the 16lb bag. The price is not so far from what I'm use to paying for her food, the big thing for me is she eats it... no waste and that saves me money.<br /><br />After she finishes this bag I'll update my review (fingers crossed).

review/summary: Healthy and great tasting
review/text: Bragg's Liquid Aminos are a great soy sauce alternative for the health conscious. No msg, not high in sodium. Great tasting. I use it for a meat marinade, and it's fantastic. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are great for low-carb dieters or anyone who has weight issues but still wants tasty food.<br /><br />Two of the bottles leaked in shipping, messing up the labels, so if you are purchasing for resale keep this in mind. I contacted Amazon and the customer service was fantastic, as always, but new product could not be shipped out to replace the damaged ones, so a refund was immediately credited, and they allowed me to keep the product. Amazon's customer service could teach a thing or two to the rest of the retailers in the country....I've always been pleased and will never hesitate to order anything I am looking to buy...I search Amazon before Wal-Mart....no crowds and better service and good prices. I'm a happy camper.

review/summary: Glutamic Acid is completely natural and harmless
review/text: Just wanted to respond to the person below who was warning people about the dangers of "excitotoxins". Glutamic acid, one of the product's ingredients, is a completely naturally occuring amino acid that everyone's body makes in the course of metabolism. Yes, you probably do not want to drink a gallon of it in one day, but that counts for pretty much everything. Please don't pay any attention to that reviewer, the product is great, especially for people who don't tolerate ingredients in traditional soy sauce (like gluten).

review/summary: Omit a lot of sodium and add 16 aminos with Braggs
review/text: My bottle of Kikoman soy sauce lists no MSG in the ingredients so that's good but there is 920 mg of sodium in a tablespoon.  Compare that to 320 mg of sodium in a tablespoon of Braggs Aminos and that is quite an improvement.  Plus the Braggs Aminos is made of purer ingredients and provides sixteen amino acids.  Tastes just as good as soy sauce too so it's a no-brainer to go with the Braggs.  When I ordered I did not realize the bottles had pump spray tops on them.  It's great - makes adding to steamed veggies or whatever very easy.  You can unscrew the top to pour also.

review/text: If you like soy sauce/tamari, chances are you'll also like Bragg's Liquid Aminos. I love this company and although I'm not convinced that this product is so healthy (it's LOWER sodium, but still has quite a bit) I trust the Bragg name. This is really good in fried rice. I haven't had it with meat but it's wonderful with deep-fried tofu or baked seitan.

review/text: I just got my Bragg's in the mail yesterday. I had just finished dinner and had some broccoli left when UPS brought my Amazon package to my door. I couldn't wait to try the Bragg's so I opened up the package right away. I was prepared for some leakage or breakage because of some of the other reviews, but there was none. Everything arrived in great condition. I sprayed some on a piece of left over broccoli and I am now a big fan! It's definately a tasty alternative to sodium ladden soy sauce. YUM! Can't wait to cook dinner tonight.

review/summary: If you like the taste of artificial sweetner it is ok.
review/text: I have to admit based on most of the reviews I was sold on getting the 48 pack.  Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,"It wasn't bad." Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.<br />If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar. If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.  Try Cafe Escapes and Swiss Miss and see for yourself.

review/text: This is the best Hot Cocoa product I have found for the Keurig K-cup Brewer. The others I have tried do not have the test or alot of the product remains in the cup.

review/summary: highly recommended hot chocolate
review/text: They have some really good hot chocolate. I got a single pack before and it was so good that I reordered some more. I like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee (use a big cup).<br /><br />One thing to note: these dont have a strainer inside, the entire contents are meant to be used (unlike the coffee Kcups) so it will feel empty once done. I would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings. Use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come out.<br /><br />Also, kids may not like the peppermint flavor.... But that is my favorite one. If you don't want to get the variety pack, they sell the individual flavors too.

review/text: I have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find Grove Square to be about the best of them all.  I usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers, my favorite being the Sugar Free Caramel Macchiato.  By adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories.

review/summary: Still Looking
review/text: When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  I'm still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on.

review/text: After trying several brands of Hot Cocoa my kids have decided that this is the one for them.  I'm certainly happy about it because not only is it delicious, but it's also more affordable.  3 boys can consume a box of hot cocoa very quickly, even with limits set.  It's also very convenient to have it shipped automatically.  If we don't drink that much I simply skip a month.  If friends come over and we drink a lot, I just order an extra box.  It's quick, simple and delicious.

review/summary: Found the secret
review/text: To everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these k-cups, here's the trick.  Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad.

review/text: I saw these on sale so I nabbed them.  For anything larger than a 6oz cup, the results will be too weak.  I end up brewing one with 6oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it.<br /><br />The peppermint was the flavor I was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that I loved the most.  I'm on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k-cups in the future.  It might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my Keurig.

review/text: I was hesitant to try this cocoa after all the horrible reviews about how it tasted so bad, and had a really bad Sucralose flavor. I don't know if I'm just not as picky as others or what it is, but I thought this hot cocoa was really good. Creamy and rich, and almost TOO sweet. I don't think it has an "aftertaste" though, how some have described. I used the middle water setting on my Keurig or "small mug"...7.25 oz., I guess. Everyone has their own tastes and preferences, but as for me, I really like this product!

review/summary: best k-cup hot chocolate
review/text: This is hands down the best tasting k-cup hot chocolate available.  The Cafe Escapes or whatever the brand name is tastes very watered down and artificial, while this one tastes thicker and milkier.  I love the dark chocolate flavor, although if I didn't know it wasn't dark I probably couldn't have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa.  I will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option.  These are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool.  Everyone always wants hot chocolate!<br /><br />Something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about 6 oz per k-cup.  I use 2 k-cups per mug and the flavor is much better than when I try one (too watery).

Use only on the small cup setting in the Keurig. 4 stars.

review/summary: Ugh so not what I was expecting >.&lt;
review/text: So if you are a person who likes swiss miss / hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station SO DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!  I can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever.  It just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that.  This product has a strong fake sugar taste and I am perfectly OK with diet sodas and other fake sugar products.  There is something about this I just can not put a finger on it but it made my stomach curl.  I even waited for it to cool down, but it got worse.  Very disapointed in this product and it was not what I was expecting at all.

review/summary: The Best hot Cocoa in a K-Cup
review/text: I've had many hot cocoa K-Cups and I must say this one is the best by far. The Green Mountain one has a half & half bitter aftertaste while the grove square is very pleasant and is as close as you can get without actually using milk.

review/summary: Very good hot chocolate.
review/text: I really like this hot chocolate mix.  I was concerned, when I read some of the reviews, that I would not like it but I like it alot.  To me it has just the right amount of chocolate and is not to sweet.  I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Oh please... get an envelope and some hot water
review/text: All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior.

review/text: The hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size. I find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa.  The best bang for the buck I have so far found for hot cocoa.  I tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee.

review/summary: SWEET
review/text: My oh my is this cocoa sweet. Too sweet I'd say. You're better off making hot cocoa from scratch. I bought this because I thought the minty flavor would be good, but it's too sweet. So are the dark and milk chocolate flavors.

review/summary: Hot Cocoa K-cups
review/text: I was a little skeptical when I bought this, but it has really been a great purchase.  The cocoa is DELICIOUS!  It's so easy to just make my daughter and I some cocoa quickly before sitting down to watch a movie.  I didn't have to add anything to it, but I did add a tiny bit of milk just to cool it down.  I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again.

review/summary: Sugar AND Sucralose
review/text: I didn't read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it 60 calories and 11 grams of carbohydrate in each cup. I tried one with a bit of cream and found it to be very tasty. I'll keep it around for friends and family or perhaps an occasional mini-splurge. I'd like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future.

review/text: Not bad at all when I use CoffeeMate CHOCOLATE creamer.<br />I still like swiss mix made with 2% milk a little better.<br />But as far K-Cups go, this milk chocolate with the Coffeemate Chocolate Creamer is not bad.<br />And currently, it is less than $11.00 for 24 cups.

review/text: This is a great hot cocoa as long as you read the box and only use the 8oz setting on your coffee make. Otherwise it will taste watered down. Also it is an instant coffee so dont be surprised by it.

review/summary: Too watery after multiple settings.
review/text: A hot chocolate packet was the first K-Cup on my new Keurig (it was 1 a.m. and I wasn't ready for coffee before bed). I had read they ran a little watery but I decided to try it on the 10 oz. setting, took a sip, and tossed it. The next morning I made one with 8 oz. and added some whipped cream. The taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery. My husband made one to try at 6 oz. and said it tasted like sugar water. I might try combining 2-3 6 oz. servings to use the box up but we won't be buying more.
