review/summary: Nice Italian-style espresso drink in a can with 50 calories
review/text: Having visited Europe many times, one of the things I miss is good espressos. I have a couple of coffee machines at home but I'm always too lazy to make cold espressos! This "illy issimo" espresso-in-a-can tastes good to me. It's not too strong yet has enough espresso bitterness to make it flavorful. Each can has 50 calories, including 1g of fiber and 10g of sugar. The drink is made in Denmark and tastes high-quality. I really liked the one sample can I received from the Amazon Vine program, so I'm going to order more! I do wish it were cheaper since each can is small!

review/summary: Adult pick-me-up
review/text: Fifty calories of pretty darn smooth espresso (style) drinking. No cream, no milk, no crazy flavors. This is for those that really like coffee. Ingredients simply: coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, potassium, citrate. If you're an adult espresso fan looking for a pick-me-up without the fat (0 grams vs 6g (3.5 saturated)) in a Starbucks doubleshot espresso and without the fad ingrediants of kiddie energy drinks then this is a great choice.

review/summary: Good, but a bit strong for me!
review/text: I had never tried this type of product before and got it because I was curious after reading the reviews.  I am not an Expresso drinker and I think I was in for a bit of a shock with the taste.  It had a 'pop' to it, but I found it to be bitter for my tastebuds.  I tried it room temperature and chilled, but neither one really appealed to me.  I would not say it was distasteful by any means, and for the person who enjoys this type of drink, it most probably would be quite good.  I did not experience an unpleasant aftertaste, but I did experience a lingering one.  For me, a person who enjoys a mild cup of coffee with raw brown sugar and cream, no :)

review/summary: Great pick-me-up on a hot afternoon!
review/text: This is a great espresso with just a hint of sweetness.  If you are an espresso drinker this is for you.  If you like lattes, cappucinos, and such, look elsewhere, this has no milk or flavorings, it's just pure, smooth espresso.<br /><br />My preference for anything other than my morning coffee from my Keurig is hot in the winter and ice cold in the summer.  Today's temperature touched 100 so ice cold was the order of the day.  I have a special fast chill compartment in my refrigerator that cools items quickly to 34 degrees and after 4 hours in there I put the can in the freezer for 5 minutes.  It was icy cold the way I like it.  THe espresso is strong and bold without bitterness.  I liked the slight hint of sweetness as I find many coffee drinks to be too sweet for my taste but the Illy Issimo was spot on.  Compared to a Starbucks Double Shot the Illy has a better, more well-rounded flavor.<br /><br />Ok, I raved about the product so why only 4 stars?  The price!  In this age of Starbucks, etc., we are getting used to paying astronomical prices for coffee.  Folks, this is good espresso and convenient in the can but it is still coffee.  I guess we like to pay for convenience.  I could make Illy espresso in my Gaggia Baby for pennies a shot but sticking a can in the fridge is more convenient.  Bottom line, it's still coffee, a very nice espresso, but still coffee.

review/summary: Better Than Starbucks Doubleshot
review/text: Illy Issimo Coffee drink in a can was a pleasant surprise. I love coffee but prior to trying this beverage was less than impressed by the chillded coffee-in-a-can that was available. Starbucks Doubleshots and similar drinks by Seattle's Best and Others had been what I had tried. Those were all too weak and had a bit of a funny aftertaste. Illy managed to make a smooth, strong, good tasting chilled coffee with no funny aftertaste.<br /><br />This drink is basically a quick, good-tasting coffee that's ready to go. You must like coffee to like this drink; it's not one of those creamy, foo-foo drinks that are popular but are basically full of fat and void of coffee. It's not as good as fresh made espresso, but when I'm in a hurry and want some good tasting caffeine quick I now have a new go-to drink. Sorry Doubleshot.

review/summary: Worthy entry into the crowded Energy Drink market.
review/text: I tried this illy issimo Caff&egrave; Italian Espresso Style coffee drink for a quick energy lift after lunch. The drink is made in Denmark (not Italy) and distributed by the Coca-Cola Co.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>The AL can chilled quickly (1.5 hrs) in the fridge OR pour in a glass and heat it up in the microwave.<br />>Richer taste of Arabica coffee than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> without the fat and cholesterol (from lowfat milk).<br />>Per 6.8oz. can: 10g sugar, 0mg cholesterol & fat, and only 50 calories.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>Each 6.8oz. can contains: 155mg caffeine and 20mg sodium.  Not bad but for those who are very sensitive to caffeine, even 155mg could cause an extra hour or two of insomnia (happened to me, drank it around 2PM, stayed up until 2AM).<br />>Easy to exceed the maximum daily intake of 500mg caffeine (as recommended by physicians) with just three to four cans.<br />>Competitively priced at $2.01 per 6.8oz can (12-pack) but costs can add up quickly for heavy coffee drinkers.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Tasty drink for an occasional energy boost but not recommended for people sensitive to or trying to minimize caffeine intake.  Give it a try, some may enjoy the flavor and couldn't care less about the 155mg caffeine; make your own informed decision!

review/summary: Decent flavor but nothing I'm going to go out and buy
review/text: I drink my coffee black and normally make it myself.  But if I want iced coffee, a lot of times it is faster just to buy something canned or in a bottle.  However, I have yet to really fall in love with any of the available products.<br /><br />illy issimo's Caffe flavored coffee drink has a nice, bold flavor.  There's a touch more sweetness than I like, but it's less than most premade drinks.  I do wish I'd decanted it.  Every once in awhile I would get a strong chemical taste, but I think that was due to the can rather than the coffee itself.  One can contains double the caffeine of a Red Bull, but I didn't feel much effect after finishing.  I felt less tired than usual, but there was no jolt of energy.<br /><br />I enjoyed trying this product and feel that it's better than many of its competitors, but I don't think I'm going to go out and buy any.  The periodic aftertaste really bothered me after awhile.

review/summary: Surprisingly light and refreshing
review/text: For some reason, I had it in my head that this was iced coffee similar to a iced cafe mocha than a Coke that lost its carbonation. I really don't know where I got that idea because the description is clear "Coffee Drink, Caffe".<br /><br />Still, it was a surprise when I poured it into a small cup with ice that it was dark like (you guessed it) coffee.<br /><br />But instead of being disappointed at my unfounded assumption, I went ahead and took a sip and whoa, it was good.<br /><br />Mind you, I'm not a coffee drinker unless one considers a bit of coffee with cream and sugar to be coffee. My expectations were low and yet, this drink was good. Light, not too sweet, but not bitter either. At 6.8 oz, it was also the right size that it wasn't too much either. It was the perfect pick-me-up post-lunch in fact.<br /><br />I probably won't have this too much but I'll try to have it now and again. At 50 calories, it is a much better option for a post-lunch treat than the iced white mocha that I get from a well known coffee chain.<br /><br />So while this drink was different from what I expected, it was a good surprise and I will definitely buy again.

review/text: It's just coffee, sugar and potassium no cream.  I was very surprised to find that this coffee tasted superior to canned coffee I have had from Taiwan and Japan.  I guess this is what the coffee craze is all about which totally passed me by.  I would rather have a can of this than an ice cream to cool off - that's how satisfying it is.  But I consider this to be such a luxury drink at two dollars a small can when I don't even patronize Starbuck$. I throw powdered coffee into a milk carton to make cold coffee for myself.  I don't know ... if it were ever offered to me free again, I'd take it without hesitation.  It is definitely delicious but I don't see myself living that lifestyle of splurging on a can of coffee.<br /><br />p.s. I totally changed my mind and am going to order this out of pocket.  Amazon currently has a coupon for it but I was placing it in my shopping cart anyway.  It's yummy and I want more.

review/summary: Wonderful for making Iced Coffee Drinks!
review/text: The pain in the butt that is ice cold coffee that retains the depth of flavor when iced is a constant problem. Especially if, like me, you don't want to make a giant pitcher of iced coffee, just one every-so-often.<br /><br />This was made much easier for me when trying out Illy issimo Coffee Drink. The can was small enough that after I chilled it, opened and poured over ice, there was enough room for flavored creamer! This created a lovely, hazelnutty ice coffee drink without losing the strong, vibrant coffee flavor.<br /><br />Unlike Starbucks iced coffee drinks, I was able to go sugar free with my creamer. While I am not a black coffee drinker, the flavor of this before adding anything was pleasing and not bitter or have an aftertaste. Personal preferences just dictate creamer for me.

review/summary: Convenient, preferred over Starbucks
review/text: After trying both the Illy and Starbucks canned coffees several times I have to say that I much prefer Illy.  It's not the taste so much as the smell of the canned/bottled drink itself.  While neither packaged coffee drink smells as pleasant as fresh brewed, I prefer the plainer scent of Illy over Starbucks which always smells faintly of "gym bag" to me. (though I'm at a loss of how to explain this)<br /><br />That said: the Caffe drink is not too bitter or tinny for coffee out of a can. Though it's not difficult to get a coffee on the go, these little cans are convenient for around town or packing on picnics or trips.  I've had this straight from the can, over ice, and with a little milk added.  It's not too sweet and is a nice pick-me-up.

review/summary: Pretty tasty for canned coffee.
review/text: I generally start my days in warm weather with an iced Americano from a local coffeehouse, and that gave me an opportunity to A/B this drink against a freshly brewed glass this morning. While this canned concoction didn't have the aroma or richness of the freshly brewed drink, it was still quite pleasant. There were no aftertastes or unpleasant flavors, and the coffee flavor itself was rich and not at all bitter.I don't usually drink sweetened coffee, but this wasn't cloyingly sweet, like a soft drink; it was more like a Mideastern-style coffee, where the sugar served to balance off the bitterness of the coffee. At $2/can I'd rather spend a buck more and have a freshly brewed espresso, but this is certainly better than some of the espresso I've had in airports and restaurants.  I think this would be a fine drink to keep in the fridge at home or to carry on car trips or picnic outings.

review/text: My workplace doesn't have a coffee maker, and I need my coffee sometimes, so canned coffee has become a staple.<br /><br />This is probably the best iteration of canned coffee I've ever found.  I love whatever they are doing to make the liquid a little thicker.  It's subtle, but it makes a big difference.  I think the quantity is just right, and it produces a nice energy kick.  It's not sugary and it's not full of carbs.<br /><br />I don't personally prefer this flavor (like another flavor of this product better), but it's a nice, strong, bold espresso flavor.  I found it enjoyable, and if that's your favorite flavor, you will be delighted with this.  This if for someone who just wants a good strong coffee as opposed to something that tastes like a frappe with whipped cream and sugar.<br /><br />I think the price for twelve of these is a little steep, so I'll drop a single star, but it is a high quality beverage.

This product isn't terrible, but it's not really good either. It had a strong coffee flavor, a little stronger than I like, but there was also a weird aftertaste. I'd have to describe it was sour and bitter, but it wasn't the kind of sour/bitter aftertaste you get sometimes with "bargain" coffee brands; it had a unique bad aftertase all its own. I did like the jolt of energy that it had, but I could get the same amount of energy from tastier drinks. It seems like a lot of people like it, so I don't want to put it down entirely, but for me personally, it wasn't something that I enjoyed.

review/summary: Nice coffee flavor
review/text: I enjoyed the illy issimo Coffee Drink.  While it is not equal to a freshly made iced coffee, it had a nice, rich coffee flavor and did not taste like the can.  For a quick iced coffee drink, it is worth the price, but it is a rather small serving and you will find it gone rather quickly.  I would prefer to have it in a larger container.<br /><br />I do recommend this product.

review/summary: Strong espresso flavor with a hint of milk
review/text: Strong espresso taste with a hint of mil, but a tiny bit bitter for me, yet not as much as the cappuccino flavor. If you like a little bitterness, then you'll prolly love this. Thankfully no can taste, which was a concern of mine. I prefer a bit more milk in mine (soy or rice).<br /><br />Otherwise not much to say - plain, no flavors, although I'm sure you could add your own if you want i, but taste fine just like it is.<br /><br />The bitterness was just a hint, which many regular espresso drinkers probably wouldn't notice - for me, it was enough to take off a star, but was still good. Don't know that I'll be buying a lot of it, but for that allergy or headache, when I use that caffeine, it would be great to have around to get rid of those.

review/summary: Less sweeter than the Cappuccino drink from illy issimo
review/text: I prefer coffee with only a teaspoon of sugar and hot milk in the morning instead of the highly sweetened foufou drinks. Illy issimo makes a Cappuccino in a can that is too sweet for my taste. This Caffe drink suits me better. The Cappuccino drink I had to tweak with hot frothed milk. This Caffe was good straight from the can, but is a nice morning cup if warmed with the hot frothed milk.

However, I like the idea of something I can keep in my fridge and throw into my purse when I hit the road.<br /><br />I must say, from first taste, this was delicious.  The flavor is smooth and there was no discernible aftertaste.  The caffeine kick was good and it kept me going this morning at work.  The pricing is less than my usual coffee drinks and I can definitely see making this my summer go-to coffee!<br /><br />This one is a winner!  I'll be keeping my fridge stocked.<br /><br />BTW - The can says "do not shake".  I have no idea what happens when you shake, though.  :-)  I'll leave it to one of you to experiment with that!

review/summary: A bitter sip to swallow...
review/text: I love coffee and I love espresso, but I've found that I prefer my `shot of espresso' to be accompanied (or to `accompany') something else.  Alone, left unfiltered, the strength of the espresso can be overwhelming.  For me, this illy issimo caffe drink is a tad too concentrated for my taste.  It has a very strong flavor, which many have praised saying that it is very close to the flavor of an espresso, but for me there is a bitter aftertaste that I can't ignore.  The colder you drink this, the stronger the aftertaste and so I found that letting it get closer to room temperature (slightly cooler, but not much) helped make this a more satisfying `sip'.  Still, I'm not as fond of this particular flavor.  I definitely liked the cappuccino flavor more.

review/summary: Exactly what I wanted
review/text: Let me first start by saying: I don't drink hot coffee unless forced. I like coffee but I don't like hot drinks. I go for iced, or cold, or cold drinks like this product. I tried both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>and far prefer this product.<br /><br />The taste is bold, smooth, and doesn't have the gritty texture that some canned coffees can bring with them. The taste is good, the feeling is good, and the aftertaste is just like the coffee, not a strange variation of it.<br /><br />I had a little issue with the cappuccino version becuase it had a bit of an emulsified oily feel on the tongue, but this one is good to go.  And at only 50 calories, I would always choose this option. The can is very small and would easily fit in a pocket, purse or bag if you wanted to take it to work or on a trip with you.<br /><br />Enjoyed and recommended.

review/text: I've tried both the illy issimo Caffe and the illy issimo cappuccino.  I gave the cappuccino 5 stars because it tastes like a creamy iced cappuccino made with espresso from a machine.<br /><br />The caffe is also good and also tastes legitimately like it's a not-strong espresso.  However, I didn't find it to be the same quality as the Cappuccino.  It's ok.  It tastes like an ok iced/sweetened espresso/caffe from an average coffee place.  I surely would drink it - it's just not a 5 star product.  Good.  Not great.<br /><br />Note: this drink does not have any kind of cream/milk in it.  It's a black/sweetened coffee.

review/text: I have liked other illy issimo products, but not this one.  It's too bitter!  I didn't taste any sweetness.  In fact, to me, it tasted like 2 day old coffee mixed with tap water.  The first taste was not so bad - it was ok'ish, but the bitterness and feeling that it was just old stale coffee kept getting stronger and stronger.  It's nothing like the real thing over ice, even though I drank it well chilled.  I don't think I could have drank it at all any other way.  I'm giving it 2 stars though because it was a very effective pick up - the caffeine content gets a star by itself.

review/text: Nice flavor- I would have preferred it slightly sweeter, but as some other reviewers have said it's too sweet, that's clearly a personal preference.<br /><br />While the convenience is great, for the price, I'd rather get an iced coffee (with actual ice!) from the local coffee place. The serving size is fairly small (basically the same size as half a can of soda- not much at all if you like coffee), as well. But the portability is pretty great- it'd be good for grabbing on a hurry or if you're headed out to a picnic or some sort of day out somewhere and need to bring coffee with you.

review/summary: Good quick iced coffee with a mild jolt
review/text: This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans</a> is a good and quick iced coffee alternative for those of us who need the convenience from time to time, or for those of us who can sometimes feel a bit too lazy to make our own iced coffee. I really do like a good cup of coffee, but even with a 12-cup drip coffee maker, there's never enough to make iced coffee as much as I might like. I'm also one who as a rule drinks coffee black, with no sweeteners, cream or creamy substitutes.<br /><br />I've said 'iced coffee' as the minute I received it from Amazon, I noticed that it said "DO NOT SHAKE" imprinted four times around the rim of the 6.8-ounce can, so into the refrigerator it went for a couple of days.  Opened the can carefully, still wondering what the "DO NOT SHAKE" warning was all about, but it wasn't carbonated, so it was slowly poured into an 8-ounce glass.  At first taste, more of a coffee aficionado's tasting sip, it seemed a bit thin.  On second taste it got better, and a decent iced coffee taste emerged, slightly sweet, but with no objectionable artificial sweetener aftertaste.<br /><br />Reading on this, my illy issimo Caff&egrave; said on the can that it's a product of Denmark.  illycaff&egrave; SpA is based in Milan, Italy. Coca-Cola distributes it, so is this true international globalism in coffees? I don't know where the can is made.<br /><br />The product description here says that it's "sweetened with beet sugar" so that might account for this.  Beet sugar is more closely related to cane sugar, though there's only 10g sugar content, so I'm not too concerned with this light "touch of sweetness" cranking up a few pounds on the obesity index and I don't plan on drinking a six pack of this on a daily basis. Just glad to see that high-fructose corn syrup wasn't used as a sweetener.  Each can has 50 calories, according to the label, and digging here, the description states that there are 155 mg of caffeine. This puts this 6.8-ounce can just behind Starbuck's Grande (16 oz) iced coffee, which has about 165 mg of caffeine, and that's fine with me.<br /><br />Received this along with an order for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans</a>, which also had that "DO NOT SHAKE" admonition on its rim,  but that's a separate taste issue into itself.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Doing the math, each 6.8 fluid ounce can here breaks down to just over two bucks per serving. If you were making your own coffee at home, a standard cup (8 fluid ounces) of even a premium grade of your favorite coffee would come in far cheaper, so this is no great bargain.  On the other hand, though I wouldn't call this "Caff&egrave;" an espresso, it subjectively does have a good taste, and it's far better than some of the caffeinated beverages that I've tried.  So breaking this down, here's my highly subjective rating:<br /><br />3-stars: simple 'bang-for-the-buck' value compared to regular home brewed coffee<br />5-stars: good taste and good caffeine content<br /><br />That being said, I'll average this as a solid 4-star product when it comes to caffeinated enjoyment.  Your taste may differ.<br /><br />But one of these days I'm going to ignore that "DO NOT SHAKE" warning and just try it to see what happens...<br /><br />6/4/2012

review/text: I found the illy issimo Caffe Espresso flavored coffee drink to be drinkable but it is not a drink I plan to consume on any sort of a regular basis.<br /><br />While the drink does have an espresso-like taste, it is too bitter and watery to be worth over $2 for a 6.8 oz can. Further, its espresso flavor is just acceptable, nothing special. In addition to my considering this product to be  just an average, at best, drink, I found it gave me such a strong caffeine jolt that for over an hour after finishing it I had a bit of a pressure headache.

review/summary: Tastes Like Cold Coffee
review/text: If I made my usual morning coffee in my coffee maker (I like it a little on the strong side), added a bit of sweetener and then put it in the refrigerator to cool down for about 24 hours, I would have this drink.  Pretty much exactly this drink.  The first thing I thought of when I took my initial swallow was that it tasted just like cold coffee.  The sweetness was just about where I like it - not too sweet, but not bitter either.  I can see where buying these small, 6.8 fluid oz. cans would be much easier and more convenient than making your own cold, black coffee if you tend to like it cold and take it with you in a hurry.  I'd down about 3 of these every morning if I could afford them.<br /><br />It tastes fine, really does.  I prefer cream with my coffee but I still thought this tasted pretty good - again, just like cold, black, slightly sweetened coffee. I found it smooth and easy to drink. I like ice-coffee and usually make it later in the day from the morning's left-over sitting in the pot. It has 155 mg of caffeine per can so I would assume it could be used as an energy booster for that lag time during the day around 2:00 - 4:00 pm.  The reason for 3 stars is though it tastes just like cold coffee, there is really nothing to distinguish it as something unusually wonderful and unique.<br /><br />And though I did not see it until after I had done it, at the very top of the can it says, "Do not shake".  Why, I don't know.  I shook it good and hard before opening. I guess they just want to keep bubbles from forming but I don't think the shaking altered the taste or texture whatsoever.

review/summary: For the Coffee Lover, a Great Alternative to Other "Energy Drinks"
review/text: This product describes itself as 100% Natural Arabic.  This is pretty much what it is -- coffee and a some sugar.  I assume that most people will be buying this for a "hit" of caffeine, so I'll compare it to some popular alternatives.<br /><br />Healthy?: Let's face it, most of the other "energy drinks" and caffeinated sodas on the market are chemicals and water. Some of them throw in a couple of vitamins to give the impression that they are healthy drinks, but most are not. Compared to those, this seems much healthier.  It is similar to drinking a brewed cup of coffee.  Is plain coffee healthy?  Probably more so than other "energy" options.<br /><br />Calories: This drink has 50 calories.  The same amount of cola would have about twice as many calories. and Red Bull would have about 80.  Obviously, the artificially sweetened alternatives to this would have very few.  So other than the artificially sweetened drinks, the calories in this are fairly low.<br /><br />Caffiene: It contains 155 mg of caffeine.  A similar amount of cola has about 20 mg.  This amount of "Red Bull" has about 66mg.  A cup of brewed coffee might have 100-200mg.  For its size, this has a pretty good caffeine punch to it.  I could definitely feel the caffeine "kick in" a little while after drinking this.<br /><br />Taste: I found the taste very enjoyable.  It tastes somewhat like moderatly sweetened, slightly diluted, black coffee.  If you like coffee, you should enjoy this as well.  However, if you like your coffee heavily sweetened and/or with lots of cream, this may taste  a little rough.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this product, can recommend it,  and will be buying more.

I chilled the can for several days before drinking and got a pretty good energy burst from the drink. With that being said I would like to mention that I'm only an occassional coffee drinker. I'll have a coffee or frappucino from Starbucks a few times a month so more frequent coffee drinker might not get the same energy boost I did.  Overall all I recommend this drink for coffee lovers who like to mix thiings up every once in a while.

review/text: I buy illy coffee and espresso grounds on a fairly regular basis, as it is one of my favorite brands of coffee, so I was excited to try their issimo Coffee Drink, Caffe. The first thing to hit me was the sweetness, which was a little unexpected, since I don't normally drink coffee quite that sweet, but it wasn't too overpowering. The overall flavor was actually fairly robust, but missing that fresh-roasted bite, and had a somewhat unpleasant artificial/manufactured aftertaste (perhaps from being housed in a can?).<br /><br />I did, however, get a big energy perk from the coffee, which allowed me to focus and bolstered me through my morning work.<br /><br />Overall, I think I'll stick with fresh ground illy, as there is no beating fresh espresso in the morning. But, if I'm ever in a pinch and need a quick pick-me-up, I might consider grabbing a can as a quick substitute.

review/text: I really liked the illy Cappuccino coffee drink I previously tried, so I thought I would enjoy this caffe' Italian Espresso style coffee drink as well. While this is less calories (50 per can) and has a really bold flavor, it is a bit too strong for my liking. Now if you are a regular espresso drinker, you will most likely enjoy this very much. I tend to go for my drinks on the sweeter side. I also felt this drink was a bit on the "watery" side. I would have liked it to bit creamier, but obviously that would mean more calories. I also believe espresso tends to be stronger in general. So lesson here: I should have known better because I am not a HUGE fan of espresso. Now that being said, it still was good enough that I would enjoy it occasionally as a mid-day pick me up drink because it certainly helped get me through a mid-day slump! It wasn't all that bad, just not something I, myself would drink everyday.

This is Caffe version, which they say is "Italian espresso style coffee drink."  In actuality, it's a simple drink with 4 ingredients:  coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate (latter two as preservative, probably--although the can says it has no preservatives).  If you count the water and milk (as the can warns that it "may contain traces of milk"), 6 ingredients.  The can notes that it has 155mg of caffeine per can--roughly double that of Red Bull.  Only have 50 calories per can--which is a plus, and impressive given that it has no artificial sweetner.<br /><br />How it is:  Strong without being acidic, with a hint of sugar.  It's pretty smooth, but does have a noticeable bitter signature.  I could not chug this thing.  Note:  the can says "do not shake."  I'm not sure if you should drink it as is, though; wouldn't coffee need to be mixed?  Anyway, if you plan on shaking it, let it sit for a while after doing so; it squirts coffee all over the place when I tried to open it right after shaking.  Lesson learned.  The kick from the caffeine is very much noticeable.  Definitely a good thing to have for a quick pick-me-up.<br /><br />In conclusion:  You don't have to drink Red Bull for caffeine.  And you don't have to pick up a Starbucks Doubleshot (choke full of sugar and cream) as an alternative, either.  I think it's a nice product.<br /><br />Caveat:  Groceries will sell these for much cheaper.

review/summary: Blech
review/text: I like coffee.  I do.  Particularly iced.  Now full disclaimer here: my norm is a cold brewed coffee so I am used to a very different coffee,  but I also partake in the the weekly  coffeehouse drink or rare canned drink like the type I am reviewing here.  When I saw on its page that it was claiming to be "bold" and an "espresso-style coffee drink with a touch of sweetness" at only 45 calories?  Well sign me up!  I figured worse case scenario well I'd dump it into a cup o' milk.  How wrong I was.  It was just bitter and nasty and wrong.  I never did figure out if it was the coffee itself or that "touch of sweetness"  but something in this tiny little can was not right and no amount of milk made it right.  I finally gave up, dumping it out, wasting a perfectly good cup o' milk.<br /><br />Shame, I had high hopes for it.

review/summary: At least it's not as bad as Diet Pepsi.
review/text: A few weeks ago, I tried the illy issimo Cappuccino coffee drink, and didn't care for it. Part of it's probably because I rarely drink coffee, but I wasn't too thrilled about drinking what looked like brown water in a can. The Caffe flavor here doesn't fare any better, and I literally spit it out upon taking the first sip.<br /><br />Normally I'd go into the pros and cons about the product, like I do with my other reviews, but I can't think of anything to say other than I didn't like it. The flavor was an insult to my taste buds, it's still a gross-looking clear brown color, and while it might not be that bad for you as far as nutrition goes, you can still do better.<br /><br />I'm going to leave this one to coffee regulars who are used to this kind of taste.

review/summary: The illy issimo Caff&egrave; Tastes Good if You Like Black Coffee
review/text: I'm sleep deprived because I work two jobs and, therefore, drinking coffee is a matter of survival for me.  I drink iced coffee during the hot summer months.  I jumped at the opportunity to sample the illy issimo Caff&egrave;, which is Coca-Cola's attempt to make a profit from America's sudden craving for iced coffee.  Everyone from McDonald's to IHop is selling it.  Normally, I make my own iced coffee at Panera Bread.<br /><br />  The illy issimo Caff&egrave; looks and tastes like black, bitter coffee, which I detest.  See the photographs that I have posted showing how dark it is compared to other leading espresso coffee brands such as Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso & Cream (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005W48BQE">Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso & Cream 6.5 oz x 8 Cans</a>) and Rockstar Roasted Coffee + Energy Mocha [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GLRJ2K">(Pack of 24) Rockstar Roasted Espresso Energy Drink 8 oz ea</a>].  Overall the illy issimo Caff&egrave; has less calories and fat per serving.  I posted photos depicting its nutritional value and ingredients.  However, the Starbucks tastes the best; naturally it has more fat and sugar.  On the other hand, the Rockstar gave me more energy, but it has a strange, sweet taste; the Rockstar is loaded with vitamins and minerals.  All three brands of coffee drinks are high in caffeine.<br /><br />  Starbucks doesn't have to worry about competition from Coca-Cola.  Starbucks exceptional taste, in lieu of nutritional benefits, will lure customers.  Most consumers drink iced coffee for its taste rather than its nutrition.  Furthermore, I don't understand why illy issimo Caff&egrave; has "Do Not Shake" on their cans.  No one else does.  I posted a photograph of a Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino Coffee Drink [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink Mocha, 9.5 Ounce Bottles-(pack of 12)</a>]; notice the ingredients that have settled at the bottom of the glass bottle.  I always shake my cans and bottles of coffee; the coffee may look frothy when I pour it but it has never spewed like carbonated sodas.<br /><br />  Illy issimo Caff&egrave; is only recommended for those who like their coffee black with a touch of sugar.  I believe it would be less expensive to make one's own coffee, refrigerate it until cool and then pour it over ice.  Rather than throw it away, I've brought home leftover coffee from my Sunday school class and put it in my refrigerator.  Later, when I ate dinner, I'd pour the coffee into a tall glass full of ice.  I'd add Stevia (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00430EJR8">Sweetleaf Sweetener 70 Packets</a>) and milk until my sweet tooth was satisfied.  Speaking of Stevia, which is an all-natural sweetener with zero calories, I had to pour Stevia into my glass of illy issimo Caff&egrave; before I could finish drinking it.  I ran out of milk or I would have added some of that also.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/summary: Faux Coffee, Real Heartburn
review/text: This was a really unsatisfactory beverage in taste and aftereffects. I'm not a huge fan of coffee in a can or jar, having partaken of two widely nationally available brands and found them lacking for a coffee fanatic such as myself (consuming an average of 4-6 cups a day). I was hoping that the Italians (via Denmark, where this product is made) would get it right. Sadly, the Illy Espresso company has failed abysmally with this product. The weird thing was that it tasted fine for the first sip: a nice, bracing bittersweet espresso flavor. The second sip, it seemed a little tinny. Then it was salty. But I was committed to finishing this drink to the full, 6.8 fluid ounce end. The bitter end. Because while I got a faint coffee buzz, I also got major heartburn and a stomachache within a half hour of consumption. I'm guessing as an amateur chemist that adding baking soda (potassium bicarbonate, 20 mg sodium per serving in the drink) with an alkaline Ph interacts negatively with coffee's more acid Ph.  Well, I've popped an antacid, and I will say that this product has convinced me that there are no shortcuts in life. If you want decent coffee, make it yourself. This product contains 156 mg of caffeine per serving. If that's what you're looking for, there are other options that won't feel like you drank battery acid.

review/summary: Approved by an old school coffee snob
review/text: I am a coffee freak; I probably need to find a support group.  Coffee is one of my pleasures that I fully embrace and I have no problem admitting it.  However, I am a standard coffee guy.  I don't like the coffee drinks that aren't really coffee, those mixtures that have tons of cream, flavor, sugar, syrup, whip cream, flavor shots and one drop of coffee.  I am a standard coffee drink with a touch of cream and sugar.  Oh and it should be noted I love my coffee HOT.  I am not really a fan of iced coffee.<br /><br />This brings us to this canned coffee beverage that is served cool.  I will confess, I have had a couple of ice coffee drinks that didn't taste bad, if mixed properly and having the right balance of cream and sugar.  Yet this isn't my preferred method of consumption.  Notwithstanding, I decided to give this can of espresso a chance.  After I chilled it over night I gave it a taste.  I must confess the flavor is very nice and smooth.  There is no cream in this beverage, just a hint of sweetness.  I found this to promote a nice balance.  I could tell by the taste a high end blend of coffee was use to make this product.<br /><br />Overall, I am still a guy who will always grab his hot coffee before an ice coffee.  Yet this little can really has a good flavor.  Perhaps it is the fact that the star of this drink is the coffee itself.  There are no flavors or syrups that distract from the coffee, which makes this drink very enjoyable.  In addition, the drink isn't all that big, under 7oz and at 50 calories this beverage is better for the waist than some of the fluffy faux coffee beverages out there.  So coming from a real coffee drinker, I would recommend this drink if I decided that I wanted to venture towards a cooler cup of coffee.

review/summary: Drink isn't bad, but the Caff&egrave; flavor isn't to my taste
review/text: I like coffee, and although I don't really drink it every day, sometimes I just really crave the flavor. I might tackle that craving with a regular cup of coffee, some coffee flavored ice cream or a cold coffee drink.<br /><br />I occasionally like a latte or espresso drink, but usually have them hot. I was interested in the illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave; flavor when I saw it and decided I had to try it.<br /><br />While I like a nice hot espresso, I have to say I don't much care for this drink. It definitely does remind me of a cold espresso, but apparently I don't much like my espresso cold.<br /><br />I don't think this is a fault of the way the drink is made - more likely it just doesn't suit my taste. I should mention that I have also tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and liked it better than this Caff&egrave; flavor.<br /><br />While I don't necessarily care for it, I think it may appeal to others. If you like strong coffee drinks that aren't sweet and think the flavor sounds good to you, I'd recommend giving it a try. If you prefer a milder coffee drink that is sweeter, you will find the cappuccino flavor more to your liking.

I drink coffee every day and have never added these two chemicals to my cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have read that potassium citrate is used as a diuretic, particularly in veterinary treatments.  Was it really necessary to add these two chemicals to the "Espresso Style" coffee mix?  If it had been nothing but plain black coffee of typical good illy quality, then it would have rated a 5.  I will not be buying it.

The illy issimo caff&eacute; Italian espresso style coffee drink met my expectations.  I divided my 6.8 fl oz can into 3 portions, so that I could try it in different ways.  I had it in a mug after warming it in the microwave and then warmed with some milk, as well as in a glass over ice.  Since it is a little sweet, I preferred it with milk or over ice.  However, it's not bad alone, and would probably be good chilled straight out of the can.  It is made primarily with natural Arabica beans and sugar, with 50 calories and 12g carb per serving.  It also has 20 mg of sodium and 155 mg of caffeine.  I like it!

review/text: The "illy issimo caffe" Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink is delicious and remarkably non-acidic. I drank a swallow of the caffe at room temperature and could taste the espresso flavor without the bitter aftertaste. After heating it, the dark thick texture and rich aroma were very pleasing. The caffe is sweetened with 10g of sugar per 6.8 FL OZ can, so no additional sweetener is needed. If you have a sensitive stomach, you will like the low acidity maintained by the potassium bicarbonate additive. It is very smooth to swallow and does not irritate the stomach like many espresso products. Low acidity often comes with a reduction in caffeine, but each can of this caffe has 155 mg of the stimulant (about the same as regular brewed coffee with a shot of espresso).  I am definitely going to order a case of the caffe through Amazon at the reasonable price point (a little less than $2 per can).

This illy fits that bill!  The Starbucks doubleshot has a touch of cream in it--my husband explained to me that it needs that bit of cream in order to give it a smooth flavor.  The illy doesn't need it.  It's so smooth without the cream that it's better than a doubleshot.  And for a 12 pack, it's $13 cheaper for 12 ($36 vs. $23).  That sounds a lot better to me!

review/text: I love strong coffee and I love iced coffee so this little can is a whopping good time.  I grabbed this on my way out to work one morning and the only complaint I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger can.  However, the strong taste is probably best in moderation.  It tasted freshly brewed and hit the spot. It also gave me that much needed caffeine boost on my way.  Hope they develop some more flavors in the future.

review/summary: Pleasant, smooth, and drinkable
review/text: I found this cold coffee beverage to be pleasant. It has a full-bodied coffee aroma, and a nice smooth coffee flavor. There are fifty calories worth of sweetener in it, meaning it is a sweetened coffee, but only mildly so. I enjoyed it over ice. As it comes in the can, it is a straight sweetened coffee beverage with no cream. It is enjoyable as it is, though I enjoyed it most with a bit of milk added and over ice. It contains 155 mg of caffeine (a can of Mountain Dew contains 54 mg and Red Bull contains 80 mg, by comparison), so it could serve as an "energy drink." It's not fresh-brewed coffee, but if you have a taste for chilled coffee beverages and are turned off by the overly sweetened varieties that are usually available cold, this one may be worth a try. It is expensive, though, and it seems overpriced for what you get. Though the flavor is good, I think I will settle for a cheaper alternative. It doesn't live up to a good cold-press coffee in my estimation.

review/summary: Smoother than Starbucks Double Shot and nice as an Ice-blended too!
review/text: I was very pleasantly surprised by the Issimo Caff&egrave; canned drink.  at 6.8 ounces it's about the right size to drink right out of the can or to split in half to make Ice-blendeds.  I tried it both ways and found the cofee taste to be strong enough for my taste but free of any bitter aftertaste or metal "can tatse" that I sometimes get with Starbucks.  With 10 grams of sugar, it is a little sweet right out of the can but I'm OK with that.  I liked it better mixed with some nonfat milk and unsweetened dark chocolate powder dissolved into hot water and made into a reasdy-made syrup I keep in the fridge.  It whipped up nicely and at a much lower calorie and sugar oad than a Frappuccino.<br /><br />I've been looking for a new canned coffee item to keep in the office and at home for some time since Amazon stopped carrying the Cinnabon Lattes in cans.  This has about the same amount of suagr but 20 or so fewer calories so I'm pleased.  I can see myself skipping trips to Starbucks and/or Coffee bean & tea leaf and saving myself a signficant amount of money!  Hey, I like that!  Give it try.  It's pretty much straight brewed espresso with some usual preservatives and of course the sugar.  No added oils or thickeners or colrings like the Crushed bettles in the strawberry Frappucinos from Starbucks - so what you see is what you get.  What you get is a nice, smooth cold Espresso that you can pound down instead of a nasty red Bull or sip slowly and enjoy the taste. Issimo makes canned Cappuccinos as well.

review/text: I don't drink a lot of coffee mostly because I find it so difficult to find the blend of blackness and cream and sugar. Temperature is also a difficult think to master (it always seems too hot or too cold!) However, this coffee blend is a masterful mix of my favorite sweetness, creaminess, and blackness. It's rich, but not too rich. It's sweet, but not too sweet. And no bitter aftertaste!  I refrigerated it and thought it tasted great cold.<br /><br />With that being said, I would never spent $2 on a little tiny 6.8 can of it. But if coffee is important to you, this is a great-tasting product. And a great--albeit unhealthy--way to boost your energy!

review/summary: Illy Issimo Coffee Drinks
review/text: I received both the Caffe and Cappuccino versions and did a side-by-side taste comparison to see which of the two I might prefer over the other.<br /><br />First I tried the Caffe version and was surprised to discover it was just black coffee. I prefer cream in my coffee, so I was hesitant to taste it as it was. But I tasted it and found it to have a nice medium coffee strength with a bit of sweetness to it. In my everyday coffee I don't add sugar, but on occasion it's nice to have a special coffee drink, and since it's been hot here lately, I had poured it over ice as well. I added cream and found it to be quite enjoyable. It's one of those conveniences that one could easily become addicted to.<br /><br />Next I tried the Cappuccino which had a similar taste and flavor as the Caffe, but was milder. I prefer my coffee stronger, so my preference was for the Caffe and still I would have liked it stronger (perhaps this is offered in another version). But the Cappuccino was also good and I had poured it over ice as well. I was concerned about both coffees being packaged in cans as I don't like my drinks to have a metallic tinge to them, but I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I had, however, poured the drinks over ice into a glass, so that may have helped. Regardless, it was really nice to have sitting out on my deck on a warm day. Hot coffee just does not sit well with me in hot weather.<br /><br />All-in-all, if you're looking for a mild, sweet coffee drink that's quick and easy to take with you on the go or to pour into a glass at home, this is a good choice. It's small and convenient to slip into a purse or briefcase. While the coffee is mild, it still gives a quick pick-me-up in the morning, or in the middle of the day if need be.

review/text: I have tried the cappuccino version of this drink (which is great), and was excited to try this drink, following the instructions I did not shake.  I opened the drink and took a sip, the coffee is strong and has a full body, and has a good taste (for canned coffee), however (I am not sure if this is from transport, or what), the coffee is very watered down and I feel like I am tasting mostly a watered down coffee (like iced coffee where the ice has melted).  The watered down taste of the coffee sticks with you, so be prepared to need something to clean your palate afterwards.<br /><br />I do not know if the one I got went through some sort of shock or excess moisture phase during shipping to fridge, but I found it to taste watered down (not sure if it was just mine or all), the coffee is very strong and has a bold taste, but due to the watering down it takes a way from the flavor and makes it tough to drink.

Upon its arrival I stuck the can in the fridge for a couple days for it to chill.  I took it out, opened it and poured into a glass.  It has a rich coffee flavor without any bitterness reported by the other reviewers and it wasn't sweet to me.  The can states not to shake, and I think the wording means > No Need to Shake.<br />I think the secret to this little caffe on the go is to make sure its good and cold.

It has a sweetened coffee-like taste that isn't bad--but that's not the point.<br /><br />It's called espresso, but it really isn't.  There are none of the aromatics that make the experience of espresso what it is.  At home, I'll take the time to grind the beans and brew a real cup.

review/summary: Strong coffee in easy to drink little can
review/text: Four individual coffee lovers from different cultural backgrounds conducted a sampling of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> side by side with this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and we had an exact split on the selection of a favorite between both samples.  Of note is that the Caffe single serving can is a couple ounces smaller and half the calories.  My personal preference was the Caffe because I found it to taste fresher, less like a canned beverage, less sweet, and stronger in the coffee flavor.<br /><br />I gave away my Nespresso machine and currently do not have an electric espresso maker other than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5F0">Delonghi EMK6 Alicia Electric Moka Espresso Coffee Maker</a> and prefer very strong coffee.  I still make it on the stovetop or prepare French drip coffee.  I sometimes use Splenda and froth steamed milk.  I used to roast green coffee beans but have also given away my roasters.  I grind beans prior to preparing coffee.  Just a little history for my frame of reference in writing this review.<br /><br />I liked the Caffe much better than the Cappucino.  Because I seldom use sugar, my first taste was of a very sweet, strong coffee, but when I continued drinking, it appeared to be less sweet.  According to my computations, this contains over a tablespoon of sugar, way more sweetener than I'd add to any beverage.  Nevertheless, the coffee flavor was very good and I will try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I2FGQE">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave; (No Sugar), 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.  The information provided says these beverages contain no preservatives, but each has potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate listed as ingredients.  I don't know about the usual life expectancy of the illy beverages, but my can expires in less than two months from now.<br /><br />Our natural instinct is to shake a non-carbonated beverage, but there are strict instructions stating that the can is not to be shaken.  The can is nice to look at, smaller than a soda can and may cause problems in a beverage holder if you take these on a road trip.  Since I prefer to have my beet sugar come from the whole beet, I would pass on this beverage, but would recommend it to a person who likes a strong coffee in a cute can that chills well, has an easy to lift aluminum tab, and is probably very nice over ice.  It's better than an average canned coffee beverage.

Drink comes is a small 6.8 oz can that is easy to pack and carry.  I drank my coffee cold.  One cannot go wrong with drinking it on room temperature either.  Can does not require shaking; drink contains 50 calories  and no fat.  This drink is stronger than cappucino and a little bit bitter.  There is disticnt flavor and strenght in each drink.  I liked both, but my preference in the morning is coffee with some milk in it.  For that reason, I would recommend Caffe as afternon "pick me up" type of drink.<br /><br />This product is made in Italy and it is distributed in USA by Coca-Cola company.  This fine Arabica bean coffee will give you Italian espresso experience.  There is nothing better than an old world coffee drink (in my opinion).

I didn't think it was overly sweet, and when cold, it tasted okay for a canned coffee.  However, if given the choice between making my own iced coffee and putting it into a travel cup, or grabbing one of Illy Issimo canned coffee, I would opt for the travel mug iced coffee.  Two main reasons - 1) one less can to go into the trash (or recycling, if lucky) and 2) homemade iced coffee tastes a LOT better.  In fact, here is a recipe that's easy AND stores well:  [...]<br /><br />That aside, Illy Issimo isn't too bad.

review/summary: Thoughts from an experienced illy drinker
review/text: A little background:  I own a Gaggia for illy espresso machine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00416L8OQ">Gaggia for Illy Espresso Machine</a> that works with illy single-serve pods <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRE5D8">illy iperEspresso Capsules Dark Roasted Coffee, 5-Ounce, 21-Count Capsules</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRAWCQ">illy iperEspresso Capsules Medium Roasted Coffee, 5-Ounce, 21-Count Capsules</a>.  I like the flavor of illy espresso, but my favorite is still the Nespresso line of coffee <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UW1KLM">Nespresso Citz D110 Espresso Machine, Silver Chrome</a>.  When I saw that Coca-Cola was distributing illy in-a-can from Denmark, I immediately thought it might be a nice cold drink for my early morning, one-hour commute into the city.<br /><br />This morning I pulled two cans from the frig and drank them as I drove to work.  I tasted both the "caffe" and the "cappuccino" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>flavors.  Here are my thoughts:  The coffee in these cans is nothing like what you make at home in your espresso machine--the richness is missing.  illy makes a medium and a dark roast; the coffee in these cans are more like the medium roast--definitely not dark.  But, bottom line, coffee in a can tastes exactly like you feared it would:  Coffee with that "special" canned taste.<br /><br />Comparing the two flavors that I sampled this morning, I like the cappuccino better than the caffe.  I think the cappuccino works better than the caffe as a cold drink.  The caffe was not a drink to be chugged down.  It is suited to sipping as it is not a thirst-quencher.  With the first few sips, I noticed a pronounced tangy flavor that I did not care for.  By the time I got half-way through the can, I had pretty much gotten used to the tang and it didn't bother me.I did not notice any bitterness in either of the flavors.<br /><br />Be aware of the size of these cans:  They are not as large as soda pop cans.  They are narrow cans, with the cappuccino can about an inch taller than the caffe can.  I mention this because I had trouble finding a place to set them in my vehicle's console because they are so narrow.  Your vehicle's can-holder space will be too large for these cans.  You  would have to wedge them in somehow to keep them from toppling.<br /><br />So, as with most everything else that you buy for convenience-sake, with these coffee drinks you sacrifice flavor for handiness.  If you really don't have time in the evening to put together a bottle of iced coffee for your morning commute, then the cappuccino is not a bad drink.  If you like a sweet coffee and if you like milk in your coffee, then the cappuccino is not a bad choice.  Personally, even though I don't have any extra time in the evening, I think I'll try to find the time to build myself an iced coffee for the morning--because I've just realized that it is very pleasant to have cold coffee to drink for my long commute, and canned coffee is not to my taste.

review/text: I usually avoid cold coffee drinks. They are usually too oily, sweet, milky or bland.  I was most pleasantly surprised by this drink. The touch of sugar adds more smoothness than sweetness to the robust expresso bite.  It contains no fat but has 12 grams of carbs. The small, slender can is easy to transport and the pop top makes for easy opening.<br /><br />I enjoyed this product.  In addition to using it as a beverage, a little bit enhances the flavor of chocolate baked goods (think brownies) and cuts the sweetness of buttercream frosting. So skip the run to Dunkin Donuts for an iced coffe and pop open a can of illy issimo instead.

The Caffe tasted like a cold shot of expresso, with lots of sugary sweetness added to it.  I did notice a little pick me up for a couple hours before it wore off.  For the price it isn't bad, it works at keeping you awake, but I probably would just drink a cup of hot coffee instead of this next time.  If you're a cold coffee drinker, you may be more inclined to like it.

review/summary: Too sweet and rich
review/text: Well, reviews for this drink are all over the place, so I can't say my review is definitive. Anyway, this drink met with negative results, here - too sweet and rich, but, it would be best to judge for yourself or look at several reviews. For me, not being a regular coffee drinker, I prefer a cold Coca Cola or iced tea, rather than any iced coffee drink anytime. Plus, at about $2 for a can, too expensive for me - but I'm a cheapskate, so keep that in mind.

review/summary: You Have To REALLY Like Iced Esspresso To Drink This
review/text: I sampled the caffe flavor.  illy issimo comes in five flavors: caffe, caffe no sugar, cappuccino, mochaccino, and latte macchiato.<br /><br />Unless you like iced coffee to begin with, and then iced espresso to boot, you probably won't like this product.  This has no dairy type ingredients, so you will either need to drink this "black" or add something to it.  I tried it straight out of the can into a glass, chilled.  It was really strong, as in very bitter.<br /><br />I softened it a bit by adding some skim milk and sugar.  Even though this is sweetened with beet sugar, the bitterness far overpowers any hint of sweetness.  I added about 3 teaspoons of sugar, and then used about two ounces of milk mixed with this 6.8 ounce can. That made it more palatable.  I then added some crushed ice and poured some over the ice.  Better yet.<br /><br />All in all I would say this is for only hard core iced coffee drinkers.  If you lean more toward a sweet coffee with lots of sugar, this probably isn't going to be up your alley.<br /><br />But if you are an iced coffee drinker and like the bold taste of espresso, you might want to give this a whirl.

review/summary: very strong, not too sweet, and packed with energy--only 50 calories!
review/text: I personally preferred the cappuccino, but I am not exactly a "real" coffee drinker. For people who enjoy a stronger flavor, this is the drink! It has a bold flavor with minimal bitterness (considering its strength) and only a hint of milk and sugar. The size is smaller than the cappuccino drink, yet it has much more caffeine and fewer calories, so in terms of bang for your buck, this drink is an excellent way to start the day, especially during the summer. Here are some numbers relating to the content of this drink, as well as info on the Illy Cappucino 8.45-Ounce Cans, in case you wanted to compare:<br /><br />Illy Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (THIS product)<br />50 calories, 155mg caffeine, 0g fat, 10g sugars, 0g protein<br /><br />Illy Cappucino 8.45-Ounce Cans (The other one I tried and reviewed, which is milder and sweeter)<br />100 calories, 81mg caffeine, 1.5g fat, 18g sugars, 4g protein

review/summary: good, but....
review/text: You know your drip coffee maker, Mr. Coffee, over there in the corner?  Long cold, the coffee is just sitting in the carafe until you clean it out, right?  Try this: pour it over ice in a cup.  Taste.  Now you know what this coffee drink tastes like without spending the money.<br /><br />Yes, it sounds harsh, but this should have been better than it is.  Convenient, for sure, and the size is a perfect afternoon fix.  But it doesn't taste like delicious brewed coffee.  It just tastes like cold coffee.  There's a difference.  The taste isn't bad, but not great.  It's not flavored up with sugars and creams, which is a GOOD thing...some of us hate sweet coffee that has unnecessary calories.  So, were I on the run, I may pick one of these up if it were cheap, just for ice-cold convenience.  But definitely not assuming that it was something extra special.<br /><br />In fact, surprisingly, it may be helpful to know that Monster<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBWKG">Java Monster Coffee + Energy Drink, Vanilla Light, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> makes a coffee drink with protein that is really good that I've been buying (cheaper at the local store than the big A).  Sure, it's not especially delicious coffee, but with the protein, it makes a great afternoon slump kicker.

review/summary: For Fans of Cold Espresso, AKA Brand X Doubleshots
review/text: I had tried the illy issimo Cappuccino and found it to have a strong coffee flavor but with out much of an aftertaste, giving it what I assumed was it's "Italian style" coffee quote on the can.  But here with the illy issimo Caffe - the flavor is very bold and the taste sticks around.  Now for some, this is a definite plus.  I think this coffee is designed for coffee fans of bold flavors, dark roasts, French roasts, and especially espresso.  The sweetness is very light and almost vanishes before you can even realize it's there.  It gives you a nice smooth initial flavor, then the coffee comes over the top, dominating the taste.  To me this compares very nicely to Starbucks Doubleshot, except that this seems to have distinctively different coffee bean flavor that is hard to explain as different from Starbucks - but it is slightly.  As for the sweetness, here in the description as I write this - it says 45 calories.  It actually has 50 on the can.  So not for sure if this is an oversight or a recipe change.  Either way, this is definitely something for espresso fans.  If you are looking for a great pick me up during the sweltering summer, this is a nice alternative to hot coffee.  And price-wise, this may save you a few bucks over the price of Starbucks Doubleshot.

review/summary: Bitter but refreshing
review/text: I do warn all that this coffee is quite bitter tasting.  Personally, I like the bitter taste and so give this four stars.  But some might want to pour this in a glass and add some ice cubes to cut the taste  a bit.

review/text: Yes, I'm a coffee junkie.  I really liked this drink.  Smooth and just sweet enough.  It's not really that strong so unless you like really weak coffee, I dont recommend putting it over ice.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this drink is the 6.8oz can wasn't big enough.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF

review/summary: I Dislike It
review/text: Generally, I love coffee. I prefer hot coffee made from fresh ground beans and I drink it black. I've tried many of both iced coffee beverages and coffees with espresso shots from the big chain, and I've found them completely delightful, though expensive. Unfortunately, this canned, low-calorie Italian espresso style coffee drink is a no-go for me.<br /><br />I'm assuming this is to be served cool from the refrigerator, although I'm certain my reaction wouldn't be any different had I drank it at room temperature. The texture is unsatisfactorily grainy. The flavor is unpleasantly off, either from beans that aren't bold enough or from a mixture of ingredients that ruins the flavor of a good bean - either way, I didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />It's a 50 calorie beverage; with a low 20mg sodium and 12g in carbs, so it balances out nutritionally for a coffee drink. The beet sugar is where it gets its 4g of fiber, its 10g of sugars and likely the peculiar graininess.<br /><br />This is a convenient on-the-go option for someone who likes coffee, but I like coffee, and I do not like this.

review/summary: Thanks, But I'll Pass
review/text: I sampled this product and was not impressed. It took me several sittings to make it through this can. It's metallic, bitter and not a pleasant caffeine beverage. Although NOT a coffee connoisseur, I suspect one would better appreciate the bold bite this beverage delivers. I'm not sure if this was the only coffee available I'd choose it again. There are better tasting options available and also at better price-points.
