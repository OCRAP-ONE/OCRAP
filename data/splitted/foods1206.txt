review/summary: Tastes Just Like the Regular Suisse Mocha Coffee but Sugarfree!
review/text: I was so happy to discover that International Coffees had a sugarfree blend. We live in a fairly small community and the only mocha type coffee like this was almost 2.00 a can more. What makes it even nicer is that being an Amazon Prime member,it's shipped to my door with no s/h charges. This sugarfree coffee can be enjoyed anytime of the day and the flavor takes care of the sweet cravings with only a very few calories. If you're a diabetic or watching your calories, and who isn't, this is not only a nice way to wake up in the morning but relax in the afternoon or early evening.

review/text: I have always enjoyed mocha flavored coffee.  It's just the caffeine and calories didn't like me.  This product is fairly low calorie, decaffinated and sugar free.  But, most importantly it tastes good too!  I do find, however, that I need to use a little more product per cup to get the flavor intensity I want.  The Amazon price was fantastic even when compared to discount grocery store prices.

review/text: I was on a strict diet when I first found this little gem in the grocery store. It allowed me to have my fix of sweetness without all the calories and sugar. I ended up losing all the weight I needed and became much more healthy. However, I still have a cup a day. It has just the right amount of sweet for me. I have not tried the one that is not sugar free yet. It is becoming more difficult to find the flavors that I like in grocery stores. I visited General Foods/Maxwell website and tried their product locator. But most of the flavors I tried to search for were "discontinued" like the Vanilla Bean flavor.I like the idea of ordering on Amazon and I hope that Maxwell keeps making these products.

I've tried this through the coffee pot (using permanent gold filter) and through french press and it's absolutely wonderful. Sweet, nutty, fruity, everything it's made out to be. worth every penny. Such a wonderful cup of coffee. I usually like mine with cream and sugar and with this cup I didn't need either. Try it black with a small amount of sugar. Excellent. Someone suggested cutting this coffee with Kona. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This coffee doesn't need to be cut by anything. It stands up on its own and if your friends didn't notice any difference in the coffee they were driking you either a) made it wrong, or b) have friends with little to no taste buds.

review/summary: It's Okay ...
review/text: Purhcased this for Christmas Dinner and shared with family. No rave reviews from anyone. Usually everyone enjoys our coffee but no one, not a one, commented on this brew (which isn't a good thing). We ground the beans right before roasting, tried a few different racios and realized that you need an extra amount of coffee per cup to give it flavor. Flavor is what we're after as coffee people but, this fell short of the rave reviews on Amazon. We never told anyone at Christmas Dinner about the coffee so we would get a "clean" report. Got nothing back and that's not good. For ourselves, we didn't find anything but flatness in this. It might be good to cut this with Kona. We're going to try that out. This is far too expensive to throw out so we have to find a way to enjoy it. We have used other Blue Mountain coffees and love it.  We do NOT recommend this particular coffee.

When he woke up, I had to go back home, but I sent him a care package for when he got home. This was in there. Not only was he amazed I remembered this was his favorite, but he was amazed that it tasted as good as he remembered it! He had a heart attack a few months later and died, but I'm grateful I was able to remind him of one more good memory before he passed. I wasn't able to try it, but my mom still raves at how great it was, and how much my dad liked it.

review/summary: Jamaica Blue Mountain, the very best.
review/text: If you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation, then I highly suggest you, without haste, purchase one pound at least of whole bean JBM. Also a good grinder, a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system. Pre-ground takes much of the flavor away, compaired to properly done fresh home ground coffee, and coffee is lessened without being prepaired at the correct temperature of filtered water.<br /><br />But why something so expensive? Why jump in to the deep end of the pool before even getting your feet wet?<br /><br />Some may scoff, saying that only a true coffee fanatic would understand or be able to appreciate this blend. That is entirely true. But how can anyone really understand without first having tasted the standard by which all others must be judged?<br /><br />Thus why this review is only four out of five stars. You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful.<br /><br />It is a "perfectly" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five. Every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean.<br /><br />This should be the first coffee to ever cross the lips of anyone who wants to learn these things. How else can you truely understand the other blends?

review/text: I mean this stuff was roasted how long ago? A far lesser coffee roasted a couple of days ago is going to taste a whole lot better. At $50 per pound, what you're tasting is justification for spending the money. What you should do, if you have the money for this sort of coffee, is buy a coffee roaster and start getting good green beans (including Jamaican Blue Mountain) and roasting them fresh yourself. The folks at Sweet Maria's have all the info you need to get started.

review/text: I really got this mainly as a mixer. I tend to lean towards the more complex, dessert-y matcha flavors like Pumpkin Pie and Cheesecake, and Earl Grey seemed like it'd be the perfect compliment to a lot of my favorites. I have so many different Earl Greys in my cupboard, it seemed blasphemous not to have an EG matcha as well even if it's just for experimenting with. But of course I have to try it by itself first! Bergamot is what makes Earl Grey, well, Earl Grey, and it's nicely present here. I'm really happy with the amount of flavor used: while I do like a strong EG, I didn't want it overpowering here at all. There's that classic citrus tang, with just a hint of floral qualities that really go well with the fresh, grassy matcha. I'm not sure if bergamot is the only flavoring used here, because as the description states there's just a tiny hint of warming smoke. It reminds me of a brisk EG with a strong black base, mixed in with my matcha! Refreshing, bright, and very different from all the other ones in my cupboard.

review/summary: Duke of Earl...
review/text: This was added to the box in an continuing effort to seduce my wife to the ways of matcha. So far, the best I've gotten out of her was "That's....interesting." Ah well, more for me. London Fogs, also known as an Earl Grey with vanilla and milk, are her favorite winter drink, so that's what I had in mind when I snagged this little beauty. That and she's a sucker for anything Earl Grey. But I'm looking forward to mixing this with, you guessed it, vanilla. An Earl Grey/vanilla was my very first tea, though I'm not much of an Earl Grey fan nowadays. But still, it sounded very tasty and I had to at least try it. I'm a bit worried, after the bitterness of the lemon matcha, but I was worried about the watermelon and it turned out amazing. And we're big fans of the Earl Grey from Red Leaf Teas around here, so we have a lot of faith in this blend. Their Earl Grey Oolong is one of the teas my wife absolutely cannot do without, and their Raspberry Earl Grey was one of the few teas I've actually seen her mourn when it was discontinued. So yes, if there was ever an Earl Grey matcha to get her into matcha, it would have to be from Red Leaf Tea.<br /><br />Success! We went to the zoo on Friday and my poor wife was only running on a couple hours sleep, so I made her a matcha London Fog and she loved it. Loved it! I stole a few sips of the Earl Grey before mixing it in with everything else and it was perfect Earl Grey, and I knew that I'd made the right choice. I mixed together equal parts Earl Grey matcha and French Vanilla matcha (both from Red Leaf Tea, of course) and whisked it together in a bowl to be sure to get all the lumps out. Personally I don't care about a clump or matcha or two, but it really turns her off of her drink. Anyway, I heated up some vanilla soy milk, frothed it up, added it to the blend and it was perfect. She loved it! And it's so much better for you than the regular London Fog, full of syrup and dairy...blegh. This is one I think I'll have to keep in stock, if only for my wife's sake, which I am more than happy to do.

review/text: It is hard to find a real good gluten-free bread.  This one is great and only needs to be frozen AFTER it is opened.  So you can shelve it until then.  I also like the white bread that they make but didn't find it here on Amazon.  After it has been frozen, we can toast it or defrost it for less than a minute in the microwave before making a sandwich.  This bread is a winner for Celiacs.

The next day I was at the local grocery store and found about 50 3-packs of this gum in the sale aisle. It was also available at Target. Moral of the story, if you dont feel like waiting for amazon to ship it, just drive to your grocery store. I was also told you can't keep the gum in the plastic container in your car in the summer bc it would melt.....NOT TRUE...

review/summary: TOP FLAXSEED PRODUCT
review/text: I have been consuming flaxseed for nearly a year under doctor's orders after I developed muscle pain with a series of statins.  I also take niacin and endure the flushing.<br /><br />Researched flax recommendations on a number of medical and health sites and determined that ground flax was the way to go, providing it was properly stored.  This product pouch is a reasonable size for refrigeration after opening and I don't even mind carting it along on trips. The unopened pouches are kept in normal home temps, and I've had no spoilage problems.<br /><br />I add the ground flax to fresh fruit salads, cottage cheese, mix it with honey or peanut butter, and have even added it to an omelet. The easiest mode is with cold cereal, but admittedly it gums up in milk if not consumed quickly.  Anyway it's consumed it is preferable to potential permanent muscle damage with statins.<br /><br />Cholesterol numbers moved 20-25 points in the right directions after 90 days with this regimen (coupled with fish oil).<br /><br />Delivery on the subscription plan is timely and convenient.

The benefits of flax are well known but hard to find places to get this much fiber, protein, omega 3, 6, 9 and lingnans.  The shelf life is over 18 months which is a huge benefit.  I also liked the fact that Premium Gold owned the entire process, growing, producing and it is their brand you are seeing sold.<br /><br />I use in shakes, but they did offer a great suggestions that tastes great for adding to cookies.<br /><br />Enjoy, highly recommend.

I've had the package open for 2 weeks and it tastes as fresh as the day I opened it.<br /><br />I'm using it to bulk up my Garden of Life Perfect meal. Basically adding 50 50 and I can say that it really fills you up. 1 shake for breakfast 1 shake for lunch and 1 shake late in the afternoon as a snack. I'm actually not even very hungry for dinner and eat less.<br /><br />This is the most economical price on the market for Cold Process Milled Flax Seed. at around $3.54 per 24oz or $2.33 a pound this is  unbelievable value.

review/summary: The Sweet Stuff
review/text: In so many ways, this is a really good jerky: low in fat from the buffalo, a nicely thick natural slab cut, slightly moist so that it has a nice bite without the toughness of leather, and a sufficiently peppery kick from a nice black pepper crust. Plus the assurance of no hormones, preservatives, or msg as shouted on the big green sticker on the package. The quality is there, no doubt.<br /><br />So what's wrong with it? It's right there, second on the list of ingredients -- SUGAR! This jerky is too sweet! I ordered the Peppered flavor and I was expecting a savory treat, a nice snack for the afternoons. Instead, this stuff is as sweet as maple syrup and not really what I wanted.<br /><br />Too bad, as I'm now stuck with 8 of these packages. For now, I'm going back to the SnackMasters brand. The quality is not as good but the flavor is many times better.

review/text: If you are looking for traditional jerky, you will want to order the slab style, which I would give 4 stars. High marks for hormone free and vegetarian fed. Their regular jerky is nothing like you would expect and I would only give it two stars, because the product description does not accurately reflect what you are getting. It is not thin, dried strips of buffalo. It is chopped up, extruded, and sliced into "O" shapes. If you look at the product packaging for their regular jerky, look at the letter "O" in buffalo. The name itself indicates that you have "O" shapes inside, but nowhere in the name or description is that mentioned. I'm sure many people will like this, but it's definitely not the "jerky experience" that most are looking for when they buy jerky.

I never read the fine print-this purchase was my fault for not reading everything-I saw buffalo & peppered & got excited.  The pepper flavor is very weak and unexciting.  If you like reconstructed meat with very little pepper flavor then this is the item for you!

review/summary: Delicious, no-nonsense taste
review/text: This is the second time I've ordered Golden Valley Buffalo Jerky--I've had the 'original' flavor, which was great; and decided on ordering the 'sweet N' spicy' flavor this time. I was not disappointed. For those who seek serious burn, this is not a particularly 'spicy' jerky, but I think it is exactly the right touch--not too hot, but spicy enough to give your taste buds a bit of a reaction. The jerky pieces vary in size--as would be expected when one slices an actual piece of meat--and texture (ditto), but there are no pieces of grisle and I've only come across one piece that was too hard to chew...<br />Basically--great snack.<br />I require a fair amount of protein in my diet to maintain my metabolism, and this is an excellent resource. Not to  salty. A little sweet. Nutritious, no MSG junk. And knowing (or hoping, rather) that the buffalo gets to live a reasonable life (i.e. not stuck inside one big brick house with flurescent lights and questionable food, but actually eating what buffalo are meant to eat and hopefully roaming about a bit), helps to.<br />Works for me!<br /><br />Awesome if you need to add something quick to a soup or stew: just dump a few pieces per serving in the pot and watch it move up a notch or two (or ten).

review/text: I have just gotten the turkey, beef and buffalo from this company. The beef jerky had a highly processed feel and was way way too sweet and was not the best quality meet. The turkey was decent, and for the price pretty good with thicker pieces and not as much over-sweetening. This buffalo is in the middle of the two. This jerky is still way too sweet, but the pieces and meat quality are much better than the beef jerky. I  probably will re-order the turkey, will never re-order the beef, and am on the fence for this one. Worth a try, but be prepared to find it too sweet!

review/summary: Sweet Buffalo Jerky
review/text: in an effort to shed a few pounds, i decided to restrict my diet to high protein foods, vegetables, and nuts. When I learned that jerky was a great snack for dieters who wanted protein on-the-go, while avoiding the added carbs in meal replacement bars, I searched for a brand of jerky that was right for me.<br /><br />Knowing very little about jerky (save for the junk in convenience stores), I learned that most brands are full of hormones, nitrites, antibiotics, MSG, and erythorbate. Supposedly, none of these ingredients are harmful in moderation, but I was looking for a snack that I could rely on whenever I had food cravings, and I couldn't afford to compromise my health in the long run by regularly consuming any of these items. So, I was pleased to find out about Golden Valley's line of all natural jerky.<br /><br />Aside from the benefit of finding a vendor that produced a jerky free of preservatives and added MSG, there was the added bonus of learning that federal law actually prohibits the use of growth hormone in buffalo. My mind at ease, I ordered the peppered buffalo jerky and received it in record time using the super saver shipping option.<br /><br />As a meat snack, I found the product to be too sweet for my liking, but nevertheless adequate for my purposes. The texture is milder than the low quality jerky that I'm familiar with, but the pepper flavor could easily go unnoticed as it's way too understated. Every bag that I received was moist and easy to chew and the product was free of flaw or defect.<br /><br />At $1.49/oz., I get 11 grams of protein for the cost of 90 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 7 grams of sugar. Compare this to the leading meal replacement bar on Amazon that costs $2.07/bar for 27 grams of protein, 2.5 grams of fat, 26 grams of sugar (51 grams of total carbs), and a litany of unwanted ingredients in each 3.5-oz. bar. Ounce-for-ounce, we're looking at 11 grams of protein in the jerky versus roughly 8 grams of protein in the bar. Even considering the disappointing sweetness of the jerky, I still manage to avoid all the unwanted carbs and confections of replacement bars. Of course, jerky loses out in terms of cholesterol content.<br /><br />Jerky connoisseurs will likely find the sweetness of this product to be unappealing and off-putting. On the other hand, it's been a great diet aid and a reliable, additive-free defense against mid-meal cravings, and that's really all I wanted out of Golden Valley's Buffalo Jerky.

review/summary: Great Taste & Great Value
review/text: I love buffalo jerky but don't eat it too often because of the cost.  One company in Jacksonhole, WY charges nearly half the cost of the product for shipping and handling.  And at $45 a pound plus $21 for shipping, it's just way too pricy no matter the taste. Another company out of Texas has jerky that is so hard that you need to soak it in water to soften it up for eating - yuck!  So when I decided to try Golden Valley, I did so without much anticipation that it would be pliable to eat due to the cost.  Instead I love it!  The jerky is delicious with the perfect amount of pepper and just enough sweetness to give it a pleasant under taste.  I don't have to tussle with the jerky trying to eat it as it is pliable yet gives that chewy pleasure that good jerky properly prepared has.  I will be ordering over and over again now that I've found a brand that is good value and delicious!  Thank you Golden Valley!

review/text: I've tried scores of jerkys and this one is the best of the best.  I used to prefer Snackmaster's hot & spicy jerky but I got too many packages that were spoiled with fungus.  Eventually I found Golden Valley Natural Buffalo Jerky.  It has no added hormones, no antibiotics, no preservatives, no MSG, no nitrite.  I've been buying this product from various sources, directly from the company (Jerky Direct) as well as through Amazon (which has the best price.)  I noticed Whole Foods Market sells this product.  It isn't as hot as the Snackmasters but I have never had a package that was spoiled.  This is wonderful jerky!  I highly recommend a book called "The Omnivore's Dilemma".  If you read that, you'll appreciate grass fed meat a whole lot more than feed lot meat that most other brands of jerky are made from.

review/text: I like the other jerky products I have tried from Golden Valley very much, but the Sweet N' Spicy Buffalo Jerky is a bit too hot for my taste.  I thought "sweet and spicy" meant medium hot since it wasn't called "Sweet and hot".  This jerky is hot.  It is hard to appreciate the jerky or the sweetness of it if your mouth is burning.  Actually, it is not burning red hot, but is a little too hot for someone who likes spicy to be a little less than medium on the hotness scale.  The jerky itself is wonderful - just the right amount of tenderness and chewiness.  If you like a little less than medium hotness, then try a different flavor of their jerky - they're great!

However when I thought I was getting a great deal from Amazon, it turns out that when it arrived, half of the bags were moldy! However, Amazon was great about it and refunded my money.  Perhaps the lack of preservatives give them a very low shelf life, so if it's low in sodium, consider buying from a local store when you can check the package and dates before buying.

It is more easily assimilated than soy, causes fewer GI issues (gas, indigestion, etc.), and has a better amino acid profile, etc., plus has little to no lactose remaining.<br /><br />"Instead of using destructive chemicals, cross-flow microfiltration uses filters to separate protein from undesirable fat, cholesterol and lactose, based on molecular size and shape.(18) The low-temperature process isolates the native protein of whey at its biologically natural pH, carefully preserving its biological activity. GMPs and other immune-boosting components remain intact."<br /><br />informational reference:  www &lt;dot> sportswhey &lt;dot> com/science_ion_exchange.htm<br /><br />Aside from the problem we have with the grossly inferior form of protein they are using, our main reason for stopping with this product is this:<br /><br />>>>>> We don't want our cancer to return. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />We have had breast cancer, and it was estrogen positive.  Our oncologist has indicated that while foods containing soy are ok in reasonable amounts, SOY ISOLATES ARE NOT SAFE FOR THESE TYPES OF CANCERS.<br /><br />Research backs this up.<br /><br />These bars are possibly cancer-promoting in the sense that they have estrogenic-effects.<br /><br />Women who are at risk for breast cancer (and who knows how much of the population this includes -- we don't know until after we have gotten it most of the time) SHOULD NOT BE EATING THESE BARS.<br /><br />Maybe they can put a warning label on them to say women should check with their doctors before consuming them.<br /><br />The research on this is readily available on the Internet, and my oncologist has studied this issue extensively.<br /><br />We are sad to give these bars up because they were our favorite in terms of flavor.

review/summary: The absolute best gluten free cookie ever!
review/text: I got a free sample chocolate chip cookie from the company's website as I wasn't sure about ordering a package without trying one first, but I shouldn't have worried.  These cookies are amazing!  Really, they will leave you saying Wow!  They are thick, moist, and chewy, which is not easy to find in a gluten free cookie.  They're also very generously sized, so one is more than enough to satisfy a sweet craving.  I think they're probably better than most "regular" cookies I've had!  I'll definitely be ordering some!

review/summary: Great taste & nostalgia all in 1 bottle
review/text: After forgetting about this great brand for years, a re-run of an episode of Seinfeld sparked my interest to go out and get a bottle of this syrup.  Lo and behold, my childhood came back to me in an instant and took out a tablespoon and ate it straight out of the bottle (don't judge me, you know you would too) before using it over my ice cream.  Wow, it really is my favorite, and won't be leaving my consciousness ever again.  Blows the doors off of Hershey's or Quik.  Also goes great mixed with cola, in cocktails, milk, ice cream, in cakes, brownies, etc., or just by itself if no one else is around and you wash the spoon to dispose of any evidence.  5* product all the way, and hopefully they keep producing it for years to come.

review/summary: What's Your Fortune Say?
review/text: For older kids, even high school, this would be a great starter story for them to read and then make their own fortune cookies, inserting their own fortunes before the hot smooth cookies harden. A nice end note explains some of the original of the Fortune cookie as Japanese, not Chinese, but the overall charm of the book is its celebration of the traditions of the messages inside the cookies. If you didn't want to make fortune cookies from scratch in a classroom, you might just settle for everyone having a fortune cookie (available in most large groceries) and sharing their fortunes over a cup of nice tea. Also, check out Dim Sum for Everyone, also celebrating cultural food experiences for all ages.

Amazon shipped quickly and they arrived in perfect shape. My favorites are the orange (arancia) and the lemon, but the tangerine is also good.

review/summary: True Gorgonzola Flavor with a Crunch
review/text: Sadly, there is no Trader Joe's in our area but, friends who visited one while in Naples, Florida, returned home with a box of these crackers for me.  I love them!  I've already signed-up with Amazon to be notified when this product becomes available for online ordering.  Yes, they really are that good.<br /><br />These crackers are small; about the size of a quarter.  And you can eats lots of them--31--for just 140 calories.  That's a lot of satisfying flavor, crunching, and chewing for relatively few snack calories.  These are as addictive as potato chips but, so much more satisfying.<br /><br />There are crackers out there that proclaim to be made with real cheese, or, have a true cheesy flavor.  Never have I eaten one to taste like the real thing--until now.  The gorgonzola flavor is authentic and the crunch adds to its appeal.<br /><br />Pairing cheeses with wine or fruit is a complementary experience.  Try a handful of these gorgonzola crackers with a juicy, ripe peach, a pear, or some cherries.  They will pair well with a crisp white wine or even a red, such as a syrah (shiraz).<br /><br />Regrettably, once this box is gone, I'll have to wait until Amazon sells Trader Joe's Roasted Gorgonzola Flavored Oven Crisp Crackers.  Unless YOU happen to be going to a Trader Joe's...

I just had my first chai tea latte, and it was delicious!  It doesn't taste like tea at all, nor does it taste like coffee or flavored coffee, or flavored milk for that matter.  It's a taste all it's own -- and sweet but not overpowering sweet (I can't stand anything too sugary).  This is going to become a staple in my household.  Even if you're not a tea fan, I'd say give it a try.  I am very pleasantly surprised by it.

review/summary: Coffee Maker Broke, so USELESS
review/text: I was able to taste this coffee, even though my Dolce Gusto coffee maker broke.  fyi, the Dolce Gusto has a user screen that over time, for me, started to fritz more and more, showing only a blank screen - the internal software apparently can fritz quite a bit.  That screen is where you choose the type coffee you want to make and also where you are told to insert the coffee capsules, etc., so when it's blank you have to guess.  The coffee tastes a bit stale, unfortunately.  fyi, when my Dolce-Gusto machine broke, the Dolce Gusto folks, after having me on the phone for an hour having me look at minute serial numbers and trying to noodle out where I bought it, made it clear that they are only in search of marketing info - but they only told me that AFTER wasting my time, when they sent me on to a different company to start the complaint process all over again.  The machine is going back, and I won't be buying this coffee anymore!  Having tried almost every flavor, none of them were good enough to justify the hassle or the per cup expense.  I also own a Senseo, that uses paper per serving pods instead of the Dolce Gusto plastic per serving capsules, and the bottom line is that I'll happily  stick with my tried and true simple, more  environmentally friendly, paper single serving pods Hamilton Beach brewer  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O0AOMQ">Hamilton Beach Two Way Brewer Single Serve and 12 cup Coffee Maker</a>

review/text: I ordered these crackers about two weeks ago, not knowing how they would be. Turns out they are delicious! A little plain tasting, which was expected, with just the right amount of salt for my tastes and a subtle but pleasant hint of olive oil. They seem to go very well with several cheeses, soup and on their own, too. I recommend them to anyone who likes Saltines or other plain, salted crackers - however I find these to be significantly less salty than Saltines. Enjoy.

review/summary: Great substitute for Nabisco Saltines
review/text: I bought a package of these from our local natural foods store (at almost twice the price!).  My 4-year old loves Saltines with tuna salad, but I wanted crackers without all the additives and mystery ingredients.  These are a perfect substitution!<br /><br />The taste is very close to regular Saltines, close enough that my son didn't blink an eye when I gave these to him.  They're not as sturdy, to be sure, so it's not a cracker that can stand up to spreading a harder cheese.  However, tuna salad or soft cheeses go on just fine.  I tried them myself topped with thin slices of raw cheddar and they tasted delicious.<br /><br />I don't taste the olive oil at all.  The salt is lighter than Nabisco, but still well-seasoned. The small interior packages are nice for keeping each serving of crackers fresh and crispy.<br /><br />Now that I know Amazon carries these, I'll be signing up for the Subscribe and Save option to keep a nice stash in the cupboard.

review/summary: Very Good Organic Saltine Crackers But Too Crumbly
review/text: These saltine crackers taste very good but they are so crumbly that as soon as you take a bite, you end up with crumbs all over the place. I like the idea that they are organic and use healthy olive oil, but they would be more nutritious if they contained whole wheat flour instead of just wheat flour.<br /><br />Also, I would prefer if they cut down the amount of packages per box, so that I'm not opening a cellophane package for every 4 double-crackers I eat or serve.
