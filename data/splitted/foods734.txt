review/summary: Smooth, better flavor, and less waste.
review/text: Had to try this coffee brand for my single brew machine.  Glad I did.  This is what fresh coffee should taste like.  Also like the idea that there is less plastic- don't want items brewed in plastic!  The flavor is the best- smooth and so fresh!<br />I hope they will consider making flavored coffees- vanilla, etc.

review/summary: Finally an affordable alternative to over priced K-cups.
review/text: Over the last six years that I've had my Kureig brewer I've seen the price of K-cups steadily rise along with it's popularity.  Finally someone has come up with an alternative that is just as easy to use, tastes great and is substantially cheaper.  THANK YOU San Francisco Bay Coffee for marketing this product.  I got the breakfast blend which is actually stronger than the Green Mountain version I normally buy.  I compensated by increasing the size of the cup from the regular mug to the travel mug size.  Now I'm actually getting a larger cup of coffee for less money.  Yippee!

review/summary: Very good value
review/text: I'm quite pleased with this. I wondered how the less-plastic design would work, but it worked just fine. The coffee is bold without being a dark roast. So there is no problem using the large cup setting. The price per cup is the best I've found. It seems they economize with the k-cup design and not by skimping on the amount of coffee. Of course you're buying 80 cups, so you hope you're going to like it. So far, I do.

review/summary: Better tasting coffee
review/text: I tried this version of K-cups to determine how it compared with other brands.  I was somewhat skeptical of the coffee not being in an air tight container.  This coffee has a filter covering the bottom and therefore not sealed.  The taste of the coffee is great.  We typically stay with the medium type blends and stay away from the bold flavors.  This coffee is a little on the strong side so when I brew, I just use more water and the flavor is as good as or better than the other brands (Emerils, Newmans, etc.).  As far as keeping the coffee fresh, we use an air tight container.  This coffee comes in sealed bags containing 12 or fewer cups.  Cost is much less than the standard k-cups.

review/text: Generally I avoid 'breakfast blends' because they are, usually, pretty wimpy in flavor.  I actually ordered this by mistake - thought I was ordering one of the other San Francisco Bay coffees (that I love).  Having said that - I got it - tried it - and it is surprisingly good.  Not at all wimpy in flavor and it is becoming one of my favs.

review/text: Very happy with the flavor of the coffee.  Have purchased both the Breakfast Blend and the Fogchaser.  The Breakfast Blend is a lighter roast while Fogchaser is more full bodied.  Very happy with the flavor of both.  Coffee doesn't come in traditional k-cups but arrive in sealed bags containing 5 each of the containers.  The filter are exposed but the tops fit in the udual holder.  This arrangement of holders reduces the cost to approximately half the cost of a regular k cup.  Very pleased with the purchase.

review/summary: Love this breakfast blend!
review/text: After buying a keurig coffee maker this summer, we've been on a search for the perfect morning breakfast blend--our search is over! If you like Newman's Own...or Tully's then you will probably love this blend. It's a nice cup of coffee--strong but not burnt tasting like some I've tried. I have a 16 oz travel mug, and I can actually brew 10oz, then run another 6oz of water through the same kcup, and it is perfection! One more thing to mention, these are not like regular k-cups in that they arrive in sealed bags with little cups that have a top of the cup similar to reg k-cups, but the coffee is not encased in a plastic cup, they are in a thick rounded filter material. Looks different, but works perfect in the coffee machine. I love that it is less plastic waste to end up in the landfill. Oh, and if you're still 'on the fence', consider the price of these VS regular k-cups---definite savings!

review/summary: Not residue, but crema!
review/text: What some think is residue is actually crema, though not as heavy as in an espresso shot. Crema is a flavorful, aromatic, reddish-brown froth made when air bubbles combine with fine-ground coffee's soluble oils. The strong presence of crema indicates a quality, well-ground coffee Crema helps give espresso a fuller flavor, longer aftertaste than drip coffee. This is excellent coffee and the crema makes it better.

review/text: I like the San Francisco Bay cups because they have a "paper" bottom, which means less plastic (better for the environment????).  I think the paper allows more water to flow through, thus the coffee is a bit stronger.  They appear to be a bit less expensive also, which makes sense since there is less plastic.

review/summary: Great coffee at an excellent price
review/text: I ordered this coffee hoping to like it as the price for 80 cups was a mere $33 shipped!  When it arrived the box was a little beat up and the bottom was half opened but no product was lost so not too big of a deal. I opened the box and there are 10 packages with 8 cups in each. As this coffee pod doesn't have the protective plastic cup around the filter you save on the cost and it helps the environment. The coffee smelled great and my husband and I each brewed a cup. I added cream and sugar and while I liked the taste it isn't my absolute favorite blend. My husband on the other hand LOVED it. He drank five cups and told me to be sure to order more when we run out. He said it wasn't as bitter as some of the other K-cup flavors he has tried like Donut House blends. I can't wait to share it with guests and  tell them the bargain price.  The only caveat is that the bags of pods are not sealed so they can go stale if you don't keep it in a plastic bag or a bowl with a lid.

review/summary: THE Alternative To High Priced K-Cups You've Been LOOKING For!
review/text: You love K-Cups, but get annoyed with paying $1.50+ apiece? This product is for you. It's not a K-Cup. So my guess is that they don't pay royalties to Keurig. And they pass the savings along to you.<br /><br />So if it's not a K-cup, what is it? Too hard to explain. It's like a cross between a tea-bag and a K-Cup.<br /><br />Here's all that matters: it fits in your Keurig machine--no problem. They package it in a way that it stays fresh. And it brews as good of a cup of coffee as any K-Cup.<br /><br />But it's WAY cheaper.<br /><br />Try it. You'll love it!

review/summary: Robust for a Breakfast Blend!
review/text: The San Francisco Bay Coffee Breakfast Blend K-cup is a robust cup of coffee for a supposed Breakfast Blend.  I bought this as a standby when I need K-cups quickly and my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA30TG">Green Mountain Coffee, Breakfast Blend K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers, 50-count</a> was running out.  We normally drink Green Mountain coffee but I was intrigued by the low environmental impact packaging of these individual portions, so I decided to give them a try.  Really, really great.  I only wish more companies would offer this type of packaging ... it makes a great, fresh cup of coffee.<br /><br />When brewed, the coffee is a little heavier than I am accustomed to for a Breakfast Blend (I drink my coffee black).  I can actually get two cups out of one K-cup/pod - one on the tallest setting and one of the shortest setting.  For a black cup of coffee, it is still relatively robust even for that smaller cup.<br /><br />I like these K-cup pods a lot.  I think they make a lot more sense packaging-wise.  These came in a box with 8 baggies of 10 K-cups.  The bags keep them fresh and are necessary for that.  Unlike a regular plastic K-cup, if exposed to the elements they will go stale quickly.  I have a sealed coffee jar I keep the pods in that keeps them fresh cup after cup.<br /><br />Coffee has gotten a lot more expensive but for 80 portions, this is a great buy.  Love these.  I wish that Green Mountain would package them like this!

It was much more economical than the small boxes we had been buying.  The box was received in less than a week and we tried the coffee immediately.  It has a robust flavor without any bitterness.  Great coffee!  I would recommend this product and this merchant to anyone.

review/text: This coffee is very good, a bit stronger than most of the breakfast blends I have tried. I was surprised at the strengh,  but still very good.  I like the fact that is has less waste than other k cups. I will buy again as the price is superb. I am looking forward to trying the other blends by this company.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: The coffee is good coffee, packaged in much more environmentally friendly containers than K cups!  The coffee comes in vacuum sealed bags of 10 or 12.  Each cup has a plastic ring which holds it in place in the keurig machine and the coffee is held to the ring by a strong filter. Once the cup has been used, I cut the two apart, compost the coffee and filter and the ring is rinsed and put in recycling. The only slight drawback to this packaging is that you need to brew the coffee in a reasonable amount of time once the vacuum seal has been broken.

review/summary: Great coffee, great price
review/text: I'm not generally a huge fan of Keurig coffee makers because they and their K-cups are so expensive. But my girlfriend has one and she ran out of coffee for it. I looked around Amazon and found this item. It sounded promising so I decided to try it. It is the best K-cup of coffee I've ever had (it has a strong, mellow medium roast flavor). And it's also the least expensive I've found. I signed up for a subscription and will probably keep it going. Yum.

review/summary: san francisco bay excellent coffee
review/text: I tried this coffee and did not expect it to be very tasty.  Well I love love love it.  The company packs approxitmately 10 individual coffee in a wonderful plastic bag which is of high quality.  My order consisted of several of these bags.  The manufacturer places the coffee in plastic to keep it fresh.  The coffee has a different bottom than the keurig coffee.  However, it fits into the keurig  platinum series coffee maker.  Be aware the new keurig vue brewer  coffee pods will not fit into this machine.  All the pods we are used to do not fit into the new machine.  This just a gimmick to sell more and slowely replace the machine we are used to.

review/text: I have used most K-cups varieties and flavors over the past couple of years. I'm an old Navy man, so I'm required to drink lots of coffee (that's a joke, son!). This is the first batch of San Francisco Bay coffee that I've tried, and now I reach right past all the other brands on my kitchen counter to where this is. When I open a bag of these "cups" - there are eight in each plastic bag - I use one and put the remaining seven in a glass jar to keep them fresh. I've had my favorites among the various K-cup varieties over the years, but now this is easliy the "best". I'm trying some other blends of theirs now. Five stars is not enough.

review/summary: Decent but not great cheese popcorn
review/text: I purchased this popcorn because, as a Chicago native, I've been craving great Chicago-style popcorn. It's good for packaged popcorn, but it's not up to the quality of Nuts on Clark or Garrett's, the quintessential Chicago brands (both of which sell their popcorn via mail-order). On the plus side, this popcorn does have a long shelf-life, it's crunchy and isn't greasy. It is moderately cheesy, but it's not as cheesy as the classics -- you won't find your fingers coated with yellow cheese-dust after eating it -- and it's actually less cheesy than a commonplace grocery-store brand like Smartfood. It's certainly edible, but I won't be buying any more, and I would recommend looking at other brands instead if you've got a cheese-corn craving.

review/summary: Very Good Bulgur Wheat!!!
review/text: This is very good bulgur (also spelled bulgar, bulghur, burghul, pourgouri, depending on ethnic group).  It is course-ground, slightly toward the medium-grind side.  It comes packaged in a double layer paper bag with a plastic liner in between the paper layers.  Amazon put it in a box to ship. It arrived just fine.  It was acceptably fresh, free of any noticeable debris, with a faint earthy smell of toasted wheat.  Below you will find information from the package label and manufacturer's site.  They also have recipes available there, if you need ideas.  We were very happy with the quality/freshness/price-on-sale (just a bit over a dollar per pound) and will order again.<br /><br />Bulgar Wheat Description:<br />Bulgar wheat are wheat kernels that have been steamed, dried and crushed. Bulgar has a tender, chewy texture, and is light brown in color. Although it is often confused with cracked wheat, bulgar wheat is processed differently.<br /><br />Comments:<br />Bulgar wheat is a natural product. It is a staple of many Middle Eastern countries. Roland Bulgar Wheat is a coarse grained product (#3).<br /><br />Preparation:<br />1 cup bulgur, 2 cups water or broth,  1 tsp. salt  Bring water or broth to a boil. Add bulgar. Return to boil, cover, reduce heat and cook on low for 15 minutes, or until tender. Remove from heat, fluff with fork, cover and let stand for 8 minutes.<br /><br />Ingredients/Contents: Bulgur Wheat Item #: 72130 UPC #: 041224721302 Pack: 25/25.00 LB or 11.3 Kg-New Item: No-Kosher: No-Organic:  No-All Natural: No-SKU 041224721302 or 10041224721309  Nutrition Facts--Serving Size 0.25 cup (45g) Amount Per Serving--Calories 150  Calories From Fat 5---% Daily Value *---Total Fat 0.5g-1% Saturated Fat 0g-0% Unsaturated Fat 0.5g Trans Fat 0g Cholesterol 0mg-0% Sodium 10mg0% Total Carbohydrate 34g-11% Dietary Fiber 3g-12% Sugars 1g Protein 5g Vitamin A 0% Vitamin C 0% Calcium 2% Iron 8%<br />* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

After reading the ingredients and deciding that there was really nothing unhealthy in them, I made them for brunch.  Everyone loved the true pumpkin flavor.  The spices are just perfect.  This year I made a special trip to Trader Joe's and there they were, a seasonal item.  I bought two boxes and have already used the first and opened the second today.  It's only been a month.

review/summary: Excellent Pasta !
review/text: I am very gluten sensitive and have unconsciously avoided pasta for years, as well as bread, pizza, etc.  I've become consciously aware of this sensitivity and have switched to gluten-free foods as much as possible.<br /><br />When I saw this pasta, I thought, hmmm.  Great price for gluten-free pasta although I wasn't sure about the size/shape of this pasta since I do prefer larger flat pasta noodles.<br /><br />When I cooked this pasta, I was very pleasantly surprised. It cooked quickly, stayed firm enough for me, and digested like a charm. No bloated feeling after eating it..........it went down like a vegetable and I love the size.<br /><br />It's perfect to add to soup for a bit more "body".  I also made a delicious stove-top tuna casserole-type meal by combining about a cup of this uncooked pasta, then cooking it, a can of tuna drained, some cooked broccoli and diced baby carrots, garlic to taste, and then heated it all together with half a jar of alfredo sauce.  Yum and quick.......probably 15 minutes start to finish.<br /><br />The price at about a buck plus a bag is amazing compared to the prices you'll find in your local health food store and it's not a compromise, in my opinion.<br /><br />If you have digestion issues or gluten sensitivity, please consider trying this product.  It's a winner !

review/summary: Okay, But Should Be Better
review/text: On the one hand, this tiny corn-flour shell pasta has a pleasant flavor that offset a sub-par cheese sauce recipe.  On the other, it never completely cooked.  I left it on the fire for the defined time, tasted it, and found it underdone.  So I gave it more time, and it was still underdone.<br /><br />In the end I gave it nearly twice the prescribed time before just giving up and eating it.  At that point it tasted good, but was gummy and undercooked, and when I drained it the cook-water was almost rigid with starch.  I could have used that water to glue stuff in my scrapbook.<br /><br />It was tasty enough.  But it took too long and never got finished.  I've had good luck with this brand before, if not this exact variety, so I may try again when I have more time to invest.  But for the moment, I could kindly call this product a mixed bag.

review/text: This is a good tasting gluten free pasta for a great price.  My whole family enjoys it, even those not on a gf diet.  It has a better taste than many rice pastas and stays firmer than rice pasta, especially after reheating left overs.  The only downfall is that it can't be used for cold pasta salads such as macaroni salad, because it is hard when cold.

review/summary: Cooking this may take a small amount of trial and error, but for Celiacs, it's the best I've found
review/text: A friend found this pasta in the discount bin at a discount grocery--shiver.  I looked at it, instantly had hope and then considered it carefully before even testing it.  I cooked it and like the tasteless brown rice pasta I can get at Whole Foods, there's a lot of paste in it.  I rinsed with cold water after cooking, like you're supposed to do with any pasta, and ignored the cooking times, because like any "bread," you have to cook pasta with an eye to the way it absorbs water(barometric pressure, viscosity and a host of other variables can affect this).  What I ended up with the first batch, was an under cooked pasta that at least didn't soak up salt too much like the brown rice pasta did.  There was a corn taste I covered with cheese or a meat sauce I made.<br /><br />The second try went much, much better.  I was only diagnosed last year, so I'd cooked pastas for over a decade.  The first time I cooked spaghetti was when I was probably 5 years old and I assure you, my first pass at this stuff was far better than the mess that 5 year old made.  Salt, a small amount of olive oil and a large open sauce bot for the boiling helps.  Boil for at least 5 minutes, and then start testing the shells with a pair of tongs.  Pull up on shell and flex it with the tongs.  When the consistency is where you want it, quickly remove the pot from heat and strain the pasta.  While the pasta is still in the strainer, rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.  The sauces that go with this pasta are the key.<br /><br />1.  I make an Alfredo sauce I thicken with potato starch (don't use corn starch here, you have enough corn already)<br />2.  This makes the best Gluten-free Mac and cheese I've found.  Do not use young cheeses if you can help it.  I prefer sharp cheddar and a touch of Parmesan.<br />3.  Meat sauces.  I've noticed many Celiac are vegetarian or even vegan, but for those of us who aren't, this pasta tastes the best in a marinara reduction that has at least two kinds of meats folded into it.  Boar's head bacon and ground beef, with sweated onions added to two cans or 3 or 4 fresh diced and sweated tomatoes, add a teaspoon of potato starch to thicken and a diced clove of garlic and you have a sauce that worked with the brown rice pasta but is literally golden with this corn stuff.<br />4.  Butter, garlic, salt, pepper, and lemon or lime.  Simple, sweet and remarkable.<br /><br />Can horrible things happen with this pasta?  Oh yes, but that's not the pasta's fault.  You can burn toast and scald yourself boiling water, but this is the best thing on the market for a gluten free pasta.

It boiled up into a pot of paste suitable for making paper mache and not suitable for eating. I have tried using bigger pots with more water and still no luck. Also the cooking time is way off, no matter how long you cook the pasta it just dissolves. The pasta never reaches a stage of being done. This is one of over a dozen GF pastas that I have used and the only one that I have had a problem with. It also isn't the first corn pasta that I have used!

review/summary: Great for our Siberian Husky puppy
review/text: Our Sibe was underweight so after vet blood work  came back free of parasites, the vet recommended we start her on a grain-free diet. She had be on an all Science Diet diet, however her breeder had recommended Blue Buffalo so we knew that might be a good option. She loves the Blue Buffalo Freedom canned puppy food and we were finally able to add the puppy lamb and oatmeal with the canned Freedom. Her stools are now a normal consistency and she is holding weight. Hopefully she will start gaining weight soon. We've only had her on the grain-free diet for 2 weeks. At least now she acts hungry at meals and has some energy. Thankful to BB for being an affordable option for us....it's expensive, but not as much as a prescription diet would've been from the doctor.

review/summary: The real stuff.  Shark brand Sriracha loses the artifical qualities of Huey Fong but has all the fire and yum.
review/text: I've been a rabid fan of Huey Fong Sriracha sauce for years, so when I saw authentic Thai Sriracha sauce here on Amazon my interest was piqued.  I wasn't disappointed.  Shark brand Sriracha sauce really does come from Thailand and it really is sriracha sauce.  It's the same hot chili loaded with garlic and yummy sweetness - but there are plenty of differences.  Where Huey Fong is dark almost crimson red (and looks a tad fake), Shark brand is brick tomato red and clearly looks natural.  Huey Fong lists preservatives, Shark does not.  Unlike Huey Fong, Shark is freely runny and comes in a glass (not plastic) bottle without a flow limiting top (so watch out!)<br /><br />Tasting notes:  Shark is hot, sweet, and garlicky.  Compared to Huey Fong it is less sweet, with a more open tomato-like flavor component.  Vinegar is a more noticeable flavor element with Shark brand.  The texture is looser; and the product separates more in the fridge (and, yes, it requires refrigeration) and requires that the bottle be shaken before use if it's sitting for more than a week.  Is Shark yummy?  Yes - it's probably the second best hot sauce I've tried.  Is Huey Fong yummier?  Yes, in my opinion Huey Fong's added sweetness and thickness and less vinegar taste is more yummy - but it's not a slam dunk.  Shark brand feels more real, more homemade, and more authentic (as it probably is). Huey Fong has preservatives and has a color and texture that are a tad artificial.  I find myself going back and forth.  On top of a burrito I prefer Huey Fong.  In soup I prefer Shark.  I certainly do not regret having this stuff.  Highly recommended for the sriracha obsessed.<br /><br />FYI - full ingredient list:  "Chillie" 35%, Water 25%, Sugar 20%, Garlic 10%, Salt 5%, Vinegar 5%.  Sounds like you could almost make it at home.  Manufacturer:  Kosol-Ampa Co. LTD.  OFF: 804D Chet Cham Nong Rd. Cholburi, Thailand 038-282710 (That's the phone number).

review/text: I ordered this never having tried sriracha sauce before. I am trying to eat more veggies and greens. In preparation for my newly found eagerness for more vegetables, I  ordered cellophane rice wraps, green curry, Sriracha , etc. This stuff is addicting! I want to dip almost everything I eat into this Sriacha sauce. I am not into overly spicy food. While this definitely has a kick it is not overbearing. I have ordered  a very popular brand of chili sauce in the past ( with a rooster on it)  and each time the sauce had a plastic, synthetic flavor. Shark brand does not , it has a very clean and fresh flavor. I am happy to have found this product!

review/summary: the only hot sauce I'll use
review/text: I've been eating shark brand hot sauce since as long as I can remember. My Thai mother used to buy this at the local Asian store in giant bottles, and it wouldn't last very long!  We would use it on fried noodles (pad thai), and my favorite with a fried omelette and rice!<br /><br />This sauce is simply the best. It's nothing like the Huy Fong sauce (which I have never liked) because Shark Brand is pureed into a smooth ketchup like consistency.  This makes it great for putting on practically anything!  Everyone I have ever introduced the Shark Brand sauce to has become a convert.  If you want a tasty snack, buy some shrimp chips (http://www.amazon.com/Calbee-Shrimp-Flavored-Chips-4-Ounce/dp/B0028P8FJS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1334249885&sr=8-1) and dip them in this sauce.  It's absolutely addictive and tasty with beer ;)

review/summary: VERY TASTY + NO ADDITIVES:
review/text: I LOVE this sriracha sauce and must confess that I have become addicted to it.  I have always loved hot peppers and sauces...ever since I was introduced to Tabasco sauce at age 6.  I love these hot, spicy peppers and sauces the way "normal" people love chocolate.  This is the best bottled sriracha sauce I have found to date and it is even better than the fresh-made sauce they serve at my favorite local Thai restaurant.  It has the perfect combination of sweetness and burn and I order this through Amazon.com by the caseload.<br /><br />Another "plus" is that it contains no additives or preservatives so it won't make you glow in the dark.  However, be warned:  once you open a bottle you MUST refrigerate it.  But, the bottles are small (7 oz.) and if you enjoy sriracha sauce as much as I do, you'll empty a bottle within days!<br /><br />I highly recommend "Shark" brand sriracha sauce to anyone who appreciates Thai food as much as I do...or, even, if just you like tasty hot sauces.  You can use this sauce on just about anything:  sandwiches, crackers & cheese, vegetables and more.

review/text: This is very hard to find but when I find it, I buy it in bulk. Vendors think I'm insane.  I eat this stuff straight by pouring it into a shot glass and dip raw vegetables and shrimp chips in it.  Crazy hot, great flavor for making dipping sauces or adding it to ketchup to make it spicy.  I go through a wholesale bottle within a month, a 7oz bottle is lucky to survive the week.....<br /><br />This gives any kind of red sauce an awesome kick and flavor.  I add it to everything, curried dishes, delicate miso based soups, heavy peanut and creamed vegetable soups across a variety of ethnic dishes.. Great in Indian food and of course Thai food.<br /><br />My local restaurant has it and I pour a ton of it in the tom yum and curried dishes she serves....<br /><br />Hot food fanatics need to make this a daily condiment.....

review/summary: A more authentic Sriracha!
review/text: Most Americans are more familiar with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LOAN66">Huey Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (17oz)</a> version of Sriracha sauce with what I jokingly called the "screaming chicken" hot sauce you see in Asian restaurants.  The Huey Fong version is fairly thick and somewhat sweet that makes it more palatable to American tastes.  I came across Shark Sriracha somewhat by accident and I quickly remembered the wide variety of sauces and cuisines that vary by region and had to remind myself that it's a matter of taste and preference.  For some, Shark Sriracha will be quite shocking as it is prepared in the more traditional Thai manner, meaning it is runnier and more piquant.  Many Americans may be put off by all the foreign language labeling and fearful of the contents, but don't worry, it's not as hot as you think.  As with so many things I was put off by, I'm kicking myself now that I've tried it, as Sriracha sauce isn't that hot and in fact has a nice touch of sweetness to it that makes it a great addition to Thai and Chinese dishes.  Truthfully it's nowhere near as hot as Tabasco sauce and on the Scoville Scale of hotness it ranks only at the 1,000-2,5000 range making it medium (Tabasco is the next level up).  As a self-confessed hot-head hot sauce lover I have to admit Shark Sriracha has a much more blendable consistency which works easier when cooking and blends well in many Asian dishes.  I typically love northern Thai food and Shark Sriracha works well with it and with Szechwan as well.  Shark Sriracha gives a nice pop of hot without being overpowering like some hot sauces or the truly hot Thai chilies that rate up at 50,000-100,000 on the Scoville scale.  If something is a bit too bland for my taste usually a bit of Shark Sriracha gets my mouth watering. Don't let your fear of the unknown scare you off of Shark Sriracha as you don't know what you're missing!

Very thin, and does not have that savory sweetness like most balsamic vinegars have.  Look elsewhere unless you are looking for red wine vinegar.
