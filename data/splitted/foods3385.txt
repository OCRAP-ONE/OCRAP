review/summary: decent xylitol gum
review/text: I appreciate that this gum is sweetened JUST with xylitol (unlike some of the others widely available which also contain aspartame and/or acesulfame potassium).  Overall, this gum has good flavor and texture.  The other reviewers are correct that it loses its flavor fairly quickly however, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars.  This is not a major issue to me; I have and would buy this product again.

review/summary: Good flavor; difficult texture.
review/text: I love the taste of truffles, and because they are too expensive and too evanescent to buy fresh very often, I have sought ways of obtaining the taste in ways that don't break the bank or go bad in three days.  Truffle oil has been successful, as has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013M5EM8">FungusAmongUs Truffle Salt, 3.5-Ounce Jar</a>, also from FungusAmongUs.  I think this "Gatherer's Sauce" is the least satisfactory among those three options.<br /><br />The sauce includes truffles--it's not clear the exact amount--and several other ingredients such as anchovy that mimic, complement, and stretch the truffle taste.  And that taste is far from objectionable, having the tangy, earthiness of truffles gestured at strongly enough that one doesn't feel cheated by that aspect of the product.  The let-down is almost entirely to do with the texture.  To call it a sauce does violence to definition of "sauce," because sauces should flow or spread.  This "sauce" does neither, and has roughly the texture of soggy mulch.<br /><br />This is significant because I bought the Gatherer's Sauce to use primarily as a spread--a thin coating to a good ham in a sandwich, that sort of thing.  I was expecting something approximating the consistency of coarsely ground mustard.  No such luck.  Rather than being spreadable, this "sauce" must be strategically dabbed on and tamped down to offer uniform coverage.<br /><br />I wouldn't go so far as to say "definitely avoid," because despite my warning about the texture, the flavor is a welcome addition to so many foods, changing them from basic to damn-near elegant at a smear.  But I await a product that manages to capture that unique piquancy with less compromise toward gloppy grittiness.

review/summary: Makes a big difference
review/text: We used to just dump our compostable kitchen stuff straight into the composting crock, and it was always a horrendous mess when we would carry it out to the main compost bin to empty.  Now that I've started using these bags, it's a much less unpleasant task (and we empty the crock more often now, too, because we aren't both trying to put the task off hoping the other will break down and do it instead! :D )<br /><br />A couple of caveats: the bags ARE, as advertised, biodegradable, so if you leave them in the crock full of wet kitchen scraps for too long, they will start to seep liquid out into the crock.  It's more like osmosis - they don't really seem to develop holes at this point, but they kind of ooze liquid through a little bit.  I'd say five days is the maximum time you should leave them in there.  If you forget and they do start to seep, however, the task of taking the bag out to the compost bin and then washing the crock is still much less objectionable, since the inside of the crock is only wet, not stuck full of coffee grounds and bits of eggshell and all that other stuff I used to hate having to clean out of it every time.<br /><br />They are also a bit fragile.  The practice of cramming in as much stuff as you can by shoving down on top of the contents is just not a good idea here - the bags can be easily torn by hard materials such as banana stems, eggshells, grape stems and the like.<br /><br />So basically the upshot of the whole thing is: don't shove too much into the compost crock, remove the bags often, and you will find that these bags make your counter-top compost collecting a much more pleasant task.

review/text: Love how easy these make it to empty the under-sink compost bucket into the composter. Cuts down on the cleaning of the bucket, too (though it still usually needs a good rinse). Found that the bags tend to slip down into the bucket so we simply pull a little bit over the outer edge, twist it into a knot and hold it there with a small binder clip.

review/summary: Keeps things neater
review/text: I've been composting for several years, and bought one of those crocks that sits on the counter.  I just put things in the crock and carried them out to the compost for years.  But every time, you then have to wash out the messy, stinky crock.  With these bags, the mess (and stink) is greatly reduced.  I just put a folded paper towel in the bottom (to catch juices) and then the bag.  When it is full it comes out of the crock much better than loose scraps.  I started using them last year, and when I turned the compost this summer there was no trace of the older bags so they DO biodegrade as stated.  The only thing I wish is that they were a little smaller; they are so big they stick out of the crock quite a bit and it seems wasteful.

review/text: I use these in a compost pail in my kitchen. They make it a little more convenient to empty the pail into the compost pile outside, but they are not leak proof so I am still faced with a messy pail nearly every time.  The bags do break down in the outdoor pile, but not quickly.  When I turn the pile, the kitchen scraps from the bags will have been broken down and converted into compost, but the ragged bags are still recognizable.  I have been using them for a year, and will have to screen bag fragments out of finished compost.

review/summary: Very useful
review/text: We have a ceramic compost bucket and tried lining it with plastic bags to avoid scooping out gross vegetable matter -- not a very good solution.  The BioBags are a good size and lightweight enough to easily line the compost bucket.  We actually pull them out, put them in a ziplok bag, and then into the freezer to store until eventually taking out to the compost pile, but then we just pull out the entire BioBag and dump it in -- very easy.  Note that the BioBag is not completely waterproof, so the compost bucket still needs to be rinsed, and I wouldn't want to shake the bag around for fear of it bursting apart after starting to decompose... but, we bought one to try it out and just bought a 4-pack -- it's much better than the alternatives we've tried.

review/text: We switched to these bags from plastic bags a year ago when we adopted a more earth-friendly lifestyle, and we haven't regretted it. We use them in the kitchen,and in the bathroom, and they work very well.<br /><br />These are smaller, and a little more delicate than your average trash bag, so we switched to smaller trash cans everywhere. We recycle as much as possible, so most of the trash is organic. That means we double the bags when we know we are going to throw a lot of acidic food waste ( we don't want everything to fall out in the disposal chute!). On the whole, its taught us to be more alert and responsible, and we like that!

review/text: I purchased a pack of 4 of these to use for collecting kitchen scraps to add to my three compost piles (each in different stages of decomposition). Over the last year, I have had to screen out the green bags and pass them to the next level of decomposition along with things like corn cobs and branches. The corn cobs break down faster than the biobags! I had torn the bags into small bits to help them break down faster but that hasn't helped. I've stopped using the bags. And have two unopened boxes in my basement. What a disappointment!

review/text: These biobags are the perfect fit for my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XWGS1G">Full Circle FC11301 Fresh Air Kitchen Compost Collector</a>, but will fit most countertop or undercounter compost buckets.<br /><br />I've found that very wet food scraps cause the bags to start seeping after a couple of days so the drier the food scraps, the better. I normally change a bag every 3-4 days.<br /><br />The current Prime deal, at 21 cents per bag, is very good (even cheaper with Subscribe and Save).<br /><br />TIP: Chickens will lay eggs with beautiful and nutritious dark yolks throughout the winter, when grass and insects are not available to them, if fed vegetable and fruit peelings. If you know someone who keeps chickens in their backyard, they'll greatly appreciate it if you saved the contents of your compost collector for their birds (the compost baggies store nicely and out of the way in the freezer for a few days).<br /> Comment

review/summary: Makes composting easy and mess free
review/text: I have found these bags to be quite utile.  I use them in a Sterilite 10 Qt bucket, and they are the perfect size to line the bucket, with an extra bit at the top to wrap over the edge to keep the bags from slipping down.  The great thing about using a bucket, is that I fill it to almost the top, and then knot the top of the bag by tying each side of the bag to it's opposite side using 4 sides.  It's a contained unit then, and then I carry the whole bucket by it's handle out to the curbside compost bin, and dump the bag in.  No muss, no fuss.  I have only ever had to clean out the bucket about 3 times in the 7 months I have been doing this.  Otherwise I have had no quality issues with the bags.  But then, I'm not asking the bags to carry the weight of their contents without breaking either, I'm letting the bucket do that job for it.  If you use these the way I do, you'll have no problems with having to clean extra, or ripping bags.

review/text: My friend has gotten cheaper bags that tear when you try to separate them from each other, no matter how carefully you tear them apart.  These bags do not have that problem.  You tear one off, put it in your household bin, then take it out to the garden when full.  I don't knot mine, just leave them open to let composting begin quickly.  The bag itself takes a little longer than the food products to decay, but for the ease of use I'm OK with that.

review/summary: These have improved a lot.
review/text: We've been getting these BioBags for quite a while as small trash can liners.  In the beginning, they weren't very sturdy and came in a roll.  When we tore them apart, even if we were careful, sometimes at least one of the two bags we were trying to separate would tear to the point that it couldn't be used.  Now the bags are much stronger and come separated.<br />I haven't used BioBags for compost since they've been stronger, so I don't know if they still break down as fast as they did, but in the past I've used them in compost and seen them break down more quickly than some foods.  It's a good idea to change the bag relatively frequently if you're using it for anything very moist.  Another note:  messes involving vomit should not be placed into BioBags, because apparently the stomach acid cuts right through them, resulting in an even worse mess.<br />I really love these bags and the improvements to them over time.

review/summary: Great Compostable Bags
review/text: I love having these bags in my kitchen.  They hold a lot of kitchen waste and are plenty durable.<br /><br />They do weep some moisture if they are in another container, but it doesn't really seem to be a big deal.  They also don't contain all of the smells.  Some onion smell can escape.  Personally, I don't think it's that big of a deal.  If I've got smelly stuff and don't want to deal with it, the bag goes right into the compost/yard waste bin.<br /><br />Many other types of bags are not actually compostable.  They might start breaking down before then next millennium, but won't break down before you'd want to use your compost or the city would want to use the composted yard waste.  Don't be fooled.<br /><br />Buy these in the Amazon 4-pack and they are a great deal.  And they are so much easier to deal with than a kitchen compost canister.  :)

After just a week of composting we found that a good amount of our waste now qualified to be composted and since then we have gone down to only needing a 11 gallon can per week, down from a 32 gallon! The only additional expense was the need to buy these bags, as only certain ones were approved in our area. (Remember there is a difference in Degradeable bags and Compostable bags) After looking at the local stores and being surprised at the prices, I was happy to find them here on Amazon for less and on the Subscribe & Save program. We have found that we go through 4-5 per week on average, so these should last a couple months before we'll need our next delivery.

review/summary: great alternative to plastic garbage bags!
review/text: We use the 3-gallon Biobags in place of plastic garbage bags for kitchen, bathroom, etc.  They are a little more delicate than plastic bags, but not a problem.<br /><br />(We used to use the plastic bags from food shopping, but now use reusable bags for that purpose.)<br /><br />We love the Biobags & give them 5 stars!  We order enough at a time to get free shipping, & that comes to 16 cents a bag.  It feels good to be cutting down on plastic.

review/summary: BioBag Compostable Food Waste Bags Killer Deal @ Amazon!
review/text: If you are into composting, then this is the deal for you! Buy in bulk---100 bags (4 25-packs)--and save on a quality product. I bought a countertop composting bin, which came with 3 bags from a different manufacturer, and when it was time to order more I got sticker shock! Then I went online, and found the best deal on Amazon. This amounts to about 2 years worth of bags for my family, so I keep the currently open box with unused bags in the freezer so they won't biodegrade prematurely. They fit better than the original bags that came with the composter, and seem to be better made. Great deal!

review/summary: Weak
review/text: Sadly these bags are not strong enough to do the job. I've tried to double them up but that becomes a pain in the keester and is expensive to boot. The company says the seam construction at the bottom increases the strength but unfortunately the material itself just doesn't hold up to any normal handling. I found the packaging extremely poor as well. I would have expected a roll of bags that are self-dispensing as most trash bags are. These are essentially a wad of bags that you need to stuff back in the box when you're done picking them up off the floor while trying to get one bag out of the clump. I'm not sure what the company was thinking...saving a few cents per box I expect. I can't recommend these.

review/summary: Great compostable bag!
review/text: Really like this product.  Very good price.  We use them for compost scraps or storage of fresh vegetables.  We are able to reuse them even after they've contained compost scraps.  This sounds kind of yucky but we only do this if the compost isn't full of liquidy things to begin with.  The bags are very thin but hold up really well (to the aforementioned reusing of them.) Moreover, they hold ALOT of stuff and do not break during that tiny hike out to the compost pile.  (Worth noting: I have taken them along camping for  various uses as well but not reused;)

review/summary: composter bags
review/text: I'm trying out these little bags. They have a ever so slight odor, so I read more about them other than they are made in the USA--I found that they are made of corn, so maybe that is the smell. So far I'm using 2/week because I haven't experienced how much they will hold or for how long. I'm using these bags with the FULL CIRCLE COOL EARTH FRESH AIR KITCHEN COMPOSTER COLLECTOR, which I like. The free sample of bags that came w/this composter tore as I unrolled them & more so when I attempted to separate them. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3DWWQ">BioBag Compostable Waste Bags, 3 Gallon - 25 count per box</a>

review/text: We put this bag to the test on our first use stuffing it full as well as plenty of waste that was full of liquid. The bag was packed so full I had to pull on the bag when taking it out of the kitchen compost container that it stretched sort of like latex but did not tear or leak. The bag is a thin walled bag and I am hopeful that it will compost quicker than other bags I have tried.

review/summary: Nice bags
review/text: Nice bags, usually no leaks (but not always). I've found that putting anything hot in the bag (coffee grounds, hot tea bags, etc) will pretty much guarantee a leak. Leaving lots of liquid in the bag for more than a day also seems to cause leaks. But if I work around those constraints, they don't usually have any problems with leaks. The bags are pretty lightweight and flimsy, so I usually keep the bag in the compost container when I take it down to the compost bin, then transfer the bag to the bin.<br /><br />Since I don't compost myself (my city has a municipal composting program), I can't say how well they compost.

review/text: While not as strong as traditional (and environmentally unsound) plastic bags, these do the trick as long as you don't overload them. In my compost heaps, they tend to take one season to break down, though for heaps that get very very hot, they may break down quicker (mine rely more on vermicomposting). the newer design tends to make them go into the pails we use to collect scraps better and also makes them a bit stronger for when we remove them.

They make it easier to clean the kitchen pail each week after dumping.  So, I stocked up on the BioBags by ordering a 4 pack in July.  The trouble is, we just finished the first box of these and found the next three boxes of bags are DEFECTIVE with a slice right down the length of the bag!  This makes them unusable.  Nearly $20 for one box of compostable bags is outrageous.  Now we are past the date to return these and seem to have no recourse.  I am extremely disappointed and will feel wary of ordering items like this in bulk again from Amazon.

review/text: We thought we were doing a good thing by going green with our garbage bags, and unfortunately, these don't work.  They tear SO easily, the only way to avoid a tear is if you filled it only with laundry lint or something equally weightless.  Almost every single time I have pulled this bag out of my garbage can to take it out to the trash, it has ripped.  Then, if I do ever manage to get it out of the can in one piece, it then rips when I try to tie the top in a knot.  Great concept, poor execution.

While being environmentally friendly is important, a product first needs to serve its primary function, in this case, storing garbage.

review/summary: Package wasn't received, and both UPS and Amazon said it was the other's problem
review/text: I have given my dogs these dental treats before and they are very popular with them. The package I found on Amazon was a good price for the large quantity ordered. Since now I have paid the money and never received the item, and basically have found no direct route of getting refunded, I am not happy. I will be reluctant to purchase from Amazon again because there was no way for me to get hold of them for a reimbursement. I contacted UPS and they said Amazon likes to handle these things directly. And from looking all through Amazon's website, it says to contact UPS directly. And when I try to put in for a refund, the product not arriving is never an option---and there is no phone number or way to email otherwise. I guess I am out $30 for this purchase. I am disappointed in both Amazon and UPS for their service. I think if the product arrived, I would have likely been happy with it.

review/summary: Count in description is wrong.
review/text: What's there to review about the gum.  It's chiclets, you know what you're getting. The reason for the 3 star review is that the item count is wrong.  The title is 6 count, 60 packs (pack of 14), and the description says it is 5040 pieces which it is not.  You actually get 14 packs of 6 boxes with each box containing 10 pieces of gum.  This gets you a net total of 840 pieces of gum. You actually only get 1/6th of the advertised amount. Disappointing.

review/summary: Chiclets lovers unite
review/text: Not much to say about the gum. It came in fast and fresh (over a year left before expiry). I happen to be a Chiclets fanatic so there is no way it is going to last that long though. I did however want to clarify the amount since I was a little confused by the description. These come as a package with two cases of hang bags. Each case has 7 bags, and each bag has 6 boxes of Chiclets. Obviously there are the standard 10 pieces per box. So this order comes with a total of 84 boxes of Chiclets. In other words, this is a good amount of gum for the price.

review/summary: most popular at DeliveryDesk in my office.
review/text: Good product!<br /><br />Good presentation.  Not crazy about the ">$1" price per package ... but if you don't have access to one of the few stores which sell the Chiclets packages right now, this Amazon price will do.  (Fancy brands in grocery stores are $3.50, where these are $1.00.)  (So far, I find at Dollar Tree, and Big Lots.) I had hoped for more flavors among the return of Chiclets; but it seems only the two... Fruit and the Peppermint.  I confess I'd not remembered the gum lately.  But, when the new (expensive!) plastic tubs of gum in loose pieces became popular -- it reminded me of Chiclets.<br /><br />The cross-section population who comes and goes at my office via the Delivery Door where I sit, has chosen its favorite-- CHICLETS, FRUIT Flavor, even more-often than the intense mint options.  I'm thankful, as it saves me a lot of money while I keep all manner of visitors happy.  "I'm doing some things right:  the gum helps to keep our office on the good-list with every brand of couriers!"  I deposit the chiclets into one of those tubs for distribution.  Each gum is not individually wrapped (like are my other favorite, Life Savers) but the "pour" method for the gum, still helps to reduce the degree of germ-sharing.

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!

Its the right amount of food to hold you over and let you feel satisfied. The taste is good and can always be gussied up with a bit or parm and black pepper or other seasonings. This is my go to diet snack that lets me feel like I'm cheating a little bit. Didn't buy from Amazon but right now there are B1G1 at Sweetbay and I took advantage and upped my inventory. The kettle corn is also great. Trust me, I've tried almost every diet snack out there. This is the most bang for your buck and waistline that you are gonna get.

My husband told me to find it and never let us run out. :) We go through hot sauce like most people do ketchup so this will be a new staple at my house.<br /><br />The flavors work really well together. It's not too spice (though we like that too) but has just the right amount to go with the sweet.<br /><br />Thanks Tabasco for bringing us a new favorite. We will buy it in bulk and share with our friends (well maybe!!).
