review/text: great chews. Dogs love the flavor so they keep on CHEWING. we have 3 shelties and they love the taste. they usually snub other chews. The chews also keep the tartar on their teeth to a minimum. not your typical chew. worth the cost. will save you on having your dogs teeth professionally cleaned.

review/summary: Not all EXTRA Large but all EXTRA good...so say my dogs.
review/text: I agree that there's a problem with the chews not all being equal size.  But in our family, that's not a problem.  All bags of chews, no matter the brand, seem to have this issue...thick and thin together...but we just use it to our advantage.  We have 2 dogs: the one we raised from a pup likes a big, thick chew, the other is older and a rescue, and though we take him to the dentist regularly, his teeth are just very sensitive so the smaller chews work out great for him.  The ones in the middle they share equally.<br /><br />Another thing, each chew is coated differently.  The smaller more wrinkled up chews have more of it than the thicker chews which have a smoother surface.  But our boys don't seem to notice these small differences and we're happy as long as they're happy.  In fact, one of the best parts of our evening is watching them settle down beside each other, each with their respective CET chew, engaged in knawing away the time.<br /><br />Is CET messing with the consumer by not correctly sizing their chews 100%?  I dunno.  But they are without a doubt the favorite treat in this household and we'll keep buying them here since we can't find a better price elsewhere!

review/summary: my dogs love them
review/text: I would definitely reccomend these for your dog.  My dogs love their taste and think they're getting a treat when they get these.  I also save money by buying the biggest size and cutting them in half.<br /><br />Here's our tale.  My dog Babe is 11 yrs old.  3 years ago at her annual check-up the vet reccomended we have her teeth cleaned (this means anesthesia).  We were busy so we scheduled her appointment 2 months out. The new dog foods with teeth brushing had just come out in our area so we switched her to one.  When we took her in for the teeth cleaning, the vet said she didn't need it.  Yeah!  Then last year we took our new dog Hercules to the vet and she showed us the CET Hextra chews.  Which my dog treated like the best thing he'd ever seen.  So I went home and ordered some.  Amazon had the best deal I could find by far.  6 months later after daily use of the chews.  Babe went in for her annual again and the vet said her teeth looked like those of a 1 yr old dog.  They even brought other people in the clinic in to see her teeth.  They said whatever we were doing to keep it up.

My dogs love them but they can finish this new thickness (or thinness I should say) in no time flat.<br /><br />The reason that it is very noticeable to me is because I buy the extra-large for the thickness & cut them in half (with pruning shears) for my two Aussies. The bag I got today, I could almost cut them in half with kitchen scissors.<br /><br />I hope that I just got a bad batch & that the future batches will be the usual thickness of the past.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />*** Update:  It has been at least a month since my first review when I wrote that I e-mailed the Virbac company about the the decrease in size of the Extra-Large chews.<br /><br />I have NOT heard a word from them.

review/summary: Sent these back
review/text: I took a chance and ordered these even though I couldn't find out where they were manufactured. I only by Made in the USA products for my dog because items made in Mexico and other countries sometimes use arsenic as a preservative even though that is not disclosed on the ingredients. Treats made in the USA are subject to stricter rules and do not contain that preservative. I tried to see the back of the bag or read where the items were made or processed, so I took a chance and ordered them. That should have been my clue.  I received the item and found out these are made in Mexico, so I returned them. From now on I will not order anything unless I find that this information is included in the product description. I share this as a heads up to other consumers. Talk to your vet, do some research, make up your own mind. And the next time you go to the store to buy treats for your pups, take a look at the label, you'll be surprised how many are made outside the USA.

In fact, she usually will not eat in the morning until we give her one of these chews.  Her teeth are nice and white.<br /><br />They do not splinter and do not make a mess.  The only negative is that she holds them between her paws and they leave a light brown discoloration on her white fur.  It does wash (or lick) right off.  I would not let your dog have them on a light colored carpet.<br /><br />Great product at a reasonable price if you shop around a little on line.

review/summary: Great Chews but product contained in bag not as promised
review/text: C.E.T. chews are the only chews sticks that I give to our sporting breed. They are excellent and safe for your pup. The plus to ordering from Amazon is the price--$24.95 and free shipping versus the $38+ and $39+ price on the exact bag from our vet and another local retailer/vet. However, after ordering over a dozen bags through Amazon, I am very unsatisfied because the 30 count bag of of XL chews for a 51 lb+ dog are very inconsistent in size and thickness. If I wanted puny little chews for my 65lb dog, then I could save a ton of money by ordering these Virbac C.E.T. chews in much smaller sizes. I don't want to see skimpy pieces of chews in a bag labeled XL. Amazon customer service recently refunded my last bag but I had 3 in that order. If they are packing these XL chews as less than 1st quality and discounting because of that, then it needs to be clearly noted in the Amazon product description. Otherwise, fill the bag with the XL chews as labeled!

review/summary: Just messy coated rawhide - would not buy again.
review/text: I purchased based on reviews here and elsewhere about all the wonderful things these chews accomplished on dogs teeth and the price per unit was so much less than the "Greenies" I have been using. Upon receipt I immediately noticed that these are just large rawhide strips with a coating on them. They are not even particularly thick rawhide. Rawhide in any form is very dangerous and you must monitor your dog very closely when they are chewing on these. My Great Dane is not a "swallow whole" kind of eater - he tries to chew up even the tiniest training treats before swallowing them, BUT with rawhide strips like these he will chew on the whole piece until it eventually becomes soft, then swallow it. Whole. Then choke it back up, chew some more and swallow it whole again. Repeat until it goes down and stays down. This is not healthy and not very safe and I always have to be poised to remove the offending chunk of soft wet rawhide from his throat as he gags it up. He does love these chews but I have not seen any wonderful changes in his teeth so far with 2 weeks of daily use so it will not be worth the trouble or risk of choking for me to buy more once this bag is gone. I now wish I had gotten the smaller quantity bag so I could be done with these sooner!<br />Edited to add that I finally finished the whole bag and still didnt see any big changes to his teeth or gums. Also, the coating comes off on his white legs and my carpet and they make his breath smell weird (not fresh, kind of medicine like). I will never buy these again.

review/text: I've been using these for almost a month now and just ordered some more.  I have two labs so I split one between the two of them every day.  They LOVE them.  Ok, they love any treat, but seem really excited by these.  One lab already has good teeth, the other does not.  Plaque covered the surface of all of her back teeth.  While the plaque is not 100% gone, it is greatly improved, probably about 75% of it has been removed.  I'm hopeful that with continued use, it will get even better.  Also, this product does not give my dogs intestinal "issues" as other rawhide treats have done in the past.  Only downside is that these chews are not consistently the same size or thickness.  Great product, I am hopeful to spread out dental cleanings more as they are pricey and require the dog to be put under.

review/summary: Great results but they stink
review/text: We originally purchased these chews from our veterinarian. Decided to order them here from Amazon because of the reduced cost and lack of shipping temperature restrictions on the product. We get complimented on the whiteness of our dogs' "smiles" all the time. Our vet is happy and so am I because I don't have to brush their teeth a lot! You definitely want to wash your hands after handling the chews because they have a peculiar odor.  Now if someone can figure out how to ship heart worm prevention without it getting too hot, I'd be ecstatic!

review/summary: Really Cleans Teeth
review/text: I have a golden retriever and a golden/chow mix who was rescued around age 11.  When the rescue group took him to his in-take visit at the vet, they saw that his teeth were in horrible condition and he even lost a tooth on the spot.  When he first came to live with us, his breath could have killed a gorilla.  I first saw these at his vet and bought a bag to try.  After almost 2 yrs of eating these a few nights a week his breath is almost normal and his gum disease and teeth have greatly improved. My golden's vet always comments on how great her teeth look for a 10 yr old.  I highly recommend and Amazon does have the best price around.

review/summary: thickness consistency problem resolved
review/text: Since reporting a problem with the thickness consistency, i.e. some (quite a few actually) chews were very thin, they resolved the problem. I ordered extra large for my 70 pound dog and wanted something she could get her teeth into. My dog loves them and they do a great job keeping her teeth and breath clean and pleasent. The quality is now very good again.

review/summary: Very good, but room for improvement.
review/text: I have been buying these for quite some time now - they were recommended by our vet, and our dog simply loves them. They do a fine job of keeping her teeth clean, occupying her while we eat dinner, and best of all they don't seem to have any ill effects on her digestive tract (which is always a concern of mine with rawhide products). They seem well-made and thoughtfully produced. My sole gripe is, as others have mentioned, the uniformity of their size. Our puppy is only 50lbs, but I've found myself having to order the XL size package to ensure the bulk of the package is reasonably sized chews. I originally ordered the normal size package, but the ratio of S:M:L chews was definitely skewed in favor of S:M. Even with the XL size package, where the ratio is skewed M:L, we still get a number of very small chews - chews so small our dog can swallow them nearly whole after just a few minutes of chewing. This creates a serious choking hazard, and I sometimes find myself just throwing these tiny ones away. Obviously the size issue hasn't stopped me from buying the product (I'm very happy with it), but to earn a 5-star review some better size control would be required.

review/summary: dogs love it
review/text: i have two medium sized mutts and buy the extra-large chews to cut up into smaller pieces (some can be cut with scissors but some are too thick and must be sawed). the dogs love them and they each get a piece as their nighttime snack. they still do get plaque and tartar but i imagine without these chews the buildup would be much faster. also, one of my dogs eats these a little too eagerly and tends to choke a little on them, but she is always able to get it back up to chew it more, so this does not worry me too much.

review/text: Our dogs have been using this product for about a year now.  We use to buy them from our vet until they didn't have the large size one month and I check Amazon and I've been ordering them from Amazon ever since (cheaper too).  The vet had been after me to have the dogs teeth cleaned but now marvels at how clean my 10 year old Fox Terrier's teeth have become... and our two year old golden retriever's are the same.  Give them one a day (the large size cut in half) in the morning after they eat.

review/summary: Can't Get Enough of Them
review/text: My Great Dane, Daisy, absolutely loves these chews. When she hears the bag opening, she knows her treat is waiting for her. She just grabs it out of my hand and runs off. I like that it helps to clean her teeth since she's prone to tartar buildup. Believe me, I'd love to brush them, but she won't let me anywhere near her mouth (might have something to do with her being a rescue). At any rate, I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their dog to have nice, clean teeth and fresh breath.

It is rather pricey but it still beats getting a dental cleaning from the vet.

review/text: I have three fairly big dogs -- 50 to 65 pounds -- who all love to chew. They love these chips and they last long enough to give them a good chew. They have a little bit of an odor, but it's not unpleasant and it doesn't linger. They also don't leave stains on the carpet. The price is great compared to similar chips for retail outlets. I marked them down one star because you do get a few in every bag that are not as hefty as the rest.

review/summary: Caution - Choking problem
review/text: If your dog chews these up into tiny pieces, they're probably good treats for him/her.  Our Golden Retriever chews them down to two inch or larger pieces that she tries to swallow.  They get caught in her throat choking her and we have to get our fingers down her throat past the piece to pull it out, very abusive for the dog.  If we don't catch the problem when she first starts to choke, it could be fatal.<br /><br />We've stopped giving her these treats.

review/text: We've ordered these before and had no problem. This time however, with the second treat, my boxer mix almost choked to death. I pulled the small chunk out of his mouth. Later on at night, he hacked up and vomited another small piece along with his two earlier meals of the day. The piece was still super hard. It seems that they fragment easier than before after a bit of chewing. Will not be ordering again and will be returning my bag as the choking risk is not worth it. There are other and better chews out there. For those of you that feed this to your dogs, please watch carefully as they might try to eat the small fragmented pieces!

review/summary: 11 year old Black Lab loves them
review/text: I have tried several other brands of dental chews for my 11 year old black lab, Bonnie.  She "inhales" most other dental chews thus defeating their purpose.  I bought the extra lg C.E.T. Hextra and she loves them!  I cut them in half so I get 2 months from the 30 count package.  It takes her about 10 minutes of chewing before finally devouring  and after 2 weeks, there is a noticeable improvement in her teeth and gums.  I do watch her to assure she doesn't try to swallow whole pieces but, so far, it hasn't been a problem.  I will be ordering more from Amazon as this packages dwindles.  I have recommended this product to friends who have old and young large dogs and have received postive feedback from all. Now if I could find something similar for this old human's use.

If your dogs are small (12-lbs and under) I'd recommend the "petite" size because they are made from "pressed" hide and are easier for them to digest.  My dog is 75-lbs and she needs the Extra Large ones.  We've been huge fans of HEXtra Chews for several years.  Do you and your dog a favor and keep them on hand!

review/text: We've been giving these chews to our dobies for at least the last four years.  Our (now) older dog had a dental cleaning and we started giving these chews about a week later.  The vet has never recommended a cleaning since.  We have a new pup (almost two years old now) and he still has super-model teeth thanks to these chews.  They do seem expensive, but I have struggled to find a chew that is this effective for a lower cost.  We give the dogs a chew every night because they won't leave us alone until they get one.  I do agree with the comments in one review about the bag containing various sizes and thicknesses, but after purchasing so many bags over time I feel like it all has averaged out (some bags do have large, thick chews and no smaller chews mixed in).

review/summary: BEWARE!!! GAVE MY DOG BAD DIARRHEA TIME AND TIME AGAIN....
review/text: We bought these hoping they would be treats that lasted long and be good for the dog's teeth. I have a golden retriever that has NEVER had any sort of stomach issue. Anway after the second time giving my dog this chew she developed bad diarrhea and had to be taken out multiple times during the night which was a first. We didn't know what was wrong so put her on boiled chicken, rice, and pumpkin diet. Things firmed up after a day so we thought everything was better. Fast forward a few days and since we felt her stomach was better we gave her another one. What do you know? Diarrhea all through the night again! We went back to the chicken and rice diet till things firmed up. A week later we decided to give her another one. We had not yet put 2 and 2 together, we thought maybe there was some lingering issue and that is why her diarrhea had come back the 2nd time. Well after a week of solid poo we gave her another and just like that, diarrhea through the night again. We finally figured out it was the chews and we will no longer be giving our dogs these. We will be requesting a refund from the company.

We have never had a problem with our dogs with these dental chews before, so it makes me question the recent quality.  It is possible that these came from  a bad batch as the company manufactures these in MEXICO.  Buyer beware.

My dog's vet also agreed and was much surprised.<br /><br />I am continuing to give this to my 100 lbs lab who happily chews this down. This is now the only dental product my dog will get.

review/summary: even my vet says my dogs teeth are clean!
review/text: We started using these about 4 years ago. The last time we took our dog in, the vet kept saying his teeth are really clean and is no longer asking us to get his teeth cleaned every time we take him in. My dog loves them and eats them for "dessert" each night :>)

review/summary: Yum-Yum
review/text: I buy these for my 100 pound Rhodesian/Lab mix who is a diabetic as well as my 60 pound pitt bull mix. They each get one every evening after my diabetic dog has had his shot as an alternative to the expensive teeth cleaning my vet recommended. By the way, my vet also recommended these chews. They are much cheaper on Amazon.com than at the vet's by far. The dogs really enjoy them and look forward to them every evening. I have noticed less tartar on their teeth as well as fresher breath.  Because I have large dogs, I buy the x-large size; however, the strips do not all come x-large. I get an assortment of small, medium, and large. The dogs do fine with the larger ones, but I find I have to watch the Rhodesian/Lab closely as he will tend to get choked on the smaller ones. This is also a disappointment to the dogs when one evening they get a chew that may last up to thirty minutes, and the next evening they get one that lasts five or ten minutes.

review/summary: I can't beleive my dog actually loves these things!
review/text: Our Saint Bernard is 4 yrs. old and has always turned his nose up to rawhide or similar type chews.  Trying to brush his teeth is always a challenge.  A woman at the vets office (who had the same issues with her dogs), told me her dogs really enjoy these HEXtra chews.  She was absolutely right, they're great.  Our Saint loves 'em!  Not only do they keep him busy for awhile, but they actually do help keep his teeth clean . . . without fighting to brush them!  Whatever taste they have, it sure gets his attention.  An excellent product for maintaining your dogs oral hygiene.

review/summary: Intestinal problems
review/text: I got this product hoping that my dog will have something good to chew every day. But 15 min (if not less) after eating the chew, my dog had a diarrhea. Amazing! Never seen anything work so fast in that direction. So I had to take him out for a walk every 30 min that night. It was that bad! I thought I will send the product back, but started to read reviews. Found one saying that you should give this chew after the meal. Next time I gave my dog Kong stuffed with his regular food, and then half of the chew, and then more food in Kong. 15 min went ok, and he did not have to run outside. Later same day I did it again - food-chew-food, and he was fine. And I have to mention that he is a big boy and never had problems with his stomach before. And he eats different things.<br />Two things I can summarize - watch your dog during and after you give the chew, and give some food either before or right after the chew is gone.

review/summary: The Best Bones I've used for years for our dogs
review/text: I haven't written reviews, only 1 or 2.  Now is the time people should know how I feel about these C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Bones.<br />Our Vet, who sells those C.E.T. Bones, I tried one pack, but relized after seeing how good they are, I checked Amazon, and sure enough, they sold them, and at a better price.<br /><br />Our Vet said when dogs reach 4 to 5 years old, regular rawhide does grind/chip their back teeth. That worrid me, but Vet said they're not bad, and introducted me to C.E.T. bones.  Dogs have been on them for long time now, and I continue, oftened, to buy C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral... chews.<br /><br />And when so much time passed, and recently Vet both dogs teeth, the older dog, her teeth are the same, they arn't worse.  That to me is GREAT.  Now I order from whoever has the better prices for C.E.T. chews.  (NOTE:-I would check, though, make sure if you want to try these, make sure if you order $25.00 or over, that there's NO POSTAGE, some are 3rd parties, some 3rd parties offer free postage.  Just letting all the Dog lovers know this.)<br /><br />We've been using these Chews for so long, and when it's time to give each of them one, all I say is "how about a 'Chewy Bone'....WOW, no matter where they are in the house, they come a running, right to the closet in kitchen where I store them.  They also, when I open the pantry, they run to other room, next to kitchen, and sit and wait, while their tails wag alot.  That, at least to me, tells me they really like them.<br /><br />So for anyone out there who wants to know what I think.....I think these C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral ARE THE BEST, and I would NOT recommend any other chewy bones, especially rawhide, or any other hard bone.<br /><br />If this previous isn't enough to convince you, I don't know what else to say, other than "Maybe you should at least try 1 bag, even if you pay postage.  I bet after that 1 bag, depending on size, which I buy the 30 extra large, which is much better price, they have small, medium, the right sizes for any dogs.<br /><br />That's about it. If anyone wants to ask me questions, feel free to write/ask. I'll be happy to answer any questions.

review/summary: CET HEXtra
review/text: These chews are very helpful in keeping our puppy's teeth clean. We cut them in thirds and give him a third at a time, because he's such a fast chewer.<br /><br />Fortunately, they appear to be digestible, and he has not choked or gotten sick from them, unlike our other dog who had major issues with the Greenies brand.<br /><br />The only draw back is that although we buy the extra-large chews, sometimes there are thin ones in the bunch. (Our puppy needs the thicker chews because he's such a strong chewer.)<br /><br />I would give them a five star rating if they were all thick. But for the most part, they mostly contain the extra large size in the package.

review/text: Our golden retriever LOVES these!!  We've tried other dental treats/chews in the past without luck.  I took our dog to the vet to have her check out his teeth, and she gave us a sample of these to try.  Our dog practically ripped it out of my hands when I held it out for him to smell.  We give him one of these every other day, and his gums and teeth look AMAZING!  I'm really excited that he has a treat he loves that's also good for his dental hygiene.  I recommend this product to everyone with a dog!!

review/text: I have used this product for my Vizsla since he was a puppy. At the age of 6 1/2 because of this product he has very white and clean teeth without being brushed. This is also a special treat as whenever he is left home alone he gets a chew.  He senses when we are leaving and will stand by his treat table waiting for his chew.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Soo Good for Your Dog's Teeth
review/text: These chews are soo good for your dog's teeth, and most dogs will love them! My 58 lb. Blue Tick Coon Hound would eat them like candy, if we let her! But the limit is usually one per day (in this household).<br />I also work with a Veterinarian, and he says these are the next best thing to brushing your dog's teeth every day. Which sounds good tto clean off their teeth.<br />So if you want to keep your dog's teeth clean, and don't particularly brush them regularly (I don't-and I work with a Vet), these are a great alternative!!o me! He recommends feeding your dog "dinner" or a meal, then giving your dog one of these a little bit afterwards

review/summary: Organic? Not certified.
review/text: I am not convinced this product is organic and will therefore not buy it again. The packaging on this product leaves me wondering how organic "Healthyway Organic Goji Berry" really is. There is no independent verification authority to confirm that this product is really organic. As far as I can tell, it is not certified organic by any authority other than the supplier and distributor. The 'Nutrition Facts" on the label have some strange entries like "Quantity of Heat" and "Thick Protein" which I do not understand. They sound like direct translations of Chinese to English. It is a "Product of China" as are most goji berries I have seen. My concern at a time when there is so much bad publicity related to food products coming out of China is that this product may be "organic" in name only and not in fact.

I bought the organic version at harris teeter which is a grocery store chain for four ninety nine. The juice is not real sweet, almost like eating a mouthful of pitted bing cherries without having to chew. I also add it to a lot of things for flavor and color swirls, namely Oetker's organic vanilla pudding, yellow cake mix, white frosting, pancake mix, and lemon poppy-seed muffins. Thus far Amazon has the best prices on Oetker products for my area. This juice is also very good to freeze as popsicles. I've thought about making a sorbet, but haven't yet.

review/text: Perfect for anyone who wants to keep gout at bay. It tastes good too, not sweet at all. If only i could afford to buy it on a regular basis. By regular basis i mean more than one case a month. If your wallet (or purse) allows it, by all means buy it.

review/text: Great tasting Cherry Juice! Packaged well and shipped promptly. Each bottle in its own foam pocket. What's not to like?! Try it, you'll like it, I did.

review/summary: BEWARE - OVERPRICED ON AMAZON !
review/text: I bought this juice from Amazon just last month and went around local supermarkets looking for it and Harris Teeter has it for only $5 a bottle and Amazon's charging $8 for one!! That's highway robbery. They should really correct the pricing. The juice itself I find no fault and taste great. Always shop around, not everything on Amazon is a bargain!
