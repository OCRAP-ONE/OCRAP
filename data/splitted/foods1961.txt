review/summary: Ginger bits with kick
review/text: Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps, are crisp rounds with candied bits of ginger that have some kick. Addictive chews that keep you going back for more. My wife likes them a lot, very spicy--probably the spiciest cookies she has tasted.

review/summary: Cool cookie
review/text: My family and I love gingersnaps, so we were excited to get to review this new cookie made by the Paul Newman company Newman's Own.  Overall it is an excellent cookie, a snack for cool, crisp fall days spent outdoors on a rocking chair or a porch swing.<br /><br />This cookie is organic, made with organic flour and organic sugar.  The ginger taste is powerful, and candied ginger is used (instead of powdered) for the key ginger ingredient.<br /><br />I used this cookie as a snack in my children's lunch boxes for school, and as a snack for my husband at work.  I ate them at home with regular coffee, which in my opinion emphasized the strong ginger flavor.<br /><br />In summary: Newman's Own organic gingersnap cookie is a very good, somewhat healthy cookie that will appeal to people who enjoy organic products

review/summary: Great ginger snaps
review/text: These cookies delivered a smooth ginger flavor without the peppery aftertaste.  They are small cookies, and it would be easy to eat through a package in one sitting.  I enjoyed them with tea, but the flavor would go well with milk or coffee as well.  I would recommend these for the cookie lover.

review/summary: Tasty Old-Fashioned treat
review/text: These cookies are small, hard and very crunchy.  Nice ginger flavor with pleasant "afterburn" in the back of the throat.  I like the texture but I'm not too fond of the small bits of candied ginger that are mixed into the cookies - they have a toffe-like consistency and they tend to get stuck in my teeth.  Other than that, these cookies are good, and it always feels nice to enjoy a snack made with natural ingredients.  The only way these could be better is if I made them myself (without ginger chunks in 'em.)

review/summary: Taste homemade, with a strong ginger-y taste
review/text: Many products which taste mass produced and are full of artificial ingredients bill themselves as tasting "homemade", and while there's no way to know if these "Family Recipe Cookies" are prepared based on a recipe from the Newmans or any other family, they are delicious.  The strong taste of ginger will make these a "natural" for the cookie crust of my next pie, and their lack of animal products make them acceptable for vegans.  (They are designated kosher-dairy, no doubt because they're produced in a facility where other items produced contain milk products.)

review/summary: Quite interesting, very gingery and crisp
review/text: I like ginger snaps, but these are *GINGER* snaps, definite stress on the ginger. The cookies contain both candied and powdered ginger, but no cinnamon or nutmeg - it they do, then they fall into the category of "spices," which is found at the end of the list of ingredients.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are quite interesting, very gingery and crisp. Children will probably find them a bit overwhelming, but adults will find their taste interesting. I find they go well with coffee or tea, or a nice flavorful schnapps.<br /><br />(Review of Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies)

review/summary: Newman's Own Ginger Snaps
review/text: This is a little hard to bite ginger snap, but if you dip it in milk or coffee then you may get to enjoy this stuff. The manufacturer claims that this is a Vegan cookie with no artificial flavor or no trans-fatty acids, but I think this is a product of Mother Nature. On the positive side, ginger is known to decrease pain from arthritis. It may also have cholesterol lowering properties. Preliminary research also indicates that ginger may have positive effect on anxiety.<br /><br />Actor Paul Newman founded this line of food products, Newman's Own, and he established a policy that all proceeds, after taxes, would be donated to charity. One beneficiary of his philanthropy is the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a residential summer camp for seriously ill children, which is located in Ashford, Connecticut.<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPP588">Mi-Del, Swedish Style Ginger Snaps, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XUGGLA">Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Cookies, 6.75-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a><br />3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XUGGLA">Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Cookies, 6.75-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: All-natural cookies for real ginger lovers.
review/text: I adore ginger snaps, and I think that most all of Newman's Own products are excellent.  The company uses top quality ingredients, nothing artificial, and they donate most (all?) of the profits to various charities.<br /><br />That said, these are excellent cookies IF you love your ginger snaps really (and I mean REALLY) gingery.  These ginger snaps snap back.  I like my ginger snaps just a little sweeter.  But I have to admit that once I got used to the heat that these cookies generated on my tongue, I finished the entire bag in a couple of days.  I liked them best with a glass of milk to take away some of the sting of the ginger -- even dunking helped.  I think these would make a really interesting crust for a vanilla cream pie, also.<br /><br />I will be purchasing them again.  But these are probably not cookies for children, unless they have sophisticated palates.

review/text: I've long been a fan of Newman's Own Organics, and these cookies did not disappoint. In a word, they are delicious. They have just enough sweetness and are a perfect snack. These are also suitable for vegans. One caution: there is a fair amount of sugar per serving. Granted, the sugar is organic cane sugar, but it is still sugar nonetheless. While these aren't health food, they certainly are better than some of the other cookies on the market and fine for an occasional treat.

review/summary: Crunchy, strong on ginger
review/text: In my mind there are two types of ginger snaps...soft and chewy and hard and crunchy.  Just so you are aware, these are the crunchy kind.<br /><br />Like most gingersnaps they're fairly low in calories.  Each cookie is about the diameter of a half dollar and based on the nutrition info (5 cookies = 1 serving = 130 cal) they're about 25 calories each.<br /><br />Gingersnaps also range in the flavors...this one has the molasses defined and some complex spice flavors...ginger is fairly predominate though...a little harsh, but if you like that good enough.<br /><br />Pretty good all in all.  Nothing special - don't know if I'll buy them in the future, but I'm enjoying munching them and when I'm in a gingersnap mood these would certainly fulfill the craving so good enough!

review/text: These are a bit different than your average variety ginger snap.  With actual bits of chewy, candied ginger and strong spice that's zingy with a hint of a bitter aftertaste.  Not unpleasant to me, but I can see where some might not like it.  Personally, I find the complex, strong flavors interesting and tasty.  I like 'em.<br /><br />The cookies are very crisp (hard) so they'll definitely snap!  Great for dipping in hot tea or with ice cream.

review/text: These little cookies are great!  I like to eat less sugar, so many things taste too sweet for me.  These cookies do not - they're perfect for my adult taste buds!  There are tiny pieces of crystallized ginger that you can see in the cookies, which add a really nice real ginger flavor.  These are so wonderful with a mug of steamed cider!<br /><br />They are very crunchy cookies, which I find deeply satisfying.  They are not chewy at all, so if that is what you are looking for, you are in the wrong place.<br /><br />The ingredients are natural and mostly organic, which is great for the planet.<br /><br />The bag is small -- 6.5 ounces -- and the cookies are small at about the size of a half-dollar coin.  But because of the depth of ginger flavor, I am satisfied with four cookies.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: bad flavor and rock hard
review/text: I'm a big fan of most of Newman's products and I appreciate that these cookies are organic, not artificial and don't have any hydorgenated oils, or trans-fatty acids. I don't care that they are vegan however I know some people might be looking for that but I'm just looking for a good ginger snap that's relatively healthy and for that there are far better options. First of all, these cookies are dry and hard as a rock. I know ginger snaps are sometimes crisp but you could chip a tooth on these things. Also the flavor is not my favorite. The ginger flavor is a little strange and they have a very strong orange taste. Overall the flavor of these cookies is just too overpowering. I did not finish the bag and would not buy these again.

review/summary: No mystery ingredients, a nice distinct ginger flavor
review/text: Pleasingly chewy with a strong, distinct ginger flavor, these organic cookies are the rare packaged cookies I'd bother to eat.<br /><br />Organic ingredients with no mystery chemicals, two forms of ginger for a potent ginger flavor.  Fresh out of the bag, they're almost soft, with a great chewy texture.  After sitting out/open for a few hours, the cookies harden to the more familiar "snappy" crunch typical of this kind of cookie.  I prefer the initial chewiness, but they are enjoyable at either texture.<br /><br />I'm a foodie and a home baker, so it's rare for me to find a packaged cookie that doesn't taste stale, artificial, or otherwise inedible.  These Ginger Snaps are the rare exception.  Recommended.

review/summary: Good taste, not-so-good shape
review/text: These are really tasty, lots of ginger and candied ginger, which I like. I like the organic ingredients. I like that there is no corn syrup in these ginger snaps. There is something that keeps them from being 5 star cookies, however, and that is the shape. If they were thin and smooth they would snap satisfyingly. They are stocky and rough, though, and too small. They remind me of dog biscuits - and yes, I did try dog biscuits, when I was very young, so I know whereof I speak. They are simply too hard to be so thick. My teeth worry having to bite so hard, and I don't blame them. The shape was a bad choice. That being said, I ate the whole bag much too quickly and would not say no if they were offered to me again. They are not the perfect snap, but perhaps it is better that way... the quest continues, and with Newman's Own Organic Ginger Snaps we are getting closer.

review/text: I like Newman's Own line of foods and trust their quality. These ginger snaps are crunchier and spicier than your average gingersnap. There are bits of real candied ginger in each cookie which explain the strong burst of flavor in every bite. If you love ginger, you'll love this cookie. I love them. My only complaint is that the cookies taste a bit too sweet for me. There is 130 calories per 5 cookies. Each cookie is the size of a half-dollar coin. You don't need a lot. A small handful delivers quite a treat.

review/summary: Stick to your teeth, but I still enjoyed them
review/text: These cookies have a strong ginger flavor. As best I can tell, this strong flavor comes from little pieces of ginger root inside each cookie. If you chew the cookie, you will find they stick to your teeth, just like taffy. The tiny pieces remind me of a caramel candy that you can whittle away with your teeth till it fully dissolves. (Dentist would probably cry at the thought!) As others mentioned, they are great dunked in milk. At first I wasn't sure if I would repurchase, but by the end of the bag, I decided I wasn't bothered by the little ginger chunks. They actually make the entire cookie last longer~

review/summary: Much better than the average ginger snap
review/text: If you love ginger, as I do, you probably are often disappointed by commercial ginger snap cookies.  Most of them, while promising the bite of ginger, are bland (and often too sweet).  Happily, this is not the case for Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps. The cookies are small and crisp, and the delightful "burn" of real ginger floods your mouth after a few seconds. These also have identifiable chunks of real crystallized ginger which make for a delightful find as you chew.<br /><br />While the "organic" nature is not all that important to me, I did note that the organic ingredients were limited to flour, sugar and palm oil (!).  The ginger itself is not claimed to be organic.<br /><br />My wife and I both found Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps to be among the best non-homemade ginger snaps we had eaten, and the bag's contents quickly disappeared.

review/text: These little gems are decidely adult. A crunchy two to three bite cookie with a ginger punch that nicely lingers "just enough". Bonus: they don't taste commercially made to me. The kids will likely want to leave them alone because they are not overly sweet. That's great because that means there is more left for me! These are a treat alone, lovely with hot tea and likely will form the crust of my holiday pumpkin cheesecake. Five cookies are allocated per serving at 130 calories, with 6 servings per package, they are fairly low in fat and teetering toward low sugar in comparison with other cookies. I will definitely buy these again,

review/summary: "Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps"
review/text: I was eager to try Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snap.  As always, I checked the label first and was pleased.  The serving size of these small (6 gram) cookies is five (30g).  The 6.5 oz package contains about 6 servings.  It is made with 70% + organic ingredients including organic unbleached wheat flour, organic sugar, molasses, organic palm fruit oil, and ground ginger, this product qualifies as "organic." Ginger Snap cookies do not contain artificial flavors, colors, hydrogenated oils, or trans fat.  The recipe contains wheat, soy ingredients and monocalcium phosphate.<br /><br />Nutritionally, Ginger Snap is relatively low per serving in fat (3.5g), saturated fat (1.5g) and average in calories (130).  Per serving of sodium (180mg) and total carbohydrates (24g) are acceptable, but nothing to write home about. Ginger Snap are processed on equipment that may also process products containing peanuts, tree nuts and dairy. I sampled two cookies and found them to be delicious.  Caution:  It is difficult to limit yourself to just one serving.  They taste that good.

review/summary: Definitely ginger snaps
review/text: I never buy Newman's Own due to the price, but I'm glad I got a chance to try these cookies. I'm a medium fan of ginger snaps and I think the hardness of most of these cookies is the main reason. These Newman's are also very hard". Don't eat them with tender or soft teeth!<br /><br />But they do taste strongly of ginger and they were sweet enough for me. I have a definite sweet tooth so sweetness was important to me. I don't know that they're that much healthier than the norm since I didn't have a package of a different brand on hand when I tried these, but I can't imagine ginger snaps being the worst type of cookie you can eat. I suspect the taste of ginger means they don't have to sweeten them as much as regular cookies (like sugar, peanut butter, choco chip, etc).<br /><br />I think the big thing to me is price. I wouldn't pay more than two-fifty for the bag size I received. Good, but not "gourmet", in my opinion.

Drooled with anticipation when they arrived.  Took my first bite.  WHAT IS THIS!!!!??!<br /><br />When your mother made ginger snaps did she always remember to put in plenty of sage???  What! She forgot???!?  Well, bless her heart, that's what made them so GOOD; NO SAGE!!!  I tried several cookies just to see if this was a bad batch but the sage came through over and over.  It doesn't hit you immediately but, when it does, that's all you remember.  I gave one to my wife and my 34-year old daughter and they both had the same reaction (YUCK)!<br /><br />I'll see if my grand daughter likes them.  Otherwise I'll wait til later this month and use them to stuff the turkey.

review/text: I can't believe how good these are, especially for a store-bought cookie! Ginger snaps are one of my favorite cookies, but it's hard to find store-bought brands that are as good as the ones I make - not bragging, but my husband and I like our ginger snaps to be spicy with plenty of ginger. These delicious cookies fill the bill - I just got them this morning and I can't stop eating them! The good news is since they are organic and not loaded with a lot of preservatives and junk I can eat a handful with my coffee or tea and not feel guilty. I love how gingery they are, with actual bits of candied ginger baked into the cookies; if you're not a fan of REAL ginger and you don't like a bit of heat in your ginger snaps, you might want to give these a pass. I love the gingery bite, though, and will definitely buy these at the store.

review/summary: Ginger Snaps that really have Snap!
review/text: Ginger snaps are by far one of my favorite cookies!  For a store bought cookie these are not bad.  They are what I think of as Tea Cookies.  They are VERY hard.  Perfect for dunking into hot unsweetened tea! Yum! The ginger is crisp & has a wonderful bite.  There are small bits of chewy ginger throughout the cookies.  The heat of the ginger lasts on the pallet long after finishing the cookie.<br /><br />If I had a choice of Ginger Snap cookies in the store, I would probably pick the Country Choice brand over these.  Why?  Because they have the USDA Certified Organic seal.  I've had them before & like them a lot.  The Country Choice brand does not have ginger bits in their cookies though.<br /><br />Overall if I am in a ginger snap kind of mood & I have the ingredients on hand, I will make them myself.  I prefer my cookies to have a little bit of softness in the center.  Otherwise these would be my second choice if a certified organic brand wasn't available.<br /><br />If you like to bake.  Earthbound farms has a cookbook with two amazing gingery cookie recipes.  One is for ginger snaps & the other is for lemon snaps.  Oh boy those lemon snaps are amazing!

review/summary: Very Spicy
review/text: My entire family sampled these gingersnaps and offered opinions.  All of my children thought they were too spicy and had a bad aftertaste.  My husband, the one who really appreciates gingersnaps in our family, said that they were a bit spicy, but he liked the overall taste.  He also thought they were a little hard.<br /><br />I must say, I agree with the children on this one.  The cookies have a very strong spice taste- almost overwhelming.  My mouth burned when I ate them.  They are very hard- even harder than is typical for a gingersnap.  I like organic products and was really hoping to like these, but I was disappointed.

review/summary: Taste of ginger was way too strong for me in these
review/text: Now of course I knew that I was getting ginger snaps, so I wanted the taste of ginger to be here, but oh my goodness, for me these cookies are REALLY bitter, way more than the ginger snaps I tried before. I felt as if I burned my mouth a little bit, and after taste stayed with you for some time. And these cookies were really hard too.

review/summary: Too gingery
review/text: I like ginger in baked goods like gingerbread, but I don't care for the taste of fresh grated ginger root, and these cookies tasted too much like fresh ginger for my taste. My husband likes fresh ginger, but didn't care for the texture of the chunks of candied ginger in the cookies. I love Paul, and we eat many of his products, but these cookies are a miss for us.

review/summary: Ginger snaps to dunk for and die for
review/text: As a kid growing up we enjoyed dunking windmill and gingersnap cookies into milk. It was a nice snack or a quick lunch when we were too busy playing to eat anything nutritious. That's probably why I developed a likeness for ginger cookies.<br /><br />For that reason this past holiday season I found a recipe for ginger cookies and baked gingerbread men cookies. Not that long after I discovered some very tasty ginger snap cookies made by Newman's Own Organics Family Recipe Cookies made with organic flour and organic sugar. Newman's Own Organics was formed by Paul Newman as a division of Newman's Own in 1993 and became a separate company in 2001.<br /><br />Ingredients used in Newman's Own Organic products are grown on farms that do not use artificial fertilizers ore pesticides for three years or more. The farms and processors have been certified by a third party, receiving Kosher certification by Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.<br /><br />The ginger snaps are made with real candied ginger, molasses, unbleached wheat flour, organic palm fruit oil, ground ginger, leavening, soy lecithin, and other ingredients. The small cookies have a deep, rich ginger taste that lingers in the mouth. Like mom's ginger snaps, they are crisp and just right for dunking. I give them a B+.<br /><br /> The nutritional information for the 6.5 ounce ginger snap package is: Serving Size - 5 cookies (30 g) Calories 130, Fat Calories 30, Total Fat 3.5g, Saturated Fat 1.5g, Cholesterol 0mg, Sodium 180mg, Total Carbohydrates 24g, Dietary Fiber 0g, Sugars 11g, Protein 2g.<br /><br />The package comes with a handy pull off tab that can be saved and used to reseal the package in case you do not eat all the cookies up in one setting.

review/summary: Very disappointing
review/text: Though I am normally a fan of Newman's Own products, these cookies were terrible. Twice the thickness of other gingersnaps and very small (around 1 1/2 " in diameter), they have little or no ginger flavor. This alone would have discouraged me, but the bag I received was also burned. They weren't simply very browned; there were burned spots around the edges, and the bottoms were blackened. The first (and only) one I ate filled my mouth with a strong burned taste that lingered. I checked the rest of the cookies, but all seemed to be burned. Hopefully, this is a quality control issue that can be resolved, but I will not be trying them again.

review/summary: Maybe I got a bad batch ...
review/text: I've bought and enjoyed Newman's Own products in the past, and I like that their profits are donated to charity.  And I like cookies of all types and flavors.  So, I requested these cookies ... Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps ... to review as part of the Amazon Vine program.  After receiving these, I gathered the family test team to try them.<br /><br />First the good.  The cookies are a little over an inch in diameter, and perhaps an eight of an inch thick, a good size for a snack cookie. They have a strong ginger and molasses flavor, which is critical for a good gingersnap cookie.  And the cookies are made from organic ingredients.  That about sums up the good.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  The cookies were very hard and almost unchewable.  They were a dark brown on top and almost black on the bottom, as in they might have been really overbaked.  The molasses and ginger had a harsh flavor, with an unpleasant aftertaste that takes awhile to fade.  Again, it was almost as if they'd been baked to the point of being burnt.  My wife, who loves the occasional ginger snap, immediately commented that these were the worst gingersnap cookies she'd ever had. My youngest son, who's never met a treat he didn't like, refused a second cookie.  None of my crack test team liked them or wanted more.  So I've eaten the rest of the bag myself, partly to see if they grew on me, and partly to make sure that it just wasn't a few bad cookies.  Unfortunately, they neither grew on me or nor got any better the deeper into the bag I ate.<br /><br />I'm thinking maybe I got a bad bag of cookies ... I have a tough time believing a firm with the deserved good reputation as Newman's Own would consider what I received to be something they'd put their good name to.  But I have to rate what I've been provided, and I'm giving them a generous two stars.

review/summary: Teeth Beware!
review/text: You will definitely need good teeth to eat these cookies!  They are not just crispy.....they are almost like trying to bite into concrete.  I love Newman's products & wanted to love these organic ginger snaps, mainly because they are organic,  but they leave a lot to be desired.  I don't know if it was just the batch I received  or if they are supposed to be this way, but they are almost burnt.  The bottoms are very dark, almost black.  They also left a bad after taste that both my husband and & I noticed.  They just did not taste good.  They taste nothing like the flat ginger snaps of other brands.  I will not be buying these.......but still love other Newman products.

review/summary: Wow, ginger-punch
review/text: I grew up with the over-sugared gingersnap cookies as a child, so I was not expecting the flavor of these Newmans. I've had other Newman's products in the past and they all sort of follow the same general theme - organic ingredients and a more "mature" flavor. By "mature" I mean that many of their cookies and snack lines are geared more towards adults than kids - they are not super sugary and their flavors are mellow and more delicate. It's not quite the case with these gingersnaps. The cookies are very hard and the flavor is like biting into a ginger root. Ok maybe it's not quite that bad, but you can seriously taste ginger in every single bite - any sweetness is an afterthought.<br /><br />I like the cookie in general - the flavor is good, the organic ingredients are a bonus, but honestly it's not my favorite gingersnap. I think the gingersnap is a cookie that really lends itself well to the sugary flavor to help balance out the bite of the ginger. I wish these had a little more sweetness to them.

review/summary: A certified organic ginger snap you're sure to love
review/text: If you love eating healthy, you know you can always turn to Newman's Own. Newman's Own offers all natural products without any of those preservatives you find in most foods. I've bought many Newman's Own products, so when I tried the Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.<br /><br />If you love ginger snaps, you have to try these as they're made with organic flour, organic sugar and real candied ginger. They're all natural; contain no artificial flavors or colors; no hydrogenated oils; no trans-fatty acids; they're dairy free; egg free; and vegan. Unlike most ginger snaps you buy in the store, these really pack a ginger punch--you'll be impressed with the spicy ginger taste and crunch. And if you're counting calories, 5 cookies are only 130 calories.<br /><br />The nutritional facts are as follows:<br />Serving Size - 5 cookies (30 g) Calories 130, Fat Calories 30, Total Fat 3.5g, Saturated Fat 1.5g, Cholesterol 0mg, Sodium 180mg, Total Carbohydrates 24g, Dietary Fiber 0g, Sugars 11g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Not bad for a little indulgence. Just beware--they can be very addicting.

review/summary: Love the flavor and texture, but...
review/text: These cookies are not for someone who is shy or uncertain about ginger.  The flavor is strong, with a little ginger burn to it.  I love ginger, and buy ginger snaps, candied ginger, or even ginger Altoids every now and then.  From the first bite of these cookies, I knew I'd love them.<br /><br />And I do... mostly.  The flavor is great, the texture is hard but not as rock-hard as the ginger snaps in my local supermarket, and they hold up well when dunked in milk or tea.  I keep wandering back to the bag to snack on one or two.  Then one of the candied ginger pieces gets stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />It's a great idea, at least in theory.  Adding candied ginger makes the flavor a little more intense.  But the texture is surprising--the small soft gummy ginger pieces contrast badly with the hard cookies.  And only flossing or brushing will convince the candied ginger to let go of its death grip on my teeth.  Ginger snaps and mint toothpaste are not a good combination at all.<br /><br />If they ever get rid of the candied ginger pieces these will be my favorite ginger snaps.

review/text: This is a very tasty ginger snap.  It has a clean and spicy taste and probably has more ginger flavoring than any ginger snap I have ever eaten.  I brought a bag in to my office and everyone really liked them and commented on the good ginger flavoring.  I would prefer them to be not quite as crunchy, as they break rather easily.  Still, it is a good snack and the organic ingredients are an added bonus.

review/summary: Finally a REAL Ginger Snap
review/text: Ginger Snaps are an American tradition, like oatmeal and sugar cookies.  We who enjoy a really good cookie with our cup of coffee or tea are always on the lookout for a really good cookie.  Newman's Own brand of Ginger Snaps are just what we are looking for in a ginger snap.  It is crispy, much like a biscotti.  The candied ginger gives it a rich ginger flavor.  And the small size, about the size of old half dollar, is just right for dunking in one's coffee and popping in the mouth.  The fact that they are made of organic ingredients not only adds to their quality, but says that they are healthy, thus making it easy to eat more than just a few at a time.<br />We have come to expect quality in all the various products marketed under the brand name, "Newman's Own," and these ginger snaps honor that tradition.

review/text: If you absolutely love ginger snaps then you will love these cookies! I loved the overall flavor because it had a strong ginger taste. I don't particularly like weak tasting ginger snaps.  The strong flavor may not be for everyone but I truly enjoyed them.  The only reason why I didn't give them five stars was because they were a little hard to bite into.  These were the hardest ginger snaps that I have ever had but other than that, they taste really good.  I also like the fact that I didn't experience any aftertaste which was a huge plus!

review/summary: Almost all the way there... but dang good anyway!
review/text: Having long been fan of Newman's Own Popcorn, pasta sauces, and various salad dressings, I was interested to see what the company's foray into cookies might be like.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the taste most of all. It is unlike any other ginger snap I've ever eaten, that's for sure. The size of the cookie itself is thicker but smaller in circumference to the classics I'm used to eating. This is notable for reasons I'll get to shortly.<br /><br />The consistency is very crisp, almost brittle. If you're teeth aren't strong, you may want to dunk them in milk or coffee before you bite into them. And this is where the size issue rears its ugly head. The cookie itself is small enough that you may get 1-2 dunks to help soften them up a bit, but that's it. By then, the cookie remnant is so small you pretty much have to finish it off 'dry'.<br /><br />I would like to see the company try to add an ingredient that would help this texture issue. If it weren't for that, I'd give these little goodies a 5 STAR rating easy.

review/summary: Delicious Adult Cookie
review/text: Mrs. Boilermate is from the Philadelphia area. One of the local treats there is Ivins Spiced Wafers, a ginger snap-like cookie that seems to evoke a "love 'em" or "hate 'um" reaction. Personally I love the crisp cookie and the fairly strong spice flavor. Other family members, however, call them "hockey pucks."<br /><br />Before ordering these from Vine I scanned the early reviews, and saw a similar trend. Now that I've tried them, I come down on the "love 'em" side. These are an adult cookie and would go well with a cup of tea.<br /><br />I like the crisp texture and the prominent, but not overpowering, ginger flavor. These cookies have tiny bits of candied ginger mixed in. This is a bit of a two-edged sword. While they contribute to the prominent ginger flavor, they are also gummy and stick to my teeth, hence the four-star rating. I did not detect any aftertaste.<br /><br />I can't comment on the effectiveness of the peel-and-stick tab for resealing the bag...I never needed it.<br /><br />I have been a "fan" of Newman's Own products for years and these cookies have done nothing to change that. Newman's is proof you can have an ethical business model and still be successful.<br /><br />Bottom line: I will buy these when they hit the stores here.

review/summary: Too sweet, too thick...
review/text: I had never had ginger snap cookies before this, so I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />Maybe I just don't like ginger snap cookies to begin with?<br /><br />I thought it would be crispier, MUCH thinner, and with more "baked," almost a burnt sugar, caramelized (think Creme Brulee) flavor, but instead, it was a very strong rooty, gingery flavor (which I guess makes perfect sense, since it's "ginger snap cookies").<br /><br />Rather, it is very thick, ticker than a waffer, and about the same size. I wish it were smaller, more bite-sized, and much thinner. It is hearty, if that is the flavor you're looking for, you would love it. I did not enjoy it as much personally.<br /><br />One of the reviewers said it's great because it's not very sweet... I would beg the contrary. It was quite sugary to my taste buds.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you were looking for a light snack, this is probably not for you. However, if you want very bold and hearty flavors, you might want to give it a try.

They would be good for dunking as they are very hard cookies so hope you like crunchy.

review/text: The first thing I do when checking out a new food product is to open the container and take in a deep breath, to smell what's inside.  These Ginger Snaps did poorly with the smell test, having very little ginger smell.  I then bit one in half, which was no easy trick.  These are substantial little cookies!  I let the first half melt a little in my mouth, which gave me the first indication of what a strong ginger flavor was in store for me.  I then began to chew the cookie, and noted the bits of candied ginger in the cookie.  Ginger flavor exploded in my mouth, and I mean REAL GINGER!  I'm a big fan of ginger, and have always enjoyed ginger snaps, but now I realize that I have never had an honest to goodness real ginger snap!  There will definitely be more of these in the house during the holidays.

review/summary: tasty! classic gingersnap, better (softer) a few days after  opening
review/text: These are a crisp classic gingersnap with the real bite of genuine ginger. I expect first rate from Newman's own products and these organic gingersnaps  from the second generation of the Newman family do not disappoint.  The flavor is excellent and I'd say they seem quite high quality. I did enjoy these immensely. They were very firm and a bit hard to the tooth when I first opened the package but  softened quite a bit after a few days. One problem if you like a softer gingersnap is being patient enough to wait after opening the bag. the other problem  is  that, as a Vine member, I only got one bag. The bags are 6 and a half ounces  and while they contain quite a few cookies (around 30) competition in my household was fierce I did not get as many as I would have liked. I would buy these  they were very good on their own and with beverages. I did not have enough cookies to try using them in recipes that call for gingersnaps  such as crumb crusts and fruit crisps or the beef and cabbage dish My great Grandparents used to make  but I am certain that these would be great for those purposes.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I like many Newman's Own products and love the concept--that all the profits go to such worthy causes including a camp for children with cancer.<br /><br />And ginger snaps are one of my favorite cookies, so I was happy when this product showed up on Vine. It's nice to be able to give a positive review to a product whose sale benefits so many people. Organic flour and organic sugar were examples of quality ingredients in use.<br /><br />So, imagine my disappointment when the bag arrived. Its a cute bag of cookies, and about 30 cookies with a removable tape to help seal it so they stay crisp. The first one I tried had a good snap and a strong ginger flavor--which I really liked and think ginger cookies should have. It also had the right balance of sweetness--some, but not too much.<br /><br />The second cookie was so different. One, crisp and fresh tasting; the other chewy (not in a good way) and a bit flat tasting. I thought maybe it was just a weird "odd" one in the batch, but...no. About half the cookies are one way, half the other. And they even look different--lt brown v. dark brown, curved like a vanilla wafer v. flat as the proverbial pancake. They seemed a bit over-baked and the after taste was not burned, exactly, but not pleasant.<br /><br />I thought maybe this was packaged just for Vine, but...no, it seems to be just the regular product. They're not inedible, they are made with organic flour and sugar, and they do go to a good cause. Just be prepared for the inconsistency and maybe use the kind you -don't- like to eat for baking or cooking. I ground up the flat ones to use with a pie (they'd be good on ice cream, too).

review/summary: A Good Ginger Snap
review/text: I have supported Newman's Own brands when I am able and the quality is high. And I love Ginger Snaps, so I was looking forward too trying these. The cookies themselves are small and crunchy. These cookies I found too be delicious with just the right enough of ginger for spice and a hint of sweet. The ginger lingers as an after taste as you would expect. And they can be addictive. I had too stop myself from continuing too eat them. Five of these cookies are considered a serving and weigh in at 130 Calories.<br /><br />Only the Flour and sugar is labeled as Organic. I like that the advertising of ingredients is clear but would have expected a Newman's Own Organic brand too be all organic. That may be asking too much. Also if you have allergies be cautious. These cookies are manufactured where products containing peanuts, tree nuts and dairy are processed. (So they may not be all dairy free!) This is disclosed on the back of the package after the list of ingredients but in its own paragraph so it is easy too find...if you are looking for it. I am sorry too say I have had another brand that taste better but these are good and I would get them again.

review/summary: Great taste, but hard as a rock
review/text: I think I read that these did not have eggs in them.  Perhaps that explains the "hockey puck" texture.  They have a great taste, although they are a LOT spicier than most ginger snaps.  But they are very hard. Ginger snaps are always kind of hard, but these go way beyond normal.  I had to soak them in milk to really enjoy them.  They also had something kind of chewey in them.  It only became chewey after you soaked it.  I thought maybe it was the ginger, but couldn't be sure. Still, if you like ginger and you like it really spicey and you don't mind dunking your cookies for longer than normal, they're good cookies.  If you don't like dunking or you don't like spicey ginger-flavored foods, skip these.

review/text: That's a quote from my husband, the Gingersnap eater in our family.  As soon as I saw them available on Vine, I knew I had to get them for him.<br /><br />I've been married to him almost 25 years and have purchased many brands over the years and so far, his favorite has been the one in the red bag (am I allowed to mention other brands?).  But these, these take Gingersnaps OVER THE TOP.<br /><br />They're not available locally (we live in a town of less than 8,000)so it's obvious I'll have to find them here at Amazon or maybe in Joplin or Springfield, at the health food stores along with the other organics.

review/summary: Uber "Snappy" Ginger Snaps
review/text: I like my ginger snaps spicy, and these did not disappoint. They are packed with flavor and have little bits of candied ginger inside. The biggest disappointment with a ginger snap is when the spice is too mellow, but these little cookies are really strong. They are also very, very "crisp". The company clearly wanted to emphasize the "snap" because they are pretty hard for your standard cookie. I usually like them a little less brittle, but the flavor was so good it didn't matter. I even dunked them in my tea to soften them up a little when the crunch was just too much.<br /><br />Be warned- these ginger snaps are not for the faint-hearted. We are talking ginger snaps that mean business!

review/summary: Intense Ginger Flavor
review/text: From the minute your tongue touches these cookies you will know this is going to be a good experience. As you crunch down and as the gingery flavor fills your mouth, you will probably think these are the best ginger cookies you've ever tasted. At least I feel that way. Now my husband couldn't stop saying "Wow" the entire time he was eating them because the flavor was pretty intense. The reason these are so good is because they have ground ginger AND candied ginger. Also these are made with organic flour and organic sugar so they are just superior in flavor to most store-bought brands. Even minutes after you eat these cookies you will notice a mild tingling in your mouth. If you love ginger these are the ultimate ginger cookies.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Really Liked These
review/text: I generally prefer a soft and chewy cookie and I'm also not a huge fan of ginger snaps I've had in the past so I was very surprised at how much I liked these cookies. First, they are very crispy (perhaps the "snap" in the name) but after you chew them for a while they seem to melt a bit in the mouth which somewhat unusual for such a crisp cookie. The big plus though is a spicy (relatively speaking) ginger bite to the cookies. This is what distinguishes them so much from ginger snaps I've had in the past which are fairly tasteless. These really do have a wonderful ginger taste to them. All in all, a very difficult cookie to stop eating. I went through many more than I should have before closing the bag for the evening.

review/summary: Intensely spiced ginger snaps, but texture is not my favorite
review/text: First the good news: I love the spiciness of these gingersnaps. These cookies have both ground ginger and candied ginger.<br />The part I don't like: perhaps because these are vegan, they don't have a very pleasant texture. They are more than just crisp, these cookies are  just plain hard.  For me this is a deal breaker, but for someone who likes to dunk their cookies in milk, these may be more likable.

review/summary: Immensely satisfying
review/text: Ginger snaps are one of my favorite cookies, and frankly I'll eat almost any brand when I'm in the mood for them.  That's how I know that not all ginger snaps are created equal. Far from it.  Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps really hit the spot with me. They're not over-sweet, and they have a nice, peppery quality -- a lot of snap with your ginger.  They also have bits of candied ginger floating in them, so along with a good crunch (They're not rock-hard like some others I could name, though.)you get little bits of chewiness making the texture very appealing.<br /><br />Normally I'd go on about how there's no HFCS, the sugar and flour are organic, and a bunch of other things related to relative healthiness, but seriously?  I love this cookie, and I don't think I'd care if it did have a lot of crap in it.  No, okay, it would make me unhappy, but not so much so that I'd never eat them again.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with these ginger snaps.  Newman's Own is a bit hit or miss for me, but these cookies are clear winners for a ginger snap junkie like myself.

review/text: As others have mentioned, the cookies are a bit hard, so anyone with any dental work might want to give these a pass, but for those who endure, there's a nice reward at the end of the bite.  The cookies themselves are good, but the fun is in the bits of chewy candied ginger that are baked into the cookie.  That's where you get your heat, and if you like ginger, it's totally worth it!  If you like ginger snaps, these aren't your typical cookie but they are pretty good!  I would buy them again!

Their sharp ginger taste makes them a great companion to tea or coffee.  I could easily store a bag of these in my car for quick snacks on the go.  The resealable label is nice too.

review/summary: The perfect coffee cookie!
review/text: When my daughter was little, she would go to grandma's house to stay the night occasionally.  Grandma would get out gingersnaps after lunch and they would dunk them -  her cookies in milk and grandma's in coffee.  She started calling them coffee cookies.  Although those weren't organic, she only got them at grandma's.  She is now 16 and when I gave her one of these she said "coffee cookies" and grabbed more!  They are delish!

review/summary: Crunchy ginger goodness.
review/text: These little Ginger Snap cookies are very, very tasty, with a satisfying crunch at the beginning and a smooth, rich feel at the end.  It might be more of a crunch than some folks would want (which might even get worse if left on the shelf for too long), and if you don't want an intense, somewhat spicy, lingering ginger flavor, you should probably avoid these.<br /><br />For me, though, ginger cookies are usually kind of boring, so it was a real treat to introduce my taste buds to these organic goodies. The all-natural ingredients lean heavily towards the sugar (each cookie is 40% sugar!), but they are less fatty than the last ginger cookies we had (Anna's), and the powerful flavor kind of dissuades you from eating too many at once!

review/summary: Best tasting ginger snap cookie I have eaten
review/text: I really like the taste of ginger, but most ginger snap cookies that I have tried have only a mild amount. Not so with these cookies. They have a very strong ginger taste that will linger in your mouth even after you have finished eating the cookie. A negative review complains that this makes the cookie inedible, but for me it make the cookie absolutely delicious. It is all a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />5 cookies have 130 calories, 1.5g saturated fat, and 12g sugar. That does not qualify them as a health food, but they are healthier than other cookies, plus they are made with organic unbleached wheat flour and organic sugar (which are the first two ingredients listed). They are a little harder than I would prefer, but still taste great.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like a strong ginger taste in a lightly sweetened cookie, this product will do the trick.

review/summary: Burt offerings to the Organic Gods
review/text: Never thought I'd see the day when a healthy brand touted real "organic sugar" as one of the main ingredients, or that I'd be thrilled to see it. There may be a few things that taste the same with high fructose corn syrup instead of good 'ol cane, but I have yet to find them. If I'm going to go all decadent and eat goodies, I want them to taste - well - good.<br /><br />I really like ginger snaps, they're a great comfort food and one of the few treats that have enough flavor that a handful is enough. I was looking forward to something a little more wholesome than my regular brand (you know the ones - look like cardboard, and probably as healthy) without going all organic-crazy and losing the flavor.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the package, most of the cookies were burnt on the underside, and about as hard as rocks. Well, they are ginger SNAPS, so I guess hard isn't bad, and they are easy enough to bite into, as long as your teeth are good. The flavor is definitely more ginger-y than the regular national brand, with tiny little bits of chewy ginger interspersed (bits have a consistency like chopped-up gummy bears). These little chewy pieces have some very strong ginger flavor, which is good if you love ginger.<br /><br />I think I'd really like these if they weren't burnt, but this batch has a singed flavor that just isn't very appealing. I might be willing to try them again, but I'm really wondering about their quality control if they could have this many bags leave the warehouse in this condition.

review/summary: Pretty Good Cookies
review/text: Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps are almost everything a ginger snap should be. They are hard (I hate soft cookies) and the ginger is fantastic--it fills your mouth with a real gingery wallop that lingers. The only thing I found disagreeable is that they were a little burned. The bottom of the cookies were a bit darker than I would've liked, and there was a definite overdone undertone. I don't know if it was the particular batch I sampled or if the product is meant to taste this way. That being said, I wouldn't refuse these ginger snaps if someone offered them.

review/summary: The small crunchy cookie with the big spice punch
review/text: Being a big fan of other Newman's Own products, I thought that these were worth a try.  Each package holds quite a few cookies- so it may make sense to plan ahead on using them before they go stale.  The crunch and texture were very good- and the small size of each cookie helped with portion control.  The flavor is the big thing, and may be a bit polarizing.  These are very "spicy" which I liked, but my wife did not.  Oh well- more cookies for me.  I found these to be perfect for a light post-dinner desert, and particularly good with coffee. Also, repackaged in baggies these go nicely with a brown bag lunch.  If you are a fan of ginger snaps, I think you will really enjoy these.

review/summary: All you Ginger Snap Nay Sayers are wimps.
review/text: Get a good bottle of hot ginger ale and sit down and eat a few of these things.  When I first got these I had high hopes and I was not disappointed.  I like hot ginger items and this fits the bill.  Yes, they are crunchy but hey, a good cookie is.  I like the fact that they are hard and not soft.  When you bite into the cookie the first thing you taste is ginger.  When you are done you taste ginger.  They are ginger cookies, not bland no taste cookies.<br /><br />They do remind me of a good ginger ale.  They will wake you up in a heartbeat and make you want more.  Give them a shot and you wont be disappointed.  However, if you are a ginger wimp, you should probably stay away.<br /><br />My box was well cooked, not burnt and tasted excellent.  I will be buying these in the future.

review/text: These cookies have all of the quality you expect when purchasing Newman's products.  Not everyone can make good ginger snaps.  These are very tasty and packed with the quality you will savor from the first bite.<br /><br />Another treat, they are bite size so you must be careful as you could eat the entire bag in one setting.  The packaging is also very good and insures the product is as fresh as possible.  They are perfect for a picnic, or concert, ballgame or wherever you will need a nice snack to complement other foods you may be bringing.<br /><br />Overall I was pleasantly surprised a good ginger snap is available in bite size portions.

review/summary: Very tasty but very hard
review/text: I couldn't bite into these without dipping them in something to soften them.  So I poured some milk to dip them in and gave them a try.  These were so hard that I couldn't break them in two with my teeth.<br /><br />The milk solved this problem.  These are very tasty if you can soften them.  I LOVE the strong ginger flavor.  I didn't care for the candied ginger pieces, as they were hard to chew and got stuck to my teeth.  If these cookies didn't have that in them, I would give them a 4.  There are 130 calories in 5 cookies that are a little bigger than a half dollar.  I like the fact that they are organic, and made with natural ingredients.  I have always been a fan of the Newman's Own products.<br /><br />If you love ginger, don't mind hard little crunchy candies getting stuck in your teeth, and love to dip these in coffee or milk, then give them a try.

review/text: I've long been a fan of the Newman's Own brand and this item is no exception. Ginger Snaps are a common or garden cookie - known in may family as the best dunking cookie there is. Although these are small in size, they dunk really well. However what sets these cookies apart is their taste. You can taste the ginger and molasses very clearly and it retains that fresh out of the kitchen flavor. In my opinion taste alone lifts this humble cookie to the heights of a mini delicacy. Why don't you give them a taste and see?

review/text: We got our bag of ginger snaps this afternoon and I am ashamed (but happy) to admit that they are almost gone already.  These cookies are fantastic!  I have long been a fan of ginger snaps but have often been disappointed by the bland, tasteless versions I found in the stores.  Nothing was as good or as flavorful as Mom used to make.  It seemed that all the really flavorful brands slowly slipped away from the grocers shelves.  The only really great ones were imported and the exchange rate made them ridiculously expensive.  Then I found Newman's Own.  I have always loved their salad dressings (not so crazy about their salsas but that is another review) and now I love their cookies.  With s satisfying snap! and a crunchy texture they also have delicious chewy ginger pieces inside to make them super flavorful.  The low heat of the ginger is just right and they are not too sweet.  They are fabulous and I now need to order more or find them at the local grocer. Buy these and you will not be sorry!

review/text: These Ginger Snaps are sure to put a tingle on the tip of your tongue. They taste great.<br /><br />In addition they're made with real candied ginger and contain a minimum of chemical content.<br /><br />And - the profits go to charity!<br /><br />Well, I'm not so sure about that. Searching the Newman's Own Organics website yields this vague statement, "Newman's Own Organics was established as a division of Newman's Own in 1993, and became a separate company in late 2001. Paul Newman has given over $200 million to thousands of charities worldwide since 1982". Meanwhile, the Newman's Own site explicitly makes the point that all profits of the original company go to charity.<br /><br />Nothing against daughter Nell if she charts a different course. But, the confusingly similar branding and the reference to Paul Newman's charitable giving seem to trade on the original's cachet it a way that's borderline misleading.<br /><br />But the cookies are great.<br /><br />Four stars.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I have usually found that "Newman's Own" products are very good, and these cookies do not disappoint.<br /><br />TASTE: They are very rich in home-made flavor - the ginger and the molasses are right up front where they should be. They are sweet enough, but not terribly sweet. They are VERY crunchy, and you'll find little bits of candied ginger in them. Ginger is naturally a bit spicy, and being rich in ginger, these have just a bit of zing to them.<br /><br />NUTRITION: they are made with organic flour and organic sugar. These are the first two ingredients listed, so that's important. Five cookies (each is about 1.25" diameter) is the size of one serving, and weighs in at 130 calories, of which 30 calories are from fat.<br /><br />PACKAGING: The package includes adhesive tape that you can pull off and use to reseal the package to keep it fresh.<br /><br />I love them! Certainly the tastiest product I have reviewed for Amazon, much better than all those books.

The kind she has been buying wasn't very flavorful or easy to chew. When I saw Newman's listed in the Vine Voice I ordered a package right away in the hopes that these would be a notch above what mom was currently eating.  We each tried one and they are REALLY good.  If you like ginger then you are going to love these cookies.  They have a nice depth of flavor and the zing of real ginger.  They are also softer than most other brands.

The small (silver dollar sized) organic (organic unbleached flour and organic sugar) crisp cookies contain not only ginger as an ingredient, but also have tiny pieces of candied chewy ginger bits that give the cookies an overpowering ginger flavor that borders on "spicy," and tingles the tongue. Some of my children liked them; others did not.<br /><br />Ginger-lovers will certainly like the cookies. Those who do not like ginger will want to stay away from them. Ideally, these are best served with milk (to counteract the spicy ginger) or with tea or coffee (for dipping).<br /><br />The cookies in our bag were a tad bit overdone, almost burned. It may be a "family recipe," but I think I prefer chocolate chip, oatmeal, peanut butter, snicker doodles, or molasses cookies to these.

review/summary: They're gingery and they're snappy, they must be ginger snaps!
review/text: Newman's Own and I have had a really good relationship thus far; I have at least liked, and most usually loved, every product I have tried from them. Their organic ginger snaps are no exception. The cookies are relatively small (somewhere between 1-1/2 to 2 inches in diameter), but they are filled to the brim with gingery goodness, which you would hope for in a ginger snap. I wouldn't think these would be for someone with a casual liking of ginger, but for those who enjoy it more, these are sure to please as far as flavor goes. As for the crunch, these are a hard cookie and not for those with gentle teeth, but they are, after all, a ginger snap. Ginger snaps are not known to be soft in any way, shape, or form. Rest assured that these won't break in shipment. My bag of cookies survived their journey even though they came in a soft envelope, which in turn was crammed into my cluster mailbox. However, when I opened the bag, I only found two broken pieces equaling a cookie. That's one tough cookie!<br /><br />As far as nutrition goes, it's pretty good: 5 cookies in a serving, 130 calories (30 from fat), saturated fat 1.5 grams, sugar is 12 grams (not great but it is a cookie so far better than most other choices). The ingredients in order: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (ginger, sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (sodium bicarbonate, monocalcium, phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. While these claim to be Vegan, I see that it doesn't say 'organic sugar' listed in the ingredients to the candied sugar, just 'sugar', so one wonders about that. If you're unfamiliar with the Newman's Own brand, it was co-founded by Paul Newman as a company where all profits from their food items go to various charities after taxes. It's a great cause that has fantastic, healthy, and quality products that while may be a bit pricier than other brands, won't break the bank.<br /><br />A little note, you might want to have a glass of milk, or cup of tea or coffee hanging around, because these ginger snaps really do snap back!

review/summary: A Great, Flavorful Cookie
review/text: I have never tried any of the Newman's Own products, but had heard the products from this label were of high quality.  I was therefore eager to try Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps.  My wife has always loved ginger snaps.  I like them, but have never been overwhelmed by them.  The first thing I liked about the cookie was its size.  Very often, you don't want a regular-size cookie.  The Newman's Own cookies are small -- not quite edible in a single bite.  The size makes it possible to gauge your cookie intake to appetite without waste.<br /><br />The cookies are crisp and literally break off with an audible "snap."  They remained crisp and fresh in their bag for well over a week.  The flavor is very ginger-y and leaves a nice tingling aftertaste in your mouth.  My wife was especially pleased at the flavor, since she's a longtime fan of ginger snaps.  I asked her if she'd say the Newman's Own were the best ginger snaps she'd ever tasted.  She pondered a moment or two and then said, "Yes, definitely."  High praise indeed.<br /><br />As for myself, I enjoyed the small cookies with coffee after dinner.  They alleviate that sugar craving while not putting on the pounds.  They're a sensible dessert, if eaten in moderation.  These cookies are very fine examples of what a classic ginger snap should be.  The company has concentrated on natural ingredients and care in baking rather than masking the flavor with unnecessary icing or adornment with other toppings.

review/summary: Life is Hard
review/text: I favor peanut butter cookies. Perhaps you should consider this as you read this review.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, these ginger snaps are hard. Perhaps not tooth-cracking hard, but not that far away. Judicious dunking might help.<br /><br />Yet, they are very tasty, you might say "snappy." So, we've got hard balanced by tasty.

review/summary: Excellent, ginger treat!
review/text: For years I have bought and used products from the Newman's Own line, and I have always loved them. So I was very pleased with these wonderful little cookies.<br /><br />Similar to other Newman's products, these are made with organic products (flour and sugar) under the Newman's Organics line and certified by the strict Oregon laws.<br /><br />As for the taste, excellent!!! The ginger is pretty strong in these, which I love. They are a hard, small cookie - perfect for dipping in hot tea. A serving size is 5 cookies with a low calorie count of only 130. There are no trans fats, only 180 mg sodium, and 12 sugars per serving.<br /><br />These make me think of autumn, cool weather, and hot tea. Recently when I had a cold and didn't feel like eating much, these little ginger snaps and hot tea were just the thing to revive my spirits!

review/summary: A Pleasure, But Not a Guilty One
review/text: Vegan cookies are hard to find.  Tasty vegan cookies are even harder, especially if you are on a budget.  And ginger snaps are available about everywhere but most of them are nothing to write home about.  These ginger snaps are the exception.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of ginger - I love the stuff.  These cookies have plenty of it, not only ground ginger but tiny bits of candied ginger, and that makes a world of difference.  These cookies will bite you back!  Not in a bad way, but in that slightly hot, tickle-your-tongue way that ginger lovers adore.  They are by far the most gingery snaps I've tasted, so if you are not a fan of the spice, they will most likely not appeal to you.  The cookies are quite crunchy and dense, as a good snap should be.  Not too sweet, just a satisfying combination of spicy and sweet.  Add to that organic ingredients and a do-good company, only 130 calories per 5 cookie serving, and it all adds up to a winner.  I love these cookies!

review/summary: Lots of Ginger
review/text: I ordered a pack of these cookies and I am glad I did.  They are great tasting but there were a couple small problems:  The cookies are so hard and thick they are difficult to bite.  Warnings for those with weak teeth.<br /><br />The second warning is a ginger warning.  They are full of ginger and the taste may remain with you for a while.  This didn't matter to me because I love ginger.  But some people may say they have ginger burn.<br /><br />Otherwise the cookies are delicious and I ate them in three sittings.

review/summary: Gingery and snappy
review/text: This is a darned nice ginger snap. They're very dry and crisp (for snappiness), and have a good strong ginger flavor -- strong enough to give you a tingle on your tongue if you wolf down a handful of them one after the other, as I'm prone to do. They might be too strongly gingery for some kid's tastes, and better for the cookie-loving grownups in the family.

review/summary: SNAP....These Cookies Really HAVE Ginger In Them!
review/text: I love ginger snap cookies, and finding good ones is really difficult unless you bake them yourself. I had high hopes for these but my hopes were dashed when I got them and tried them.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I noticed they had a lot of ginger in them....enough to leave a slight tingle on the tongue as an aftertaste. This is great if you love ginger like I do, but could be a problem for some people.<br /><br />I noticed when I opened the bag and grabbed a handful that some of the cookies were too dark and had been over baked. A little darkening on the bottom is fine, but when the sides are starting to get a little burnt and you get a burnt taste, they are overdone and need to be thrown out. Either the ovens need better temperature control, or the inspectors need to be more careful.<br /><br />Finally, I was pleased with the ingredients until I read the list closely. While using organic flour and organic sugar made these seem very healthy, I noticed that the shortening used was palm oil. They used a fancy name for it, but it is basically just palm oil, which is the vegetable oil that is highest in saturated fat content of all the vegetable oils. Why they would use such great organic ingredients and then have an unhealthy fat in them is a mystery to me. It is also a deal breaker.  I guess I go back to baking them for myself.....

review/summary: Very nice, but not amazing
review/text: Dairy free! (Not just lactose free; I have a milk allergy, and I can eat these. Big bonus.)<br /><br />Plus side: On a cold, rainy day, I was all smiles to have these at my desk at work ready to dunk in a cup of hot orange & spice tea. That was a wonderful combination, and I was very happy.<br /><br />Down side: I don't know that these actually taste any better than the ginger snaps I often pick up at Big Lots, which are definitely cheaper (and still milk free).<br /><br />Bottom line is that they were very nice, and I have no complaints at all--except that I blew my diet eating too many of them at once!

review/summary: Gingerliscious!
review/text: These snaps are not too sweet; they have a strong ginger bite (in a good way). They're fairly crisp, but with a little chew to them at the end - almost like they have tiny slivers of candied ginger in them? The molasses taste is there, but it's subtle. I haven't tried this out, but I think they'd also make a good base for a cookie crust. The small size is nice, too - good for a little treat, or a treat for a little one. They're a good contrast to the recipe I use for homemade (which is very molasses-y, and very soft). I'm not over the moon about them, but I do keep eating them...  I wouldn't buy them all the time, but they're a great choice to save time or make a less rich pie crust - and I'm happy to support a company that does a lot of organic products and is conscientious about its use of palm fruit oil (non-hydrogenated, sourced in Columbia where its production supports an indigenous population).

review/summary: Crunchy Intense Ginger
review/text: I shared my 6.5 oz bag with the people at the office.  The concenus was that the cookies were very crunchy; some people said that they were too hard.  Also, the ginger flavor was instense, strong enough to leave an aftertaste.  Some of the tasters liked this, some did not.<br /><br />The ingredients are organic, nothing particularly bad for you.  There is palm oil in the mix.  This poses a question.  Where does the palm oil come from?  The Indonesia rain forests are being burnt down to make space for palm oil plantations. Some Girl Scouts have started a drive to boycott cookies make with palm oil since it is difficult to know its origin.<br /><br />On the plus side, the profits of Newman's Own go to worthwhile causes, over $300 million so far, according to their web site..

review/summary: These Ginger Snaps Do Snap Back
review/text: Newman's Own Organics ginger snaps are a fine addition to the cookie world. They boast candied ginger pieces and the traditional spices that go along with the cookie: cinnamon and cloves. Also, organic sugar and flour have been added to the mix.<br /><br />I haven't had ginger snaps in a while, so when I took my first bite, I was bombarded by the tasty flavor. It was like getting punched in the face! The first few bites were actually a little spicy for me, in a good way. I offered some to a few relatives and they agreed that they were delicious. The texture, however, is hard and a bit grainy. Maybe the organic products come into question?<br /><br />These are still a nice little cookie, and I'll be keeping my eye on them in the market. A good holiday treat!

Some also were burned on the bottom like someone failed to take them out of the oven soon enough.<br /><br />This surprises me as the other Newman brand products I have tried were as I expected them to be with no negative points.  Maybe this was a bag that got past the inspection team.<br /><br />If you don't mind the crunchiness and a few darker than normal bottoms, the flavor is great.

review/text: I'm a bit conflicted on these.  These are spicy cookies. A more adult cookie for sure.  Not too sweet, perfect for coffee, milk or tea.  They do have a very "clean" taste with nothing really lingering.  They are pretty hard/crispy so you almost need something to dunk them in.  The taste is very good with a slightly chewy gingery inside from the candied ginger.  The only issue I had is a good portion of the cookies were nearly burnt and didn't taste good.  Not to mention they were too hard to consume.  The ones that weren't burnt were very tasty, but the inconsistent quality disappointed me.  It's shame because I did enjoy them and the ingredient list is very nice and wholesome.  Some QC would go a long way in making these better.

review/summary: Excellent ginger taste with a hard, crunchy texture
review/text: I'm a big fan of all things ginger and like many of Paul Newman's products so I was happy to try out Newman's Own Organic Ginger Snaps. The cookies have a very strong, sharp ginger taste which I liked. However, I found them to be a little too hard and thick, making them crunchy. I like a thinner ginger snap, not one that needs to be dunked in my tea.<br /><br />I'm going to be neutral on these cookies. The taste was great, the texture not so good. I'm not sure if my bag was overcooked or if this is how they were meant to be; they didn't look burned, just a hard cookie. If they change them to be thinner and a bit softer I would definitely buy them as the taste is excellent.

review/text: Ginger SNAP is definitely the right word for these cookies. They are crisp, crunchy, delicious, and a little bit addicting. If crunchy is what you're after, these are the cookies for you.<br /><br />But if you'd rather have a softer ginger cookie, never fear. Just dip these in some hot tea and you've got a softer, chewier cookie that is just as tasty. We've found that we actually prefer the cookies this way.<br /><br />The ginger is fairly powerful and has a bit of "ginger burn" to it, but it's by no means overpowering. Our two year-old typically dislikes ginger cookies, but he really liked these. The sugar content is low enough that letting him eat one or two is no big deal.<br /><br />So, if you like ginger cookies, give these a try. We have enjoyed them quite a bit.

review/summary: Very spicy, gingery, hard cookies
review/text: If you really like ginger and you enjoy hard cookies, Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps may be for you. The cookies have a very strong, spicy ginger flavor and a long-lasting peppery aftertaste. They're not very sweet, but they're sweet enough. They are very hard and crunchy, with more emphasis on the hard than the crunchy. If you have sensitive teeth, you should exercise caution. I picked up a hint of staleness; the hard-crunchy balance might have fallen on the crunchy side if the cookies had been fresher or had been packaged more quickly after baking. For that reason, I almost gave these a 3-star rating ... but they do taste good.

review/text: These cookies are delicious -- strong ginger and molasses flavor with just enough sugar to make them truly cookies. The ingredient list is heartening -- nine items, all of which I keep in my own pantry. However, they are tooth-breakers. . . so hard that I have to use my molars to bite into them rather than just taking a nibble with my front teeth. I wish they were a bit thinner, which would have made the texture seem merely crispy; at this thickness they're a teensy bit reminiscent of yummy rocks.

review/text: I love everything ginger so was eager to try these cookies. They have a really rich, almost hot, ginger flavor and you could feel the pieces of candied ginger throughout.  My only complaint is that the texture of the cookie was not at all chewy and in fact was so hard that they were difficult to bite. They have a very rustic look to them and the bottoms of some of the cookies looked almost burnt.  I would buy these cookies again to get the strong ginger flavor -- I just wish the texture were a little softer.

review/summary: Powerful ginger flavor!
review/text: My grandmother is a sucker for a good gingersnap cookie.  She's very difficult to please.  So I put these cookies to the true test - I handed them over to her.  Nana's assessment is the following.<br /><br />"They were an excellent cookie.  Better than any storebought gingersnap I've had since I was a kid!  They were super crunchy, but not hard to bite.  And the ginger flavor was very strong, which I love.  So many times you get a gingersnap that tastes nothing like ginger and that's very disappointing.  These were nothing like that.  They were delicious!"<br /><br />I sampled some myself and, though I'm not as big a gingersnap fan in general, I have to admit that Nana was spot on in her assessment.  The reason I only awarded 4 stars to these cookies because I do have a minor disclaimer: To me, the ginger flavor was almost TOO strong.  It wasn't at all overpowering.  But it was so strong that it kept growing in the back of my mouth until I felt a tingle in my throat.  I think that might be too much for a lot of people, hence the reason I couldn't in good conscience award full stars.<br /><br />I'd say they were a solid 4 1/2 though.  This is an excellent cookie and definitely better than any other I've ever bought for my family!

review/summary: A deep rich ginger-flavored crisp cookie
review/text: This cookie's yummy ginger flavor struck me right away as being almost exotic.  The ginger added is candied ginger (sugar and ginger) and just the right mixture seems to have been used.  The sugar enhances the ginger rather than the other way around.<br /><br />The cookies are small and rich brown in color.<br /><br />Because of the quality and careful selection of organic ingredients (unbleached wheat flour, as well as organic sugar and palm fruit oil, plus the delicious flavor of molasses), I will be purchasing this product at my local supermarket when I'm in the mood for something sweet.<br /><br />I don't usually partake of cookies, but these are small and healthy enough to not make me feel guilty when I treat myself to one or two at a time.  Also my dogs seem to like the scent -- I had to tell them 'No'-'No' several times.  And, yes, I felt stingy.<br /><br />A serving size is considered to be five cookies:  so per serving size, these cookies contain 3.5 gr fat, 180 mg sodium, no cholesterol, 24 gr carbohydrates, 2% calcium and 2% iron.<br /><br />I'm impressed!

review/summary: Too intense
review/text: Newman's Ginger Snaps are very crunchy. The first bite was woody but within a few seconds, the ginger taste kicked in. One tiny cookie was enough to wean me off. its almost like having a strong 1/2 cup of ginger tea. Well, then we can use these cookies for relief during a cold. My husband's reaching for a 5th cookie. I dont think it will be a hit with kids. I wonder if light or dark molasses were used.

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: I'm not a big ginger snap fan to begin with, but I ate half of one of these cookies and threw the rest of the bag away. The ginger taste is sharp and overwhelming, so much so I found it almost made me gag. The cookies are hard as rocks with such an overpowering ginger taste that I can't imagine anyone would like them. I asked my husband to try one, and he actually winced at the first bite. At first he said he would eat them if I wanted him to, but then he admitted he was just trying not to hurt my feelings and agreed we should just toss them out. I normally like Newman's Own products, and I honestly don't know if some ginger snap connoisseurs enjoy such a strong taste of ginger, but I can't recommend these cookies at all.

review/summary: THE WORST GINGER SNAPS I'VE EVER TASTED
review/text: If you want a dry and rock-hard cookie that doesn't even remotely taste like real Ginger Snaps this is the cookie for you.  If, on the other hand, you want a gingery, tasty cookie that reminds you of fall AVOID THESE LIKE THE PLAGUE.  Just go to your local supermarket and buy your Ginger Snaps there!  Sorry, Paul, you dropped the ball on this one!

review/summary: Hard but delicious
review/text: Although I knew that ginger snaps were supposed to be hard, I was surprised by how much so these Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps cookies were when I first bit down on one with my front teeth.  It hurt my teeth.  But I quickly adapted by shoving them deep into my cheek and bit down with my molars. I like them.  They have a very strong ginger favor and I am a ginger root lover, and  they are not overly sweet.  I liked them so much that I ate half a bag in one sitting.  There is a burnt favor in the cookies.  I wonder if the bakers had left them in the oven for too long.  They are also the smallest cookies I have ever eaten, measuring only 1-3/4" across.  They fit my mouth perfectly.  There is a reusable tape on the bag, which can be used to reseal the bag.  It is thoughtful addition.  Overall, these are very delicious and flavorful cookies. I would have given them a 5-star rating, have they not been so hard.

review/summary: spicy, ginger-y, snappy
review/text: When I first pulled out one of these little cookies, I was nonplussed. I don't think they're particularly attractive,having an uneven and almost burnt look. But the taste soon convinced me otherwise. These have a very good, very ginger-y and somewhat spicy flavor. I really enjoyed the little bits of ginger that are in each cookie, so that after the cookie is gone there's often a chewy bit of ginger that lingers. Yum. Also, they are smaller, like a silver dollar, and so grabbing a handful of these organic vegan gems does not bring on piles o' guilt. Excellent for gingersnap connoiseurs.

review/text: I love the taste of a good ginger snap cookie. When I saw these offered I jumped on them thinking what an easy review this would be. Well.....as for the taste, they are great. True ginger snap flavor!! When I opened the bag, the smell made my mouth water. The cookie itself is extremely hard! I really had a hard time biting into them and chewing them. If the company could "soften" them up a bit they would be awesome!! If you like a very hard and crunchy cookie, and love the taste of a ginger snap, you will love this cookie! If you prefer a soft cookie, this one isn't for you!

review/summary: Excellent, except...
review/text: I found these cookies to be a healthy and tasty snack. Plus, the cookies were crisp, a feature I like. The only negative was that the batch I was given was slightly burnt, downgrading the taste slightly. Hopefully, other batches aren't burnt.

review/summary: Great Ginger Snap Cookies
review/text: I loved these ginger snap cookies--just the right ginger taste and not too sweet.  However, I have to take one star away for the packaging.  I couldn't get the package open at the top and consequently it ripped down the side.  Here in humid Florida, since I couldn't properly seal the package, the cookies got a little soggy after a few days.  But they were still delicious!
