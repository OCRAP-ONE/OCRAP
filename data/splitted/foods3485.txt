review/summary: Not good coffee
review/text: As others have reported, this is a very coarse grind coffee that takes about twice as much to create a coffee of any strength.  It does not live up to the Lavazza name, being more like food-service grade.  It is most certainly not a Premium coffee, as it is called.  It is a light roast, but has an unpleasant, weak taste nevertheless, in addition to poor mouthfeel.  Not worth the money, even when on sale.  Lavazza should be selling this under a different brand name.

review/summary: Lavazza coffee
review/text: I've been using Lavazza coffee since living in Italy in 1971. Having tried endless different roasts and types of coffee, I've always returned to this brand. I use the drip grind (which used to be called "Milano" roast) in a french press type coffee maker. I also use the Lavazza "Gold" in my espresso maker. I find Lavazza quality to be extremely consistent.<br />I also am impressed with the Amazon prices and shipment of the coffee. As a chef and food writer, I used to buy the coffee from one of my distributors, but find your prices are even better. Sounds like I've been paid for this review, but it's all true for me.

review/summary: Wonderfully smooth!
review/text: Not knowing much about coffee, I noticed an immediate and amazing difference when I tasted this.  Make it as strong as you like, it is smooth and not bitter at all.  It has won me over and now I don't use anything else.  In regard to those who claim it's too coarse, I put it through my Delonghi coffee grinder all the time (for espresso) with excellent results.  I love it!

review/summary: Don't buy this! Too coarse
review/text: Made the mistake of ordering this product. This coffee is WAY too coarse to use. The result is that the coffee tastes weak and bland. You have to use a TON of coffee to get any taste whatsoever and even then it doesn't taste very good. Now I'm stuck with 4 cans. I may try running the grounds through a coffee grinder to see if I can get a finer grind. Very disappointed.<br /><br />May try the black can (espresso grind) in the future as that one has excellent reviews.

review/text: I'm surprised to see a lot of negative reviews about this one. If you're expecting a dark espresso taste, though, you may be disappointed. I used to prefer dark roasts, and now, because of this coffee, I've made the switch to the brighter, light roasts (brewed strong with no milk or sugar). After drinking Community Coffee, Illy, and a few others on a regular basis for years, I switched to this one with Amazon's subscribe and save and the price is right. Works great with both French press and drip coffee makers.

review/text: I found this coffee to be very disappointing. It is too light for me and so I had to make a mix by buying other expresso coffee to add to it. This made it acceptable.

review/summary: Exactly what you get when a cafe serves Lavazza. Excellent.
review/text: Learned about Lavazza when a small crepery served it, and I could not stop drinking the stuff. It's so mild, yet flavorful. And this drip ground coffee is exactly that flavor and mildness in a home brew. I did not notice a funky aftertaste as one of the reviewers has noted, it is smooth and delicious. If you like Starbucks, you'll probably think this is too weak (because even Starbucks "mild" Pike's Roast is far too strong, even burned tasting to my palate). Lavazza is smooth and mild, yet still tastes like you are drinking real coffee. I'll never go back to another brand after buying this for the first time.<br /><br />As a side note, if you want the same flavor as this coffee but prefer to grind your own (or prefer to control the coarseness of the grind), then get the whole-bean variety here: [...] It tastes almost identical when ground coarse like this drip variety.

review/text: the can states very clearly "Light roast"! How are you expecting a strong flavor from this coffee? Like another review says, taste depend on the person, but it's common sense buying a light roast expecting dark, strong flavor!. If you like smooth light coffee flavor this is the best coffee I have tried. My dad tried it and wanted it more strong, so we pour more next time, didn't work. Buy it for what it is, not what you think may be!

review/summary: Lavazza Premium Drip Coffee - Very smooth
review/text: This drip coffee is extremely smooth and as all lavazza coffees are - very high quality.  If you're a flavored coffee drinker and like to dose your coffee with sugar - do NOT do it with Premium Drip.  You don't need anything in this coffee to make it palatable.  It's a light roast which makes it very smooth so if you want a stronger coffee, you'll need to add a scoop or two to your normal brew process.  By the way, 'light roast' coffee has more caffeine so don't load up on this until you get comfortable.

Save yourself $25 and the space in your cupboard & do not waste your money on this product.

review/summary: Best Granola I've Ever Found
review/text: I'm not a fan of granola by any means: at least not until now. I have tried making my own on many occasions but the mess, expense, amount of ingredients to keep on hand and the less than satisfactory results have pretty much turned me off. I purchased this product in 3 flavors as a last ditch effort: Cherry Walnut, Almond and Maple Walnut. They arrived together in 2 days, well packaged, fresh and crunchy. Did I mention FLAVORFUL? I am a true convert. This is the best. While I like all 3, my favorite is the Maple Walnut, followed by the Almond and then Cherry Walnut (mostly because the huge dried cherries taste more like golden raisins than cherries, but still very good. I should also mention that while the dried cherries are about the size of the bowl of a teaspoon and look like they are soft and pliable, they are very hard and take a lot of careful chewing, after which they become sticky. I didn't find that texture pleasant). And when the ingredients listed walnuts or almonds, I figured it would be microscopic smooshed up pieces mixed in so small I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a sesame seed and a piece of walnut or almond. BUT, the almonds are large pieces or whole almonds while the walnuts - well, the walnuts are planet-sized: sometimes 1/2 of an entire walnut and there are tons of them in a single bag of this granola. The maple walnut is the only one I find a bit on the sticky side, but not like caramel popcorn sticky-just a bit tacky. I've already used this in yogurt, cottage cheese, oatmeal, as a snack in mid afternoon, in salads, pancakes and yesterday morning, I made Bisquick biscuits and added some of all 3 flavors as an experiment. The biscuits were marvelous. Now, if I could only remember WHAT I did so I can make them again with the same success! Try this. I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you are, you can send it to me!! :)

review/summary: Convenient 2-part frothy cappuccino. Not very strong, however
review/text: I'm going to say from the get-go, if you run an office or business where you want to serve cappuccino to guests, this is one of the easiest, best-tasting ways to serve that milky drink without a mess. However, the flavor is clearly designed with that ultimate in current vogue--NOT TO OFFEND ANYONE. It's as bland as a reading of the telephone book.<br /><br />To use this in your VUE, you pop in the Numero Uno (number one) cup and press CAFE, upon which a milk-and-water froth fills your mug or cup (I used a 10 oz cappuccino cup I happened to have.) Then you put in Numero Duo (number --forgive me, 2) and you can select regular or "strong". I chose strong because I like coffee that can strip paint from a Mack Truck. The coffee drips into the middle of the frothy milk and lo, a cappuccino.<br /><br />it does use an instant non-fat powdered milk, not a milk-and-soy-solids-and-coffee mixture that is nothing but a glorified instant creamer-coffee. Bravo for that. As I said before, this is designed for the great AVERAGE, so as not to offend a single soul. But in NOT offending, it offends those who like anything that tastes like anything, or as Colette the famous French author put it, more than "hanging your tongue out the window."  Bland, washy, watery even at full strength. No offending. But, alas, no flavor, either. I will give it points for being not too sweet, but I'd have preferred even unsweetened as bitterness would have been SOMETHING. Oh, the foam dissipates faster than tears of gratitude. But it is real dairy--so lactose intolerant people, you are on your own. Take a lactase tab if that works for you or avoid it as you would any latte from a coffee bar.<br /><br />To recycle the cups, pull off the foil from a second tab that is opposite the front tongue that sits to the front of the machine--in other words, it is on the back of the cup. You need a fingernail or two to grab that foil. Then pull slowly and carefully. Oh! The coffee pod is well-packed with coffee (hello! where was the flavor?) and it can spill out. A messy job but you can then put the translucent cup part in the recycle bin. The coffee and filter go in the garbage (it is compostable, but the FOIL is not. So if you COMPOST, a three part job. Woo.)<br /><br />Not cheap either, but convenient. And I do not see these coming down in price soon for two reasons; the current K-cup model is very widely owned and the Vue is not. And secondly, the VUE cup plastic is clearly a pricier plastic and the manufacturing takes more steps. Don't expect a cup under half a buck any time soon.

review/summary: One of the best you can get
review/text: I recently read in one of Alice Medrich's books that the best crystallized ginger comes from Down Under, and in that book she recommended Royal Pacific as one of the best brands. Since the publication of that book (1994), Royal Pacific is now known as The Ginger People. (The VERY BEST Australian ginger is produced by Buderim, Queensland, but unfortunately only 3 of their many products are available for sale in the USA.)<br /><br />Prior to trying the Baker's Cut, I had been to Penzey's and tried a small jar of their Australian Ginger (sold under their own brand so I have no idea who supplies it). There is a definite difference between the Penzey's ginger and the Ginger People's Baker's Cut; the Penzeys is noticeably sweeter, and the Baker's Cut has more heat. The ingredients on the Penzeys product is shown as "Cane sugar, ginger", whereas on the Baker's Cut is "Baby ginger, cane sugar". Since ingredient labels must begin with the highest-proportion ingredient and 'work downward', this isn't surprising.<br /><br />I use the Baker's Cut for cooking and will be finishing up the Penzey's by nibbling. ;-)  Not because the Penzeys is "better", but because the Ginger People's product has a flavor that will hold up much better when combined with other ingredients.

The recipe had molasses in it, that's all I could taste. I made some more cupcakes from the same recipe today, I added half a tin of this hoping the cakes would taste more gingery. It didn't work very well, I still only tasted the molasses.<br /><br />This ginger tastes very nice on its own like candy. I'm sure if I use it in baking with recipes without molasses, it will be more successful. Meanwhile I'm quite happy just nibbling on them. They taste good.

review/text: I understand that these little nuggets of ginger can be used in baking, but I like to eat them right out the can to settle my stomach. I have GERD, and I find these reduce the acid in my stomach, without having to take a pill. I prefer these to other versions of crystallized ginger, because the chunks are small, so the ginger taste is not over-powering, and there are no ginger fibers like one might find in bulk crystallized ginger. I have even made my own, but the ginger available on my grocery shelves is too fibrous to made good sweets.

review/summary: Ginger People cut ginger chips
review/text: This ginger is easy to use and great for cookies, cakes, salmon fillets, etc.  The product is a bit hard and has quite a lot of sugar, but I would recommend it to anyone who hates to cut up ginger all the time. I make small cheese biscuits with a bit of crystalized ginger on top, and this is perfect for that.

review/summary: Perfect for making ginger cookies
review/text: I stumbled on a single can of this product at TJ Maxx, of all places. I had a Molasses-Ginger cookie recipe just crying out to be made, so I decided to use the entire can's worth of ginger bits instead of the lesser amount that the recipe called for. The cookies turned out to be nothing short of spectacular, and even my adult son -- who claims to dislike anything made with ginger -- scarfed them right down. The individual bits are fresh, chewy, well-separated (no clumps here) and a bit sweet; for those who like desserts that are less sweet, just reduce the amount of sugar called for in your recipe. I was thrilled to find out that Amazon.com sells a 6-pack of these gems, and have now purchased them several times over; the price is definitely right! Highly recommended!

review/text: If you bake ginger cookies, you will love these.  Chopping candied ginger can be a mess, and the Spice Islands jars are very expensive.  When I make a batch of my favorite ginger cookies (Ultimate Ginger Cookies by Ina Garten), you can bet this product is in them.  The only problem is that they are tasty right out of the can and you might be tempted to eat so many that you won't have enough left for your cookies.

review/summary: Beef-N-Blah Slop
review/text: Campbells certainly has its moments, but this ain't one of 'em! This soup's got beef...it's got barley...what could possibly go wrong? Let me tell you...instead of including some onions and bell peppers...maybe some garlic, they decided to throw in a shipload of their hideous minestrone-type vegetables. The beef was overcooked, dry, and nearly tasteless. You can't even taste the barley, through the flavor of old, canned carrots. The only reason I didn't give this swill one star, is that there is undoubtedly some nutritional value to it...'caveat emptor'.

review/text: This is my favorite Campbell's Chunky soup. I eat it all the time and have it on subscribe and save. I tried Progresso beef barley, and frankly found it very bland and cancelled the subscription after one shipment. I only ordered the Progresso because I couldn't locate the Campbell soup on Amazon at the time.  I normally like Progresso soup, but far prefer Campbell's Chunky beef barley. One reviewer commented that you cannot taste the barley. Really? What I love about this soup is that there is SO MUCH BARLEY.  It's so thick that it's hard to get it to come out of the can. By far my favorite canned soup, but you had better like barley soups, because there is a lot of it in there.

review/summary: GLUTEN FREE!  So good, I had to review it!
review/text: BOTTOM LINE:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  This stuff was sooo good, I really wish I had another bowl right now. The Quantity:Price ratio takes the product down one star.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I thought the flavor was excellent, in that I could really taste the garlic, pepper, and onions.  The broth was a little salty at first, but I added a bit more water to get it to where I wanted.  I also thought it could use a little spiciness, but I feel that way about everything (I left out their oil packet and added a squirt of my own Hot Chili Sesame Oil - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZXXWM">House of Tsang Hot Chili Sesame Oil</a> and it was perfect).  It was really nice in that it had more than just your standard chicken/ msg broth flavor - it had real subtle flavor notes.<br /><br />NOODLES:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  I thought I would note that I really like the noodles in this - they are not your standard Ramen noodle, but are a form of rice noodle, similar to Vietnamese Pho.  These take a little longer to cook, but are definitely a great match for the broth.  I bought them because they are gluten free, but they make a great soup noodle in their own right.<br /><br />QUANTITY vs. PRICE:<br />I wish there was more in the bowl than what was provided.  This is what takes the product from 5 stars down to 4.  For the price, I wish there was more food - or for the amount of food, I wish it was cheaper.  To be fair, I bought this at my supermarket, and not on here, but the price is similar.

review/summary: It clears the sinuses!
review/text: I read that most "Wasabi" in the U.S. is actually mustard/ horseradish with food coloring, since real wasabi is hard to grow and therefore expensive. There is another brand of "Wasabi"-coated peas here on Amazon that got high ratings, but real wasabi was nowhere in the ingredient list (only horseradish appeared). The ingredient list on this package does say "Wasabi powder", so you know that you're getting the real thing. I'm a former cook, and I know real wasabi flavor, and let me tell you, you get a big kick out of it with every bite of these!

review/summary: Taste good and works good.
review/text: I wanted to write a quick review for this product based on my own personal experience with it.  I'm naturally very thin, so I wanted to add something to my diet to help me bulk up a little.  Well this stuff definitley works.  I've began gaining weight relatively fast since I started using this stuff.  Make sure you have a big cup to use when mixing this product with milk.  If you're over 150lbs you use 4 big scoops of it (pretty much enough powder to fill a normal sized glass), if you're under 150lbs you only need to use 2 scoops.  As for flavor, I can only speak for the "vanilla ice cream."  I really like the taste; it's actually like a treat for me.  Instead of eating a piece of candy to satisfy my sweet tooth between meals I just have a cup of this stuff.  It's relatively low in sugar so that's another plus.  So that's about it for my review.  I really have nothing negative to say about this product.

If you are already getting enough carbs and calories in your diet, stick to protein drinks, not mass gainers. For those of us who can't get enough cals & carbs, this is very good. However, i'd like to see Glutamine and BCAAs added, and of course it could be a little cheaper.

review/summary: 'Lean' Body? Yeah right
review/text: Started using whey protein as a dietary supplement when I got serious about exercising 6 months ago. Have been using the stuff you can get a Wal-Mart or Target, figured I could get a better deal on Amazon. I've been on a low-carb diet, been pretty pleased with the stuff I've previously gotten - avg about 8g a serving. Well, this stuff tops out at 77g per! My fault I guess, for not consulting the nutritional info more closely before I ordered...guess is figured whey protein is pretty much whey protein, and how different could they be. Make no mistake - this stuff if for people who seriously want to pack on size & muscle, which I didn't want either. I guess what irritated me the most was the mention of 'Lean Body' in the name...why would you name your product that if it's supposed to help you GAIN weight?? Guess I'll go back to my 'Body Fortress' stuff from Wal-Mart - thanks for nothing Labrada!

review/summary: CAVEAT EMPTOR:  buying in bulk is always risky business
review/text: *** Shopping via Amazon as marketplace, I've purchased in bulk out of convenience and my prior satisfaction rate has been 100%, this experience takes it down to 99% *** The specific item review has previously been purchased locally from the many local Asian-markets in San Francisco on many occasions, wanting to make this at home.  Familiarity with, and of product result expectation was set; having also tried the differing levels of "heat" to find my preference.  I made one-box using grass-fed, organic ground pork, adding chopped green onions for garnish and added preferential tastes post-cooking.  To my shock and dismay, the finished product had an obvious chemical taste which was undeniable, and putting over rice did not help.  Sadly, though understandably I had to toss the meal - a total loss of time and money committed on all components.  I went out to eat.  Upon return I checked the box to make the expiration had not already been met, something I should have done upon receipt but failed to do, though in the end the date was set at "March/19/2014", so that wasn't it.  The next day I tried again but used free-range ground chicken meat and the chemical-taste was still ever present, indicating the mix, not the chicken.  What's up with that taste the was never present before?  Was it the batch?  Was it the way it was handled at some point between manufacturing, warehousing, the vendor, or any of the carriers between those points or later the carrier from whom it arrived literally into my arms?  I cannot say with any certainty.  What I will say, is from this I've learned for myself, that I'll need to continue to shop locally, living in San Francisco I gave up having a car and driving years ago.  That being said I'll make the most of where and when I get to the Asian-markets, believing that they, too, can receive a bad batch but that I'd be the one to have to tell them would be less likely.  In closing, I'd remind you, dear reader, that this was my experience only, and I don't have enough info to fault any point of this transaction.  We live in a world that's come to care less in standards having been previously set for good reasons, standard that are no longer being met to be kept as signs of good faith to "buy as is" in the convenience market of products we end up buying to bring a little pleasure into our busy lives.  "Caveat emptor".  Going forward, I'll either have this item only at restaurants or have to find a recipe that is easy and that I enjoy making at home.

I just can't stop eating these.<br /><br />Even my dog freaked out watching ME go into a Food Frenzy while eating these.  Like a dog who has been waiting for his food, I turned primal with these.  YUMMY!

I have to keep sending an extra shipment because it goes so quickly in my house but for thr price I get them on Amazon I dont mind. It is the best deal you can find!

review/text: Ughh..... My gawd. These things taste awful. Has no flavor, no kick, barely even fizzes. It's rather terrible. A local charity drive received some of these and sent this off to some hungry kids in Cambodia and the kids sent the entire shipment back saying they rather risk drinking the cholera-laden water from the nearby stream. I cant recommend anyone drinking this unless they've previously had their taste buds burned off with sulfuric acid. In that case....bottoms up!<br /><br />2 stars...one extra because it's only 99 cents at most stores for when you have no money to quench the thirst and Arizona or Brisk arent available.

review/text: The selection offered in this gift set is appealing however the price volume ratio is not worth the purchase. Having reviewed the other comments and information my expectations were no where near what arrived. What did arrive was a set of boxes roughly the size of what you might get at a jewelery store and stacked the height of a barbie doll. I feel that for the cost I could have gotten some microwave popcorn, pretzel sticks and a bag of choclate and accomplished the same feat for a fraction of the cost with no dissapointment and more than likely impressed the recipant 10 times over! I would highly reccomend weighing any alternatives prior to purchasing this product first e.g. a gift bag and items found at your local grocery store if you want your monies worth.

I chose this basket because of the items that were supposed to be included - there were no chocolate covered cherries, no pistachios.  Next, don't send the package directly to the gift recipient - the treats were still in their bags, so you'll have to arrange them yourself - which is contrary to what is stated that they are "hand arranged".

review/summary: in the recipient's on words (reaction to Broadway Basketeers Ultimate Celebration Gourmet Gift Tower)
review/text: I just wanted to let you know that the snack pack was a wonderful idea for a present for us. With not only our son, his wife, and my mother here, but my son's childhood playmate, his wife and two kids coming over one afternoon, it gave us lots of ready made snacks.<br /><br />The packaging was exquisite, and in some instances much larger than the snacks. The package for the buttercrunch toffee was quite large, with 3 medium sized shiny blue rappers, with one much smaller piece of toffee inside it in yet another wrapper. On the other hand, the yogurt covered pretzels were good for my husband, being diabetic and all. The chocolate chip cookies were tiny and blah, but the honey mustard pretzels were very, very good. We liked the chocolate covered peanuts, the regular shelled peanuts, the cranberry mix, and the popcorn drizzeled in caramel and chocolate. As I already mentioned, the hot chocolate and biscotti was good and I have one more of each left to enjoy.<br /><br />Since the boxes are all lightly glued together, I can probably fill them with my own snacks or presents another year and pass them on to our son and his wife, for instance, as a gift next year.<br /><br />Thank you very much for this thoughtful gift.
