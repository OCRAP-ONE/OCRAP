review/summary: Great cookie!
review/text: My son is Autistic so being "the same" as the other kids in preschool is important. These cookies fit right in with regular animal cookies. Not sure where all the "bad reviews" are coming from but these are GREAT for a child/person with allergies. They might be a little grainy but hey almost all things made gluten casein sy free in my house tatse a little different because THEY ARE! I would definatly reccomend these and this price on Amazon is amazing! One store sells them withthin a 100 miles radius and they are $6 a box at that store so I totally score here!

review/summary: Not very tasty.
review/text: My boys were not fond of these at all.  They are used to the taste and texture of gluten free foods, but even with them being used to them, they couldn't stomach these.  I wish Amazon carried the Mi-del gluten free animal crackers, as they are very tasty and my boys love those.<br /><br />(We dipped these ones in Nutella so they'd eat these ones).

review/summary: The best cookies ever
review/text: If you have food allergies and have a difficult time finding sweets that actually taste really good, then this is the product you need to try.  Orgran company is over the top in their ingredients and flavors.  These cookies taste like those purchased at a high-end specialty store, like a homemade teacake cookie.  The chocolate ones are also very good.  You don't have to worry about anything when you snack on these.  I'm so glad I ran across these at a health food store, and now can purchase them at such a reduced cost here on Amazon.com.  Love these.

review/summary: WORST COOKIES EVER!!!!!!
review/text: Cookies are horrible!!!! Worst cookies I have had in my whole life, and I am not exaggerating. I opened one of the 8 boxes and tried to eat one. I could not finish it. It smells and tastes how you would think dry dog food would taste. Styrofoam would have been tastier. Some people may enjoy the taste, as indicated in feedback. Other than the dog food taste, they are extremely dry and bland. They were not for me or my family. Requested refund from Amazon.

review/text: It is tough to find allergen-free snacks that taste and have the texture of regular foods.  These Outback Animals are  just  like regular animal crackers.<br />My child loves them.  I give them to other kids who don't have food allergies and they like them too.  The individual snack packs make them convenient for lunch boxes.  We get both the vanilla and chocolate flavors.

review/text: My daughter loves the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK4F5A">Kinnikinnick Gluten Free Animal Crackers</a> so I thought she'd love these chocolate ones (she's a chocoholic).  But she hated them.  And when I tasted them, I could see why.  Compared to the Kinnikinnick, they were much grainier and a less favorable overall texture.  I can't recommend them.

review/summary: Great for little ones
review/text: This is a great snack/animal cracker for young children who have many allergies.  My son loves to chew on crackers of any kind, but it is very hard to find ones that are free from all the food allergies he has.  These are perfect for when I need a snack for him when we are wandering around town.  Taste wise, they are ok, but since my son is only 18 months old and eats anything he is given, he's not too picky when it comes to flavor.  For a wheat free, nut free, egg free, dairy free, soy free cookie, they are not too bad.

review/summary: Great Cookie Option for our Toddler!
review/text: Since our little one was diagnosed with multiple food allergies our options have been limited.  We make everything from scratch, of course, but sometimes, it is nice to be able to toss something in the diaper bag that requires no work and is a little sturdier than home-baked goodies.  These are it!  We can't really distinquish the animals too well, but that aside, for allergy-free treats, these cookies taste great!  Any child who doesn't take to them right away should just be offered them again & again...eventually they will appreciate them with gusto!  Our daughter did.  It is hard to adjust to allergy-free eating in general, especially if your kids have had the pleasure of tasting "normal" food.  Now she LOVES these cookies, though, and for me it is a convenient & simple treat to give her.

We recently removed soy from our diet and found many of the peanut free products we had were off limits now.  OrgraN to the rescue!  Very happy.  I will be buying the large cookies for my sons preschool class birthday party celebration.  Great deal here since my local markets do not carry OrgraN.<br /><br />Plus, I emailed OrgraN to confirm the nut free labeling included peanuts and it does.  They sent me an email listing all products and production facilities use of peanuts.  Very helpful.

review/summary: Low marks on taste
review/text: My daughter has a severe gluten allergy, so I was excited to find these cookies. However, after trying one she wouldn't touch them again. I tried one myself and was underwhelmed. The texture is crumbly and rather bland. We have tried a range of gluten free products and I find these cookies to be disappointing. I normally try a product before buying a whole case, but I was unable to find this particular brand in local stores, so I took a chance, I won't be doing that again.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: Now, I've had these cookies before and they are pretty good, but have a bit of a sandy after-taste. However, my son with multiple food allergies LOVES thems and would eat as many as I'd let him. The problem is I've bought the big box, but they tend to get stale from being open since I don't let him have cookies that often...this is the perfect solution. There are 8 mini packs in each bag keeping them fresh and easy to grab and go. Perfect for a fun or "special" snack and to have on hand in the classroom in case a friend brings an unexpected treat to which your child might be allergic. Finally a animal cracker for kids with allergies. Thanks Orgran :)

My son (who just turned 2) loves his new crackers.  It is hard to find a snack that fits into his definition of a "cracker" with all of his allergies.  Now when he asks for a cracker, I can fulfill his requests (makes a Mom's heart happy).  Now we are going to try the chocolate ones as an extra special treat.

They are also casein free, soy free, nut free, among other things "free".  And, they are made in a dedicated gluten free facility.  We used to eat the kinickinnick animal cookie.  Now, we've moved on to these.  Again, the best GF/CF/soy free cookie we've ever had.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S. Some viewers said they were "sandy".  I didn't get that at all.

There seems to be some confusion in the reviews for these Diamanti port kits as to the final volume... port kits are always 3 gallons/11L. I was able to bottle six 375ml half bottles and twelve 750ml full bottles.

review/summary: My top wine kit
review/text: Despite the bad description on Amazon about this kit I still rate this at 4 stars. Anybody who is big into making kits should know that all port kits are sold in 3 gallon kits. For the price of this kit I had no idea how well it would turn out so I bought one of these kits almost 2 years ago and I loved it so much that last December I bought 2 more. I have entered this kit into an international amateur wine competition last April and won a silver in the port category. This wine is so much better if you wait at lest a year before drinking, the longer you age it the smoother it gets. I am going to buy one or two more kits this December just so I can stay stocked up.

review/text: I was a bit skeptical, because most "sexy" costumes tend to fit a bit snug. But I'm a size 14 and the  large costume fit me perfectly! It is flattering and super fun with the buttons and ruffles. There were a few strings hanging off and the costume is a little shear in some places, but it's pretty good quality for a bag costume. The wig looked like a hot mess at first, but after fussing with it for a bit, I put it in tiny pigtails and added a fun bow and it looked super cute. I am 100% pleased with this costume and can't wait to wear it to my Halloween party this weekend!

review/summary: Decent, but not great
review/text: When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

review/summary: A staple in our home.
review/text: We bought a huge box of this from Amazon because our local store stopped carrying it. Despite Amazon's reputation for grocery prices, this actually cost us about the same with free Amazon Prime shipping.<br /><br />I dice one potato, two carrots and two chicken breasts. Toss those in a pan and cook until the chicken is mostly white. Chop up one of these curry bricks, add water and simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the vegetables are tender, thinning with water until the sauce is as thick/thin as you want. Serve over rice.<br /><br />It is cheap, easy, and a great way to get eat carrots if you don't really like them. We have that for dinner about 3-4 times a month. My husband adds a little red pepper to his, but I think the flavor is perfect like this.<br /><br />We'll definitely be getting another pack soon!

A treat made from sesame and some covered with chocolate.I didn't realize how hard it is to get ahold of it in other areas.If you have never tried it, I would highly suggest it and then you can work your way through the many other great joyvah products.

One of the main ingredients is gelatin, which is not a kosher ingredient, as gelatin is made from horse hooves and pig skins. Please remove the "kosher" designation from the description list.

review/text: The most nastiest caviar I've ever eaten in my entire life, and I know caviar, and it didn't even looked like a caviar, it looked like liquid orange paste, so nasty and so salty. This caviar is not a Russian Caviar! Because authentic Russian caviar is a good quality product and this is a rip-off and a lie! Someone from Brooklyn shipping them. So you do the math.

review/summary: Happy Valentine's Day to Me
review/text: I can't think of anything I want more on Valentine's Day than a box of Godiva truffles. They are so creamy and dreamy that they satisfy any desire for chocolate you may have. This box has milk and dark chocolate truffles. My two favorite truffles are the hazelnut praline and the smooth coconut truffles. You may also find the French vanilla to be quite delicious and creamy. There may also be a milk chocolate, dark chocolate seduction, extra dark chocolate, strawberry n' dream, cappuccino, roasted almond, double chocolate raspberry or a key lime truffle. So there is something to please everyone. Of course if you buy this for yourself you may not want to share. This is only the second box of Godiva chocolates I've ever bought and while they are expensive they are totally worth the price.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I've eaten a lot of pasta in my life. This pasta has substance -  it's chewy, not pasty like a lot of white flour pasta brands, and not gritty like a lot of whole wheat pastas.  The label says it's "slow cooked" so perhaps that's why it is so good.  Only wish it was a little cheaper, though it's certainly not a bad deal at the subscribe n save price.

review/text: Do you love the taste of licorice? If so, this tea is for you. I used to be able to buy it from retail grocery stores but they no longer carry it. It turns out that buying this online is about half the price of retail, so I win both ways (price & availability). I do not add sugar, milk or anything else to this tea. It is wonderful all by itself. However, just one bit of advice: Do NOT remove the bag after brewing. The tea is so mild, that I leave it in the cup the whole time I am drinking the tea.

review/text: I only tried this tea because it was provided free at my hotel in Oregon. That was a few years ago and I have been drinking this tasty tea ever since. You can add sugar if you want and it's good, but what I really love about this tea is that it is delicious with nothing added. Nothing's needed. Tea bag, hot water, steep, done, drink. Great for travel. Just stash some tea bags in your purse or pocket and if you have access to hot water you can have tea in an instant. I make this tea at work, too. Actually, I drink it all day long and never tire of the fresh berry taste.

review/summary: Why is this tea not famous and widely available?
review/text: You used to be able to find Stash Licorice at major grocery stores, and I'm baffled as to why it has disappeared from shelves and can only be found online. It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else. Great as an after-dinner/before-bed drink.

review/summary: Licorice lovers and health nuts, this is for you!
review/text: If you love black licorice and and would like something that also has great health benefits, you'll love this tea.  I brew this tea and drink hot, but even when it gets cold, its still great.  I often just add more cold water to it and get a very mild licorice taste that is better than just strait water.  I will do this several times until I just want more of the licorice taste, and brew some more tea.  As to the health benefits, there are many.  Here are just a few: "useful for many ailments including asthma, body odor, bursitis, canker sores, chronic fatigue, depression, colds and flu, coughs, gingivitis and tooth decay, gout, heartburn, HIV, viral infections, fungal infections, ulcers, liver problems, Lyme disease, menopause, psoriasis, shingles, sore throat, tendinitis, tuberculosis, ulcers, yeast infections, prostate enlargement and arthritis."  See [...] and click on the link licorice.  That is where this health info came from, but there is much much more info there on that web site too.  It's said to be very good for flu and colds, which I'm fighting now, and it's so very SOOTHING to my throat!  You'll love this tea.

review/summary: A loyal drinker (!) for years
review/text: Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).  The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.  It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime.  Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either.  I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.

review/text: I love the taste of this tea. It tastes exactly like licorice root and it's very refreshing. I like to make iced tea with it. However, I just read a review someone made on another licorice tea product on amazon, telling their story of licorice toxicity. I'm a fairly paranoid person, so I'm now only going to enjoy this tea about twice a week, instead of everyday like I was doing. I canceled my subscribe & save order because I don't think I can safely use up 6 boxes within the time I selected. I might be overreacting, I probably am, but better safe than sorry.

review/text: I will be honest and say that when a friend suggested I try this tea as I began getting sick last winter, I told her no way because I do not like licorice flavor.  She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?

review/text: This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it. My local grocery is out, so here I am on Amazon, buying more.<br /><br />Note that the primary source of "lemon" appears to be lemongrass. (Ingredients, via the product packaging: "Ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, and citric acid. Contains: Soy." I don't understand "Contains: Soy", but it's not listed on the ingredients... I wonder if this is an allergy alert thing.)<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, the organic version has caffeine and doesn't have any actual lemon in it... I haven't tried that one yet, though. I'm a fan of both green tea and organic products, but I don't want caffeine when I'm sick, so I'll stick with this.

review/text: To me this tea is perfect! I love licorice so this fits the bill. It's just the right amount of natural sweetness with the soft subtle licorice flavor. If I want something that bites I'll go for hot peppers, but this tea is 'GREAT' anytime of day or night!<br />I've ordered 15 boxes so far and 'will' order more.<br />Thanks for offering such a great product.

review/summary: Best flavor for Licorice lovers
review/text: I tried Licorice spice at a B and B in Maine and absolutely loved it.  I can't always find it at a kitchen or grocery store so Amazon came to my rescue.  I now purchase a case at a time.  The clove and licorice flavors are wonderful and very soothing.  Very nice to have at Christmas time!

review/summary: Really Great Tea
review/text: A friend introduced me to Licorice Tea many years ago by asking for a cup at a restuarant. When the server stated that the restuarant did not have Licorice tea, she took a packette out of her handbag and asked for a cup of hot water. She had an extra packette for me to try. WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf. I placed my order for the Pack of 6 to save on shipping and should now have sufficient tea bags for several months. Individually, foil wrapped tea bags keeps the flavor fresh.

review/text: Stash Licorice Spice tea is so soothing. I can't always drink a caffenated tea, although I love it. Before I have anything in my stomach, Licorice tea is wonderful and soothing. I can't find it anywhere else but at Amazon. It does not have a strong licorice flavor, which I know some people don't care for.

review/summary: super yummy sweet taste!
review/text: If you aren't familiar with the taste, I can only suggest you try it before you end up with 6 boxes of the stuff.  But if you are a committed lover of this tea, then Amazon's Subscribe and Save is REALLY a great deal!  Definitely not for people who do not like the taste of black licorice.  I personally steep the tea for longer than advised on the package but I like my teas strong (package says 3-5 minutes, I go for 10).  I have turned some of my licorice loving friends onto it - 1 is a diabetic and she LOVES it since it gives a really sweet flavor with NO sugar or carbohydrates.  It is wonderful on a cold evening and won't keep you awake as there is NO caffeine.

review/text: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this tea! I don't even like licorice, my friend encouraged me to taste it, as she was so pleased with it. I did not realize (as the packaging box states) that herbal teas contain no true tea leaves, but are created from an international collection of herbs and spices such as licorice, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise and sarsaparilla. It is a perfect after dinner tea. I live in Michigan and those wintery nights are good for a cup of this caffeine free tea.

review/text: I love Red Tea by Stash.  It is very difficult to find in my local supermarkets.  I asked if one would special order, and they hemmed and hawed.  So a friend suggested I check Amazon.com for the tea.  And in just a short time I had a huge stock of Red Tea.  It is great that this was so convenient and easy to shop.

review/summary: I like this tea!
review/text: Well, what's to be said other than I really like this Licorice Spice Tea?<br /><br />I cut out sugar and reduced my caffeine intake over the last year or so and this licorice tea is my favorite replacement for a caffeinated hot drink. Because I have a sweet tooth I usually now drink tea and coffee with soy milk to reduce the bitterness. This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor). I have at least one or two cups a day, and even if I was to return to my previous high regime of caffeination I would still include a cup or two of this tea during the day.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of chamomile and this Licorice spice tea does not seem to list that as an ingredient.<br /><br />It seems many people don't like the flavor of licorice, but those that do really like this tea.<br /><br />I've found that the flavor of each batch seems to vary in intensity and the last batch I bought had a less strong taste which simply means it needs to be steeped a little longer.<br /><br />Scratching around for other things to say, my only concern about Stash teas is what appears to be plastic coated aluminum sashes that the teabags are sealed in. That does a great job in terms of sealing in flavor, but I'd rather it wasn't either plastic or aluminum coated. Maybe there's no good alternative.<br /><br />The only other thing is that the latest boxes have changed the design of the semi-circular hole at the bottom of the box and the new design makes it near impossible to easily remove a sachet. You'll be attacking it with the scissors or opening the box lid to get them out.<br /><br />But what really matters is the flavor and this is simply the best!

review/text: Licorice Spice is my most favorite daily tea flavor. Earl Grey is what I take in the winter instead of coffee. Stash's Licorice Spice is very strong, not weak like some other teas I've tried with this flavoring. If you had a Licorice Spice Tea years ago and wondering if you should get this, just know I'm glad I did!

review/summary: Hands down my favorite tea!
review/text: I've been "addicted" to this tea for years and glad that it has become more widely available.<br /><br />A few weeks ago my cousin and I were discussing our love of tea.  I put forth Licorice Spice as my favorite and she said her all time favorite was, surprisingly enough, a tea made by Aveda - the haircare company - called Comforting Tea.  She lamented that she found it hard to find and described the taste to me.  I immediately told her that she had to try Licorice Spice then.  A few days after my recommendation she emailed me that she had tried the Stash tea and it was EVEN BETTER than the Aveda one!  I so do love making converts!<br /><br />As an added bonus, I've discovered after many nights of letting the tea steep, forgetting about the cup I've made, but not wanting to waste the tea bag - it tastes really good cold too!

review/text: I bought this recently, not paying attention to brand.  When I got it home, I realized it was Stash, and thought, oh, no, here comes the weak tea!<br /><br />Indeed, as with other of their teas, it is weak.  I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea, and it was still pretty weak in flavor.  When I've made hot tea with it, I need two tea bags.<br /><br />The flavor is ok--I love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberry--but it's really just too weak overall.  Will not purchase again.

review/summary: SOY??? WHY?
review/text: Maybe I didn't read the ingredient list thoroughly, because I was not expecting to find SOY in my tea!! What a disappointment! I called Stash to find out if the soy was GMO, and...the woman in customer service guarenteed me the suppliers sell them non-GMO soy. If this is the case, they really should label it as such. I like the flavor though, it's very soothing and gentle on the tummy (hence the three stars). The only way I will order again is if they start labeling the soy as non-GMO, i can't trust the product without a label!<br /><br />PS: after reading ingredient list again, I found NO mention of soy...

review/summary: Try this for Sore Throat or to Wind Down!!!
review/text: First of all, I am a tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea all my 60 years of life and I LOVE tea.  Stash is a wonderful tea and they have a tremendous line of delicious flavors out there right now. Stash chamomile is caffeine free.<br /><br />Now, let me share one of Kathy W's secrets with you. (S-h-h-h-h-h...) Chamomile tea is EXCELLENT for sore throats, scratchy throats, any throat irritation.  I first learned about Chamomile tea from my Greek neighbors. YaYa and PaPu always gave the grandchildren Chamomile tea whenever they got sick.  It not only is very soothing but it somehow soothes throat irritations.  Over the years, I have found that if I get a sore throat, I drink 2 cups of chamomile tea, one behind the other, and my throat STOPS hurting.  If it starts again the next day, I repeat the procedure, and it stops again.<br /><br />I rarely get sick now-a-days, and if I get a bug, it passes through and out real quick, but I have turned many a friend and co-worker on to my little secret.  It works!  Chamomile brews/steeps as a yellow tea and it has a different taste than black tea.  So, if the taste is strange to you initially, you will probably get used to it quickly.  I assure you, it beats the heck out of having a sore throat.  For a sore throat, you can also add honey if you want.  Honey makes it even more smooth and soothing.<br /><br />Some people also like a cup of chamomile tea before bedtime because it is soothing and helps them wind down.<br /><br />So, when you use this for a sore throat, and you realize it helped you or your children, do me a favor.  Look up to heaven and say Thank You to YaYa and PaPu Harjandrou for sharing this special secret with all of us.<br /><br />God Bless you all.<br /><br />(Note: I am not a doctor.)
