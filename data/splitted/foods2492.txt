review/text: Over the past few weeks, I have had the opportunity to try these Nabisco Honey Maid Graham Crackers, and also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BKHX1Y">Back To Nature Apple Cinnamon Oat</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BKLHOS">Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat</a> Graham Crackers.<br /><br />These are good, not too crumbly, break easily, and make nice snacks.  However, in direct comparison, they come in second to the Back to Nature Honey Oat Crackers.  Back to Nature has a more pronounced honey flavor.  They also have only natural ingredients.  Nabisco can earn an extra star from me by eliminating the artificial flavor and replacing it with more natural honey.

review/summary: Graham Cracker Memories
review/text: Graham crackers were our staple snack as we were growing up. We ate them with milk or peanut butter. In the hot and muggy days of summer the crackers would get soggy even though we wrapped them in wax paper. The Honey Maid Fresh Snacks people have come up with something practical and appealing in the wrapped packs of 6. They won't go stale. Ideal for packing the the kids' lunches or enjoying an after school treat. They could be a lunch time lift for busy parents or a pick me up at coffee break time. Enjoy FRESH Honey-Maid packs anytime.

review/summary: Familiar taste, new packaging, worth the price?
review/text: These crackers are exactly what you expect from Honey Maid - familiar graham taste, serrated lines for breaking the crackers, etc.  The big development (if you will) here, are the "fresh stacks" - that is, slightly different packaging from the originals. Instead of four-panel crackers sealed in two packets within the box, you get six stacks of eight, two-panel (half of the original) crackers.<br /><br />The packets are not reseal-able and each contains what the nutrition facts consider to be two servings (one serving is four squares and each packet contains 8 squares).<br /><br />As with many grocery items that are packaged for convenience (baby carrots, pre-sliced apples, etc.) you pay more.  If you're looking for an easy, pre-packed snack for an outing...I suppose this helps but it is up to you to decide whether your time is worth the extra cost here.

review/summary: Great Idea for Freshness, But Execution Suffers
review/text: Sometimes, there's just nothing else that'll satisfy a snack-tooth.  Graham crackers and milk have been calming me since probably 1959, my first year in Sunday school.  I'm a single woman, and a traditional box of graham crackers gets, maybe, 1/4th consumed in a year.  The rest go stale and get thrown away.  This idea of "snack sized" packs of graham crackers is super!<br /><br />The box has six small packs of graham crackers in it, and the graham crackers are not the traditional "four square" size, but "two square" size.  Doesn't matter the size to me, but the flavor of the graham cracker does.  And these Honey Maids are, in my humble snacky opinion, the best graham cracker on the market.  In each snack pack, there eight "two square" crackers in a fresh stack package.  I'd call that a serving.  Honey Maid calls that two servings, so watch the nutritional numbers.<br /><br />I found the crackers to be, largely, crumbled and broken.  Granted, I have never consumed crackers that have been mailed to me, so this could be a problem of shipping, rather than Honey Maid's problem.  The corner of the Honey Maid box (not the shipping box from Amazon) was bent and crushed, so I will assume that the crackers don't normally run into this problem when you purchase them in the grocery store.  The broken-ness of the crackers dented my enjoyment of the grahams, as I tend to like to dip them in milk for just a second.  There wasn't much to dip at times!<br /><br />Flavor=great.  Idea of individual size servings = ideal!  Nutritional breakdown on package = a bit misleading.  Physical quality of mailed crackers = not so much.<br /><br />That said, I'll look for them in stores, where I can monitor their transport from shelf to home.  Thanks, Honey Maid!

review/summary: Small Packets Stay Fresher With No Waste
review/text: Nabisco Honey Grahams have always been a favorite in our house and now they found a new way to package them in convenient smaller packets. With 8 squares to a packet, this means you'll always get a fresh and crispy graham cracker every time. These squares can be conveniently snapped in half on the dotted line down the center. The square shapes are perfect for S'mores. The honey grahams have so much more taste than plain graham crackers, that they even taste good just by themselves. Half a pack which is 4 squares are only 130 calories, so if you like to add a little butter, jelly, fruit or anything else for taste, adding a thin spread will still be in line with anyone counting calories.<br /><br />The best thing about this packaging is you'll never have waste. In our house, we don't eat crackers on a daily basis, and I always end up tossing the unfinished box away months later when the crackers are stale because they are no longer crisp. Nabisco has combined their great tasting honey grahams with a great packaging which will end up being a great money saver in the end.

review/summary: Classic Graham Crackers with Updated Packaging
review/text: These graham crackers have been around forever and taste great as usual. This particular packaging is an improvement because instead of 1 or 2 packages in a box for all the crackers, this has six packages in a box. So you have less crackers per package which is better since the other crackers won't get stale. Unless you eat a lot of crackers at once this is an improvement over the normal type of packaging.

review/summary: Great snack size and S'more size!
review/text: These grahams are packaged in squares instead of rectangles which makes them perfect for grabbing to throw in a diaper bag or in your purse for quick snacks!  There are 8 squares per package and my husband pointed out the fact that this was perfect for S'mores making for our family since we don't have to try to break the graham into perfect squares now and 1 fresh stack is enough for 4 s'mores.<br /><br />The grahams are fresh and as great tasting as always, Honey Maid is a staple in my pantry, and I have to say that these "Fresh Stacks" are going to be the new packaging I buy from now on!  What a great idea for them to move away from the rectangles into a more ready to snack shape.

review/summary: A Familiar Favorite
review/text: These are the same Honey Maid Graham Crackers we all grew up with. Generally accepted as a healthier alternative to store bought cookies, they still offer enough sweetness to satisfy that craving for sugar that most of us have from time to time. The only real difference here is that instead of the old rectangular crackers in 4 sections, they are half-size squares of 2 sections (I remember breaking the full size crackers into 4 smaller sections before eating them). I guess the thought is that the smaller size packages will be less likely to get stale before eating this way.<br /><br />I am ambivalent to the change in cracker size personally, and certainly wouldn't pay extra for it (fortunately, it appears that Nabisco isn't charging extra for the value add). Five stars because I love the graham crackers. P-)

review/summary: Convenient but lacking taste
review/text: I've always enjoyed graham crackers, well at least I did before I started eating healthy.<br /><br />The individual packages are convenient.  But beware of handing a small child an entire package which amounts to 250 calories.<br /><br />Kudos to Nabisco/Kraft for providing the "nutritional facts" both in the absurd "serving size" and also for an entire "fresh stack".<br /><br />I found these to be rather dry and what I might term "stale" tasting even though I'm sure they are fresh.  They don't always break cleanly on the "dividing line".  I'd like to see a softer, more moist product.

review/summary: Tasty To-Go Treats
review/text: I had forgotten how good plain graham crackers are (you know, when they're not the bookends of s'mores...).  These are the same tasty Honey Maid graham crackers, essentially broken in half (two of the small rectangles, instead of the large "brick" of four rectangles) and stacked up.  There are 8 of these "halves" in a sealed pack, which turned out to be two servings.  (I didn't notice that at first, but it is worth acknowledging, if you have concerns about portion size and/or calories.)<br /><br />This box didn't last a week at our house (hey, it's 6 packs per box, which is officially 12 "servings") but I see the definite advantage of having the crackers sealed into smaller packages, as they would be less likely to get stale.  I also stashed a pack in my purse on my way to work (very convenient).  They would be equally convenient for tossing into the diaper bag.<br /><br />No qualms about buying these in the future, though I have not yet seen them at the grocery store.  But the grahams I received from Amazon were fresh, so I would not hesitate to purchase them from here in the future.  Yum.

review/summary: Convenient Packaging
review/text: I loved Honey Grahm Crackers when I was growing up and these have the same flavor. I can see someone saying the perfect size to make Smoores or ice cream sandwich. Instead of the long 4 piece packaging with many crackers this has a small package of 2 servings of crackers. The package could even fit in you shirt pocket of a t-shirt. Another convenience is when you open this package you will most likely eats them before they get stale which may not always be the case in the large packaging depending on your families size.<br /><br />The down size is if you are looking for something for your child's lunchbox each package is two serving sizes. The package is 250 calories of which 50 calories is fat. So you would not be want to pack a full package. As for myself I found them just as tasty as I remember and a satisfying snack. This is old time favorite in a smaller wax paper package. 4.5 stars.

review/summary: CHILDHOOD TREAT IS STILL FUN TO EAT
review/text: Nabisco has repackaged its popular Honey Maid Graham Crackers in what might be called a "snack pack." It's just a smaller box to make it easier to snack at home-- or take with you if you want to snack on the go. The product comes in six fresh stacks; same value, same classic taste. I easily finished off two stacks in two days. I prefer my graham crackers to have cinamon (which these don't); just to give it a little extra flavor. But these are still the perfect afternoon snacks. I recommend washing these down with a big glass of milk; which also makes for fun dunking.

review/summary: Same delicious taste in smaller packages
review/text: The traditional large-size graham crackers are broken into two squares and packed in separate, waxed-paper packets. These are probably a better choice for kids' lunchboxes and adults' lunch bags, too. And in humid climates, will keep leftovers - which get soggy - to a minimum. So, a good idea, and the waxed paper is low-impact enough that it shouldn't matter much that the packaging is increased.

review/summary: Fresh, well packaged, just like I remember them!
review/text: These are almost just like I remember them when these were a treat growing up.  The difference is, rather than having a large rectangular 4 section cracker to deal with - that never broke in half right, these boxes have 6 square packages in the box, each package has 8 square crackers.  Each package is wrapped in a wax-paper-colored plastic bag, sealed well for freshness, but not sealed so hard that you get mad opening the bag.  There is a slight scoring in each square cracker and if you are careful, you can break each in half, but in my case, that's not needed - a square at a time makes for a great treat.  Goes perfect with milk!<br /><br />Enjoy

review/text: Great idea, providing SMALLER graham crackers in SMALLER packages. Ideal for packing lunches. More than a grade-schooler could polish off in one lunch, however, so you may find yourself breaking down even these smaller packages into zip-top bags when you're packing lunches in the morning. I like Honeymaid graham crackers better than the generic graham crackers in the market. This is a good idea, but I'd have made this box with TWELVE little packs of graham crackers instead of six.<br />---<br />My teenagers have DEVOURED these packets. They do not appear to feel that the number of crackers in each one is any kind of issue. Our last box of graham crackers lasted months. These were gone in a week.

review/summary: Nice on-the-go packaging and tasty product
review/text: This package comes with 6 eight graham cracker pouches.  The pouches are made of the same type of material (wax paperish) that normal honey grahams come in, so it's difficult, if not impossible, to re-seal them in their own packaging if you don't eat the entire 8 cracker sleeve in one sitting.  The advantage of this packaging is that it's smaller portions than a normal pack of honey grahams, so they're good for a snack or with a meal.<br /><br />They are a little hefty on the nutritional side of things.  One of the 6 packs has 250 calories, 6 grams of fat (1.5 saturated) and 46g of carbs.  Probably not something you'd want to eat every day, but there are worse things out there for you!<br /><br />Honey grams are a great tasting cracker, my favorite of any graham cracker brands.  The box I received had freshly packed crackers that were not stale.  If they price is right (sometimes products charge way too much for 'convenient' packaging) then this is a great buy.

review/summary: What took them so long?
review/text: Honey Maid Fresh Stacks are the same Honey Maid Graham crackers you know and love, just packaged differently.  8 fresh little graham squares to a packet, just right for school lunches or tossing in your pocket or bike bag.  Each packet would provide 260 calories, so even at this size it might be a bit big when compared to all the 100 calorie snack packs out there.<br />I don't know anyone that doesn't love graham crackers.  But the staleness issue is universal.  Once the little tan package has been opened, the crackers have a limited life span.  This will definitely allow those of us without lots of graham cracker eaters in the house to have fresh ones on hand.<br />The perfect size for smores, these are packed as squares, or half the large rectangles we are used to.  But even the square size is hard to eat without getting crumbs everywhere.  The only improvement I would suggest is a more rectangular, snack friendly shape.  Of course, that would make smores difficult.<br />In any case, the breakthrough with this product is in the packaging.  I abhor over-packaging of any kind (even the above mentioned 100 calorie snack packs of various snacks).  Its not cost-conscious, and its not friendly to the environment.  But I'll give Honey Maid a pass in this situation.  It doesn't add up to be much more packaging than before, but will result in far less waste.<br />Great idea!

The difference is that they are being packaged differently in more efficient snack sizes. Having put this to the test I can honestly say that this is one instance where packaging does make a difference. Grahams tend to go soft if left open for too long. In this case by wrapping them in portion sizes it allows you to maintain freshness for longer. Good idea Nabisco!

review/summary: The Same Crackers Found in Campfire S'Mores
review/text: Lingering evenings by campfires, sitting on old stumps, fumbling through the delicious art of s'more making always involves Honey Maid honey grahams. These are those crackers.<br /><br />Unlike their classic brethren, these are batched in six packs of eight crackers. Otherwise, they are the same. Future campfires can include passing out a pack to each person (I dare not say child, knowing adults love them as well).<br /><br />The recipe is simple:<br />* Two crackers make a sandwich around a piece of milk chocolate and a marshmallow.<br />* Hold tightly together (but not too tight) over a fire with tongs.<br />* When the chocolate and marshmallow melt just enough to be squishy, eat.<br />* Wash down with hot chocolate.<br /><br />Eight crackers are also just enough for a snack, as I am having now, accompanied by orange juice.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: I have not eaten a graham cracker in a very long time.  These are nice with a crunchy crisp taste and honey flavor.  They are conveniently packed in smaller packages that hold 8 crackers each.  Easy to pack for a lunch or take on a day trip.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the flavor of these graham crackers and would recommend them.

review/text: What I expect a graham cracker to be like. These could easily qualify as comfort food for most people.<br /><br />They seem to have the right amount of honey which is just a touch. Also they have a nice healthy cruch when you bite into them.<br /><br />Earlier in the day that I received these cookies I had been repairing fences. As I was a bit hungry I was happy to find that these had been delivered. These honey grahams sure hit the spot.

review/summary: Who Doesn't Like Graham Crackers
review/text: These crackers come packed in small 3x3 inch squares that are easy to toss into a lunch bag or to pack for a trip or snack while on the road in a car, airplane, etc. Each pack contains 8 crackers with a total of 250 calories and these crackers are quite tasty and filling as well. There is about 16g of sugar per pack, which is about 1/2 of one can of soda. Each pack also contains 14% of your daily sodium and 9% of your daily fat content, but no trans fats.<br /><br />The crackers would also be perfect for smores by a campfire and are just the right size, about 1/2 the size of the large sized graham crackers I remember as a child.<br /><br />It is a very filling snack and I enjoy these crackers and would recommend them to anyone who wants to have a few good snacks to toss into a lunch bag or for after school.

review/summary: Same Honey Maid product in a much easier size
review/text: These are the tried and true graham crackers that we all know but the small square size is a big improvement.  I suppose if you're making s'mores the original size might be better, then again s'mores built on this smaller platform would work out nicely too I bet.  These square graham crackers, as best I can tell, do not have the perforated lines that the original size has.  The lines that suggest you could cleanly break them into four neat pieces but rarely do.  However, this size is very easy to break in half with fairly even results.  I withhold one star for the partially hydrogenated oil, the artificial flavoring, and the fact that there is more white flour than whole-grain graham flour.

review/summary: Quite Good
review/text: Honey Maid graham crackers are a staple in my home. We've tried other brands, but none can match the grahamy flavor Honey Maid. While I was initially a bit disappointed the crackers do not come doubled up like the standard graham crackers, it soon becomes clear why. Keeping the crackers smaller and more tightly packaged, preserves the crisp quality of the crackers making them exceedingly fresh.<br /><br />Graham crackers have been around a long time. They first were produced as a brand in 1829 by a Presbyterian minister as a way of curbing... Unwanted `carnal' desire.  I didn't realize that, but while researching for this review I found that amusing- While I can't say that graham crackers work that way for me, they certainly do make a great snack.<br /><br />To further the taste-test on these crackers I offered some to my sister and mother and they were both quite pleased with the fresh crisp quality of these cookies.

review/summary: Difficult Packaging
review/text: The appeal of this specific product is suposed to be the packaging. The individual stacks of crackers are smaller than typical.<br /><br />Well, it falls a little short. The packages aren't anywhere near single-serving. There are 8 2-3/8" squares in each hard to open pouch. That's about twice -- close to three times -- what I would consider a single serving.<br /><br />The pouches are so thick, you either need a sicsors or knife to open them, and there is no way to roll them closed again. You either need to plan on finishing them before they go stale, or find another container to store them in. Hardly what I'd choose to call "fresh stacks".<br /><br />The crackers themselves were fine. Nothing spectacular one way or the other about them. But then again, we're talking about a pretty utilitarian cracker here, so one person's spectacularly good would be someone else's spectacularly bad. So not much to say there.<br /><br />All in all, unless the size of the pouches are just the size you usually want, it's not worth paying extra for these. I'm just going to get regularly packaged crackers, and store them in a larger plastic bag to keep them fresh. If I'm going to need a plastic bag anyway, why pay extra for these harder to get open pouches that need to be opened more often, too?

review/text: These graham crackers are a lot better tasting than the organic graham crackers that I have tried. And compared to other brands (generic) I much prefer the crunchy sweetness of Honey Maid. The graham crackers taste so fresh and are the best for dunking in milk or tea. I love these as an alternative to cookies. Fortunately, the packaging ensures that the last graham cracker is as good and crispy as the first one. The portable and palatable treats are great for kids or anyone on the go (and for making perfectly shaped s'mores).

review/summary: Gimmicky packaging
review/text: These aren't bad graham crackers, but they're not great, either (I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OBYNQW">Keebler</a>).  Cheaper store-brand crackers might be just as good, depending on your preferences (and store), and the "convenience" of smaller pouches seems be designed purely as a cost-saving (less product per box) function for Nabisco.<br /><br />I was initially intrigued by the new packaging concept.  I like having the crackers split into squares, and the smaller pouches are a good idea.  But if they're going to do it this way, I wish they had made the pouches single serving (rather than two servings).  Otherwise, there's just not a lot of point to having smaller pouches.  And the pouches are impossible to open without using scissors or breaking the crackers in the process.<br /><br />And speaking of broken crackers, probably two-thirds of my crackers were broken on arrival.  This is probably from shipping, so if having whole crackers is important for your purposes, you might think twice about ordering these online.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a bad product, but just be aware of what you're getting (just 12.2 ounces divided into six pouches).

review/summary: Same treat... a little better package
review/text: I'm not going to get too terribly excited about this, but it probably makes sense for some folks.  Basically what Nabisco has done is to package those addicting Honey Maid Graham Crackers in half groups.  Huh? The standard way of grouping the product is to  put them in stacks of full-size crackers, each of which breaks into four smaller pieces.  So the innovation here is to split the crackers in half.  And to add insult to injury, two of these half crackers are smaller than one of the "old" ones.<br /><br />So the benefit here is that there is less likelihood that the crackers will get stale in the box, due to the fact that you'll have fewer of them in an open wrapping than before.<br /><br />What I'd like to know however, is why did they stop there?  Why couldn't they have come up with a better form of wrapping the stacks that wasn't so damnably irritating to open?  That might have received four stars from me.  This only gets three, and only because the crackers are still so tasty!

review/text: This was one of the freshest, crunchiest graham crackers I have ever tried, the individual packages are too big for a single serving, so it is a good idea to have someone to take it away from you before you eat almost 3 servings of graham crackers.<br />I think packing the crackers in single serving sizes would have been more useful.<br />The overall product package is not protective enough to make this a good item for ordering over the internet, I was sent a single box and in each individual package you were lucky to find a single unbroken cracker.<br />The only bright side of ordering this from Amazon would be if you really like making desserts with graham cracker crusts and would like your crackers to come pre-crushed.<br /><br />Final thoughts<br />Tasty item, individual packages too big to be a single serving, overall package is not protective enough to survive Amazon's rather inconsistent packing process.

review/summary: Fresher than ever!!!
review/text: These individually packed graham crackers by Honey Maid are such a  great idea. The crackers stay fresh and crispy and you don't have to stress over eating the entire pack because you fear they will become stale. These are a great idea for children or individuals who want a nice,quick, and easy snack that has a great package that's very effiecent.<br /><br />I will defiently buy this newly packaged graham crackers so that I can have a simple snack and not have to worry about binging on an entire pack of crackers. The packaging does not travel well but if you place it on the top of the lunch bag or purse then you have a nice fresh snack perfect for work or school.<br /><br />In today's society with many children overeating and becoming more overweight I think that small steps like these can help parent's maintain control with some of the overindulgence that has been going on with our children. Great idea Honey Maid and good job.

review/summary: Fresher, Honey Graham Snack Packs
review/text: I love Honey Maid graham crackers! These "Fresh Stacks" are the same recipe as their longer cousin. It's like the long ones only snapped in half and packaged in stacks of 8. There are 6 packages of 8 in each box.<br /><br />It's a good idea. Smaller packages allow you to open and not have to save the remainder of the package for many days, thus crackers are fresher. If you make smores (with roasted marshmellows and chocolate) these are already the optimal size. And because they are smaller than the regular size, they'll fit in a bag or lunch much easier.<br /><br />One thing to watch out for is that the individual packages are not single serving, there are two servings inside - a total of 260 calories.<br /><br />So, this has all the flavor, in the size I usually break them into anyway. A winning combination.

review/summary: Almost perfect
review/text: These graham crackers are delicious and perfect for taking on camping trips or picnics where s'mores are an option, since they're already just the right size-- no breaking larger crackers into uneven halves!  The little packets really cut down on the tendency of grahams to go stale before you've used them.  However, it would actually have been even better if the folks at Honey Maid had put these in packets about half this size, so that my family and I could have a single serving per pack in our lunches.  As it is, they're very calorie-laden and one little pack should be about two servings of crackers, which leaves you needing to store the other two or three until you're ready for them, meaning you'll need another bag to hold them in the mean time or some other method of keeping them from leaking graham crumbs and sugar all over your bag.<br /><br />All in all though, these are a great idea.  They're certainly perfect for group snacking, and with just a tiny adjustment they'd also be ideal for single serve.

review/summary: Same Honey Grahams - more convenient packaging
review/text: These are the same Honey Graham Crackers we grew up on, in a new package to keep them fresh.<br /><br />If you are one of those who finds yourself throwing away the rest of your graham crackers because they get stale, you'll find these Fresh Stacks a more convenient way of keeping them fresh. They come 8 squares to a package, and can be more handily used in this smaller size package.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for something to carry with you (lunch, snack, etc.) you need to note that these packages are each TWO servings. What is nice is that the package clearly notes the nutritional value for both the single serving AND the package size. The package size has 250 calories and 6 grams of fat, as well as 46 grams of carbs - a "hefty" snack for anyone trying to moderate either item. In fact, if you add peanut butter to these (I keep the individual packs of peanut butter on hand, which could be easily used with these), you hit 500 calories.<br /><br />While I appreciate the convenience, I would most likely compare the price with the "regular" packaging before I purchased these, and carry the individual servings in a sandwich bag. Good idea ... just don't assume one serving per package. ;-)

review/summary: 5-star product at an appalling price....
review/text: Honey Maids are the only brand of graham crackers I buy, and my kids and I go through at least a box a week. We love their relative healthfulness - 5 grams of whole grains to 8 grams of sugar per serving is much better than cookies, fruit snacks, and even many brands of granola bars - and we love their incomparable great taste. The boxes we usually buy at the store contain big packs of rectangular-shaped grahams that really don't transport that well, but these little packages contain two serving sizes worth of crackers in easy-to-handle squares and are just perfect for snacking on the go. I love them!<br /><br />In my experience, Amazon Grocery prices vary greatly from item to item... I've found wonderful savings on some things and head-shakingly high prices on others. The current price on these crackers is nearly twice what I pay for the slightly larger, traditional boxes at the local grocery, so I certainly won't be stocking up here and now, regardless of the convenience. But I'll be sure to keep my eye out for a better deal in days to come!

review/summary: These are your grandfather's graham crackers.
review/text: Here is one product that seems to have been left unmodified for generations.  This is a review of HOENY MAID FRESH STACKS HONEY GRAHAMS.  The product consists of a total 345 grams of graham cracker.  This is about one third of a kilogram.  To provide some perspective, the typical adult in America weighs about 65 kilograms.<br /><br />The crackers come in a box, and in the box are six envelopes, each envelope containing 8 square-shaped graham crackers.  The American consumer, and perhaps people in Europe, might be more used to graham crackers that are rectangular shape.  Apparently, the goal of using only 1/2 crackers that are square, instead of full-crackers that are rectangular, are to extend freshness, for those who only eat graham crackers once in a while.  Yet another reason for this new packaging is likely to prevent breakage, that might occur with the traditional rectangular crackers, during transportation.<br /><br />But a more likely reason is to allow people to take individual servings with them, perhaps on trips, to school, or to work, with the confidence that the crackers will be kept safe, secure, and intact.  In my opinion, and perhaps those of others, one serving amounts to 8 crackers.  Thus, the great benefit of the HONEY MAIN FRESH STACKS product is not really "freshness," but ease in packing an individual serving for school or trips.<br /><br />Now for the good part.  The crackers taste just the same as they have for generations, at least to this palette.  When I opened one package, I got the whiff of vanilla.  Or anyway, it was a pleasant aroma.  The color is light brown, perhaps the color of your favorite puppy, or perhaps the color of a stone formation at one of the National Parks in Utah.  The flavor is graham flavor.  The texture of this product is on the soft side.  Compared to another type of cracker, for example, SALTINES, the HONEY MAID graham crackers are softer and less cracky.  To conclude, I would not characterize this food as "an adventure," but I might be tempted to call the HONEY MAIN graham cracker, addictive.<br /><br />According to a well known source (Wikipedia), Graham flour is a type of whole wheat flour named after the American Presbyterian minister Rev. Sylvester Graham (1794-1851), an early advocate for dietary reform.  Graham despised processed white flour and believed that bran was the cure-all for the bad eating habits of his compatriots.<br />Rather than simply grinding the whole grain wheat kernel (bran, germ, and endosperm), in graham flour the components are ground separately. The endosperm is ground finely, initially creating white flour. The bran and germ are ground coarsely. The two parts are then mixed back together, creating a coarse-textured flour that bakes and keeps well. Graham flour is used to make graham crackers and pie crusts, among other things.  It should be noted that the nutritional label on the HONEY MAID box clearly reads, "graham flour."

I love to make peanut butter and graham cracker snacks, and each of these individually wrapped packs contains eight squares each (the packaging indicates "About 8 Crackers") which turns out to be just the right amount [typically] to avoid leaving open leftovers in the box to lose crispness.<br /><br />The crackers are already in a square shape for many baking and snacking needs. Although the crackers have the signature dashed score on the cracker, I have yet to be able to break it straight across as I could with the full sized rectangular crackers.<br /><br />These are the same delicious Honey Maid graham crackers they've always been, only now they're available in this fresh-pack option that's even more convenient for a brown bag lunch than the original form.

review/text: First thing I have to say is that these are the regular honey maid grahams.  I like them.  They are a good product.  I would generally give this product five stars.  My two stars are for the packaging.<br /><br />If I were to buy these, I would just buy them in the standard pack.  They are a lot cheaper than these smaller wrapped stacks.  They have basically taken a couple of graham crackers, broken them in half (literally, they are not produced in smaller pieces, they have been broken in half), and package them in smaller bundles.  These bundles are appropriate for 2 or 3 kids.  There are too many grahams to be individually wrapped.  If it were me, I would break a couple, throw them in a baggie, and save a little money and packaging.<br /><br />All in all, I will continue to buy this brand.  My kids prefer it.  I won't buy them in this packaging.  As a side note, this and ritz type crackers, I don't buy from Amazon.  These came obliterated.  Seriously, I didn't have a single one that wasn't broken.  This is a grocery store item.

review/text: As a parent on the go, you always are trying to fill a bag at the last minute with snacks for the kiddo's. This is why string cheese, banana's and these new "fresh stacks" are great. We also like the Ritz version. Just grab a small pack as you are heading out the door and you have a quick PB and Graham Cracker Sandwich or a simple snack on its own.<br /><br />We love them and the kids love them. Winner!

review/summary: Not for the Health Conscious
review/text: These Honey Maid Fresh Stacks are good portable snacks great for carrying in a bag or purse for those times when a person needs a quick "pick me up" The snack is a smaller version of the popular Nabisco Honey Maid Graham Crackers.  Each pack has eight  graham crackers that are about 25 percent the size of the original cracker.  They provide a tasty treat, advertized at 24 grams if carbohydrate and 130 calories.<br /><br />There are several problems: The serving size is four (4) crackers, but each "pack" has eight (8).  So when I am on the go, I either eat half of the "pack" for my 130 calories, or eat twice what I thought.  If I eat half, then a leave four crackers which will spread crumbs throughout my carry bag.  It would have been better to make each pack four coachers (Or 6 crackers at 195 calories), but 260 calories is too large a snack for me.<br />Second, these crackers are not gluten free.  Gluten free snacks are becoming increasing popular.  Third, because of the "partially hydrogenated" oil, these are not recommended for anyone with heart disease, high blood pressure, or weight problems.<br />It seems a shame that Nabisco did not market a more healthy snack.  This "snack pack" is the same cracker as the regular honey graham.  If Nabisco would re-market this without gluten and substitute a different oil, this product could be superior.  As it currently exists it is an average snack.

review/summary: Nice Packaging
review/text: Honey Maid has always been one of my favorite brand of graham crackers.  The new packaging of six crackers in a compact form is handy.  Mothers of toddlers will love the convenience of these fitting easily in a purse or small pocket.  However, I found these crackers dry and hard to break apart.  They crumbled easily and wouldn't break at the serrated lines.  I am not sure if this is a storage problem or if this batch is over baked.<br /><br />I would try these again if I bought them fresh.  As is, I would want to buy another brand in that I don't enjoy stale crackers.

review/summary: An Iconic Snack Made Even Better
review/text: As a big fan of graham crackers (and who makes a better one than Honey Maid?) I am often disappointed in getting back to an unfinished portion and finding them stale. After being stuck with practically bendable crackers later, I started emptying the whole container into a ziplock back and hoping they remained crisp.<br /><br />Well, now they've introduced a new "Fresh Stacks" packaging, which cuts the number of crackers in each individual package in half. Just about the right amount of crackers for two to enjoy.<br /><br />The rest is easy, just get a glass of your favorite beverage and enjoy these iconic crackers, knowing that the next "stack" is going to be crisp and fresh! My serving suggestion is to layer vanilla ice cream between two of these bad boys and you have about the best ice cream sandwich possible.<br /><br />But exactly does the world "graham" mean? In 1829, a minister named Sylvester Graham invented a new way to process flour. Instead of grinding whole grain wheat kernels , graham flour's parts get ground up separately. The inside of the kernel gets ground at a fine setting, which makes standard white flour. Then the outside germ and bran are ground using a coarse setting. Once they are all mixed together, it creates a more textured product which bakes easier and tastes sweeter. It's also much better for you and has a higher fiber content.<br /><br />Well, as alternately boring and interesting as that all is, we owe it to Sylvester for today's resulting graham crackers, which are pretty much a staple food at my house. And Nabisco's Honey Maid is - after much testing of other manufacturers' competing product - easily the best graham cracker out there. And this new packaging idea has made them even better!

review/summary: Terrible design and poor material
review/text: These beverage coasters are made out of some strange material that simply does not hold up.  I would think that the first, if not the only requirement for a coaster would be that it has to be waterproof.  Cold beverages "sweat," and the main reason to even use a coaster in the first place is to protect the surface beneath them.  These become waterlogged almost immediately, and quickly start to crumble and disintegrate into a sticky goo.  Even when new and perfectly dry, they are extremely brittle, with small pieces breaking off almost immediately, and unless great care is taken, tend to crack and shatter in normal use.<br /><br />I did notice that when I failed to clean one of these up fast enough, the dog ate it, which was worrisome, but he did not suffer any ill effects.  So at least these coasters are non-toxic, and certainly biodegradeable.  However, they utterly fail to perform their intended purpose.  I would give this product zero stars if I could.

review/summary: Good stuff, packaged right
review/text: The packaging is the focus here, and the individual packs make it easier to grab and go, which is what I did. It seemed that the crackers stayed fresh longer, although I have no scientific data for that. I liked having it in the right size to throw in the lunch bag with some peanut butter and get going. The crackers themselves tasted great, I have to admit; better than other brands for sure. After I ran out of this box, I went out and bought another one next time I went shopping, which I guess is the ultimate proof; I got one for free, and I liked it enough to pay for the next one! Overall it's a good product and a great packaging idea.

review/summary: This is what I expect from a Gaham cracker
review/text: I love Graham crackers.  I love crispness, and the way they crumble in your mouth.  I love the subtle sweetness and the hint of spice.  And, these graham crackers deliver on all of those things.  They are exactly what I expect from a graham cracker.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The smaller sized "stacks" are much more convenient for snacking, or using for something like s'mores.  It doesn't take a lot of effort to break a traditional graham cracker in half, but this avoids the annoying problem of them not breaking evenly, or crumbling in the process.  I would be happy to order these again.

review/text: The taste is what you expect from graham crackers. Very authentic taste. The size of the cracker is perfect. Already set up to make smores if you so desire. Each individual package inside contains 8 squares and only has 250 calories a package so its a much more filling/healthy substitute for a bag of chips from your vending machine at work. Really good. Would defiantly recommend to anyone looking for a much healthier snack.

review/text: The kids loved these and they didn't last long at all... that's the real test of a snack to me.  If the kids like them and they are pretty healthy, you have it made.  The individual-serving size containers help you keep them fresh... if the kids would let them last long enough to go stale in the first place, which they won't.  Still, this packaging method is good for taking them with you, as the wife (or you, if you are a woman) can throw some in her purse and have them ready at a moment's notice.

review/summary: VERY handy, great crackers, not sure if it's worth the price though
review/text: I am VERY particular about my graham crackers. In a nutshell, anything other than Honey Maid is second class by a long shot (with the exception of some expensive organic types!).  So as far as the crackers themselves, I give them a glowing 5 stars.<br /><br />My one thing I don't care for is the extra price you pay for the smaller packs of crackers.  I know I am a bit odd in the fact that we have a larger family (and thus I can easily open up a large pack and it will be gone in an instant!), but I just couldn't justify the price of the crackers for the small packs.  That being said, they ARE handy for when it's just me and the toddler, especially when we are on the road and going to appointments, grocery shopping, etc...  so I totally get the convenience thing.  So if you like the convenience of having a smaller package and don't mind paying a little bit more for that, then I would HIGHLY recommend!<br /><br />That being said, you may also want to look at Back to Nature's graham crackers when they are available from Amazon (the other sellers are way too expensive)... they are even tastier (which is rare, like I said I love the Honey Maids!), and they also have small packages with the added benefit of some extra whole grains in them like oats.<br />[...]

review/summary: The Best Graham Crackers
review/text: I have great memories of S'Mores, so I decided I needed to make some of my own, hence the Graham Crackers. It turns out that my memories remain sweet, but my tastebuds have matured and I find the combination of graham crackers, marshmallows and chocolate way too sweet.<br /><br />However, the Honey Maid Graham Crackers by themselves make a most delicious snack. Just the right amount of sweetness, nice and crispy (but not too hard), these snack crackers are a wonderful treat. In this form with the fresh stacks, they remain fresher than ever, and are the perfect traveling size for a kid's lunch (or mine, for that matter!).

review/summary: Nice, slightly healthier alternative to snack-pack chips
review/text: With an elementary-school child and a middle-school child, a busy parent often resorts to buying the pre-packaged snacks.  Call it a sign of the times, but I will admit to buying snack-packs of chips (bad), seaweed (good), and cookies (not so good), for the days when we're too lazy to pack fruit or repack bigger packages of cookies/crackers.  While graham crackers aren't the healthiest snacks available, it's still better than frosted cookies or chips.<br /><br />Overall, nice.  I'd personally prefer a bigger multi-pack, though, 6 is on the small side.  I'd rather pay more for a 12-pack.

review/summary: Good ol' Graham Crackers
review/text: I really liked these graham crackers. There isn't anything different about the taste of coarse but the way they are packaged is ideal for man things.<br /><br />Instead of being big rectangular pieces these are halved. This makes them ideal for parents with smaller kids who just want to give their kid a quick snack.<br /><br />Another great use for these is definitely smores! Thanks to these already being broken down into squares you don't have to worry about accidentally breaking them when juggling your chocolate and a flaming marsh mellow.<br /><br />The only thing I could offer in the way of advise to Honey Maid would be to package them in stacks of 3 instead of 6 as the serving size is 3, but that isn't anything to keep me from purchasing these.<br /><br />I'll be keeping an eye out for these at my local grocer!

review/text: These are typical graham crackers.  If you like graham crackers, these are as good as any.  The real difference is in the packaging -- rather than those big cellophaned stacks, you get smaller stacks.  This is great for single people or those who just want a few crackers.  In a regular package, once you opened the cellophane on the big stacks, they started getting stale.  These smaller stacks prevent that from happening.

I like that the crackers are square and not the standard oversized rectangles - the squares are great for smores and snacking.  I like that they are a convenient size to put into a zip baggie for freshness or just eat the entire pack for a snack.  Minuses are that these are a big brand graham cracker and thus are not optimal for nutrition - only 1g fiber per serving with first ingredient unbleached enriched flour (second ingredient graham flour) and contain the not-so-good-for-you sugar, PHOs (soybean and/or partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil) and artificial flavor.  Honey comes after the sugar and oil in the ingredient list.  They do taste very good and I will likely purchase from time to time.

review/summary: Good graham crackers -- the kids like 'em
review/text: There's not a whole lot you can say about graham crackers. They're exactly what you expect, the same old slightly-sweet, crunchy crackers that we remember from when we were kids. As snacks go, they're reasonably healthy, although I generally prefer to buy the low-fat variety. Yes, they have sugar in them, but they also have dietary fiber, so at least you're getting some good stuff along with it. My kids eat these several times a week and always enjoy them.<br /><br />The idea behind the packaging of this particular variety is interesting: the crackers are packaged in smaller quantities, six squares per package. (Each square consists of two rectangular halves.) In theory, this is a nice idea, allowing you to grab a pack and bring them on the road or wherever else you're going. The problem is, six crackers is really too many for this purpose. If they were packaged in quantities of four, for example, I would find them a lot more useful.

review/summary: Our fave snack, in the perfect size!
review/text: My kids are pretty sure that Graham Crackers are the best thing ever. And they don't want any other brand but this one. They are picky little brats. When I got the opportunity to try these 'fresh stacks' - snack size type things, school was just getting ready to let out and I thought "why not, looks like a quick school snack" and grabbed it.<br /><br />I honestly forgot about them until the last few days of school. And thank goodness for that! My kids are in Elementary and the last week of school is completely insane trying to get everyone up and the projects done and the fun stuff done and... and... and... I had like NO food in the house. I told them to buy lunch and then went rooting around in the pantry.<br /><br />SCORE! I handed them to them and said "graham crackers, let's go". After I finished explaining that no no no no... these really WERE graham crackers, just in a different package, off they went.<br /><br />And they then took them for the next two days. I'm told this was the perfect size with just enough for their school snack and was super yummy to boot.<br /><br />That makes my kids think I'm a rockstar mom. Thanks, Honey Maid.<br /><br />Great product. Great size. Great idea. Sold!<br /><br />We've since bought a few packages of these. They are great to toss in the car when you aren't sure if you're going to be late getting back for dinner, to the soccer game, or just when the kids are whining. I like that it's portioned too. Keeps them from just mindless eating them. (I told you they were graham nuts).

review/summary: Great, portable snack
review/text: I was already familiar with the Honey Maid crackers and always enjoyed them. The flavor is always consistently good. This option is better because the box contains six individually wrapped packages with about eight or ten crackers in each pack. It's great because you don't have to open the whole box with worry about the remainder of the crackers getting stale. The individually wrapped packs would also be good for snacking on the run. It's easy to just grab a package of these and put them in your purse for later. The only drawback is that sometimes eight crackers is just more than desired for a snack and there is no way to really seal the bag to save them for later. But, overall, this cracker is a delicious snack choice, especially if you are on the go.

review/summary: A Great Snack in a New Size
review/text: Honey Maid Graham crackers are as good as ever - a great snack for kids of all ages.  When my children were younger, we would go through the larger packages very quickly and never had a soggy or stale one.  Now that just my husband and I are at home, the large packages get opened, we have a few crackers, and then the rest end up going stale and get thrown out.  This happens even though we put the crackers in zip lock - can't figure out why!<br /><br />With this new size, we are able to share a small package and keep the rest of the crackers fresh for the next time we want a snack.  I can imagine taking a small package on a flight or a car trip (sometimes a little snack helps with motion sickness.)  I like the idea and will certainly purchase more of the Fresh Stacks size. I hate throwing food away so paying a little bit more for convenience may actually mean savings in the long run as we are sure to finish the package.  Buying cheaper doesn't always mean a bargain - it is only a bargain if you like the product and will use it up commpletely.

review/text: So the question here is what should I be reviewing.  If I review the graham crackers, I would point out that the reduced fat version is healthier and tastes the same.  If I review the packaging I would point out that you pay more per ounce and could save money by doing this yourself with ziplock bags, but the idea is sound and nothing is defective about it.  And if I reviewed the Honey Maid brand against other brands, I would say that they are similar in taste and texture and that they live up to the quality that one would expect from the brand.<br /><br />I hope that gave you insight into all aspects of the product.  Overall, I am going to go back to buying the reduced fat ones and ziplock bags.

review/summary: The crackers are great as usual.
review/text: The product was offered for review because of the packaging.  They are stacks of square crackers, one half of the large ones that we are used to.  They come in two serving packs. I liked having the crackers already broken in half, because that's the size I give to a child.  I think I'd prefer to have re-sealable packaging, but this wasn't bad.  We never did have to eat soggy or stale crackers.<br />Just be aware, this is a package that is a right size for having several toddlers hanging on to your skirts, not a size pre-packaged to put in lunch boxes.

review/summary: Same Taste, Portion Control
review/text: These are the same Honey Made graham crackers I grew up eating so if you liked those or you like them today, what is there not to like here?<br /><br />In 2+oz packs they are easy to use if you want to control portion size and also to transport though they will still break apart just as if you put then in your own baggie. That's the only potential negative here because they do cost more than if you portioned out your own crackers.  But if you are busy or just don't want the hassle, this is a good way to help yourself and your loved ones take just a bit of sweetness with you.

review/summary: A classic snack in smaller packets
review/text: These are your classic Honey Maid graham crackers -- a long-time snack favorite -- repackaged into smaller packets. This makes some sense: With fewer crackers per packet, the others stay sealed where they won't get stale. Also, each packet is now a handy size that could fit in a pocket or a purse.<br /><br />You might want to think about how graham crackers are consumed in your household to see if this is a good fit. Do you go through packages fast or slow? If fast, then the staleness concerns may not even be a consideration. Would it be handy for you to take a packet on-the-go as a snack? If you're only going to eat them at home, the smaller packet size will be less important to you.

review/text: These are the same Honey Maid Graham Crackers that we all know and love, just different packaging.  They are squares (actually the same size squares as 1/2 of the full-size crackers) packaged in stacks.  These are nice for my household now (just 2 of us) as it keeps the crackers fresher (since there is a smaller amount in each package).  I would have really liked them when I had little ones and wanted to keep some crackers in a bag for hunger crankies.  They are sized perfect for s'mores also!  Just grab a package or two, no need to juggle hot marshmallows and chocolate while you break a cracker in two.

review/text: Believe it or not, this was the first time that I've tasted this brand of graham crackers.  They have a nice sweet taste (hence the "honey" part), but not overly sweet.  My toddlers enjoy getting these as a snack.  We'll also be sure to build some 'Smores snacks with these as well.<br /><br />Generally the crackers break according to the perforated lines.  I mention this because I hate when snacks crumble when you don't expect it and make a big mess for you to clean up ;)<br /><br />I'm pretty happy with these crackers and plan to buy more.

review/summary: The Crackers You Always Loved, But More Convenient
review/text: These crackers are always good - if you like them.  I won't say there is any difference from other Honey Maid Graham crackers.  But I will say normally they are quite large and in long stacked packages that are incovenient for lunches or travel.  These packs are similar to the new 100 calorie packs or single serving packs - much easier for kids lunches or for watching your diet.  Overall this is main convenience, otherwise you can stick to the larger box for savings.

review/text: I had always enjoyed graham crackers. These individual servings were great for me to take to work in the morning one at a time. Even though it's not a super healthy breakfast, it help held me through some of the busier mornings when I was in a hurry. I would eat this while I drink honey water.<br /><br />The flavor is great, too. Not too sweet. It's a good snack with warm milk. The grains in the crackers are tasty and adds to an interesting texture if you like whole grain food. Even opened, the crunchiness last a very long time (a couple of days), though I did put it in the fridge.

review/summary: Classic taste, sized for s'mores
review/text: Anyone who has had the trouble of trying to break apart graham crackers in the middle of maintaining a campfire, divvy up marshmallows and divide chocolate squares knows that it is not very easy. The fact that this often occurs in the dark, after the sun has gone down, makes it even more difficult. The process could turn what is a pleasant family getaway into a fumbling, bumbling fiasco with some if not all of one's tasty treats falling on the ground.<br /><br />This format of graham crackers allows for easy placement, and so allows the user a convenient way to enjoy their post-dinner campfire delight. The Honey Maid taste and quality is still there. Now it's just more convenient.

review/text: This packaging for graham crackers is wonderful for families with young kids.  There are six packages of grahams in the box, each containing about 8 half-sized crackers.  We are able to travel with these a little at a time and not worry about the whole box going stale.  They are also great for making smores, as they are already the right size.  Great idea when wanting to make smores for just a couple of people.

review/text: In one deft move, Nabisco has solved my one and only problem with graham crackers: that the packaging just doesn't keep them fresh.  These little packs are not only a bit better at keeping the grahams crisp longer, they keep more fresher by reducing the number per sealed pack.  I'm sure someone at Nabisco casually suggested this little gem of a solution, and I hope that chap gets a solid pat on the back.  Well done!

review/text: What can I say.  Honey Maid graham crackers are good.  Always have been.  This packaging seems to make way more sense than the traditional rectangles in a larger package that go stale when you don't eat them all right away.  It's probably psychological, but the crackers seem thicker than I remember them being, but I think it's because they are so fresh the crispiness makes it seem like more cracker!  Whatever the reason, the package size is easier to tote and keeps the crackers fresh.  5 stars all the way.

review/text: This is a just half-sized and smaller-packaged version of honey graham crackers. They taste the same as you would expect but are packaged "conveniently" for tossing in with your lunch. Personally, I would rather pay less and package what I want to put in my lunch on my own most of the time. What may be considered a plus by many is the individualized packaging; you no longer have to be concerned with them going stale. However, and I may be in the minority here, I actually do not like my graham crackers to be super fresh and crunchy. I usually open a package and let it get some air for a day or so before I start eating them, after they have gotten a little soft and less crumbly. Each to his own! :)

review/summary: A half honey graham cracker is still a honey graham cracker
review/text: I like Honey Maid graham crackers, but I don't see much reason for this new packaging of a familiar product.  It's the same graham cracker they have always had, just one cracker instead of the usual two (that you can split apart as they have a line in the middle).  I guess it might be slightly more convenient to have the single cracker, but to me it is a kind of waste (if it ain't broke, don't fix it).  When you figure the price in, the regular double cracker is cheaper; to me this is a no brainer (same product, lesser price by buying the original).

review/summary: Great idea but double serving size.
review/text: No one likes stale graham crackers but unless you keep them in Tupperware or eat them quickly, they get stale fast.  Welcome Honey Maid fresh stacks.  These have the same great taste as the regular package but in double serving packs.  That is where Honey Maid went wrong.  If you are going to put the grahams in smaller packs, why not single serving packs?  If you want a single serving you still are left storing the remaining half of the opened pack.  Also, the packs are hard to open and I seem to break the crackers getting them opened and also the crumbs fly everywhere.  Last, I'm not sure if this was a shipping problem but two of the packs in my box were opened, which defeats the whole purpose of having a "fresh stack".  So 5 stars for taste but minus 1 for poor implementation.

review/text: I love honey maid Graham crackers but find invariably we open a pack and don't finish it and the rest go stale pretty quickly.  This box contains packs where each original cracker is half size (think s'more size without having to break them). We typically would open and eat what was in the pack.  The weight on this box is less than the weight on the long cracker box but there is less waste because they are in a more convenient size and you aren't opening way more than can be eaten, so they aren't going stale.  If you have a smaller sized household or just can never seem to break your crackers in half perfectly for s'mores then these are great.

review/summary: A good classic snack
review/text: I have not had a graham cracker in decades. I was very happy to try out a box. I grew up with them. I ate them at my friend's house; my mother bought them, and remember them being available at the child care center my mother managed. I remember they were wrapped in wax at the time and breakable. I had fond memories of them.<br /><br />I will say, as another reviewer wrote, I might have got a slightly `stale' box or overcooked one. I think more overcooked. The `crackers' are really dry and do not have much taste to them. They are just very dry and have not moisture when you put them in your mouth. They taste alright but with the box I got it is hard to judge.<br /><br />I do like the fact that you have 6 individual snack sizes in the box. I live alone and use zip lock baggies for other boxed items but having these individually wrapped helps. I well say the box itself does not stand out much and I think I would walk right past them in the market. They need to make the font bigger and also the actual photo of the item. The majority of the box has what looks like `tiles' on it (meant to be graham crackers).<br /><br />All in all I would give these 4 stars hoping I got an overcooked box. I would also buy them in the future and know when my daughter is old enough I want her to grow up with them like I did. All and all a great snack.

review/text: One of the biggest problems with graham crackers was that you had to find a ziplock bag or something to put them in after you opened them because they would get stale very quickly if you didn't. This new form of packaging cuts down the amount of crackers in each package by half so the remaining crackers stay fresh until you open them. A great idea that was a long time coming. If only Oreo (another Nabisco product) could do this also we would really be getting somewhere.

review/text: Unless you're making s'mores, chances are you don't finish a whole pack of graham crackers at a sitting; I know I don't.  Honey Maid graham crackers are, in my opinion, a great tasting cracker, and the individual "fresh stacks" packets are a very convenient way to keep them fresh and crispy.  It also makes them a good grab 'n' go option when trying to get out the door in a hurry.  A very practical way to package graham crackers.
