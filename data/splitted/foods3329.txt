review/summary: Outstanding product
review/text: Fast and easy, and great flavor.  About as close as you are getting without making them from scratch.<br /><br />My wife sadly is addicted to refried beans from a can.  If you can't tolerate refried beans that look like jellied cranberry sauce and smell like a bad cross between dogfood and other unknown substances (let alone taste ugh!), then this product is for you!<br /><br />Ingredients are very simple, it's just that these are pre prepared and dehydrated.  Very lightweight, so if you are going outdoors, these are great to pack and rehydrate, and will definitely help keep you warm in the sleeping bag later, and the packaging is lightweight, so easy to dispose of after.<br /><br />On top of that, there's normal beans in this pack as well, very yummy also.<br /><br />Packaging wise, they come in a 2 part box, dispose of the top and you have a bottom display like container to keep them well organized.

review/summary: Very happy with purchase.
review/text: So far I have only tried a few of these. Realize the Borracho Beans are quite spicy, but very tasty. These products go a lot further than you average can of re-fried beans/beans, The eight packs are the equivalent of ~24 cans of beans as they are dehydrated, yet they are just as simple and, in my opinion, taste better than the canned stuff. You would have to get a pretty good deal to get 24 cans of quality refried beans/beans for around $14 (subscribe and save deal).<br />I am giving this one five stars as the price and quality is practically unbeatable at your local grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty, economical, and more!
review/text: These are some tasty beans, and do NOT need heat to reconstitute, just liquid! You must try adding water (or tea, beer, tomato juice, etc.) and tasting after a while--it's a fun combo of crunch and apparently cooked beans, albeit cold. What this means is that you can prepare it the night before, then heat it up in the morning. I use this method to reduce cooking time for all sorts of things, and if these are good cold, that's a nice compliment!<br /><br />This would be a great road food snack, heated via sunlight on a car's dashboard. Serve with tortillas or your favorite bread/wrap, etc.<br /><br />Until I learn to dehydrate my own beans, I'll be buying these!

I usually put a little cumin or taco seasoning, spoonful of diced jalepenos or fresh cilantro in the water before we boil it to give it a little more flavor, if there are any leftovers, I just put it in the fridge and then make quesadillas or nachos the next day. The price seems to have gone up a bit since I purchased, but will likely buy more when it ($) drops back down a bit

review/text: I didn't realize when I purchased this that there was 2 different types of bean dishes in the box. My husband thought he messed up the refried beans and I couldn't understand how he did when the directions were quite clear.  Later, I noticed when I pulled out a package to make them, that it wasn't refried beans.  Upon inspecting the rest of the box, I noted 2 different types of bean dishes.  He must've made one of the other ones thinking it was refried.  I'm not sure if I mis-ordered by choosing the wrong product or if there was a mistake in the shipment.<br /><br />Either way, we are pleased with both styles of bean dishes.

review/summary: High Mountain Magic.  Food of the Gods.
review/text: Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa.<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added lavender and clove essential oils to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, and lavender tea.  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, "nutrition" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of "yummy.").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to "gourmet it" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As "rice" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with "noodle heaven"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As "oatmeal" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Normally, a microwave cooks 4 times faster than "outside-the-waves" cooking, but, of course that time varies with larger amounts of food.  For example, 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (�) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate "lid"; zap it for another minute or half, then let it "steep" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate "lid" I can just place it on the table for family style "digging in."<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm very confident in ordering any item from them.  And now Berry Farms has been added to my list of healthful, gourmet goods.<br /><br />Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the "naked" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of "health"?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had "lived" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books, including:<br />Molasses Moon

Try any flavor to begin -- I liked the idea of of my dog eating blueberries and chicken, so that's what I started him on -- and I think you'll agree with my review.

review/summary: Better than Snickers original
review/text: So Snickers is the quintessential American candy bar, and the recent fad for swapping milk chocolate for dark is a cheap line-expansion gimmick.  But, y'know, I think this is better than the original Snickers?  A regular Snickers can be throat-searingly sweet  -  the nougat, caramel, and milk chocolate all blend together in one saccharine lump.  Here, though, substituting dark chocolate for milk gives the nougat a grounding  -  lets it stand out as a flavor  -  while the sweet of the nougat makes the dark chocolate more rounded and gives it a taste beyond flat bitterness.  It's as hearty as a regular Snickers, but it has more dimension to it.  It's a shrewd bit of candy engineering.<br /><br />And, let's not forget, the coating is real chocolate, something that's not always guaranteed in today's candy market.  (Tip: if a Hershey's bar says it's "made WITH chocolate," then chocolate's only a partial ingredient  -  in other words, there's not enough actual chocolate in the component to call it chocolate.)<br /><br />Mainstay that it is, I'm not sure I'd call Snickers a five-star candy.  But, y'know, the Dark version made me take a second look at one of the oldest candy bars around and buy two bars in as many days.  It even made me view dark chocolate in a new light.  I think that's worth a high recommendation.

review/text: These are the best new South Beach bars.  I love bars but they are always high in fat or carbs or both.  These are 4.5 g fat, 17 g carb and 9 g protein.  I would say they are similar to the Medifast bars but much less expensive and Atikins bars have too much fat.  I tried the new South Beach peanut butter protein and it was OK.  The chocolate protein is very tasty.  Chewy, crunchy and very chocolate.  I will not buy the peanut butter again but could eat a chocolate one every day.  I use it for breakfast, snack or before the gym.  I'm glad I found an inexpensive, not too bad for you, tasty bar.

I have one when I start to feel hungry and it gets me by for a couple hours.  They're also cheaper than most of the other bars.  For being a 'diet bar', I thought they tasted pretty good.

review/summary: Rich cocoa taste and satisfying...
review/text: I like the convenience of protein bars for an on-the-go snack that fits in a purse or bag. I've been in search of a bar like this for a while because most other protein bars I've tried either aren't satisfying or have as many calories and fat as a big candy bar. These South Beach bars have a very rich cocoa flavor that chocolate lovers will appreciate. They're only 130 calories but still have a good amount of protein to keep hunger at bay between meals. They're also much lower in sugar than similar bars in this category but it doesn't affect the taste. They are just the right balance of low calorie, great taste and still very satisfying. I have already ordered my second box of these.

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: I was a little hesitant to try these bars, as I usually don't like chocolate for breakfast (I prefer fruit-flavored things in the morning).  However, what I DID like about these bars was the "Protein Fit" label; if I am going to grab a bar for breakfast, I want it to be high in protein rather than some sugary cereal bar.  These South Beach Protein Fit Bars have 9 grams protein (I usually look for 8 or more), 8 grams sugar (about 1 1/2 teaspoons--very reasonable), and 3.5 grams fat, with 2 of those being saturated (I don't worry overly about fat myself, but others might find the saturated fat content a bit on the high side).  The bars also contain a good dose of additional nutrition, with 3grams of fiber, 15% of the daily calcium requirement, and various other vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of these bars as well.  Unlike many other chocolate products of this type, the chocolate tastes natural rather than artificial.  In additional, the bars have a very nice texture:  they are like a flaky, moist cereal bar.  Personally, I could have done without the extra drizzle of chocolate on top, but I think that chocolate lovers will truly love these bars.  I would definitely recommend the Chocolate Protein Fit bar to others; I plan to check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Y10YY2">South Beach Protein Fit Cinnamon Raisin</a> flavor for myself.

review/summary: surprisingly not bad
review/text: I pretty much shop exclusively in the natural/organic food department in my grocery store and those few times that I have strayed and read labels I was always reminded why I don't shop in the normal part of the grocery store.  These bars are not bad at all.  So many others I have looked at have hidden artificial sweeteners (like aspartame) in them, but not these, only 8 grams of sugar per bar (our household limit is 9 grams per serving of any food) and there is a tiny bit of stevia, but I have no problem with that since I am a big stevia believer.  These have only 130 calories so it can be a snack (if a protein bar gets to be too high in calories it really ought to be a meal replacement) and these are chocolatey enough to satisfy my chocolate craving.  These have 3 grams of fiber, not so much, but then these are not trying to be fiber bars.  These bars have 9 grams of protein, not bad, but it appears to be all soy based, but since it is not SO much protein I guess that is fine (too much soy is not good).  There is some palm oil which I am not a fan of (not ecologically sound and it is cholesterol raising), but few processed foods out there are perfect.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs a little something sweet and chocolatey that is low enough in calories to be a snack and who isn't so hung up on natural/organic foods.  From what I've seen in the conventional food isles these are quite clean and they taste good.  While I say that I recommend them, for me personally I will still go back to buying my old standby in the natural foods department, NuGo Slim.

review/text: I love this salsa! I'm actually looking it up on Amazon because my local store stopped carrying it. =(<br /><br />It has the perfect consistency, not so chunky it doesn't spread, and not so thin it won't stay on a chip. It's fresh, sweet and kicky - but my heat adverse hubby can still eat it. I'd call it a medium salsa. I'm bummed that it's only currently sold in 6 packs - but I'm seriously thinking about buying it anyway - it's that good!

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: It's not terrible.  But it's nothing worth writing home about and definitely not worth the price, in my opinion.  For some background on that opinion of which I speak, let me point out that I like a little heat with my salsa.  Some of my favourites--just for your comparison purposes--are Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero (Medium Hot), Mrs. Renfro's Ghost Chili Pepper (Hot), and Arriba! Fire Roasted Mexican Red (Hot), about which I've also left an Amazon review.  So when I read the Ernie's label of the "perfect blend of sweet and heat," I was hoping for, and expecting something similar to, Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero, but chunkier, and with pineapple replacing the mango for the fruitiness.  (Because the one thing that's tragically wrong with Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero is that it's far too thin.)<br /><br />What this salsa has going for it is that it's quite chunky, which makes it easy to dip, and it has a lot of pineapple flavour, which is half of what it advertises on the label.  Unfortunately, there is no heat to be found, which is the other half of what it advertises on the label.  If you're a bit of a baby when it comes to "hot" then perhaps you'll be able to discern some heat in this salsa, but to me it's little more than pineapple and tomatoes.  To add to the misfortune, the pineapple tastes a bit metallic, i.e., canned rather than fresh.<br /><br />The "best you've ever tasted or I'll buy it back" guarantee is a nice marketing ploy, but since you would have to send back the unused portion in the jar, the shipping cost (because it'll be about a pound to ship to Virginia if you really didn't like it after the first bite) will eat up most of your refund even if you use the cheapest method available, so it's not worth the trouble.<br /><br />Essentially, if you like a hot salsa with some fruity sweetness to its flavour, this isn't the salsa for you.  If you like sweet fruit-and-vegetable mix salsas that do not deliver on heat but would be nice perhaps with some fish or for those who don't like spicy foods, or if you just adore pineapple in everything, then you will probably like this.<br /><br />As for me, I did eventually finish the jar, having a few scoops here and there, never enjoying it much, and always following it up with a salsa I actually like, but I'll certainly never buy it again.

review/summary: Like a little bit of dessert!
review/text: I discovered this gum about 6 months ago, and it has become and remained my favorite.  The plus points:  the flavor lasts a very long time, it is sugar free but doesn't taste sugar free and it satisfies my sweet tooth, my kids love to blow bubbles with it (it works well), and it works as a sweet and pleasant breath freshener.  Minus:  this type of packaging is cumbersome, but I have a jar at my desk, and one either at home or in the car.  If I want to take some with me in my purse, I put a few in a baggie, or I re-use the small box that I bought when I originally tried this gum.  It can be expensive, and sometimes hard to find in the stores.  I have found it on sale 2 for $5.00, but the regular price is anywhere from $3.00 - $3.50.  If you order the subscription through Amazon, which I did, it works out to about $2.76 per "jar" of 40.  I can deal with that.

review/summary: my favorite!
review/text: If you tried this and missed the flavor pay off the problem may be an average palette. Some people are super-tasters and able detect most ingredients, if that sounds like you than try this oil. This is my favorite olive oil!  I don't use it for cooking but as a finishing oil , dipping oil, or when I make fresh Caeser dressing. It's amazing with fresh mozz and tomatoes. I love it as a dipping oil for fresh semolina- just add cracked pepper and salt + fresh herbs. It's buttery and smooth. I used to use butter religiously and this is the oil that got me off my butter addiction. But if you look around you can buy this for much cheaper. I find it at an Italian Deli in Astoria  NY for under 22$ ( that's a new york city price folks!) After this oil it's hard to stomach regular olive oil. It's spoiled me!  If you're looking for a good cooking E.V.O.O than go for a Frantoia Barberra unflitered- which is great when making a homemade sauce and award winner. -- Enjoy fellow foodies:)

review/summary: Perfect for sparkling water!
review/text: I bought a SodaStream soda maker several months ago to cut down on the expense of buying carbonated soda water. I gave up artificial sweeteners a few years ago and didn't want to drink sugary drinks, so I hoped that I would be able to use the SodaStream to replace the fairly pricey carbonated water I was buying (LaCroix).<br /><br />I quickly realized that the flavorings for fancy water were not as simple as I'd hoped to replicate. Slicing fruit into the water was messy (and lemons and limes squeezed into the water made it pretty tart). Flavorings stabilized in alcohol are not bad, but they require a fair amount to flavor the water and are not inexpensive--a bottle of lemon extract sells for about $6 at my local grocery store and lasts 1-2 weeks.<br /><br />I finally took a chance and bought this grapefruit essential oil. The first batch I made, I added 10 drops. WAY too much. For the one liter bottle of carbonated water, three drops are just about perfect. At this pace, I believe that the 4 ounce bottle that I bought will last about the rest of my life.<br /><br />In addition to being economical, the oil is very tasty--though, it is obvious from the flavor that the oil comes from the skin of the grapefruit. Not that I've eaten a lot of grapefruit skins, but it tastes exactly like the skin smells as you peel the fruit. I find the taste delicious, but it is different from the taste of the juice of the fruit.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone looking to step back from sugar who doesn't want to give up cold, fizzy drinks. I'm buying this (the smaller size)  for my friends who also have a SodaStream maker.

review/text: I am a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with a long heritage of discriminating taste. Pet'n Shape products are my most favored treats,and I am especially fond of Chik 'n Breast. They are pure chicken with no additives, and, as I am watching my figure, they break easily into smaller morsels, so I can exercise moderation in this delectable indulgence. Ten out of ten of my canine neighbors agree that this reward is well worth obeying a command or two. I give it five paws up.<br /><br />Sincerely, Phoebe

review/summary: My Dog Loves These Treats!
review/text: We've got a really picky eater of a dog.  Actually "picky" doesn't adequately describe him.  But when these treats come by mail, he rushes to open the package himself.  These treats are his favorite by far.  His other choice is another treat by Pet 'n Shape (the sweet potatoes).  I doubt there is any dog alive that doesn't gulp these down.

review/summary: Excellent, nutritious dog treat
review/text: This dog treat is one that my dog went crazy over.  Whenever she smelled it she was in her nice sitting positon trying to go into the up position or sticking out her paws to shake....basically all the tricks she knew. High in protein and low in moisture, a treat that was also good for her. I would sometimes cut up some with her food, which guaranteed an empty bowl. All in all a great treat in my left pocket the had all the neighbourhood dogs hanging around me. Great cost to value.

review/text: Good beer. I have made a couple of batches so far and will make more. Great beer for the value. Using the included directions this kit makes a 6 gallon batch. I reduce the water by 1 gallon and sugar content by 1/6th to make a 5 gallon batch. This results in a beer with good/better overall body. 7-10 days in the fermenter. 2 weeks in the bottle and it's ready to drink.

review/text: I bought this and a grinder (and a couple other varieties of course salts) as a gift for my spouse at Christmas.  I know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and I was tired of buying the $2.99 use-and-toss grinders of salt at the grocery store.<br /><br />As far as this salt goes, you should NOT use it in a grinder because it is too moist.  I did not know this until after I had purchased it.  I still use it as a finishing salt, but for the use I had in mind, grinding on food, it does not work.

I then heard from everyone else who told me the same thing. My sister who by this time had returned to NC and had one waiting for her there, turned around and sent us one which was delivered yesterday.  This morning we opened and it has exceeded our expectations.  My husband who does not in particular like blueberries has eaten 3 pieces!

review/text: Like stated above, these are dangerous.  It's like giving your dog buffalo flavored glass. I didn't like how it was shattering while my dog was chewing on it, I decided to inspect a piece by breaking it with my fingers and sliced my finger open.  They might be fine for a small dog to nibble on, but my medium sized dog (38 lbs) shattered one of these things into pocket-knife-like shards within seconds.  Better off giving your dog cooked chicken bones.

review/text: Brownie loves the taste and I love that its healthy and long lasting. It kept him busy for about 3 hours! The bully sticks didn't even keep him busy for an hour and they are much more expensive. Plus it doesn't stink like the bully sticks. As with any chew, you must supervise your dog in case they bite off big chunks which can be a choking hazard. Lucky me, brownie only bites off small pieces at a time and never tries to swallow anything without chewing.<br /><br />Update 9/10/12  Unfortunately it gave Brownie a little bit of diarhhea both days that I gave it to him, so I can no longer give him these. I wonder if it's the treat or Brownie......

review/text: My dog enjoys gnawing on tendons and has tried many brands in the past two years. I went out on a limb and decided to try ordering a whole bag online AND trying a new brand which seemed more ethical.<br /><br />These were nothing like any tendon we've bought in the past. Instead of softening and being chewable, they SHATTERED in her mouth. After I picked up the broken-glass-like shards and tossed them out, vowing to return them, I discovered that she had a sliver lodged in her throat!<br /><br />If these are even tendons, they are a nightmare.

review/summary: BEST for dogs with allergies
review/text: This is so far the BEST food I have had my dogs on.  I have one english bulldog and one french bulldog--both breeds predispositioned for food allergies.  The english bulldog was on another brand of salmon and sweet potato.  His hair started falling out in patches--and we had been struggling for about a year.  In less than one month of this food, his hair stopped falling out AND has started to grow back!!  Also, noticed his little stinky face folds are WAY less stinky and less tear stains.<br /><br />Garbage in, Garbage out!  Cheap food is no good for your dogs in the long run.  I'm a true believer of this food.  Tapioca as the starch limits the chances for allergies.  FANTASTIC food and dogs love the flavor.

review/text: My dog's love this flavor of dog food, and I am most comfortable feeding them this one because fish oils are so much healthier than animal fats. There is some fish smell to the food, of course, but not too bad. If you have a sealed food container, which you should anyway for a large bag like this, it will keep the smell inside. This product is also grain free and is overall full of great ingredients. This is a company than can be trusted.  Go to [&#8230;] for more information about this food.  Amazon has the best price I've seen for this, especially when you consider the price for subscribe and save.

review/summary: Great Food!! Less Gas!! :-)
review/text: We have 2 sensitive Dobermans (2y Red Male and 10m Black Female) and have had to play musical food since we got our 2y old.. We started him on Nutro Ultra Large Breed Puppy.. which is great food, it grew a strong healthy 90lb boy BUT we struggled the whole first year with skin allergies, itchiness and rashes. After several vet visits, skin tests and a few bottles of Benadryl, we decided to go ahead and change his food. We tried the "Grain Free" version Nutro had just come out with and seemed to get a little relief but ultimately, still had problems. After meeting another Doberman Mommy at the dog park, who had a beautiful Black Female.. her coat was so black and smooth and shiny.. We decided to try what they use, Nature's Variety Prairie formulas. We went with the Salmon flavor with added Omega-3s to also help with the skin and coat problems. He took to the food immediately but never had a problem with over eating. Within about a week, we could already see a difference in the skin irritations! This was awesome! We were now believers in Nature's Variety! So when we got our new puppy, we started her immediately on the Prairie Salmon with her brother. She also took right to it and did not seem to want to over eat. Well I did some reading and decided to try to rotate to some of the other flavors, for variety in their diet and overall health. They love the other flavors as well... BUT we started noticing horrible horrible horrible gas! They always had a little, I guess, but now it was unbearable! We quickly went back to the Salmon but it didn't help. I did some more reading and found a very helpful review from another customer that talked about the bad gas and their solution was switching to the Instinct.. So we tried it! Finally, no more gas mask needed! What a relief, for the dogs and for us! We are currently on the Instinct Salmon.. they love it and we love being able to breathe again! At this point, we will not go back to grain foods!<br /><br />My only complaints are that there are not more options for Large Breed dogs (extra bone health and joint support for large, fast growing bones).. currently there is ONLY Prairie Chicken.. which we can't use :-( It would be nice to have an Instinct Large Breed formula (pref the salmon). *hint hint*<br /><br />Also, the bag size is smaller for Instinct, than in Prairie, yet the price is the same or more. With 2 Dobermans weighing 90lbs and 70lbs, we go through a bag about every 10-12 days. I wish you could buy a 40-50lb bag as an option.<br /><br />Other than this, we LOVE Instinct! (and your pup will too!)

review/text: This is the cheapest ive been able to find this product... in the stores its much more expensive. I love that it is periodically shipped to me for an even larger discount... so now, i get the food my dog needs, at a deep discount, and I never have to run to the store for dog food and lug a huge bag to my car, etc. The food itself is wonderful as well. My dog's coat looks amazing, she has more energy, her weight is stabalized, and her allergy issues have subsided almost completely. I never though i would be one of those people with a 'gluten-free' dog, but the vet suggested it after she struggled with itchy skin. It has worked like a charm so far! It might be more expensive, but they eat less volume due to the much higher protein content, so i think it basically evens out. I definitely recommend this product!

review/summary: Nature's Variety Instinct is great - but not the salmon
review/text: Others seemed to have a lot better experience than I did, so perhaps this was a fluke (or a bad bag of food). I'll be continuing to buy Nature's Variety Instinct - GREAT food with REAL ingredients. Feeding this to my dog makes his coat shine beautifully and makes a huge difference in his energy level and general well being. Good food is worth every penny.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the salmon meal variety just didn't meet expectations. The dog picked at it unhappily, often leaving much of his food. When he did eat, he seemed to do so reluctantly (hungry, but really not liking the food). It didn't smell great - had an aroma of rancid omega-3s. It didn't bring the same effect of happy, healthy dog. He seemed sad and lethargic (perhaps from not getting enough food). It isn't an aversion to salmon in general, as he'll occasionally get a treat of fresh salmon (or skin), and he LOVES it. This food, he hates.<br /><br />I switched back to beef and lamb, and immediately saw a change in behavior. He gobbled up his dinner and played happily for the rest of the evening - jumping and sprinting around the house (the first time he's done this in a while).<br /><br />It's a shame to throw out most of a $70 bag of dog food, but I think it would be worse to force him to eat it.

review/text: My dog loves this food... he's normally a picky eater. In the past, when we put food in his bowl we would have to "command" him to eat it. Sometimes he would eat half of it, and just let the rest sit all day. With this food he eagerly goes to his bowl when we fill it and enthusiastically eats his food. No more trying to convince him to eat his food!<br /><br />We actually tried the lamb flavor first, and he didn't seem to like it very much. He really likes the salmon flavor. His coat seems shinier, and he's shedding less than he has in the past. We're going to try other flavors. This food does have a bit of a fishy smell... which is probably why the dog likes it so much!

review/summary: High Quality, Loved By My Dog
review/text: My puppy and I love this food. Me for its quality ingredients and health benefits, he for the flavor. It is on the expensive side but comparable to other grain-free quality brands. He doesn't have any food sensitivities that I'm aware of, though we were cautioned to avoid grains as much as possible by the breeder, and this brand is all I've ever fed him. He likes it so much that I use it for training treats as well as regular meals. The only slight down side is that it does have a bit of a fishy smell, and handling the kibbles during training does leave the smell on my hands. It's nothing a bit of scented soap wont fix and completely worth it to know my pup is getting great food.  This food is rated 'for all life stages' so it is okay for puppies through senior age dogs.

review/summary: Great for itchy pups
review/text: I started my dog on this brand after trying several others with no success. He was fed beneful when I adopted him, so I quickly switched to canidae, it helped his itching somewhat, but didnt completely go away, then we tried taste of the wild which gave him the runs and impacted anal glands. Finally I decided to try instinct and he's been doing super well, itching decreased by 80%, he has soft and shiny coat now and lots of energy. The only downside is that this food is a bit pricey, I found a better deal through another retailer online with free shipping. The upside is that this food is very high calorie, so he eats very little of it (3/4 cup a day for 22 lb dog) and the bag lasts like 3 months.

review/summary: No more bulldog gas!
review/text: I have a three year old American Bulldog and she used to have the baddest gas ever. I've talking take a deep breath, hold your nose, and run for the air freshener bad. I tried several brands including Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, Premium Edge, and Diamond. All of the mentioned brands where tried in different varieties of chicken, lamb, salmon, etc. All failed to slow down the air pollutant that is my dog.<br /><br />In comes Instinct Grain-Free Salmon food by Nature's Variety. This stuff is the real deal. After 2-3 weeks on this food the gas cleared up and her droppings are solid. It's a dream come true.<br /><br />My bulldog also eats it up like it's going out of style. We always have food out for her and she manages her appetite herself. She stays lean. I've noticed that I do have to refill the bowl quite a bit more now. Looks like we both win.

review/summary: My dog's favorite, my most trusted dog food!
review/text: We've bought Blue Buffalo, Max, Taste of the Wild, Orijen, Wellness, etc. in the past three years for our shepherd dog. Instinct was recommended to her by a young vet. She was suggesting Prairie but I found the Instinct (grain free, same brand as Prairie) better (though more expensive). She loves this Salmon better than the others: Duck+Chicken, Rabbit, or Beef. Base on my research and experience, this is the BEST I've found, in terms of quality and the amount of protein and other essential ingredients. Blue Buffalo is very good too, as well as Taste of the Wild--but I don't like the smoky Roasted Bison, don't think it's as healthy--you don't want to eat BBQ every day yourself right? Orijen is similar to Blue Buffalo but their selection of ingredients may be more careful--however, I don't like the "moldy" looking kibbles though after one big bag, my dog is still healthy and fine. Surprisingly, my dog likes Max a lot--maybe it's like us human who enjoy french fries more than plain cheese sandwiches.

review/summary: Great product for pups but very expensive
review/text: This is a great product for my two Labrador Retrievers.  They love receiving this treat.  The problem is the price keeps increasing.  I first purchased these two years ago for about $50 for the box of 12.  Now, two years later, the price seems to be going up every few months.  I'm not sure why the cost increases either.  Rather than purchase a new box of 12, I am recylcling the old bones by cleaning them and inserting something else inside the bone (once the insides have been cleaned out by the dogs).<br /><br />These are hard bones and very difficult to break.  I haven't seen one broken but have seen one of my dogs chew at it breaking the ends.  Sometimes you'll get fat bones in the box with lots of filled product and other times you'll receive thin bones.  The last 12 I purchased, was around $68 for 12.  The entire box had the 6-inch bones but they were all thin, so practically useless.  The box before this last one had fat bones.<br /><br />If the price decreases, I'll buy some new ones to replace the old ones.  I have also purchased the cheese and beef filled bones from the same seller.  Shipping costs are expensive also.  Add the significant cost to purchase the box of 12 plus shipping, and these days it'll run close to $100 which is too expensive for us.<br /><br />I'd recommend the bones, but if you want to try them out first before buying a large quantity, the seller sells singles as well.  If the price decreased back under $60 and the shipping costs were cheaper, I would have given this a 5 star rating.

review/summary: Good tasting muffin.--
review/text: I added some nuts & banana for extra flavor; I also used applesauce instead of oil & egg substitute rather than eggs. Then I filled 2 muffin top pans to make 12 servings. They turned out moist & yummy! Then I tossed them in the freezer & eat them as needed for breakfast on the go or at work.

review/summary: Must have muffins
review/text: I found these muffins in my local supermarket about six months ago. They were easy to make and they come in two more flavors however Banana Nut is the best.  Considering the fiber I thought they would taste nothing like muffins but I was pleasantly surprised "no tree bark here". Needless to say I was not able to find Banana Nut flavor at any supermarkets any longer but Amazon "of course" has a pack of 4.  I would definitely recommend this product you get the fiber you need in a way you can enjoy it.

review/summary: Taste really good and easy to make
review/text: I wanted something to make with my daughter other than brownies and cupcakes.  These taste really good and are easy to make, but don't be fooled into thinking they are healthy - the first ingredient is sugar and the last half of the list are things I can't pronounce, with some cited in articles as reasons to go organic.  The box does not claim this product is healthy, though, so I'm only taking 1 star away for not being healthy.

review/summary: The Best Muffins EVER
review/text: My husband and I usually buy/love pumpkin muffins (Pillsbury). One day, the store was out, and my husband got Fiber One Banana Nut Muffins instead.<br /><br />OMG, it's now our absolute favorite! These scrumptious, hearty muffins smell SO good when they're baking--and are utterly delicious right out of the oven, as well as the next day.<br /><br />A great benefit, of course, is that it has a lot of fiber. But even if it were NOT healthy, it would still be the best muffin mix on the market, in my opinion. (Note: the apple/cinnamon isn't half as good...so stick with the banana, instead).<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />-- Janet Boyer, author of Back in Time Tarot

review/summary: Best Muffen Mix Ever
review/text: My husband loves these muffins.  I have tried all the flavors but this is the one he likes best.  I was buying them in the grocery stores but they stopped selling the Banans Nut flavor and I checked all the stores in our town. Finaly I gave up and went on line and it was so easy to order these that I think this is the way I will do it from now on.

review/summary: I'm a Fiber One Banana Nut
review/text: I love these muffins and can't get them anyplace near me.  This subscription is more convenient and even cheaper than I got them at Walmart!  As a T2 diabetic, these are a yummy breakfast choice that doesn't shoot my blood sugar through the roof.

review/summary: Better than muffins from the bakery!
review/text: Let me tell you, these are some awesome muffins! The taste is out of this world just as per the package directions. However, since we are creative types, we've made batches including mashed banana as a substitute for some of the oil, and added walnuts for extra heart-health benefit. After we pour the batter into the cups, we have created a ready-made assortment by alternatively popping in chocolate chips, dried cranberries, or bits of candied fruit! For some reason, the banana flavor of Fiber One mix disappears from the supermarket every time we look for it, so we are overjoyed to find it here on Amazon for a reasonable price.<br /><br />Wonderful stuff!

review/summary: I Found These !
review/text: I was buying the Fiber One banana nut in my local food store for a couple of years. I was easily able to find the blueberry kind but the banana nut and the apple cinnamon were available in only one store and now that store only carries the blueberry. I immediately checked on Amazon & to my delight the muffins were available. They arrived super well packaged and with an expiration date months in the future. These muffins are yummy, healthy, easy to prepare and a great snack alternative for kids.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: They came in a timely manner and nothing was wrong with them. They tasted just like they should and weren't squished. I got an extra box of something different in with it, but I wasn't charged so that's OK. The one thing I'd have liked to know was that the sell by date is in about 20 days. I thought I'd have longer before they got stale. Oh well, they're really good anyway.
