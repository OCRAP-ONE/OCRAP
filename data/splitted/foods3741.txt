review/summary: Smores candy bar
review/text: hmmmm so you fancy a smore but dont have the ingredients or its too much effort to make them... well hey your wish is granted.<br />Overall, I like it but for 2 things.<br />- needs a bit more marshmallow.<br />- chocolate is a teensy bit bitter.<br />Think this would depend on how you like your s'mores but I'd recommend it.

review/summary: Best around for lentil soup
review/text: The Lysanders lentil soup mix is the best around as far as we are concerned.  By "we" I mean everyone who has had it at our house likes it.  They like it so much that we buy packages for family members and give them as gifts.  It's fun to add a green pepper, etc. to the package to prompt early use by the recipient!

review/summary: Nothing special and *jumbo* my patootie!
review/text: Normally I wouldn't spring so much money for chocolate, but being that these Turin-made bars were filled with liquor-flavored "ganache" and came in a "jumbo" size, I figured it would be worth it.<br /><br />Ha-- well, color my face red! Turin did something very cute with these so-called "jumbo" bars, kind of like how snack companies will puff their jumbo-sized bags full of air to make them look like they have more chips than they really contain. You see, these bars *are* definitely larger than average size in terms of length and width. But their thickness is practically paper thin. We're talking maybe about as thin as Andes candy, maybe even a thinner than that. So they probably have no more volume than a Hershey bar that has been spread out really thinly.<br /><br />As for the taste? Absolutely nothing mind blowing to justify the price, just sort of "meh". I can't even honestly say that I "tasted" any of the flavors, either. On first bite I'd get a mild "hint" of Baileys or Kahlua, but then nothing much afterwards, just a blamd sweetened filling. The chocolate, too, was nothing great, kind of mediocre. So needless to say, I'd definitely pass on these. The packaging looks nice, the bars are huge, and the flavors exotic, but the product is average and over-priced.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Mmm...this boxed macaroni and cheese kit is great. The cheese sauce is smooth and creamy and there is just enough ro-tel included to give the mac some kick-without making it runny. As a bonus, it only takes about 15 mins. to prepare.<br /><br />Note: The ro-tel isn't mixed in with the cheese sauce, so you can add as much or as little of the tomato sauce as you'd like to the mac-or just skip it and use it in another dish. You could just add the tomato sauce to your portion if the kiddies don't like tomatoes. (Note: One box only makes 2 servings, unless you have tiny eaters).<br /><br />Try it!

review/summary: Mmmm, sour!
review/text: Sour candy is one of my little self indulgences that I let myself have every now and then. I just love sour apple flavor, and in my opinion the individually wrapped Sour Power belts are some of the best. I've tried the tubs of straws, sour laces from other companies, and the sour straws in the smaller packages, but these have what to me is the freshest, least gelatin-esque, and most sour flavor.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend them (just try to be responsible!). They're even individually wrapped for resale if you don't want to keep them all for yourself!

review/text: Thanks to reminiscing with my daughter (30) about my childhood experiences and the "love" for this particular candy she did a search on the Internet and found them.

It's been just lying around ever since, sometimes he plays with it, sometimes licks it, but doesn't want to keep chewing on it. This is while other rawhide chew bones we've tried he ate completely without much delay.

review/summary: Very nice flavor and you can stretch it
review/text: I really like the Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce Kit. This was a test of a competing brand. Although there is a definite difference in taste, they are both equally exotic for your taste buds. The Prima Taste has a distinctive lemongrass taste. The Asian Home has a distinctive medium hot chili taste. I added vegetables to both and served over rice from my rice cooker. Just as you might like 2 distinct fried chickens -say Popeye's cajun and KFC's herbs and spices- both of these Rendangs were very satisfying. If you only cook the Asian Home with your meat, you are definitely going to experience heat and a stronger spice taste. Here's my recipe that created 8 platefuls and reduced the chili heat:<br /><br />I added the Asian Home to a can of coconut milk and heated it in a covered non-stick Dutch oven. I added a lb. of thinly sliced round steak and simmered it 10 mins. I gently covered that with thin slices of a full broccoli stem and flowerette. After 10 min. I added thin celery slices, a standard can of straw mushrooms sliced and a standard can of bamboo shoots cubed small. (You can add carrot toothpick slices or red bell pepper for color.) Cook 10 minutes. By keeping the cover on you will  have some sauce on everything. Serve over rice for an all-in-one meal. Salt if you desire (I thought it brought out the flavor.)<br /><br />This is much more economical than the Prima Taste. You can achieve the lemongrass taste by adding some lemon juice. If you are used to a little sweetness, sprinkle a little sugar on top.

The seeds came in good condition, packaged in efficient clear plastic bags which work fine for storage, but you will want to transfer the seeds to some sort of more appropriate container when you want to use then for cooking or other purposes. (That is, the bags do not reseal and once open you might as well pour all the seeds out.)

review/text: If your favorite coffee at Starbucks is the Caramel Macchiato- then you will LOVE this coffee.  The price is just over a buck a cup so it's still pricey by home coffee standards, but is such a savings compared to Starbucks prices.  Side note- you don't have to follow the directions and make a tiny cup from these servings- I make my portions much larger and just stop the flow when the color runs opaque. Delicious!

review/text: I live in a small town and we don't have a coffee shop. My husband gave me the dolce Gusto machine for Christmas and I bought The Latte Macchiato right after. They are all gone now! The tast and milk froth are just as good as a coffee shop latte for a fraction of the price and you can make one in less than a minute with pretty much no clean up since only water touches the unit and all of the brewing takes place in the capsule. I am very pleased with this product.

It was quite good, nice and dark and bitter.  This afternoon I made one with the milk, and it's very nice.  I thought perhaps Latte Macchiato had sugar in the capsule, but it doesn't.  I like this one a lot.

review/summary: Delicious Latte!!
review/text: I really like Latte in general. I am especially pleased with this one because it is frothy, creamy and delicious, as though I bought it from a Batista! It is the real deal. The separate layers of the latte make the glass mug, I drink from, even more attractive to the eye. It is a bit costly, but that's why I don't drink it everyday since it does require the milk and coffee capsule. Now, instead of stopping at my favorite cafe, all I have to do is insert the capsules in and enjoy my gourmet coffee. My husband tried other flavors and loves them all. I think the machine itself was well-made and makes a great gift!

review/summary: Beautiful drink
review/text: This makes a beautiful cup of Latte Macchiato. I first didn't understand why the milk pod/cup was shot into the glass first, then the coffee one, since it looked like the milk is on top. Apparently this is what a macchiato is....a "little mark" in the milk that shows it is not a cafe latte (where the milk is added after the espresso.) I am not really sure what difference it makes flavor-wise to add one before or after the other, but at least I understand it now.<br /><br />The cups for the Nescafe Dolce Gusto indeed make a beautiful serving. It tastes milky...not as watery as I expected it to be...I added a little shave of nutmeg on top, and I am sure something like caramel or chocolate might be even better. I followed the instructions on how much milk to coffee ratio in mine, but I am sure the more you drink these, you may find your personal preference to be slightly different. That is one of the positive things about the brewer, that you can adjust amounts so easily. I did use the included glass to measure, and it may be more difficult to judge amounts in your own cup..that is why I took away one star.

Is the Keurig domination of the market driving the Dolce Gustos into oblivion?

review/text: I have two Dolce Gusto coffee machines..and am getting ready to buy the latest beauty--from Amazon.com of course!! They are the "great temptors" because they always have all the newest and latest in every category and I can't resist!!! This latte macchiato is the best I have had in this country. Supreme ingredients paired with fifteen bars of pressure in the machine (professional grade) render a true luxury for the palate!!!I can wholeheartedly recommend one of these machines (the coffee machine that starts with a "K" is pitifully lacking in comparison). Then the lovely variety of coffees,hot chocolat--like that cup of rich decadence that you stand in line a mile long for in Paris!!!!Yummmmm. This stuff that I am ranting and raving about is worth your trying...My palate is no "newbie" for I am a graduate of that culinary institute where so many James Beard winners have come from (I am not one of those.... but I have a very educated palate). I hope someone reading this review will join me fot a cup of"jo"....then write a review here and tell what flavor captures your fancy...Can't wait to read the reviews...It's sort of like sharing your secret with someone!!!!!FUN!!!!!!!tha

review/summary: Excellent coffee for a home machine!
review/text: I have never been a regular coffee drinker and rarely indulged in a latte or cappucino. The local coffee house and Starbucks are just so overpriced, it seemed like an insane daily expense. However, after vowing to reduce my Dr Pepper consumption, yet still needing the caffeine, I bought the Nestle Dolce Gusto machine and a variety of the various coffees for it. After three months I find I am drinking two or three of these per day and have cut my cola habit in half and significantly reduced my sugar intake as well. (Nice bonus there!)<br /><br />The Latte Macchiato is a good one. It's got a simple flavor without being too strong or bitter. The milk doesn't have alot of sugar (no artificial sweeteners). I do add a teaspoon of sugar to the entire drink. I tend to make my latte larger than the portion size suggested on the box - I don't care for really strong coffee. The Vanilla version of this drink is lightly sweetened & flavored - this one is not. You could add a shot of caramel syrup to this to "fancy" it up for guests very easily. I like this one so much I've done Amazon's Subscribe & Save plan with it. Compared the local big box store prices per box, Amazon's prices are about $1.50 cheaper per box!

review/summary: Easy + Fast = Delicious
review/text: Initially, I was concerned about the powdered milk more than anything.  Happily, the concern was unfounded.  The Macchiato is delicious.  The coffee is strong, the milk slightly sweet.  The whole drink is wonderfully frothy.  My preference, when I have a fancy coffee drink, is for something on the sweet side.  Therefore, I add a little simple syrup of sugar to the bottom of the cup before brewing.  It's great.

review/text: I gave four starts because I love how this machine offers the ability for milk capsules to be added to your coffee drinks. The taste was fair to good, and did help smooth out the flavors of the coffees. In general, I like coffee black but I also enjoy cappuccino, but found that these capsules helped mask some of the dry, tasteless coffees.

review/text: Another great flavor from Nescafe Dolce Gusto - I really enjoyed this drink! As others, it was really easy to make, and also lighter on the calories! You do get the 8 servings instead of the 16 because of the milk capsules, but I think it was worth it. I love vanilla lattes, so I actually added some vanilla extract to the brewed cup, and it was perfect!

review/summary: Excellent. The best flavor yet!
review/text: This flavor is definitely my favorite of the bunch. Contrary to the instructions, I prefer brewing the milk FIRST and then adding the coffee (I know it shouldn't taste better that way, but I assure you it does). I also typically let the coffee run through a little longer than recommended and do not put in quite as much milk as the instructions -- yummy! The amount of foam on top is very pleasant, and the flavor is not overly sweet. Very balanced. For 90 calories a serving, this is a winner!<br /><br />5/5

review/text: My favorite Starbucks drink is the caramel Macchiato but I hate the cost and even more the calories! This drink gives me my fix at home for a quarter of the price and with only 90 calories (I do throw a small shot of both sugar free vanilla and caramel syrup in there). In sum maybe not as good as the full fat/sugar version I used to get at Starbucks but a pretty darn close second that I feel good about drinking!

review/text: What a great tasting Latte.  Put the milk cup in first and watch carefully...you have to stop the machine on your own when you think you've added enough milk, then put the coffee cup in and add just enough to your liking and *poof* perfection.  One of the best Latte's I've ever had.  Why only 4 stars?  Price.  I think the price is a bit steep for all of the Nescfe Dolce coffees.  I realize that you pay more at specialty coffee shops, but I think that the price is to steep and they aren't readily available except for on Amazon.

review/summary: Nice with a pump of syrup, if you like milk based coffee drinks
review/text: I'm not a big fan of heavy milk based coffee drinks, but this was nice with a pump of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2R2">Torani Syrup, Raspberry, 25.4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)</a>. I tried it twice made per the directions, but since I'm not a huge fan of milk, for the third drink (in two days!) I reduced the milk and increased the coffee to find a balance of flavors that I enjoy.<br /><br />With that in mind, I still feel that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Espresso, 16-Servings (Pack of 3)</a> capsules combined with fresh frothed milk rather than the included milk capsule makes a better drink so that is my reason for knocking a star.

review/summary: Perfect Combination of Coffee & Milk; Not too Sweet
review/text: Wow! All that I can say is that on first taste of the macchiato that comes out of the Dolce Gusto machine, "I'm hooked!" It avoids all of the extremes that a poorly made macchiato falls into. It is not too sweet; nor is it bitter. Not too much milk and the coffee is not overpowering. It is the perfect early afternoon light coffee drink. I actually prefer this one to Starbuck's version because it is a little less sweet.<br /><br />The best part in my opinion, is that you can slightly customize your beverage, a little more milk for a lighter drink...or a little more coffee for a bolder drink. Fine tune your beverage to your liking (But be careful, too much of the coffee pod and the drink becomes bitter). Don't get me wrong, you could probably do better and fine-tune a little more if you drew a shot of fresh roasted, fresh ground espresso and made your own. But I have certaintly tasted much worse (and few better) macchiatos.

review/text: Though this is a tasty coffee, it's not worth the price to me for 8 coffee and 8 milk capsules. Choose another coffee-only flavor and add your own milk (I microwave the milk while I'm brewing the coffee). You'll still have the foam but twice the servings.

review/summary: Would rate about 2.5
review/text: Since we cannot assign half star ratings, I have to say I would give this product a 2.5 which rounds to 3 stars.  This is probably one of my least favorite of the available flavors available for the Dolce Gusto coffee machine.  I personally am not a "frou-frou" coffee/latte expert by any means, so my rating is based on my own personal experience with just this product.  I actually prefer my coffee served black, with no sugar, creamer/milk, so I am probably a little more biased when it comes to rating something like this.<br /><br />I have to agree with another reviewer who said this coffee looks better than it tastes.  I mentioned in a review of another flavor that I don't care too much for the milk, and I think that may be what primarily affects my opinion of this particular flavor; I find it too has an aftertaste and even a powder-like feel.  I do not feel that the available hot chocolate version suffered from this as much.

review/text: I enjoy the flavor of this product very much. I almost never get any sort of flavored coffee from Starbucks, I'm typically a regular coffee guy.  I've seen the light and I'm enjoying my Dolche Gusto machine almost every night.<br /><br />This is probably my 3rd favorite flavor. Cappuccino and Choochino beat it out but this one tastes VERY similar to the Cappuccino so it's a tough call. Try one, you'll probably like it.  The downside is the expense, you're talking about $1 a drink, not to mention the price of the machine.  That's pretty steep for a homemade coffee drink IMO.

review/text: Of all the Dolce Gusto coffee drinks I've tried, this was probably my least favorite. It's still a good drink, but every time I make it, it feels a little weaker than I think it should be.  My advice is to be careful with how long you let it steam through. The caveat I'd give my own review though is that I like strong coffee and a latte is by definition made with a lot of milk.

review/summary: Familiar Like the Girl Next Door: Latte Macchiato Meets a Delicious Need
review/text: My Nescafe Dolce Gusto Latte Macchiato was born on my counter, not royal, nor so humble that I would not enjoy her company. Finding companionship with wine glasses, she smiled at me, and together, we ran through the morning with celebration of sugar, caffeine and artificial milk. It lacked the superb richness of a true, cafe-birthed Latte Macchiato, but brought me a plebeian convenience, like a girl next door's beauty and familiarity.<br /><br />The process for her creation was three-step. First, the mere heating of the machine. Second, the insertion of the milk-foam capsule and pulling hot water through it. Third, and lastly, inserting the espresso-like coffee capsule, and likewise pulling it.<br /><br />I can, and often do, make a more sophisticated latte macchiato, but the time it takes, though worth it, is not always available. I enjoyed tasting this drink, knowing fully what it could be, but accepting it as it was.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/summary: Not a Starbucks Caramel Macchiato just an idiot proof "latte"
review/text: First of all, the reviewer who said if you like Starbucks Caramel Macchiato thinks this is close, they should have their palate tested as the drink at the chain has syrup flavoring and CARAMEL sauce all over the top of WHIPPED CREAM.  This however, is a powdered milk that heats to liquid with a weakish "espresso" added.  If you throw a 1/4 tsp of raw sugar in it you might have a bit of comparison but otherwise no.<br /><br />This said, by far my favorite of all of the drinks that are available for this machine (sans the mocha as I have yet to try that one).  It's barely better than the cappucino though, with this machine you get what you can buy from Nestle.  The manufacturer would do well to make the Nespresso coffee available for these as the quality of the espresso roast is far better in those bar coded pods.<br /><br />That said, it's all taste.  Machine is only as good as the coffee and the bottom line is that I normally enjoy an americano (real one that is) and this "latte" does the job in the morning IF I drink two.

review/text: Everyone's tastes are different. With that said, I would definitely recommend trying these first. I tried Nescafe Latte Machiatto pods (along with some other flavors) in the machine I bought that uses these pods. Really wanted to like them but they were AWFUL. Bitter, synthetic--like something from a vending machine. The Dolce Gusto espresso/cappuccino/latte maker has been returned to Amazon; unfortunately, the pods are a grocery item so not eligible for return. I have two boxes--50 dollars' worth--of the cappuccino pods sitting in the box they arrived in--feel like I put fifty bucks into my office shredder. Bottom line is, should have tried them before ordering any equipment/pods off the internet. Save your cash--try them first!

Perhaps the directions are off and I should try to experiment a little bit with the water amount that is put in or maybe adding less of the milk.  It seems that the instructions have you put in a lot of milk compared to the coffee.

review/text: This Tandoori BBQ Chicken mix is very good.<br />We received a lot of compliments on this recipe when we grilled it last summer and our guests went out of their way to say "wow", that's good... what recipe is that?  It's very flavorful and a little spicy but not hot or anything.<br /><br />We originally found Shan Tandoori spice mix at a tiny 4 table restaurant/grocery store for $1.99 when the owner happened to stock it for a while.  I went back to get more but they quickly ran out so I'm glad to find it here also.  There are literally several hundred other interesting spice mixes like this from overseas once you know where to look.<br /><br />Maybe Amazon can work with more vendors on this type of product since Shan Tandoori mix sells online for $1.25 at 'America's largest online India Grocer'.  Amazon has them as a partner already so I figured it's ok to mention there's hundreds of other recipes to try that aren't listed here yet.<br /><br />Most of these recipes call for lots of fresh vegetables such as garlic, tomatoes, cilantro, fresh ginger, etc.  Over the next few weeks we'll try some of the other variations....<br /><br />Aaloo Bhaji Curry Mix<br />Chappli Kabab Masala<br />Tandoori Chicken BBQ<br />Bombay Biryani Masala<br />Dopiaza / Stew Curry<br />Maesri Masaman Curry<br />Tikka Seekh Kabab BBQ<br />Parampara Prawn Masala

review/summary: Not Too Shabby
review/text: Well heart issues is forcing me to eat asalt  reduced (a lot reduced) diet.  And while I really hate most of the products made  as a substitute for salt, this product with  garlic and herbs is actually pretty good.  I especially like it sprinkled on steaks and chops when grilling.  It is a lot more convenient to have everything pre-mixed than to have all these spices/herbs on hand and then to mix these all up for myself; and the price here can't be beat.<br /><br />I sprinkle some on just before putting the meat on the grill and then I sprinkle on some more  just before eating.  No it really doesn't replace salt and as far as I'm concerned nothing can beat a lovely grilled steak with a light sprinkling of salt, but since I want to save my allowable salt mgs for other things, then this is a pretty good replacement.  I use it to flavor other things too, so for the price it is very versatile.  Just be a bit careful not to use too much separate pepper as this product  seems to rely heavy on pepper to pique the taste buds.<br /><br />In this product you will find:<br />Garlic<br />Onion<br />Black Pepper<br />Parsley<br />Bay<br />Marjoram<br />Oregano<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Coriander<br />Cumin<br />Mustard<br />Rosemary<br />Celery Seed<br />Carrot<br />Orange Peel]<br />and<br />Spice Extracts

review/text: I used to eat a lot of Tinkyada pasta until I read that rice grown in the US South may contain high levels of arsenic. According to Tinkyada, their rice is grown in Arkansas. I emailed them to find out if they had tested their rice for arsenic.  I never received a reply.  Their website does not address the issue either.  Until they print assurances that their rice is safe, I plan to avoid all their products.<br /><br />Lundberg rice, which is grown in California, is safe from arsenic according to the company.

review/text: I ordered these because of all the reviews here on amazon, and everyone was right: these really are delicious. They beat other whole grain noodles, including whole wheat noodles, by a mile. The texture is a bit denser and chewier than regular noodles, but still wonderful--not gummy or rubbery. (My husband actually prefers their texture to regular noodles, while I find them equally good.) And there's no powerful "healthy" flavor to throw off your recipes. Excellent. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Brown Pasta is AWESOME!
review/text: We have been using this brand of pasta for over a year now and absolutely love it.  It does not taste funny as the whole wheat pastas do, nor does it have any strange chewiness.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to stay away from gluten or who is cooking for those with diabetes.  It does not affect the blood sugar the same way regular pasta does at all, nor does it have the same glycemic index.  Cooking time is a few minutes longer, but the product is always delicious.

The Raspberry Cherry preserves are very well balanced with a not too tart, and not too sweet flavor.  I use this and their other toppings to make crumbles, crisps and also as toppings on ice cream.  Each holiday season we stock up on these for a special treat.  They are also perfect gift items as they are far superior to any variety of topping or preserve that you're going to find in the grocery store.  You just can't beat Pacific Northwestern cherries!

review/text: January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.

review/text: This is a great tea that I'm using with a 2 week detox plan. Now I like all kinds of teas mainly for the healthy attributes, NOT TASTE.  I don't add sugar, honey, etc, I just drink tea straight after steeping' it. Most teas to me really have either not much flavor, but a strong herb taste to it, but THERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS TEA THOUGH! I did as instructed, and steeped this tea for 15 minutes to get the full flavor, thinking it would just have a gross and very strong herb taste, but I was wrong. It really has a smooth, sweet, and a little bit spicy taste to it. It's great and I recommend this tea for both TASTE and HEALTH ATTRIBUTES.<br />Will definitely stock up on this tea!!!<br />;)

I add some honey in mine though.  I usually experience immense neck and shoulder pain especially when I eat something I'm sensitive to, and this tea has helped tremendously with that pain.

review/summary: A Newbie to Healthy Teas
review/text: I'd ordered this because of the detox label thinking that it was going to have a different effect (i.e., I was going to be living in the bathroom for a couple of weeks). Since getting it, and doing some additional reading, I now realize that it's a bit more subtle than that.<br /><br />I'd ordered this on June 27th and got it in time to start drinking it over the weekend so I haven't been drinking it long so I don't expect that I'm going to have any immediate health benefits from it.<br /><br />Right now, I have a cup at night before I go to bed. Today, being a holiday and off work I had a cup before lunch. I haven't worked my way up to drinking it in the morning before work since I'm currently too attached to my coffee/caffeine.  I'll increase up to the suggested 3 cups a day starting tomorrow and see what happens.<br /><br />Regarding the licorice taste, yup, it tastes like black licorice.. I mean really tastes like it.  I'd never been a fan of licorice but for the sake of health I can gulp an 8 oz cup or two of this down. When it's cooled down a bit I can just drink it down. If it's hot I sweeten mine with a small amount of stevia.  I've found that I can tolerate a lot if it's sweet.

review/text: I can honestly say that this is the best coffee I have ever tasted.  First off, the Nescafe pod coffee maker is the best thing I ever purchased.  The coffee is fabulous, and we have tried them all.  This is just one of the coffee's we purchase every month.

review/summary: Amazing iced coffee
review/text: Very fast delivery, item was in perfect shape and fresh. I always loved this product and it became hard to find in any local store. The taste is very good and its refreshing to be able to get the great coffee taste in milk since I am unable to drink regular coffee because of stomach problems.

review/summary: Iced cappucino at home
review/text: This coffee is delicious!  It is the equivalent of high priced cappuccino with the added benefit of customizing for your needs.  I use lactose-free milk and make it as strong as I like using less milk or 2 packets.  I have even used half a packet for a short one!  It's helpful to have a shaker to blend it well.  It's a great product for summer coffee lovers.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I love this product, stumbled across it many years ago in grocery store & have been buying it ever since. Not really a coffee drinker, but do like the taste and am definitely a milk drinker. Maxwell house International Iced Lattes give me both. A refreshing iced morning drink. Love it!!!!!
