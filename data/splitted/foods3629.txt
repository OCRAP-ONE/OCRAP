review/summary: Very Good Oil For  The Price.
review/text: I like this olive oil for a couple of reasons.  It's the best I've found in the price range I'm willing to pay.<br />It comes in a tin, which I think protects the flavor of the oil longer.<br />I will not buy oil in a plastic bottle!<br />When I buy I always buy a pack for my friend, who is a chef.  She swears by it.

review/summary: Expiration Dates Explained
review/text: I just got off the phone with a Zoe representative and she was more than helpful explaining how to read the expiration date on the bottom of the can....Here goes  The "L" stands for lot and the next 4 digits are the specific factory location in Spain (it helps them not us) the next two digits are the year it was made and the last three digits (or two) are the julian date...(for example  May 1 would be "121" or October 13 would be "286" Here is the link to an online julian calander if you need it....[...]  So a code on the bottom of L  123411286  would be canned on October 13, 2011.....Hope this clears up any confusion....Oh by the way I loooove the oil for the price...are there better oils out there? Absolutely  but bang for the buck I put my money on Zoe.....

review/summary: Really not that great...
review/text: I must have had this oil in my Amazon cart for two years, always debating if I should give it a try.  Finally I did.  I was really disappointed.  I really find this oil very average.  It does smell nice but the flavor is somewhat weak, a little bland.  I guess because of the great reviews I expected more.  I suppose for general cooking this oil would be nice, but i wouldnt use it for a salad if I wanted to impress someone.<br />By the way, if you ever want to taste a great oil, see if you can get your hands on "Protoulis" oil from Greece.  So far it's the best oil I have ever come across.

review/text: This is a good oil for basic Italian cooking.  There are other oils out there at far higher prices, that will give you very different flavors and nuances, but I always like to have a basic oil that I like well enough to use in cooking or on salads, and maybe have a more "gourmet" EVOO for really special stuff.  Good, solid oil, good price.

review/text: I started buying this in my quest to find a good value-oriented everyday olive oil for cooking, and have recently converted to a subscription delivery after replenishing a couple of times.

review/text: I'm not a "pro" but this seems like good oil and a good price.  Eat it with foccica and smear it all over your face.  I've been doing some olive oil reading.  There's a lot to olive oil evaluation.  I remember that, "There is no right or wrong about matters of taste."<br /><br />If you slurp this oil, it will hit you in the back of the throat; peppery - yeh, I guess.  It is packaged in a can, which is good.  There is a code number of some kind on the bottom, but no xpiration date that I can discern - a little too hocus-pocus for me, but OK for now.  It's not like signing a two year contract for a cell phone.

It is flavorful, with a beautiful color.<br />The tins are beautiful, and very convenient for protecting the olive oil from light.<br />You cannot beat this price for the quality (especially if you subscribe to have it shipped automatically)!<br />I highly recommend this olive oil for everyday cooking!<br />LOVE IT!<br /><br />UPDATE 1 1/2 YEARS LATER:<br />I still use this with all of my cooking: pasta, roasting meats&veggies, pizza dough, bread, etc!<br />It is auto-shipped every six months, and I love this olive oil.<br />I have not had any issue with quality, shipping, taste, or longevity.<br /><br />Also, I was using with a oil cruet, but I find it easier to pour straight from the tin. I have no mess doing this, and I get a nice flow.<br /><br />TIP: Use this nightly on your face to cleanse, moisturize, and remove makeup. Wipe off with a towel. Then, use a normal facial cleanser. This works great, even for oily skin (which I have)!

review/summary: Zoe, a superb 2nd E.V.O.O. to have on hand !
review/text: To put it in the most simple words, ZOE, a Spanish olive oil, is a "somewhat more zesty and peppery" olive oil than its mainstream Italian oils. This stuff is GREAT for doing the oil/balsamic bread dip, insofar as most people will comment on its taste along with the milder Italian offerings. I've gone through countless tins of it already....a great, consistent performer !

review/text: This is pretty bland olive oil, I think that it is comparable to the common brands that you can buy in the regular grocery store.  I'm not an olive oil connoisseur and am surprised that this is as blah as it is.  It's not fruity or nutty or anything that I associate with extra virgin olive oil.  I wish that I didn't have two full tins of it.  It's fine to saute with, but I wouldn't recommend it for salad dressings and such.

review/text: Zoe Extra Virgin is not an amazing, full-flavored oil that you'd want to sop up with bits of homemade bread. It is, however, great for a wide range of other applications, like cooking, or making salad dressings. The metal 1 liter tins help keep the oil fresh for an extended period of time, as light and air will speed up the the oil becoming rancid.

review/summary: Very Nice Olive Oil
review/text: We really love this olive oil in our household and have taken to purchasing it on the subscription plan.  We have found this olive oil so tasty and versatile that we use it for everything.  (Well, almost.  I insist on using real butter for my chocolate chip cookies)  Its color is a pleasing light yellow-gold with a hint of green.  It is of very consistent quality batch-to-batch and is better and less expensive than what I can find locally.  The taste is smooth and fruity with no bitterness, but mild enough to use as a substitute for butter in most recipes.<br /><br />It is good enough to stand alone with some good french bread and aged balsamic vinegar but inexpensive enough that we use it for all our cooking and sauces.  I like the fact that it comes in a tin that is attractive enough to leave on the kitchen counter and it also protects the contents from light.  the pull out pouring spout meters the oil well and prevents most drips.<br /><br />This presents a very nice balance between quality and price.  There may be better olive oils out there, and certainly less expensive ones, but this one hits the sweet spot between quality and value.

review/summary: Good Oil, Good Price
review/text: My wife and I cook a lot. Olive Oil is something that we use almost daily - usually several times. I was interested in buying some in bulk and trying to find good quality for my dollar. After reviewing the offerings on Amazon, I selected this brand of oil.<br /><br />It was a good buy.<br /><br />The oil tastes good - not overpowering food, but providing a distinct flavor. This may not be oil you would use strictly as dipping oil (but that is not what it is made for). The oil cooks nicely when sauteing, browning meat, or as part of a dressing.<br /><br />You get two large cans of the olive oil (I am still working through our second) and it lasts well since it is not hit by light.<br /><br />My reccomendation is to get this and use it often - try it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SPZV">Misto M100S Gourmet Brushed Aluminum Olive Oil Sprayer</a>. Works great (but read reviews on the Misto - don't fill it all the way!).<br /><br />Bon Appetit.

If the price is good, then by all means use it as your cooking oil & for salads with a tasty vinegar which dominates, such as balsamic.

review/summary: Nice Flavor and nice for cooking
review/text: One can lasts a long time so for me, it makes sense not to buy the cheapest oil since it doesnt add up to a lot of money over time.  It is good enough for dipping with a nice italian  bread and but inexpensive enough that we use it for all our cooking and sauces. I like the fact that it comes in a tin that is attractive enough to leave on the kitchen counter and it also protects the contents from light. the pull out pouring spout meters the oil well and prevents most drips. This gives a very nice balance between quality and price. There may be better olive oils out there, and certainly less expensive ones, but this one hits the sweet spot between quality and value. We really love this olive oil at home and have taken to purchasing it on the subscription plan. We have found this olive oil so tasty and versatile that we use it for everything. Its color is a pleasing light yellow-gold with a hint of green. It is of very consistent quality batch-to-batch and is better and less expensive than what I can find locally. The taste is smooth with no bitterness, but mild enough to use as a substitute for butter in most recipes. Olive oil is one of the healtiest fats you can get.

review/summary: Excellent salad and dipping oil
review/text: I have been ordering Zoe olive oil for close to five years ever since I attended a wedding in Pittsburg, Pa. At a brunch, Zoe was the dipping olive oil, which everyone (there were ten of us) found to be the best they had ever had. Keep in mind, olive oils, like wine, have good years and average years. Zoe seems to maintain a consistant flavor although some years better than others. Notwithstanding the that, I have continued to order it year after year.

review/summary: Love the Olive Oil; Hate the Cans
review/text: Olive oil has great taste and value.  I didn't want to spend all day looking for the perfect olive oil; this one had good reviews and a good price per liter as compared to grocery store varieties.  I use olive oil for everything (as opposed to any other types of oil), so Zoe's is a good compromise on quality and value for a large amount - good bang for the buck.<br /><br />My biggest (really only) complaint are the annoying tin cans.  Every pour from the can results in wasted oil coming down the side of the can or resting on the top of the can.  I feel like any money I saved buying this oil is being poured down the side of the can.  Plus, I get to clean it up, every single time.  That annoyance alone is not worth any saved money.<br /><br />Bottom line: I do like the taste; I do enjoy cooking with it; I hate the cans.  I would consider buying this oil again in a different container type if the price was still right.

review/summary: Excellent but I wouldn't call it the greatest
review/text: Today, making bread, I caught a whiff of the fruity aroma of this oil.  It's a nice olive oil, clear, light, very good to excellent quality.<br /><br />But I'm sorry to say it isn't a five star olive oil from my vantage point. I am looking for a more distinctly flavored oil.  I haven't found that flavor lately.<br /><br />Olive oil used to have a much stronger olive flavor.  It wasn't rancid or imbalanced or a lesser quality.  There were oils, usually Spanish olive oil with a more distinctly olive taste.  Goya made a wonderful olive oil.  So did Pope.<br /><br />Today most quality olive oils like Zoe offer a fresh, pleasant flavor.  But there's something missing and I'd say Zoe suffers from this as well- a strong olive flavor is eschewed in favor of a more neutral and less obtrusive one.<br /><br />But this is not what I'm looking for in extra virgin olive oil or any olive oil.  What I want is a distinctly olive flavor.  So that accounts for my four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Zoe has a very mild olive flavor, it's fresh and fruity.  But it's not very olive-y.  So frankly if I'm going to pay for first press, I'm looking for a very distinct olive flavor.  This one, like most olive oils today is rather bland.<br /><br />The search is still on. If anyone would recommend an oil for me to try, and trust me I've tried all the store available brands, I would be most grateful.  Being Spanish, I'm ALWAYS on the lookout for a very distinct olive flavor for my cooking.

It has very little of the fresh olive flavor and aroma I expect from good oil.  I have used many other brands and I think that even the Bertolli EVOO sold by Sam's is superior to this oil (and about the same price).  Oh well, it will be good for pan frying.

review/summary: The wonders of olive oil
review/text: Olive oil is more than a food product. It treats cuts, burns,itching and various other skin issues.  2 tablespoons of this oil added to the juice of one orange taken at night will dissolve kidney stones. It will not mix. You don't want it to anyway. The oil floats on top and the orange juice is next to your tongue where your taste buds are when you drink it. As a result you taste the juice and not so much the oil. Don't drink or eat anything else after taking it and in the am drink a full 8 oz glass of water.  Note that most of our glasses these days are 12 oz. or more.  So check the glass that you are using.  There are many other health benefits in olive oil.  Check out the olive oil books here on Amazon.  I would not be without my Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.

Sometimes this flavor can be hard to find in stores, so when you run across it, make sure to stock up.<br /><br />Honestly, it's not an overstatement to say that Blue Raspberry Lemonade is the best Kool-Aid out there now.  If you like Kool-Aid and drink it often, you owe it to yourself to try this flavor.

review/summary: Good taste, expensive here
review/text: I agree with the other review that you can purchase this locally for much less, even with free shipping. The problem is- if you can't get out to the store yourself (in the case of my mother) you're going to have to order it, and you might as well order it here. Sure, look for a sale, but if you can't wait, this is a good product that tastes almost unrecognizable from full caff coffee. Older folks especially need to take in lots of fluids, and drinking a cup of full caff coffee strips out necessary liquids. So we stepped Mom down to 1/2 instead of going to full decaf, which usually tastes extremely different. I did take a star off the review for the huge package. It's hard for one person to go through a tub of ground coffee, much less two tubs. But obviously they have to sell it in bulk to make money. We keep the opened tub in the frig to try to keep it fresh.

review/summary: Great snack for our canine friends too!
review/text: I have two senior labrador retrievers and have recently become concerned about promoting eye health in their old age.  So I decided to add carrots to their diet.  One of them will eat raw carrots, but the other one won't so I started looking for pureed carrots.  This led me to the discovery of Peter Rabbit Organics baby food.  I have tried both varieties that contain carrots and my "girls" just LOVE them both!  I put a little squeeze (about a tablespoon) on top of their evening meal and they go absolutely crazy for it.  I will continue to feed this to any and all future dogs that I share my home with and I'm gonna start them on it early and not wait until they're old.  I would think any of these purees would be good for encouraging picky eaters to eat too.  (Luckily, I do not have that problem with my labs).<br /><br />I like that Peter Rabbit Organics is organic and contains only whole ingredients with no added sugar or salt or other crap!  Lastly, I like that they come in the squeezable packs so that makes dispensing super easy.  No need to even dirty a spoon; just squeeze out a dollup!

review/summary: Poor storage before shipping
review/text: All of them are distorted..as if melted and cooled. It's almost impossible to get the foil "out of" some of them. Those go in the trash. I have yet to find even one that looks normal and didn't have some gray on it.<br /><br />What causes chocolate to become gray?<br /><br />"Sugar bloom is normally caused by surface moisture. The moisture causes the sugar in the chocolate to dissolve. Once the moisture evaporates, sugar crystals remain on the surface. If this process is repeated, the surface can become sticky and even more discolored. Although sugar bloom is most often the result of overly humid storage, it can happen when the chocolate has been stored at a relatively cool temperature and is then moved too quickly into much warmer surroundings. When this happens, the chocolate sweats, producing surface moisture.<br /><br />Fat bloom is similar to sugar bloom, except that it is fat or cocoa butter that is separating from the chocolate and depositing itself on the outside of the candy. As with sugar bloom, the most common causes of fat bloom are quick temperature changes and overly-warm storage.<br /><br />Although it might look a little less appetizing than a lustrous, rich chocolatey-brown piece of candy, chocolate that has suffered bloom is still okay to eat. You may find the texture of sugar-bloomed chocolate to be a bit grainy on the outside, but it should still taste good. To prevent this from happening to your chocolate, simply use proper storage methods."<br /><br />Guess I'll be returning this.

review/summary: 40oz vs 56oz...um I'm short 16oz.
review/text: UPDATE - 1 week later: DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY! They still owe me 64oz of Hershey Kisses. They responded to my email stating that they would send me the remainder of my product and they have not.  Then I get an email from Amazon that I can't contact the seller because they are no longer selling with Amazon.  Well hello...they are selling under Amazon just under a different name!  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!<br /><br />I ordered 4 bags of these which would mean I should get 224oz of Hershey kisses. That is not what I received. Instead of four 56oz bags of kisses. I received four 40oz bags. That's 160oz. Ummm. Somebody owes me 64oz of Hershey Kisses!  I ordered them for a baby shower and now I don't have the supplies I need. Did I mention the label stated it was a Walmart order made by someone else and shipped to me?  I don't think I ordered this from Walmart.

review/summary: Child Slavery
review/text: Hershey's supply line comes from West Africa where there is a prevalence of child slavery in the cocoa bean industry. They continually refuse to make their supply line transparent or implement changes to guarantee the safety of children.<br /><br />Don't think this is relevant to a product review? Consider if it was your child, friend, relative who lived in slavery - would you want people buying products harvested by them?<br /><br />It is no surprise that people do not find this review helpful.  Why would we ever want to know that our affluence and comfort is the result of abusing children?  Please let us go on in ignorance!!

review/summary: Good Tassimo decaf
review/text: Tassimo was very popular and had a great selection of coffee when it first came out.  I drink regular coffee and that's usually what's in our regular coffee maker at home.  My wife, however, prefers decaf, so she uses the Tassimo to brew it when she wants coffee.  Previously, she liked to drink the Gevalia decaf for Tassimo, but that product is no longer available.<br /><br />She reports that this product tastes good - and she would buy it again.

review/summary: Great value, rich, full-bodied coffee!
review/text: Tassimo really hit it out of the park when it partnered with Maxwell House!  Both decaf and regular coffees are excellent choices, but I am especially impressed with the rich flavor of their decaf. I don't understand why this is, but I actually prefer Maxwell House BETTER from a T-Disk than from my drip coffee maker!  And at Amazon's price of $27 for 5 pkgs of 16 ct t-disks, it's half what I would have to pay locally.  What more could a girl ask for?!

review/summary: Mild and flavorless at automatic brew
review/text: These decaf pods give mild and tasteless flavors at Tassimo's auto-brew settings.  To brew a stronger cup, simply press the big start button during the brewing process to stop the machine.  I usually stop at half-cup (a complete automatic brew makes a 11 oz. cup).  Even then, though, I'm still disappointed with the lack of aroma and taste.  I'm now stuck with 75 more of these suckers to go.

review/text: My husband is American and since we met in the Middle East, He loved the Turkish coffee taste when he first tried it in Iraq and Jordan. I was trying to get him the same flavor of the cardamom. This coffee was good but not exactly as the same Turkish coffee we had in Iraq and Jordan. It does not have the cardamom flavor we were looking for but we can add it when we make the coffee.  The Coffee is still a good Coffee but not exactly what we were looking for.
