review/summary: Bold and not to sweet....
review/text: This drink is real good especially when it is real cold. I prefer cold coffee drinks over hot ones. The can is pretty small like a red bull can. It is easy to stash any where in your bag. The taste is pretty good and straight forward. It is bold with a hint of sweetness. It is not that sweet to me compared to other drinks from Starbucks or Monster. It does give you an after taste of coffee. Not that bad but it feels like you have coffee breath. Calories are low compared to other comparable drinks. It gives me a good quick boost that I need to begin the day.

review/summary: Did not like the taste ... strong with a bitter bite.
review/text: I did not like the taste of this canned coffee.  It had a very strong, bitter bite.  I took two sips and could not drink anymore.  My husband (who loves about anything coffee) said that he didn't really like it either, but then he polished off the can.  This is definitely a personal taste item.

review/summary: Nice for an afternoon break
review/text: Right up front: I like this drink, even though I usually don't want my coffee tampered with: No sugar, No milk or cream, No frothing, No cinnamon, No nonsense.<br /><br />This has a definite espresso flavor and is very sweet. The potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate effectively cut the bitterness that one would expect. I poured the drink into a glass, and there was no aluminum can taste.<br /><br />Actually, since it is based on espresso, I found that half the can was enough for me. At another time I might enjoy a whole can (which is still less than 7 oz.) Even though was cold, I drank it like espresso--one sip at a time.<br /><br />My energy level usually slumps in the middle of the afternoon. I found that by taking a short break and _slowly_ drinking the illy issimo coffee drink, I was refreshed and ready to go on with my day. (Could they have found a more awkward name than: illy issimo Caffe Italian espresso style coffee drink?)<br /><br />But now the true test: Will I actually buy it? Yeah, the next time I go to my local supermarket I will check it out. If it is no more expensive than Amazon, I will probably buy some to have occasionally. (If you are not really out in the boonies, it just seems strange to buy food from Amazon--and I have bought a lot of different stuff from Amazon.)<br /><br />Notes: -->I noticed some other reviewers were drinking it (and it was suggested) when they were commuting or in a hurry. Drink brewed coffee then. Don't rush through espresso--that is just disrespectful. -->Also, on the can, the promise seems to be that the coffee itself is natural, not necessarily the whole product. -->Yes, I know that the energy boost was from relaxing, enjoying the drink, and the sugar, because it takes an hour for caffeine to actually kick in.

review/summary: It's all right for a canned coffee drink.
review/text: illy issimo Coffee Drink Caffe is an okay canned coffee drink (if you're into such a thing).  Drinking coffee out of a can is an acquired taste, you either like it or hate it.  I happen to enjoy drinking coffee-on-the-go and its not that bad.  That saying, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase a can.  But, if you enjoy drinking canned coffee then you'll want to buy some to try it out.  Please, do not shake the can before drinking or freeze it.  I would drink it at room temperature (I dislike the taste of cold coffee).<br /><br />I would recommend it for those who already enjoy coffee-in-the-can.

review/summary: very strong
review/text: My wife and I shared a can of illy issimo Coffee Drink. I am not a great fan of cold coffee so I included my wife's opinion in this review, since she drinks iced coffee daily. The illy was too strong for both of us, but was not bitter. If it had been hot I probably would have liked sipping it, it seems to be close to the strength of espresso. My wife added ice and a lot of flavored half and half and found it very good. Doing as she did, rather defeats the purpose of a can of coffee that one opens and drinks on the go. I would recommend this drink to those who like cold espresso.

review/summary: This Hard Core Espresso Drinker Loves It
review/text: I really enjoy this illy issimo Coffee Drink. A lot. It's the perfect espresso treat for the hard core coffee drinkers who cringe and run away at the sight of a blonde or medium roast coffee.<br /><br />This is a smooth, perfectly sweetened espresso coffee drink that is a very satisfying chilled beverage to enjoy on a hot summer day. I found it to be of a much better quality than the canned and bottled coffee beverages sold by that coffee company you see on every corner and have kiosks inside more and more stores.<br /><br />It is also very refreshing to find a canned beverage that is sweetened with beet sugar, NOT high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I'm anxious to try more illy coffee drinks!

review/summary: Strong and sweet, a good summer alternative to brewed
review/text: This is a pretty typical sweetened packaged espresso drink. It's adequately strong, could always be stronger, since odds are pretty good you'll be drinking it iced. For my taste, it could be a bit less sweet, but it's not cloying against the coffee, and it's a nice sugary sweetness.<br /><br />I tried it straight and iced, with and without milk, and liked it all 4 ways.<br /><br />During the summer, I try to brew a big strong pot every few days and keep it in the fridge for iced coffee, but I like this as an option to keep on hand in the fridge for days I run out and don't want to wait for my usual stuff to cool. It would also be a convenient take-along booster if you're traveling somewhere with questionable coffee or visiting family members who brew theirs like a weak tea. The flavor and strength is much better than the starbucks instant packets, which are also a decent take-along booster.<br /><br />With 155mg caffeine (about 1.5x an average shot of espresso, similar to a good cup of strong brewed coffee), this has a nice pick-me-up with a low pee factor.<br /><br />For my money, it's a bit too pricy for what it is for everyday use. I'm too cheap for coffee at home at $2 a pop.

Drinking yesterday's coffee left in the pot without reheating it would be equally satisfying as  this canned beverage.  Didn't enjoy the flavor nor did I find it refreshing in any way.

review/text: I like expresso,and coffee, and I like iced coffees, so it stands to reason that I would like this product, and I do.  I recommend it in a gkass, over ice, but it's quite fine from a can.  It's a strong coffee and refreshing coffee, and tastes more fresh than I actually expected from a can.  I will purchase these in the future for morning caffeine on-the-run (running out the door with a cold drink sounds much safer than with a hot one!).  I recommend for people who long strong or iced coffees that aren't particularly sweet.  :)  Happy Mornings.

review/text: This was a tasty little drink, but not beyond special. I'm comparing this to the "stellar" chain out there. As far as a cold/iced coffee goes it is strong, but a little too sweet for my taste. Sort of like when you buy a sweetened tea and think- is there tea in this, it's like drinking sugar. I added a bit of milk and it helped smooth it out a bit. Not a bad little drink of you like cold, sweetened coffee.

review/summary: Good enough substitute for iced coffee
review/text: This small (6.8 fl oz) drink has a nice clean coffee taste, with enough sugar to make it sweet, but not annoyingly so.  If you are looking for a substitute for a trip to a coffee shop for iced coffee, this is less expensive (roughly $2 per can currently).<br /><br />However, making iced coffee at home can give better results (assuming good coffee, freshly roasted, and ground just before brewing).  By that comparison, $2 per for 6.8 fl oz seems rather expensive.<br /><br />A few other brief notes:<br /> 1) This is not espresso in a can.  It is an "Espresso STYLE Coffee Drink".  To me, the taste is more reminiscent of a strong cup of coffee with sugar, but not espresso.<br /><br /> 2) It is sweetened with sugar...not corn syrup.  The ingredients list is quite short: coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate.  Not sure what those last two ingredients lend to the taste (they are not preservatives), but I never use them when I make iced coffee at home, and I'm happy with the results.<br /><br /> 3) Finally, since I keep an eye on "points" in my daily diet, I note the following: 50 calories, 12g carbohydrates, 0g protein, 1g fiber.  (I wish Amazon would include the nutrition label for each food product it sells.)<br /><br />All in all, a decent coffee drink that is less expensive than a similar drink from a coffee chain, but more expensive than making iced coffee at home.

review/summary: Good coffee taste, not too sweet
review/text: The can of illy issimo Coffee Drink claims "100% natural Arabica coffee and the finest ingredients".  There are in fact only four ingredients, the first two of which are coffee and sugar. Note - no High Fructose Corn Syrup here.  The other two ingredients aren't what you'd typically put in for yourself, potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate, often added to drinks to regulate acidity.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good for a canned product - nice strong coffee flavor, the way I like it. Perhaps a bit more sugar than I would normally use, but less than I find in most commercial drinks. There is a hint of chemical in the taste, but it isn't obnoxious. I found it quite refreshing. One can is 50 calories, about 2/3 what you'd find in the equivalent amount of soda.  Caffeine content is 155mg per can, about on par for brewed coffee and maybe twice what a typical can of an "energy drink" contains.

review/text: I tried the cappuccino one as well, and I like that one better. This one is good, but tastes more like iced black coffee with no sugar/cream. So if that's your preference (you prefer it black or like to add your own sweetener/cream), then this is for you.<br /><br />I could still drink it, but definitely prefer it with a little extra cream in there.

review/text: Although I am coffee snob so I don't at all like canned coffee, I am always miserable when we go camping and don't have my coffee (I get headaches).  So this was my idea and it DOES work for that. I've tried some Starbucks types and they were totally disgusting to me.  This was tolerable though. I actually prefer the caffe one over the cappuccino(I prefer sweet), but my husband preferred the cappuccino. So if you like a good stronger coffee flavor, try the other. Good for camping or if you are wanting something higher quality than Starbucks (did I just say that?!), then try these!

review/summary: Went Down Smooth
review/text: Coffee preferences seem very personal and heated debates can erupt over the subject.  For me, this coffee is very good.  It's not too sweet -- just the right amount of sugar.  The taste was rich with no strange or bitter aftertaste.  There was also no 'burnt taste' that I've experiences with other brands.  Regarding other reviewers who complain about a strange acidic or a citrus taste, I couldn't taste anything funny like that.  Be aware that the product contains a preservative named potassium citrate, an odorless but not a tasteless chemical.  The vast majority of people have no problem with the chemical but there are a few where it hits the taste buds in an unpleasant way.  You'd probably know by now if you were in that minority because this preservative is common.<br /><br />Note that I like cold coffee so I poured the room temperature can into a glass with ice.  Thus I was tasting something slightly diluted, and yet it still tasted great.  I also should say that I am not a huge coffee drinker, but I do like coffee candy and coffee ice cream.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: if I was in a store or on Amazon and wanted to buy some espresso style cans of this size, I would either pick this brand or Starbuck's brand depending on which one was cheaper.  They both taste very good.  If the prices were equal, I would probably go with this brand just to give myself more long term taste test with the product.

review/summary: Not for Everyone
review/text: If you have read many of the reviews for this product, you would notice they are all over the place.  Canned coffee drinks - particularly espresso drinks - are definitely not for everyone.  This drink is rather sweet for such a product but very strong.  In fact, I would expect most people to be put off by the strong flavor after a sip or two and, judging by the reviews, that seems to be the case.  In other words, those who like their coffee weak of heavily diluted with cream should stay away from this one.<br /><br />Now for the rest of us.  The flavor is quite clear and strong but it surprised me by its sweetness.  This would not be a problem per se but the mixture does not seem to go together well and leaves a bit of an aftertaste.  Overall, a refreshing drink on a hot day but I can't give it a clear thumbs up.

review/summary: The best 'canned coffee' product I've had.
review/text: I recently reviewed another flavor of this same drink: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>... I find this caff&eacute; variety to be superior to the cappuccino variety, in both flavor and value. As far as 'canned coffee' goes, this is probably my favorite to date.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Bold coffee flavor, but with just a touch of sweetness to cut the bitterness. I found it to be robust and refreshing at the same time.<br />- 155mg of caffeine is a hefty boost in the morning<br />- 45 calories mean you can drink this without feeling guilty, and the use of beet sugar is cool (to me)<br />- no preservatives, natural coffee flavor, etc. add another layer of 'guilt-free' to this product<br /><br />SUMMARY: This is my favorite 'canned coffee' so far. I've used a french press, various drip makers, and have a Keurig at my desk at work -- but, if I was in a rush, I'd definitely be fine with drinking this stuff on the go. Right out of the frig it's flavorful, refreshing, has enough caffeine to get you going in the morning, and is low-calorie and preservative-free. I normally don't buy products like this but am seriously considering it after enjoying my free sample.

review/summary: Strong and Sweet
review/text: Most Americans have little experience with canned coffee products, but I lived in Japan for over two decades and cold canned coffee pre-dates the Starbucks we see in the refrigerator sections in the U.S. Canned coffee that is not liberally diluted with milk is often an acquired taste, especially for those who are used to something less intense or only hot coffee.Canned coffee can be ruined by the passage of time or too much acidity. Illy issimo seems to have combated possible unpleasant flavors that might emerge by adding a fair amount of sugar. This is a fairly sweet espresso, though it's not cloying. It's pretty robust and has a pretty strong coffee aftertaste which reminds me of robusta blends rather than arabica (which tend to be mellower).<br /><br />It's hard to recommend food items to others because tastes are very individualized, but I did enjoy this and feel it is better than average for a cold canned coffee. It's not going to beat a freshly made espresso, but then it's not supposed to rival the real deal. If I were in a hurry and wanted an espresso jolt, especially in the summer, I'd buy this.

I don't even know how to describe it. Strong for sure and like a bit a sweet was hiding in the background. So I tried adding some splenda to see if that would help, mmmm, just a tad. So I tried some soy milk which I like the taste of, nope not an improvement.<br /><br />Overall it seemed acidic to me and mostly unpleasant. I was unable to drink more than a few sips.

review/summary: Very strange, off taste, somewhat acidic
review/text: There is something very odd with the sweetener in this drink, I think. It tastes at first like strong black coffee, almost burnt, with some sugar and no cream added to it. Quickly, however, a really strange acidity overwhelms the rest of the taste. It's a little like that cheap liquid "diet" sweetener from the 1970s, which tasted like chemicals if you had it by itself.  It would probably be okay in this coffee if the coffee itself didn't taste burned, or if it balanced with more cream-type taste.  In fact, I finished the rest of the can I had by mixing it in with about 2 ounces of pre-made iced coffee in a carton, and that made a huge difference.<br /><br />I drink coffee daily and really enjoy other illy issimo products. This one just is not that good.

review/summary: Strong stuff...
review/text: I should start with a disclaimer that I am a real coffee lover and a habitual consumer of strong brewed Arabica cut with nonfat milk but no sugar. I learned to love iced coffee at my mother's knee - she too loved coffee but in summer when hot brew was intolerable, made her cold glass of joe with whole milk, sugar and then ice cubes.<br /><br />This illy issimo caffe Italian espresso style coffee drink struck me as really strong although reasonably smooth but with some kind of a taste of - perhaps - citric acid. Something "chemical". Something that stays on the tongue when you'd think it wouldn't.<br /><br />I waited for a nice hot day to have this; had it chilled down in the fridge, waiting. It did give me the fog-clearing of caffeine but when I found it a bit strong, I tried cutting it with my nonfat milk. Whoa - the color didn't even alter, this is STRONG stuff. When I got to half milk, it began to have a lighter look, and the taste became more what I like. I kept sipping it and getting a reaction that it tastes somewhat chemical compared to my usual brew. I wanted to like it but don't completely but that may be just me, and partially the effect of it having the sugar that I am no longer used to.<br /><br />If you prefer your coffee without sweetener as I do, please note the manufacturer does produce an unsweetened version.

review/summary: tastes like a good cup of coffee - albeit cold
review/text: I drink coffee for the flavor - I typically drink decaf and since abandoning artificial sweeteners 7 months ago, I use real sugar, sometimes cream. Since I'm unused to this volume of caffeine, it was unwise for me to consume this can late in the evening. I was wide awake all night long, unable to sleep more than a few minutes here and there.  It's unusual to get a product in a can that only has 4 ingredients as this illy issimo Caff&eacute; coffee. While it contains sugar, it was not sweet enough for me by any stretch - but I like it sweeeeet. Still, it was fully satisfying. My husband is a champion drinker of coffee. If coffee drinking were an Olympic sport, he would medal in it daily... so I let him sample this drink to get his feedback. He said he doesn't like cream in his coffee. I informed him that it didn't have any, but he insisted he could detect cream. I personally think he was thrown off by the temperature - he prefers piping hot, and I had just pulled this can out of the fridge. That being said, if you cannot tolerate cold coffee, you will not be in the market for this product. Personally, I like it at any temperature.

review/summary: Bad case of "Bitter Coffee Face"
review/text: "How can something with sugar as the second ingredient be so incredibly bitter?" said my husband after his first taste. I couldn't answer, my mouth was puckered like an old lady at a lemon eating contest.<br /><br />Hubby reached for the Hazelnut creamer, poured a little in, and we both agreed it made a huge improvement.<br /><br />I realize there are plenty of manly men out there who like their coffee black and their women strong, or something like that, but no one in our family resembles that description. However, for people who like cold black coffee, this is probably a very refreshing drink. For a generation brought up on super-sweet flavored and whip-cream-topped coffee concoctions, I doubt this will be a hit. Unless they use it as a challenge, like eating a teaspoon of cinnamon, or drinking Sriracha sauce straight from the bottle.

review/summary: Quality ingredients, bitter aftertaste
review/text: I recently tried illy issimo's Cappuccino (8.45 ounce can) and really enjoyed it. I decided to try their slightly smaller (6.8 ounce) Caffe coffee drink as well, and I came away largely disappointed.  Obviously, there is less here to enjoy.  After a few generous sips, I found the can nearly drained.  I appreciate the fact that the entire drink clocks in at only 45 calories, making it perhaps the healthiest of all the commercially available cold coffee drinks.  I was also pleased to see that it uses beet sugar as a natural sweetener as opposed to corn syrup, and of course, all illy issimo drinks uses 100% Arabica coffee.  So, there's no denying the quality.<br /><br />But in short, this was not nearly as tasty or as satisfying as the Cappuccino I previously tried.  The Caffe was intense, slightly creamy, and just about as sweet as I would want it.  But it left me with a bitter, unpleasant aftertaste that lingered far too long.  You should not feel the sudden urge to brush your teeth or drink cold water after enjoying espresso, but that is exactly how I felt after finishing this.  Therefore, despite the quality ingredients, the initial taste, and the impressive low-calorie count, I cannot recommend this.  I'd rather double up on the calories and enjoy a larger can of their superior Cappuccino.

review/text: At only 45 calories per can, it is in a class by itself; at more than $1.91 per can, it faces a lot of competition for my morning pick-me-up, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYUE6G">Green Mountain Coffee Lake & Lodge</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00284TTG2">SToK Caffeinated Black Coffee Shots</a>.<br /><br />My wife didn't care for this blend's full-bodied flavor but I preferred this over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Cappuccino</a>, which we also tested for free through Amazon's Vine program. My wife prefers coffee hot and with milk and sugar. My preference is to drink house blends, espresso and Americano black (hot) or over ice.<br /><br />This sweetened, bold ice coffee is best enjoyed over crushed ice. Straight out of the can is a bit harsh (see picture) but this blend mellows nicely over ice. My best advice is that you purchase a single can of illy issimo Caff&egrave; before committing to buy a pack of 12.<br /><br />Rating: Three stars.<br /><br />* 100% natural Arabica coffee<br />* No preservatives<br />* OU-D Kosher<br />* Sweetened with beet sugar<br />* Offers a RTD coffee option for lactose intolerant consumers<br />* 6.8 fluid ounces (200 milliliters) per can<br /><br />Nutritional Information:<br />* 45 calories<br />* 0 grams of fat<br />* 10 grams of sugar<br />* 155 milligrams of caffeine

review/summary: Kind of odd
review/text: I'm an avid coffee drinker.  I drink it black, cold, in a frap...  Illy happens to be one of my favorite brands for making lattes and cappuccinos, so I felt pretty confident that this drink would be good.  I was half right.  This may be one of the oddest things I've drunk yet.<br /><br />At the first sip, it tasted like lightly sweetened, fairly strong espresso, but there was something off.  I took another sip, trying to figure out what it was, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.<br /><br />I decided to try pouring it into a glass to see if this alleviated the strangeness.  I took another sip and, yep, still strange.  It took me a while to realize that the strangeness was that it seemed almost like it was carbonated, yet it didn't fizz.  This made no sense to me, so I checked the label to find that potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate are two of the ingredients.  Bingo.  My guess is these ingredients are conspiring to give this coffee a strange, difficult to describe aftertaste.<br /><br />Ultimately, this ruined the beverage for me.  Even though I liked the taste of the coffee and thought it had just the right level of sweetness, I couldn't get past that weird tang and vaguely fizzy feeling.  I won't be coming back for more of this.

review/text: The drink is something hard to find -- an affordable indulgence. This is not a cream based coffee beverage so it contains no fat or milk products. The ingredient list is short -- coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate. The product contains no preservatives.<br /><br />Its rich, smooth espresso flavor is slightly sweet but not cloyingly so. The Caffe flavor is not at all bitter and there is no aftertaste. It is utterly delicious and I won't hesitate to buy it in the future.

review/text: I am not a lover of canned coffee drinks, they are usually too strong and too sweet. I really enjoyed this drink. It was just a touch too strong for me but it had just the right amount of sweetness. I prefer to make my own iced coffee but if I couldn't do that, I would purchase this brand. It was just the perfect size and had a full, rich flavor.

review/summary: nice iced coffee drink
review/text: Don't kid yourself into thinking that a can of this will magically transport you to the Amalfi Coast -- but it is a nice treat nonetheless.  Tastes like slightly weak espresso with sugar.  It's a little sweet, a little bit lemony tasting, a little bitter, but all in all quite good.  The cans are small -- about half the size of a typical soda can -- and the price seems a tad high considering the size of the can.  And if you like milky, creamy coffee, this won't be your thing.  If you like sweet coffee without cream, you might enjoy this.

review/summary: Terrific for making frozen blended coffee
review/text: I was interested to try this product in making my occasional frozen blended coffee.  I find it a pain to have to brew coffee only to let it cool off first before I can make my blended coffee.  If I don't let it cool, the hot coffee melts the ice too quickly, ruining the "frozen" part of the treat, and then I might as well just have made a hot latte-style drink in the first place.  I had toyed with the idea of making my frozen treat using canned espresso, and decided to give it a try with this.<br /><br />I did taste this straight out of the can.  Even though I am not a black coffee person, the taste of this was average as far as coffee goes.  It was strong, which of course it should be, but I didn't find it bitter.  The bubbles were not like soda bubbles.  Rather, it was like a mild fizz, and I can't even come up with something to compare it to, because all other carbonated beverages I've had have been far stronger in the carbonation than this.<br /><br />I added the can to my usual recipe in the blender.  The first thing I noticed when I was finished blending was the foam.  Lots of foam, thanks to the carbonation.  It was great, actually, and I liked it a lot - it gave the whole thing a real cafe' feel, like I'd made this with fresh espresso.<br /><br />The flavor of my blended beverage was better than when I make it with my regular coffee, more like when I order one of these at a coffee shop.  Again, I'm sure this is because I used more of an espresso-style beverage, like a coffee shop would do.  The coffee flavor wasn't watered down, and it mixed well with the other flavors I had added.<br /><br />For my purposes, this drink did exactly what I wanted.  I will gladly use it again for making my frozen treats.

review/summary: it's coffee. in a can. it's illy issimo.
review/text: Okay, I admit that I'm a bit of a coffee snob. Enough so that I roast my own beans and grind them fresh before each cup and I look down a bit on Starbucks and Peet's. Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says "100% natural arabica". Not sure what the "natural" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak "natural" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the "arabica" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.<br /><br />These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!<br /><br />Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand.

review/summary: Italian Coffee Drink - too bitter AND too sweet...it's ok.
review/text: The illy issimo Coffe Drink (Caffe version), is 6.8 fluid ounces of 100% natural arabica coffee, sugar, potassium, bicarbonate and potassium citrate.  With 50 calories, 12g carbs and 10g of sugar, it's a decent "health" profile (only 20mg sodium, which is low).  It contains No Preservatives (according to the label), but the taste is just strange: I drank it cold straight from the fridge, and found it to be both too bitter AND too sweet at the same time (I don't know how they accomplished that).<br /><br />It's ok, but not something I would probably drink again unless I had to.  I drink coffee with cream (and sometimes a touch of sugar) every morning, and often a non fat latte as another choice: I love espresso (but with cream, not straight), so maybe that was the deal here: I missed my cream.  I think this drink might have benefited from a bit of cream and a bit less sugar.

review/summary: Good canned espresso drink, not too sweet
review/text: I tried the illy issimo caffe (definitely serve cold) and this offering has a good strong espresso taste with a nice caffeine buzz.  The drink is also sweet, but there is a mild off putting aftertaste, almost like an artificial sweetener (the drink is sweetened with beet sugar, not cane sugar).  I don't mind the strange aftertaste that much since the drink is Kosher, has only 10 grams of sugar and 50 calories.  The best part of this coffee drink is the rich, full bodied espresso flavor.  This is a good drink if you like cold espresso drinks and don't mind trading off a little aftertaste for a lower calorie, less sugary drink. I will get this drink again.

review/summary: Fine Cold Beverage
review/text: Illy's coffee drink has exactly the right balance of sweetness and coffee flavor. Drinking it ice cold on a hot 90 degree day is refreshing.<br /><br />This is a beautiful coal black liquid. The espresso flavor comes through very nicely, good intense coffee flavor, with a hint of tartness. Sometimes I like syrup sweet drinks, but mostly I drink coffee black. I've tried iced coffee before, and generally don't like it. This drink, on the other hand, has just exactly the right hint of sugar sweetness (not sweetener or high fructose corn syrup sweetness). The drink has a good mouth feel, slightly thicker than water with a creamy finish. The aftertaste is surprisingly nice, a good coffee flavor.<br /><br />What I particularly like about this drink, it has an authentic espresso coffee flavor without being masked by heavy cream, milk, or sugar. Compared to any Starbucks drink, this is head and shoulders better. A wonderful cold beverage for the summer.

They were made as only a neighborhood bakery could perform this ritual. I loved those cookies back then. Unfortunately, neither Wally nor his beloved stores  sell those great cookies of yesteryear any longer. However, the fact that I can get a modern day version of a good old classic delivered to my home, at a very reasonable price, provides my family and I with some great comfort food to satisfy our hunger for sweets.  Just remember these are mass baked cookies from Keebler now........but still, oh so good!  They are very addicting and often vanish quickly.  Maybe that's why we're purchasing six boxes at a time, twice a year!!

I have no problem with traditionally ground wet dog food (and Wellness makes those too) but when I'm wanting to give my girls something special, I want it to look special (even though I know they could care less). Wellness can run a little pricey, so this particular product especially might not be what you want to feed on a day to day basis, but it's great as an occasional treat.

Hydrolyzed corn gluten is a fancy name for MSG It also has 480 mg of salt in each serving - each package having 3+ servings.<br /><br />I like McCormick's spices, but I'll be looking for a more natural pesto sauce mix next time.<br /><br />Edited 27Apr2012 to add:  Thank you to Jonathan (see his comments below my review) for suggesting Simply Organic Sweet Basil Pesto.  I bought it and love it!

review/summary: Best pesto sauce in a package mix!
review/text: We love this pesto sauce mix and it's hard to find at our local grocery store so I get it from Amazon.  This is the only pesto mix that my kids like!!  They've eaten it since they were small and now they want it at college :-)  No spinach in this one (Knorr's has that) so it's a simple basil product.  If we don't have time to puree basil leaves or find the right spices, this package mix is a great substitute.

review/summary: Too Good
review/text: After you've had these chocolate chips, other brands will seem almost tasteless. Guittard is the company that supplies chocolate for See's Candy.<br /><br />The only thing I'd say is be careful you don't get addicted to them. I was having a handful of chips after lunch and dinner, but recently switched to a totally healthy concoction: Place two bananas in a blender, add a cup of raw cashews or half a cup of cashew butter, 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder and a teaspoon of vanilla. Pour into an ice cube tray and freeze. Tastes like Fudgesicles! I got the recipe at DrFurhman.com.

review/text: We wanted to cut back on our caffeine intake a few years ago, & used to try to split regular coffee with decaff. We like good coffee & when I found this already pre-mixed, I was excited. I have had this on a regular monthly order for probably a year now, & we love it. For the two of us (1 to 1 1/2 pots a day) 4 cans last about a month. GREAT price & GREAT coffee. If they ever stop this on regular delivery, I will be one sad person. If you haven't tried auto delivery on products you use all the time, it is the cats meow. I live in a semi rural area, & it is easier to have it delivered regularly & not have to think about it.

review/summary: Need a lot of coffee to brew a cup
review/text: This may be labeled a medium roast but the cups it brews more closely resemble dirty water. It takes a lot of grounds to brew a cup that has any flavor at all. I generally enjoy light and medium roasts, and when this is brewed correctly there is a decent if unremarkable flavor. But I have to pack the filter to get any taste at all. I do appreciate the lower caffeine content, as I generally enjoy an extra cup of coffee in the afternoon. I can't recommend this - following the directions on the label produces undrinkable coffee.

review/text: This is the one coffee you may have at any time, day or night. For the caffeine sensitive, Melitta Classic Lite is a gift. For those who want the added spank of strong caffeine, Classic Lite is a welcome change, a break away from the "spike" of heavyweight coffees. I like my coffee on the strong side but Classic Lite is so tasty and mellow that I would simply add two more spoonfuls to the coffee machine on top of the usual load and, voila, I got a cup of delicious, "non-aggressive," extremely pleasing coffee. I always take it with agave. Classic Lite also tastes great with flavored creamers; my favorite is French Vanilla. I discovered Classic Lite after I reviewed Amazon's coffee offerings and decided to taste. I've made a note and will be making sure Classic Lite is always available in the house. Thanks, Melitta!

review/summary: Unbelievable cherry taste
review/text: Okay, maybe it's not exactly unbelievable, because it is exactly what good maraschino cherries looked and tasted like when I was a kid. They are dark. The syrup is thick and dark. The aroma is the essence of cherries and their presence in a cocktail is magical -- taking cherries from a flavorless, if colorful, garnish, to another layer of delicious bouquet and taste.<br /><br />Unless you are over 45, it is quite possibly you never tasted a maraschino cherry like these<br /><br />While the price is not inexpensive, the value, in terms of what is added to any drink or recipe with these, is quite high. Two of these cherries will outpower a dozen of those bright red "things". And don't let cocktails be the only use. Your children deserve to experience what a "cherry" cola or other soft-drink "should" taste like, or an over-the-top sundae or banana split. Similarly, I believe I am going to get my wife to make a Bavarian Schwartzwalder Kirchtorte (Bavarian Black Forest Cherry Cake) with these to really experience the sublime bliss that is cherry and chocolate.<br /><br />They muddle in cocktails extremely well and infuse the entire drink with an exquisite hint of cherry. Old Fashionds and Manhattans become more sublime, and cherries suddenly hold their own with oranges, lemons and other fruits in a cocktail.

review/summary: Good.  Not Great.
review/text: I enjoy a quality cocktail.  Two.  As you know, the finest ingredients make the most excellent drinks.  Marachino cherries, key garnishes in a variety of cocktails, come in a variety of qualities.  Most offer up a glisteningly red cherry, a little crushed, with plenty of sugary matrix.<br /><br />The Luxardo cherries are similar, but have a much thicker, darker purple-black syrup, but the same crushed little cherry.  I did not find the consistency or quality of the cherry itself to be of any lesser or greater quality than your average marachino cherry.  The syrup, however, was less run-of-the-mill.  It's not nearly as sweet and imparts some distinct cherry flavor.  The syrup is drastically different from normal marachino cherry syrup, so be carefull with those old fashioneds and manhattans.  I did enjoy a fine drizzle of it over a frothy bourbon sour (yum).  It may do well as an expensive substitute and impart a change of hue to a cocktail or two.  You'll find a fine use, i'm sure...<br /><br />Worth the price?  ummm...not on my salary (and consumption rate). I was expecting something impressive.  These were not.

review/summary: Aesthetically pleasing, but unpleasantly candied.
review/text: I purchased this product after reading the great reviews here on Amazon and on cocktail-oriented websites. Having spent a good deal of time experimenting with different recipes to make my own cocktail cherries, I was eager to try this classic product. I very much expected to love these.  Unfortunately, I found these a little disappointing, and I thought I'd share a more measured evaluation with other Amazon readers.<br /><br />Visually: The Luxardo cherries look great; nearly black in color and coated in a very thick dark red syrup. They're also small; maybe half the diameter of a bing cherry that you might buy in the produce aisle. I think they're somewhat smaller than the commonly available cheap pink maraschino cherries.<br /><br />Aroma: They smell very nice. Like cherry soda, I guess.<br /><br />Texture: They're quite firm. When you bite into them, there's a slight "pop" before they dissolve into sugary goo. It's a little weird if you're expecting the texture of fruit.<br /><br />Taste: This is my big complaint. Yes, there's a nice cherry flavor, but it's completely overshadowed by the fact that they are SWEET. I mean unbelievably, mind-blowingly, unpleasantly SWEET. They are a mouthful of pure cherry-tinged SUGAR. I hadn't quite realized this from reading the earlier reviews, and I was expecting something like a slightly sweetened natural cherry flavor. Make no mistake: this product is candy, and it no longer has any similarity to the texture and flavor of an actual cherry.<br /><br />I purchased this product to dress up our cocktails, but I don't really want to drop a lump of candy into my manhattans. However I didn't want to give up on this expensive product, so I've tried an experiment to try to salvage them: I've poured off most of the syrup from the bottle and topped it off with unsweetened brandy.  I'll let it sit for a few days in the fridge, and then I'll check back to see if they're more palatable. I'm hoping the booze will temper the cloying sweetness of the product.<br /><br />In the meantime, we've gone back to using our home-made cocktail cherries. They actually taste like cherries.

review/summary: Perfect for Specialty Cocktails
review/text: First, I love these cherries. I make specialty cocktails, and these do terrific in both old fashions and, of course, Bourbon & Cherries.<br /><br />I'm addicted. Though, you might find them for less (when counting shipping) at your local alcohol warehouse.

review/summary: For your Manhattan this is an absolute necessity.
review/text: Why cheapen your wonderful Manhattan with a store bought, probably high fructose corn syrup infused, bright red cherry. This cherry as just as important as the top shelf vermouth (Carpano Antica Formula Sweet Vermouth) and, of course, the rye (not bourbon!!). Plus, great service from the amazon.com retailer. My jar had a crack in it and a replacement was shipped; no questions asked. Treat yourself to these cherries. Treat your self to a top shelf Manhattan. You deserve it.

review/text: Bourbon or rye, soda or not, if you make your old fashioned with fruit Luxardo Cherries move it up a level. Same story for Manhattans.<br /><br />After all, you use premium liquor in your drinks, why not premium cherries?

review/summary: I'll take Manhattan
review/text: Once you have tasted these you will never go back to the bright chemical colored and tasting super market variety of Maraschino Cherries. These have all the flavor and texture of real fruit. they make the perfect Manhattan and are quite good spooned over ice cream. The flavor is truly a revelation.

review/summary: The Best Manhattan
review/text: If a grand Manhattan, on a cold winter night, before the fireplace, -- is your thing, make it grand with an Italian Cherry from Luxardo.  The best.  Two oz. Dickel.  One oz. Red Vermouth.  Teaspoon Luxardo juice.  One cherry.  Shake with ice and drink straight from Martini glass.  It doesn't get any better than this.

review/text: These can absolutely make a cocktail go from good to incredible.<br />My favorite: brut cava, vodka, cherry syrup (home made in my case), and one of these with some their own syrup... perfect Marilyn Monroe.<br />They are a must-have in your home bar if you are a cocktail lover.

review/summary: For a gourmet manhattan, thank you Amazon.
review/text: How can a good manhattan be enhanced?  I found out at the U. S Grant hotel bar in San Diego where they serve Luxardo Gourmet Maraschino Cherries with the manhattans mixed there.  I had them write down the name of the cherries and when I got home in Florida several days later an Amazon order was placed. Got the cherries three days later. My popularity in the neighborhood has been enhanced, also, as this is an experience not to be missed and as a good neighbor I passed it on.

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: These Luxardo Maraschino cherries are nothing like those radioactive red cherries packed in sugar water. These are real live Maraschino (a variety like Bing) cherries packed in very thick syrup. They have really great wild cherry flavor and are much smaller.<br /><br />The one complaint I have with these cherries is the incredibly thick syrup. For cocktails the syrup is too thick for my taste.<br /><br />The cherries are small, about half the size of the Maraschino cherries found in most stores. There is real intense cherry flavor in these little nuggets. The cherries are all stemless, so they require a pick of some kind for drinks. On the other hand, on top of ice cream, the lack of stem is a great thing. Sadly watching your friend tie the stem up in a knot with their tongue, will just have to be done with other cherries.<br /><br />There is no alcohol in these cherries. The 360 gram jar contains about the same weight of cherries as a standard sixteen ounce jar of radioactive cherries.<br /><br />For cocktails, I prefer cherries preserved in brandy, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G5WI68">Morello Cherries in Liqueur and Kirsch Unique recipe Griottines from France 11.8 oz</a>.<br /><br />Luxardo makes some amazing products, their cherry liquor and lemoncello is fabulous. Their canned cherries are wonderful, certainly a step a long ways up from those radioactive cherries.

review/summary: Not my favorites
review/text: My original review was pretty harsh, but after a few months I have gotten somewhat used to these and enjoy them more than I did originally. I will restate, however, that Griottines are much better and have less of a fake syrupy taste and hard chewy texture.<br /><br />I bought these at the recommendation of a local liquor store owner, who thought that they were amazing as far as cocktail cherries are concerned. My past preference has been Griottines, which never seem available on Amazon these days (in the larger, more reasonably priced jars). The Griottines are nice small, tender sour cherries. I would suggest finding those somewhere on line in the larger (10+ oz) size, which is more reasonably priced than the small size, or these Luxardo. Do yourself a favor and seek them out.

review/summary: Like a Cherry flavored Sucrets
review/text: A very very strong candied cherry flavor, almost like the Cherry flavored Sucrets.  You probably would not eat Cherry flavored Sucrets on their own for dessert, but these Luxardo cherries cook very nicely in desserts.  Still, the flavor was a little "flourescent" and unnatural in the baked goods.<br /><br />Probably better left for drinks.  The texture of the cherry is far superior to a normal store bought Maraschino cherry. Very firm.

review/summary: The best compliment to a great drink
review/text: Originally found these cherries in a great mixology bar that I go to.  I asked them immediately what they did to their cherries and the mixologist showed me the Luxardo jar.  I went right to Amazon and ordered some!  They are so good!  My lid isn't fitting very snugly though so I may need to transfer them to another container eventually if they last that long.  :-)

review/text: Get some Sour Cherries. Not dark sweet cherries. Fresh is best but canned will do. Buy a bottle of Luxardo from a good liquor store. Wash the cherries. Put in a mason jar. Cover with Luxardo. Place in your refrigerator for a couple weeks. The end.

review/summary: Pretty darn good
review/text: An Italian acquaintance (from Milan) swears by this stuff.  Dead simple to make and pretty close to the "real" thing.  Heresy to serious cooks, but when the clock is running and two adolescent boys are HUNGRY.  'Nuff said.  Clearly, the additional ingredients - preservatives, et al. - give one pause - and should - but all in, it's probably not what is going to kill you or me.  Good stuff from a package.
