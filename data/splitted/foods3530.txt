review/text: I was so excited to receive the box of cookies.  Shortbreads are my favorite and I love to use them in gift baskets.  I was shocked and horrified when I opened the box and 99% of the cookies were broken.  Cookies taste good, packaging is horrible.  Major disappointment.  I took pics and sent them to Amazon along with a letter stating what had happened. However, I never heard back from them.

review/summary: Another great flavor
review/text: I've tried all of the flavors, and this one strikes a particular chord with my mouth.  I like spicy foods, and try every snack with even a hint of spice.  These snacks go so quickly that my mouth is ready for more and my brain forces my eyes and hands to keep searching in obviously-empty bags.  They have a light and tremendously satisfying crunch, which adds greatly to the entire experience.  I will order some more right this very minute.

review/summary: Doesn't last long for agressive chewers
review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/text: Our Siberian Husky is overweight and on a diet.  She also is great at building placque and tartar on her teeth - baad breath! She has a touchy stomach on top of it all.  Tried these bones in all flavors and she loves them.  They help with her teeth and breath.  She gets one bone for her lunch (she's a 3 meals a day gal).  Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/text: My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

A 23 ounce container of this will last us a very, very long time. Recommended for anyone who likes seafood (we also occasionally sprinkle a little on chicken for nice flavor).

review/summary: Mostly a Rip Off
review/text: Got these steaks as a Christmas gift. Four steaks for 90 bucks could be worth it, but in this case it's a scam. They market these as a quality of beef you can't buy in stores but that is simply not the case. There is very little marbling in the steaks and they are Choice beef at best. But let's not forget that Omaha refuses to actually use a USDA rating for their beef. They just use fancy words to make it sound like you are getting amazing steaks when in reality if they were that amazing they would be prime cuts and labeled as such. Take my word for it and go with a company that offers USDA Prime steaks, there are plenty if you just google it. Also, last time I was at costco they actually had a good selection of Prime strip steaks at a price that is cheaper than these. The only reason I did not rate as 1 star is because 3 of the 4 steaks I received had a larger portion of filet than you typically expect with a t-bone. Still, find the prime and stay away from this low quality but well marketed beef.

review/summary: Top Quality
review/text: This is a top quality Green Tea and certainly on-par with the best I have tasted (I drink a lot of green tea and tried various brands). Note, this tea does not come in a tea-bag. If you are looking for the highest quality green tea, then this tea will deliver.<br /><br />There is a significant difference between tea of this quality and other high quality expensive teas. This tea is composed of first leaves that sprout in the spring, which definitely has a freshest flavor and aroma with the most potency. The quality drops significantly after the first leaves are sprouted.<br /><br />Even though it is very expensive as a whole, you are only paying around 50 cents per cup. How many top-quality things in life costs 50 cents? Despite the high cost, the benefits are far higher especially if you break it down by per cup of tea.<br /><br />The tea is shipped directly from Korea (it takes about 2 weeks to arrive). It's best to get it from May to June because these leaves are the "first picks" of the spring and is the freshest during that time.<br /><br />The quality shows in the the color, the aroma, the taste, and the kick. The color is light (not dark) green. The aroma and taste is a subtle unami with a very slight tinge of bitterness. The caffeine kick is subtle and very gradual.<br /><br />You only need to use a pinch (about 8-12 leaves) per cup. Don't use too much or else the bitterness will overun the taste. Do not use boiling water; rather use merely hot water. If you use quality bottled water, then the flavor of this tea will be enhanced even further. For me, I enjoy good tasting water even more especially with this tea.

Most of the elderly folks that live around here prefer this to salt by far because it doesn't have that tingling aftertaste.  I would recommend buying this if you can't find this at your local grocery store or supermarket even though the shipping is more expensive than the product.

It's perfect for adding that extra kick to a recipe without making it taste too salty.<br />I use it in my traditional Chex Party Mix this time of year. It's great on chicken, hamburgers, just about any type of meat.<br /><br />LOVE IT

review/summary: Not as magical as claimed
review/text: This wasn't available at Amazon in August 2010 so I bought it online elsewhere.  I bought it based on the 5-star rave reviews here.<br /><br />I have to say I'm disappointed.  This product is basically a blend of peppers with a little sweetener added.  I find it kind of yucky.  I realize everyone has different tastes.  I wanted a salt substitute to sprinkle on a bowl of brown minute-rice, which I eat often.  This seasoning is not remotely as tasty as table salt, or as tasty as Onion salt.  To be honest, Onion salt (from Ralphs aka Kroger) tastes 10 times better.<br /><br />For this review, I sprinkled some of it on a paper plate in front of me.  I dipped my finger into it right now and tasted it.  First impression is a little bit of very light sweetness, followed immediately by a bitter taste in the mouth, then some pepper burn on the tongue, creeping back in the throat. I've got to drink some water.  I also tried it on rice 3 times earlier in the week.<br /><br />I'm a little irritated.  It doesn't deserve five 5-star reviews.  You can't sprinkle this all over buttered rice and get a nice tasting meal, like you can with Onion salt.  Maybe Chef Paul has something better than this (that is low salt), but this is not the  wondrous, magical panacea that I hoped it would be.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients from the label:<br />Chiles, toasted onion, brown sugar, dehydrated garlic, green bell pepper, dehydrated onion, red bell pepper, paprika, spices, natural flavor, vinegar powder.  No MSG. No Additives. No Preservatives.  Calories: 0  Sodium: 0  Total Fat: 0

review/summary: Great tea, awesome price
review/text: My wife and I drink about six glasses of iced tea daily... each.  We have two pitchers that we rotate through in the fridge at all times.  Whoever empties a pitcher is responsible for rinsing it out, tossing in four bags, refilling the pitcher, and putting it back to get cold.  The pitcher on the inside is the current one.<br /><br />My wife is a year post-bariatric surgery patient.  Until we discovered this stuff, she used to have problems keeping properly hydrated.  The doctors don't particularly like the idea of her ingesting so much caffiene, but they frankly prefer it to once-every-two-month visits to the ER for intravenous fluids.<br /><br />Personally, I love Monin Blackberry syrup.  I learned about it through Chili's restaurants; I used to gladly fork over the $2.50 for their iced tea, which was always too weak and didn't have quite enough blackberry syrup for me.  Now, thanks to the Amazon subscriptions to both products, I have all I want for about 25 cents a glass total.  My daughter is equally fond of Monin Mango syrup, I may send her a case for Christmas!

It has a very strong flavor that I would attribute to Indian teas (lipton is after all british/european company). This is not necessarily a bad tea- it is just something I imagine would be better hot rather than iced. Luzianne is smoother, better (in my opinion), and easier on the wallet.

review/summary: Better Tasting Than Any Pre-Brewed Tea
review/text: Several years ago, I was introduced to these one-gallon tea bags by my local warehouse club, but they no longer sell them.  Now I buy them from Amazon.  Brewing instructions recommend steeping the bag in about 1 quart of boiling hot water.  After the brewing process is complete I remove the tea bag, add ice to cool it, pour the concentrate into a one-gallon plastic jug and add water to make a full gallon. I then store the jug in my refrigerator.<br /><br />Growing up in the state of Georgia, always having fresh-brewed iced tea at home was almost a religious rite.  My mother was a home-economics major and one of the first gifts that she gave me when I was equipping my own household was a crockery pitcher for making tea.  After more than 40 years, I still have and use that pitcher, which will last a lifetime with care.  Unlike glass, which can shatter with temperature extremes, or a metal saucepan which can add a metallic taste, the modern equivalent to my old crockery pitcher is the Fiesta Pitcher <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Y9L3">Fiesta 67-1/4-Ounce Large Disk Pitcher, White</a> which is the perfect size for this process.<br /><br />The result from this small effort not only costs dramatically less (about 35-cents per gallon) than buying jugs of tea that have already been brewed, my tea is fresher and tastier.  Brewing just a few jugs of this tea yourself, I believe, will convince you to wean yourself from even the best brands of already-brewed tea

review/text: This is the best iced tea and so easy to make, in 10 minutes you will be drinking the tastiest and most refreshing drink.  Fill a 2 cup glass measuring cup with water,  microwave for 4 minutes,  place the tea bag in the water.  Let sit in microwave for 5 minutes,  remove tea bag,  squeeze bag slightly to remove all the tea goodness,  but don't squeeze it to much, because the bag will split.  Fill a rubbermaid pitcher or a glass tea jar with the spout with 14 cups cold water,  pour in the brewed tea concentrate.  Its ready to drink,  I fill a red solo cup with ice pour tea over,  drink and repeat,  so refreshingly tasty. Store in the fridge to keep it nice and cold.  I also take it to work with me everyday, I pour it into a lifeline stainless steel bottle with a handful of ice,  drink it all day and when I run out I just fill the bottle with water.  So much cheaper then buying something to drink everyday when I'm at work. Its a great deal and its all natural drink.

Wow is this so much better!!!<br />I did a quick cost comparison and these "Gallon Size Tea Bags" are a little more expensive than buying individual tea bags but the time savings and simplicity is certainly worth it.  They come in one large box, unwrapped and ready to go.  If you brew a gallon at a time or multiple gallons then this is simply the best way to do it, you'll never use individual tea bags again.

review/text: If you drink a lot of tea like I do this is for you.  Makes a gallon at a time:  Heat up a teapot of water to boiling, pour the water in a gallon container, and throw in the giant teabag and stir the bag around a couple of times.  Let it steep for a while (the longer the stronger) and remove the bag and top off with water up to a gallon.  If you pour the boiling water right on top of the dry teabag, it often ruptures the bag and you have to strain out the teasleafs.

review/text: Living in Houston, Texas means really hot summers! Here, an important part of any hot summer is plenty of iced tea. Most of the year when we have company iced tea is always on the menu. There may be times in the winter, when temperatures plunge down below 60 degrees that we may not serve iced tea; but that rarely happens I'm happy to say.<br /><br />Lipton's Iced Tea has been the iced tea of choice around our house for decades; my wife always does the preparation as she follows a strict pattern for brewing tea. First of all she makes it strong always using multiple bags of tea per gallon; she figures she needs to compensate for melting ice ahead of the fact.<br /><br />She likes hers without anything in it, I prefer mine with sugar. Either way it tastes really great.

review/summary: If my math is right, it's a good deal
review/text: First off - the product itself is delicious.  I have had the bags rip a few times but only when I poke my fingernail through them accidentally or push the plunger in our jug down too hard and rip them.  I bought generic brands for a long time but Lipton is worth the price for the better taste.<br /><br />About the price, without being too specific... the price on my local Sam's Club website is less than $1 cheaper than the price here.  The Subscribe & Save price is less than Sam's.  Maybe Sam's changed their price or maybe the price on the website is wrong.  I'll have my Mom check next time she goes.  My husband and I aren't members and for us to have her get it for us can be a pain, plus the nearest club is 30+ minutes away.  I'm doing Subscribe & Save all the way!!

review/summary: tea bags busted, loose tea everywhere, reshipped same result
review/text: I don't know if it was the packaging, USPS or if it was damaged before shipping but when I opened the inside box (as seen in picture) which contains 2 inner wrapped boxes the inner boxes were just full of loose tea and busted bags.<br /><br />edit:  amazon reshipped another box for free, got it today.  it was worse than the last box.  loose tea everywhere, just a big mess.  on the plus side, they shipped it one day shipping, lol.<br /><br />what is the problem?  have you opened any of your boxes and looked in them?  if they are ok then they are being damaged in shipping to me.  if not they were damaged when you got them.<br /><br />perhaps tea bags are just too fragile to be sent via USPS.  you should have done or should do some testing on this.  if they cannot be shipped properly then you should stop selling these products!

Lipton's prides itself on the natural processing methods it uses. I am sure this contributes a great deal to how "pure" Lipton's teas taste.

review/text: This seasoning is the BEST. A little sweet, a little hot. Bought it once at the grocery store and when I went back, they didn't carry it anymore. They just had 2-3 types of Paul's blends and a lot of that other TV chef's stuff. I have to have this blend on my spaghetti, pizza and corn on the cob every time. Had to buy online right from Amazon. I can't believe others buy it and sell it for more. Go to Amazon or PAUL's website. [...] Check out his other 6 seasoning blends.

review/text: I was introduced to this sauce by my father in law and I have never used any other seasoning on my pizza since.  The seasoning is spicy, yet sweet and tangy.  It is delicious and yet not too strong.  This seasoning blend completely replaces my need for any seasonings on my pizza, be it red pepper flakes, or parmesian.  This is simply OUTSTANDING!

review/summary: Calling it Magic doesn't do it justice!
review/text: This is a great product to accent your pizza and pasta sauces without adding the things you don't want into your diet!  It is a little bit hot as a seasoning and you can also sprinkle it onto spaghetti or pizza.  It is also very good when sprinkled onto casseroles or soups.  I like it as it has no calories, no total fat, no sodium, no carbohydrates and no additional protein.  It also contains no MSG or any preservatives.<br /><br />It lets you add the zest you like without adding items like salt or calories.  This is a good product and we like it as a seasoning for many of our Italian dishes.  I recommend it to you as a good product.

review/text: This seasoning/spice is top notch.  Like others, I bought it years ago at the grocery store and then all of a sudden it disappeared.  I just ran out and was desperate to find it.  Luckily I found it here and the day was saved.  This is the best pasta/pizza seasoning there is.  It has great flavor with a little kick and adds much to any pasta dish.  I have also used it to season chicken before grilling it and it turned out great.

review/text: This great seasoning was a favorite of mine for many different pasta dishes for years. It spices up a tomato based sauce just right for our tastes. Originally it was available in the gourmet store where I worked, then in the big grocery chain where I shopped. Now it isn't available in my area at all. Thanks to Amazon for carrying it (and contacting me when it was back in stock) so I can stock up.

review/text: This is a great product if you like a touch of "hot" on your pasta.  We first purchased it about 10 years ago when we were in Myrtle Beach.  It is hard to find where we live.  My husband will not eat his pasta withot this.  I also put a few shakes of it in my sauce when I am cooking it.  In this quantity it only flavors the sauce and does not make it hot to taste.  The biggest problem is that it is not often available.  I wish Amazon would stock it on a regulary basis.

review/text: Just a little is needed to get the full effect.  This seasoning blend is spicy hot, just like the label states.  It still tastes good, like the more mild version, but it has a definite kick to it.  What I like to do is mix the two, this one and Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends ~ Pizza & Pasta Magic Herbal.  That way it is not too intense for me.

review/text: This pizza and pasta seasoning is just what it says it is, MAGIC!  It provides the right blend of spices for your Italian cooking and it is great when mixed into pizza or pasta sauce, meatballs, or any dish.  The wonderful thing about it is that it adds no calories, no fat, no salt, no carbohydrates and no MSG to your food.  It also contains no preservatives.<br /><br />It is also very good for soups, salads, egg dishes and almost any casserole. There are some very good recipes on his web site and I like the breakfast pizza, it is pretty good.  We love this product and as I write this review I see that we are almost out of it so it is time to buy some more!  I recommend it to you.

review/text: Since McCormick has stopped making their Spicy Pizza Seasoning, we had no choice than to look elsewhere, and thought we would give Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends~Pizza & Pasta Magic Herbal a try. We were very happily surprised. Once you open the bottle and take in the aroma, it's as if you are transported into a fine Italian restaurant. The blend is perfect with just the right level of heat. We discovered that we had been deprived using the McCormick blend anyway, so we are glad that they no longer have it available. Chef Paul Prudhomme's Pizza and Pasta Seasoning blend is MAGIC so we hope to continue buying it. Thank you for offering a great product.
