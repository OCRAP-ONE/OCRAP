review/summary: Horrible Protection, Horrible Smell
review/text: This is, most likely, the worst deodorant ever made. There is no way to make this product any worse unless it makes your break out into a rash or poisons you. The "protection" and I use that term loosely, that this deodorant gives is minimal. I'm not a really active person, nor am I overweight, and yet this fails to mask odor for a few hours, let alone a whole day. On top of this all there is the actual smell of the deodorant itself. It's horrendous. When you apply this deodorant your nose will slightly burn and your eyes will almost water. It's hilarious that their commercials revolve around attracting the opposite sex, when the smell of this would send any female running. I'm not joking when I say this but, I'd rather smell like body odor than smell like AXE deodorant. The few days I wore it, I became completely self-conscious about raising my arms because it smelled so bad and offered almost no protection.<br /><br />Buy Gillette Clear Gel and stay away from this trash.

review/summary: Great coffee!!!
review/text: This coffee is fantastic, but here's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5: confusion with the advertising as another review mentioned. It would be nice to not see the K-cups when you are looking for PODS, or vice-versa. The box says "light in the cup" but it's a medium roast (actually pretty dark). I love a dark cup of coffee so to me, this was great! Vienna type coffee. I got mine as part of a package deal with the My Cafe' by BUNN and of all the coffees offered, this is my favorite. The other is "Reunion Island French Roast" which as I see here, is the same company that makes this blend. Either way, it's great coffee just be prepared for a dark cup, not light as they state on box...and it's for the pod brewers not K-cups.

I like the pod coffee for my really big cups of coffee, my Keurig does not fill this particular cup nearly enough for my taste.  So the bod brewer is perfect and this coffee is just exactly what I need.  I am ordering my second box and will keep it on my favorite's list.

review/text: I have never left a review before, but I am doing one now in hopes that it may help someone else. This item comes up when typing in K Cups. This led me to believe that it was for a machine that uses K Cups. IT IS NOT. Now, I have spent money on something I just need to throw away because there is no way to use it. This is a single serving in a flat round filter. I have no way to try the product, so my rating is ONLY for the fact that Amazon has it searchable by something it clearly is not.

review/summary: This is the best rooibos tea
review/text: I try my best to stay away from caffeine, and never really liked the taste of decaf black tea. About a year ago I tried drinking Rooibos (south african red tea) and I'm completely hooked. But this tea is the absolute best of all of the rooibos flavors I've tried from Teavana (I'd also recommend Adagio's Rooibos Jasmine and Green Rooibos Citron if you're looking for more flavors). It is incredibly floral due to all of the flower petals (including whole dried rosebuds) and fruity at the same time from all of the strawberry, with a slight sour kick. I drink this tea every day and it always cheers me up.

review/summary: Most dissapointing rooibos I've tried
review/text: At home right now I have the following rooibos teas:<br /><br />Salada Green Tea with Red Antioxidants (strawberry-orange)<br />Equal Exchange Wild Rooibos<br />Port Trading Cape Rooibos<br />Zhena's Gypsy Red Lavender<br /><br />These are all bagged teas.  In addition, I have some loose rooibos from a local tea specialty store called Virtuous Teas.<br /><br />Of all of these rooibos (or rooibos-containing) teas, the Teavana Tropica is the worst by far.<br /><br />Firstly, it is difficult to even tell if it contains any actual rooibos; any such flavoring is completely overwhelmed by citris.  Given that the tea is actually *called* a rooibos tea, I find this completely unnacceptable.<br /><br />It would be another matter if rooibos was simply listed as one of the ingredients.  For example, the Salada green tea I mentioned doesn't pretend to be a rooibos tea.  "Rooibos" is listed as a constituent (along with lycopene, anthocyanins and vitamin C), but the tea is called "Green Tea Fortified with Red Antioxidants."  Although the Salada tea is not called a rooibos tea, it is much richer in rooibos flavor than Teavana's so-called "Rooibos Tropica."  Teavana's tea should simply be called "Tropica" with rooibos listed as an ingredient (if there is any actual rooibos present ... I'm not convinced).<br /><br />Secondly, the tea's "tropical" constituents manage to produce a cloying experience in a tea that is otherwise too weak.  I have not been able to brew a pot that had any satisfying tea impact whatsoever -- it has always felt too weak regardless of how much tea I've used -- yet making it stronger simply imparts more of the bad tropical mix.  And the tropical mix *is* bad, as if I steeped some orange peels and random flower petals in hot water.<br /><br />This tea dissapoints on multiple levels.  Also, the fact that it is marketed as a rooibos tea will make me wary of any other Teavana offerings.

review/text: I love using this product because I can use 100% real whipping cream and still have it hold its shape enough to decorate with. Up until now, I have been using a whipped topping base that leaves a funny aftertaste, and have to keep in the freezer until ready to use, but I lost my local supplier, so needed to find something I could just order online. I add 2 T. of this product per cup of whipping cream, and add about 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and few drops of clear vanilla...perfect. Holds up even without refrigeration for several hours. Even though this is gelatin based, I like being able to just add the powder instead of having to go through the ordeal of softening, heating, dissolving, cooling, etc. the gelatin before adding it to the cream. I highly recommend this product to any serious decorator who is looking for a great whipped cream stabilizer.

WOW, There it was pages of Friskies canned catfood on sale and shipped using SUPER SAVER. I now have 60 cats and adore the great karma they put out. Thanks to Amazon I get wonderful prices and don't have to lug hundreds of pounds of food home each week.If you are taking care of ferals or have only one indoor kitty you MUST check out the huge range of flavors and friskie products in the grocery section of Amazon you will be delightfully surprised :-)

review/text: One of my cat got very sick few months ago and had surgery. $1800 later he came back home very weak and skinny and of course no appetite. My vet recommended us to spoil him and give him whatever he likes and would eat. I tried all the cat food brand available at Amazon.com, even the most expensive, and finally "Friskies" was the favorite to my dear Wicket. Since this ordeal Wicket became very spoiled. He will eat only Friskies but also only fresly opened can. Good that we have another cat and two dogs, so we can recycle.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: Revised: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) Water sufficient for processing, fish, poultry, meat by-products, wheat gluten. How disgusting is that?! "Fish" and "poultry"?? Not really sure how that can be counted as an ingredient...not "tuna" or "salmon" but "fish." Not "chicken" or "turkey" but "poultry." If it was a decent quality meat- they wouldn't feel the need to hide behind ambiguous terms. Then there's the by-product which is the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, pure, meat, and there just isn't real identifiable meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or ambiguous "meats".

review/text: I have a very picky older female cat. Her poor stomach can't handle rich foods, but this tuna & egg in sauce flaked food is her favorite. The younger one also loves it, and they both wait every morning for their shared can. I have tried many, many varieties over the years, including the salmon, chicken and ocean whitefish that Friskies also offers. The tuna & egg is the best, and it helps give them both a shiny coat. I highly recommend this cat food. -Amanda

You will have a good idea how my cats react after I open a can of the aforementioned cat food.  I stick to the established routine as one cat needs medicationed mixed into her food.  In any case I put down each cat's plate in a certain order.  If I go out of the usual order chaos results.  My catstypically gulp down the tuna & egg mixed with dry food in 7-10 minutes!  I don't know how they can even taste the food eating so fast, but... I like the fact that I can save money on my cats' food by using the Subscribe and Save option at Amazon.  Not even Walmart can compete with the lower prices I get on food this way.

If I would have bought this for myself I would have given one or two stars, but for a great deal as Halloween candy it would get a four or five. I figure a three is pretty fair on this one as kind of a scam product but at a scam price.

Again, a good mix of candies (and actually tasted fine), but apparently not stored properly.

review/summary: Chocolate had melted
review/text: Halloween 2012. I refuse to be one of the houses that gives off-brand Laffy Taffy or candy corn (seriously, who likes candy corn!), so I ordered 2 bags of these assorted Hershey's chocolates. Arrived in 2 days(paid $12.77 for each bag, shipped free with amazon prime).<br /><br />Arrived at my front door in about 80�F weather, opened the box up, and, worried that they had melted, opened one of the bags up to check it's condition.<br /><br />It was a chocolate holocaust.<br /><br />I'd say 60% of the chocolate was either liquid or partially liquid (some had started to reharden). I felt like Oscar Schindler as I tried to salvage as many of them as I could by throwing them in the freezer. My heart wept at the sight of this choco-carnage, truly this was an existential moment.<br /><br />Breakdown (1 bag):<br />Kit-Kat: 13. Wafer was intact, the exterior chocolate coating was all/partially melted. After freezing: outer chocolate hardened, good enough condition for halloween.<br /><br />Hershey Bars: 21. Most of the hershey bars had gotten squished during delivery, they were all partially melted/deformed. After freezing: the chocolate hardened, but you could tell they had at some point melted... I'll save these for kids who put no effort into their costumes.<br /><br />Reese's Cups: 17. These were by far the worst, all had melted and partially re-hardened, they were disfigured as though they'd been dragged through an Auschwitz concentration camp. I can only imagine the sort of torture they must have gone through. These were not fit for human consumption. Tears streamed down my face as I stuffed my face full of Reese's cups. I gave them a soldier's death.<br /><br />Whoppers- 52. Upon refreezing, they were in decent enough condition that I could probably give them out on Halloween. But there were so many... these will go to the kids who are far too old to be Trick-or-Treating.<br /><br />OVERALL: order if you need bulk Halloween candy or if you enjoy Whoppers... you could honestly get an equivalent amount of unmelted candy from your local Wal-Mart, I probably didn't save much money getting it from Amazon. And if you live in a hot place, chances are it will melt.

review/text: Well besides the fact that half the candy was melted, that's more of a packaging issue, but I still have to factor it into the review. The amount of each type of candy was very unbalanced, there were hardly any kit kats and too many whoppers. Some of the whoppers had two pieces inside instead of three which I thought was strange. I wouldn't recommend this variety pack and I'm pretty sure there aren't 100 pieces in each bag, even though I didn't count (maybe they count each whopper ball as a single piece). Better off finding a sale in the store, the prices were nearly the same.

review/text: I got 9 bags of these for kids a school and for trick or treat. I used them all! The kids liked picking from the bucket for their favorites. I did notice that the bags had lots more whoppers than the other candy. I wish it were more of an even assortment (that is why I took away one star.) I almost took another one because the price of his went up at the end of october (I doubt many folks were buying this on October 30th) and continues to be at the higher price AFTER Halloween. It is only $1.18, but still, Halloween is over!) I kind of thought it would have gone down a little (or at least stayed the same!)<br /><br />I had no trouble with staleness or with any melted candy. There was no cool pack or anything in my box. I live in the Northeast so we don't often have trouble with chocolate unless it is summer. I wanted another few bags to give out around thanksgiving, but not with the price increase.

review/summary: No more 3$ emergency 8oz bottles at the local
review/text: I've been trying to stock a small ongoing pantry. With all the coupon shows, stores and manufacturers are wise to double and triple couponing. Also, I dont need 50 deodorants or 100 bottles of Mountain Dew and we dont eat frozen meals or canned ravioli. That said, deals on cooking oil, flour, sugar,dried beans etc--pantry basics that allow for wholesome homemade meals is what I look for on Amazon. You have to really think even with aPrime membership if the price is comparable to the local market using coupons, and throwing in free delivery. In my case, its usually always pays to go with Amazon for dry goods. When  they start stocking fresh foods, no need to stand in lines or beg stores to deliver. Where I just moved everyone drives, I came from NYC where stores offered delivery as a matter of course and you tipped. Now I have to plead w customer service as a disabled shopper to get someone to assist me walking a shopping cart home. Add it all up, if Amazon can contain it prices and not start charging fees of a political nature, they have no where to go but take over the entire retail online industry...and I'm right there supportin'em.

review/text: I love PB2 but when I saw theres now an Organic powdered PB with nearly the same stats, I decided to try.  It's pretty good thought I actually prefer PB2 and peanut flour flavor better.  If the prices were the same, I would buy this product though because it's Organic.  I eat nearly a jar a week of PB2 so this stuff is just too expensive!  Is it worth 9$/jar?  Nope, not in my opinion.  If you are strictly Organic, rich and don't eat it a lot, this is a fine option

review/text: Peanut butter is the one thing that I really can't get enough of.  And eating 8 tablespoons of peanut butter--which is what I'd like to do--is certainly not an option with its high caloric and fat contents.  So I had my fingers crossed for Just Great Stuff's Powdered PB, but I had my doubts.<br /><br />Just Great Stuff's Powdered PB is amazing!!  It's slightly sweeter than peanut butter (at least for me because I favor the natural PB to sugary Skippy), probably due to the coconut additives, but it tastes like peanut butter and has that perfect PB creaminess.  If you like peanut butter, but don't like fat, you will love this!

review/summary: Organic, tasty, and customizable
review/text: This product is great. Its got a few different ingredients than PB2 which are going to appeal to a big chunk of people in the health food community.<br /><br />PB2 is made with peanuts, sugar, and salt. This is made with organic peanuts, organic coconut sugar (which is supposed to have a lower glycemic index and for the record does not taste like coconut in the slightest), and sea-salt. I'm not certain how much the glycemic index of the sugar matters when it only has 2 grams of sugar per serving (PB2 has 1 gram), but then again I'm not diabetic and I thought it might be a useful thing to point out.<br /><br />Overall unless you are a strong subscriber to the "Organic over Conventional" debate I'm not sure this product is more nutritious than PB2. It has an extra gram of sugar and a gram less of protein and fiber per serving. Of course this is a huge improvement over normal organic peanut butter let alone peanut butter from any of the major brands. So if the two products are more or less the same nutrition wise purchasing would come down to flavor and price.<br /><br />This product is a bit more expensive than PB2. Thats probably due to the organic factor and scale. Organic ingredients cost more to produce and more to buy, but also PB2 has a jump start on branding and is in more stores (or at least it seems to be) so its distribution network may run more efficiently, it may be able to produce larger batches at lower costs, and overall its going to be a bit cheaper. So don't write this product off now and forever because of the price. If you try it and like it support it and the price may come down.<br /><br />Finally flavor and texture. This product tastes like peanut butter there's no getting around that. Its rich and almost creamy when you mix it up. It can add a peanut butter flavor to protein shakes, yogurt, muffins, cookies, etc. In short its fully customizable and how you use it is up to you and your preferences. I've read that a lot of people have to "learn to like" PB2. I didn't have that experience, but if you did or are having trouble learning to like it give this one a try. I'm not sure what it is exactly maybe the coconut sugar (which again doesn't taste like coconut), but it does taste a little different than PB2. I don't have much of a preference either way and friends that have tried both seem more or less split in their opinions (when they have one).<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />It tastes great<br />It can be used in many ways and mixed to any consistency<br />It uses organic ingredients and coconut sugar (unlike PB2)<br />But its nutritional stats aren't quite as good (1 more gram sugar, 1 less gram fiber and protein)<br />Its a bit more expensive than PB2<br /><br />I love it, but you'll have to decide how you weight organic ingredients vs nutrition stats vs price, in any case if you want to replace your normal PB but don't like PB2 its worth a try

review/summary: ON A SCALE OF 1-10, I GIVE THIS A 9!
review/text: I came across this in a little specialty store on Whidbey Island and even though I was skeptical, I bought it. At $9.49 I hoped it would be at least passable. I mixed it with water as per the direction, and voila! Peanut Butter! It's low fat but it doesn't taste like it. I have been eating peanut butter for more than 50 years and I love it. However, it's high in calories and fat and I'm on Weight Watchers so 2 tbl of regular PB is about 6 points - way too much for an everyday item. 2 tbl of this is ONE POINT and it tastes great. It's creamy and flavorful and great on toast in the morning. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this a 9! Not totally perfect, but close. Even my husband, who dislikes anything low fat or reduced fat, loves it! He even asks for it specifically on his toast! Amazing. I haven't tried it in a drink yet but I'm sure it will be good. I ordered the 12 pack, which lowered the price per jar quite a bit. I know it won't go to waste. I'd like to find a recipe for cookies or a cake that includes this powdered PB! If you love PB, give this a try, I don't think you'll be sorry.

review/text: We're vegans and eat very healthy, but occasionally crave some ramen too - most ramen out there contains too much sodium and all sorts of tasty but unhealthy ingredients in the spice packet.  Not this one - though yes, the taste is pleasantly mild, it's not as strong as you may be used to from generic brands - it's also organic and much better for you.  And if you like to work with what you've got at home to add some flavor, you can easily add a veggie or your own seaweed while it's cooking to take things up a notch.  We even put some garlicky kale in last night and it was delicious.

Amazon originally quoted 1 week for shipping, but I think that is because they send the order direct to Bard Valley and then B.V. does the shipping. I think Amazon padded the shipping time just in case. I've ordered from B.V. before, they ship VERY quickly. That said it was quick from Amazon AND cheaper. Amazon does it again!
