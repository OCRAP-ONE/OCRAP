review/summary: Mini Hunks are just as good as original size
review/text: I love the candy bar, Big Hunk, but it is so much better to just have a little at a time. It is so good to have just a taste and be able to carry them in my purse for later. These were very fresh. The shipping time was amazing. I had them in time to surprise my sister for her birthday.

review/summary: Big hunk nougat candy
review/text: I used this in favor bags for a second wedding. The title was what I was after. The candy tastes good.any of the candies which were individually wrapped, had candy on the outside sticking to the wrapper. That meant I had to wipe down many of the little bars with hot soapy to clean the greasy sticky wrappers. Time consuming.

review/summary: Just as I Remember Them
review/text: I grew up in the '50s and in my high school years I was a lifeguard, water instructor.  I can't think of a day that I didn't have one of these bars as a "job well done" or "I've had a bad day" or just "this is a great candy bar".  Its cousin Look with the chocolate covering is available too!  All came packaged so carefully so as not to have them melt in the summer weather, and the quick delivery (which Amazon is famous for) had me back in candy heaven once again!  Great customer relations and careful to send out just what I need or think I need, like this great find I had given up having again!

review/summary: Cute and delicious
review/text: I was throwing a "Mommy to BEE" themed baby shower for my sister-in-law and I used these sugar bumble bees to put on Sprinkles cupcakes. They looked great and people loved them! All the guests said that the bees were good (how could they not be good - they're made out of sugar!). I think it really added a nice touch for an affordable price. I ordered the 48pk (when I really only need about 24) because I was worried some of them might come broken. All 48 bees came perfectly intact. They package very carefully in units of 12.<br /><br />When I ordered, I paid $16.99 with free prime 2-day shipping. At the time of this review, the product is only about $6 + $5 shipping! That's a great price! You can find these cake decs at other sources and even when I paid $16.99, it was pretty competitively priced. I'm not sure how much this new price will last but at a total of $11 (including shipping) it's a steal!<br /><br />Maybe I'll post a picture!

review/text: I bought these along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017140GQ">Nordic Ware Platinum Collection Beehive Cake Pan</a> for my son's Winnie the Pooh birthday party.  They came nicely wrapped with a kind note from the company stating that if any bee were broken during shipment, to call them immediately and they would replace it(them) free of charge!  None of mine were broken, and were wrapped very securely.  I would order the package of 48 to get your money's worth, or if you will be decorating a cake and cupcakes, as I did.  With doing both, I had some left over and plan to use them again in the future.

review/text: I was hesitant to order because the standard delivery said it could take up to three weeks. Since the item was only $8 I didn't want to pay for expedited shipping, when standard was already $4.99. However, the product arrived in 3-4 days and in perfect condition. My niece saw the cupcakes I made using these bees for the first time on her birthday and she exclaimed, "Stephie, I saw those bumble bee cupcakes you made me! (she had to have them after seeing them on a magazine.) You made this the best birthday ever!" She just turned 5. The price I paid with shipping was all worth it to make her day special. Thanks for the great product and wonderful customer service!!!!

The lollipops were a big hit and the teachers loved them so much that they looked on line to see where they could buy more.  Came very nicely packaged.  Just as an FYI - I was expecting the entire lollipop to be chocolate, but the bowling balls are actually coated with a hard candy coating with the chocolate inside.

review/text: The bowling pin candy was marked with an expiration date of March 2011. As soon as we handed them out at the birthday party one child noticed the expiration date. By then it was too late to do much about the problem. Another child said he did not like the lollipops. Maybe if they were fresh he might have. The bowling ball candy did not have an expiration date on the wrapper so there was not any way to know how old that was. I noticed one positive review above. I think the lollipops worked out in that instance because the children could not read.

The sets I received have the stick coming out of the top (round) part of the bowling pin, NOT the bottom as pictured.  I was going to use these as cupcake toppers and in a center piece, it would have looked very silly with upside down pins!  Probably wouldn't be a big deal if you just wanted to pass them out at a party.<br /><br />The colors were very vivid & pretty as pictured... would have been great if the pins were not upside down.

Not "upside down" at all (like some reviewers have mentioned) ... these look just like the photo. None arrived broken. With the two boxes, there were an equal number of bowling pins, red balls and blue balls. Also were not expired, the date is 2013. Perhaps they've been improved since the bad reviews here.<br />UPDATE: I did get to taste one and they smell and taste just like juicy fruit gum! Quite big and long lasting!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I bought two dozen of these. They are so cute and were not expired as some of the other reviews mentioned. I think they might have been looking at the wrong date. There are two dates. One for when it was manufactured and one for when they expire. They expire in 2013. I think the bowling pins work better upside down and it doesn't take away from the cutness of these. They came in red and blue balls, and bowling pins. I have not tasted them but they look good. None were broken or melted and arrived very fast in a safely packaged box. I would recommend these. My only complaint was that out of two boxes I only got a total of four bowling pin suckers :( and the majority were red bowling balls. I would have liked third red third blue third bowling pins. Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase. Keep up the great work you guys!

review/text: I was very dissapointed in these lollipops.  Out of 12 in the box, 4 were broken.  The picture shows a bowling pin with the stick in the bottom of the pin-so it's right side up when you hold it by the stick-but the ones I received had the stick coming out of the top of the bowling pin...which means when you hold it by the stick, the pin is upside down.  I ordered these for my daughter's bowling party and she was disappointed too.

It isn't as subtle as the other Zhena's teas that I've tried but I like it this way. If you like ginger and/or peach, you'll love this tea!<br /><br />Zhena's Passionate Peach Tea contains: organic Fair Trade black tea, ginger root, and peach flavor. One cup contains about � of the caffeine of a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Zhena's Gypsy Tea is a wonderful company that makes teas that are organic, fair trade, and processes tea using green practices. They have high standards and make quality teas. If you are interested, check[...]for more information. They all come in eco-conscious tins. Because of the high quality of the teas, they do tend to be a bit more expensive, but worth it if you believe in supporting the environment and in fair trade.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Brilliant Product - LOVE this garlic spray
review/text: I found this spray in a gourmet food store and thought it would be fun to try (I hate having garlic smelling fingers after cooking). To my surprise I have used it almost every day since then and I LOVE it! It is so much better than crushed garlic in a jar and it doesn't have a chance to whither up and dry out like fresh cloves. And NO garlic fingers! Five sprays equals a zesty and robust garlic infusion to any dish. For example, I use it in garlic mashed potatoes, in pureed bean dip, and in sauteed spinach and many more dishes.<br />And a bottle lasts forever... I still have half a bottle left after more than a year! I'm so glad to see it on Amazon - I know I can find it again when I need to.<br />Yum, yum, yum, genius product.<br />Oh, and it does come with a cap (not sure why that reviewer didn't get a cap).

review/summary: Good Tea
review/text: I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.

review/text: My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots. In other words -- nearly impossible.<br /><br />But lord help me, I try.<br /><br />I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted crap.<br /><br />(Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure.<br /><br />The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!)<br /><br />I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.)<br /><br />And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag.<br /><br />So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting. That's a winner.

review/summary: Old Mother Hubbard Biscuits
review/text: My doggies snubbed these biscuits initially (they always act that way) before they decided that they didn't really mind them, in fact they kind of like them...now.<br /><br />These are made with natural ingredients, but they do have wheat flour and oatmeal and so I don't give them too often. I don't really like giving my dogs wheat.<br /><br />I prefer Natural Balance L.I.T. Limited Ingredients Treats over these, but this is a good product too.

review/text: It tastes overcooked, bland, and almost fermented.  The babies seem to enjoy the sweetness but then again this is their first food other than cereal, so I'm not sure that they would know any better.  The consistency of the puree is very smooth and easy for the baby to manipulate.  The packaging and convenience are nice also.  We will finish the pack but afterwards I think we will be making our own fresh pear puree without overcooking the nutrients out of it.  It just doesn't have any similarity in taste to a pear.

review/summary: GROWNUP MAC & CHEESE AND MORE...
review/text: This is a grownup version of Macaroni & Cheese. You're safe, the broccoli are a mere sprinkling of the green, not enough to over run the White Cheddar Cheese flavor. I actually made a side dish of broccoli. I'm trying to get the teenager to eat more green vegetables. He mixed his broccoli in! Manager Special at less than a buck a box.<br /><br />Like most of the RONI packed mixes, it's quick, tasty and filling. You add water, butter and milk to the mix and in less than 15 MICROWAVE minutes you can eat. Just that 27% of your daily sodium limit is in each serving, when your monitoring that stuff.<br /><br />NOTE: The individual packages have a sell by date of May, 2010. We'll use up the 12 packs by then, but I'm leery of expiration dates that are close in.<br /><br />*** Microwave Recipe Variations without milk:<br />1.0 Cook pasta according to directions. Mix spice packet WITHOUT the milk and you have a tasty side dish without the dairy calories.<br /><br />1.5 Add 2 cups of chicken broth (2 buillon cubes + 2 cups of water) to the above variation. HEAT on HIGH for 4 minutes covered and you have a tasty soup.<br /><br />2.0 One Dish Meal...CHICKEN BREAST WITH PASTA-RONI ROBUSTO<br />Using round microwave dish mix 1 TBLSP olive oil, 2 TBLSP water, 1 tsp Italian Spice and a pinch of crushed Red Pepper Flakes. Then coat 2 skinless chicken breasts with mixture. Next cook covered on HIGH for 3 minutes. Follow usual Pasta Roni directions by adding the water and pasta to the chicken, until pasta is done. ADD the PastaRoni spice packet and toss . Then add 1 14oz can of Chunky Tomatoes and cook covered on HIGH for 3 minutes.<br />  My Son really liked it... suggested I slice the chicken breasts and make it a casserole. Since I started with FROZEN chicken that wasn't happening.

I like it so much that I usually don't like to share it with anyone else!  Unfortunately, stores in my area stopped stocking this flavor long ago, and judging by the way the price has gone up here, I'm assuming that it's been discontinued.  It's a shame, as the Shells with White Cheddar is a poor substitute.

review/text: This is a wonderful rice topping and it has all the same toppings normally used in "ochazukemono" -- a kind of rice porridge.  Ochazukemono, to steal a line from Ratatouille, is a peasant dish. It is commonly eaten as a snack in Japanese homes.  Ochazukemono is simply rice with dried salmon flakes and dried seaweed covered with a tea cup of green tea.  While this dish is surprisingly simple, it remains one of my most enduring "souvenirs" from Japan.  I love this furikake because I can sprinkle it over rice, add a tea cup of green tea and have a quick, nutritious and (I think) delicious snack.

I don't know the exact type of rice we eat, but we always get ours from an Asian grocery store in Charlotte. Add this (amount is based on your taste) to 1/2-1 cup of hot, steamed rice and compress it into a shape of your choice to get a tasty treat in less than 2 minutes (if the rice has been made already). I'm looking forward to adding this to chao ga (Vietnamese chicken porridge) in the future. My mother is contacting our favorite store in Charlotte to ask them to stock up on this kind of furikake. It's that good.

review/text: i bought a jar of this about a year ago and i still have most of it. it's not bad but, well, it's really fishy and i just can't get past the unnerving resemblance to fish food. i like lots of other furikake flavors (especially wasabi) but this one just doesn't do it for me. it's alright when eaten very soon after putting it on rice or couscous but the texture/flavor of it after sitting for a few hours is quite unappetizing. i now understand why people buy those little conatiners that let you take a portion to sprinkle on right before eating.<br /> maybe i'll try the tea/soup thing charlotte ann hu mentioned. that actually sounds pretty tasty and the flavor of the tea might help cut the fishiness. as for the price and vendor, the price is very reasonable and it arrived fairly quickly and in excellent condition.

I'm averaging the 1 star I'd give for the rip-off with the 5 stars I'd give for the actual mints.<br /><br />If you don't live near enough to a Trader Joe's to get these, and you're as addicted to the damn things as I am, it might just be worth $4.50 more per itty bitty box to get your fix. But if you're not already addicted...don't do it, man! I'm telling you, they are made with crack. I can't get enough of them.

review/summary: Picky Papillons Love It
review/text: My Papillons (ages 8 and 9) have been the pickiest damn dogs I have ever met.  You know when the vet says "they will eat eventually, they won't starve"?  Well, no.  These damn dogs would starve if they didn't get to eat something they liked.  I have been struggling for years to find food that is not made in China, not made from chicken from China even if manufactured in the USA.  Finally, I found Halo.  I integrated the Halo Spots Stew kibble and the Halo Spot's Stew chicken canned into the Paps diet over 2 weeks.  Week one they ate half of the Halo and by the end of week two they were eating ALL of the Halo product and the small amount of the old brand was left in their bowls.  Their skin is fantastic, their poops are a perfect consistency (not too hard or too soft) and they are energetic and just happy and excited for meal time now.  I also feed them the Halo LiL Bits freeze dried chicken treats.  All of the ingredients are from USA and made solely here.  And, I am thrilled that my favorite TV talk show host, Ms. Ellen Degeneres is a part owner of the company.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for offering this here as it is hard to get in my somewhat small town pet stores who seem to cater to gross China food that will make all our dogs sick.

review/summary: my dogs love it
review/text: I have spent 2 years trying to find some sort of dog food that won't break the bank, that's made with dog health in mind, and that my dogs actually like. having said that, I was truly skeptical about buying this, simply because of the price. I mean, it's dog food, they all look the same. But. it's. awesome. I started off by mixing in a spoon full of it into their regular food, and for the first time ever my dogs were cleaning their plates. its got chunks of real vegetables in it, and in combination with the dried food (also Halo, I mix the salmon with the lamb) my dogs are eating like kings and queens: 3 types of meat, 15 types of veggies & fruits...wow.<br /><br />I'm totally in love with this brand. I have switched over EVERYTHING, their treats, their dry food and their wet food.if halo comes out with a flavored water supplement for dogs, I'll probably buy that too. its just a great brand, reliable, and with a conscience.

Worst of ll, he could no longer go jogging with my wife and was acting old at the age of 6. Now he is healthy again and has the energy of a puppy again.

review/summary: Only dog food I will use
review/text: After reading horrible reviews about dog food and with the onset of my puppy having seizures, I made him only home cooked meals specifically for dogs.  He was having stomach problems and went through many different recipes always consulting with my Vet, but then I found Halo dog food.  My dog eats this and looks for more, his stomach problems have subsided and he's doing very well. This was such a relief due to his seizures and stomach problems and I tried so hard to make him well.  He's been on Halo canned chicken Spots Stew now for 2 months and I am so relieved.  Now if only I could do something about the seizures, all would be well.  However, I give very high recommendations for Halo food.  A bit expensive, but worth every penny.  I need to add that I know how much Ellen Degeneres loves dogs and put my trust in her advocating Halo food.  I'm not sorry. Thanks Ellen.  Thanks Amazon for carrying it and offering monthly subscriptions.

review/text: I wanted this wonderful food to work for Sheldon, but even a teaspoon added to his lamb and rice kibble gave us not so good results.  I wonder if he is just too little to try it...he is 4 months old.  Anyway, we may try it again when he is older because it seems like such a good quality food and that is what we strive to feed him.  I do have to say I was surprised when I opened the can.  I was expecting a chunky stew type food but it isn't.  It is a course puree with chunks of vegetable in it and that was fine with me too.  Also, he loved it!  If only it would have loved him back.

review/summary: Good... but no longer "the best"
review/text: Sometimes we buy products simply because we always have done so... in other words, "brand loyalty". Kraft has a very good and reliable name, and their macaroni and cheese dinner is a good product, and we still expect the best quality from them.... but Kraft has maintained the same standard in this product over the years while their smaller competitors have been changing for the better!<br /><br />Because "Kraft dinner" got a little pricey over the past few years, (around a dollar a box nowadays, depending on where you buy it), I finally relented and tried an "off brand". I picked up a few boxes  of "Our Specialty" brand at the local Dollar General store (total size = 7.25 ounce box. serving size, 2.5 oz. "Prepared" stats: 400 calories, 150 calories from fat, RDA sodium = 30%; 1% cholesterol; 17% total carbs) -- it was 33 cents per box and it simply tastes MUCH better than Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner. Also, the macaroni in the Our Specialty brand holds up better -- it's very tender but it doesn't go flat when you boil it like the Kraft does.<br /><br />A good friend of mine recently re-confirmed my own findings when he said that he bought the brand which is sold at Meier's Stores (a big food chain) around Cincinnati, Ohio, and he experienced the very same results with their store brand.<br /><br />So, maybe it's time that we took a look at more "off brands," clones, and generics. There are some really good smaller companies out there selling some very high-quality food products so don't be afraid to try them, especially when there is such a huge price difference!<br /><br />I hope that you find this review/recommendation helpful.

review/summary: ONE OF OUR FAMILY FAVORITES
review/text: This has been a favorite at our house for years now.  It is quickly prepared, tastes pretty good for a ready mixed box product and if you have some left over you can put it in the fridge and it is even better the next day.<br /><br />Now this is not to say that I prefer this stuff to the home-made variety and the different varieties of that variety my wife makes...no, there is no comparison truth be told, but over the years, raising a family, raising grand children and odd and long working hours have not always allowed my wife and I to cook scratch meals all of the time.  This product fills in the gaps quite nicely.  It makes a great side dish for many, many meals.<br /><br />We always have several boxes of it on hand for those busy days and our four grandsons are perfectly capable of cooking this stuff their selves.  Sometimes they will be in our house either all night or most of the night when they are home from school and the four will cook three or four boxes of this mac and cheese at once for a "snack."  They are great about cleaning up their own messes so this is fine with us.<br /><br />The price here, if you get free shipping, is quite competitive and can only be bested (where we live) when it is on sale or when we make our monthly trip to the local military installation and shop at the commissary (We are retired military).  Even then, the price is not all that much different.<br /><br />We have tried other brands form time to time and while they are pretty good for the most part, they simply do not taste like this particular product does.<br /><br />This is a good product, it has an excellent self-life so we are able to stock up on it and as a matter of fact we have a goodly bunch of it in our "emergency food supply" we keep incase of power outages or being snowed in. (You can cook it quite well on the top of the wood heated stove we found).<br /><br />I like this product and must admit that I have to have a fix of it myself from time to time...snacks and all that you know.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

We brought up our children on "macky cheese," as some of them called it.  With years of purchasing various brands, we discovered in our households that this one is the best.  The children considered it the gold standard,as far as taste and texture were concerned.<br /><br />The children in our families all learned how to prepare it at very young ages, because they were motivated to have something good to eat.<br /><br />We were happy because our children were getting great food they needed with calcium and fiber. We were happy that they were content with this convenient food in a box and that they preferred it to fast food to be bought.<br /><br />Now that we are older and our tastes have changed, we still cling to that box of Macky Cheese.  Occasionally, we eat it plain, but more often we add all kinds of things to it, such as tomatoes, mixed vegetables, almonds, pine nuts, and curry.  We layer it with collard greens and chili.

review/summary: Great for Normal Hair, Soothing to the Scalp
review/text: I had the two men in my life try this one: my son (10) and my husband.<br /><br />My son doesn't have a dandruff problem, but both he and my husband, who occasionally has some flakes, were both suffering from itchy scalps due to all the swimming they've been doing.<br /><br />My son really liked the shampoo.  (He used it by himself, and I washed his hair a few times myself to see what it was like.)  It made good suds and he really liked the smell which he thought was 'manly but not stinky'. (I had no idea he even noticed these sorts of things. But he did say that it made him smell nice like his Uncle Marker). I liked that it suds well and washed out cleanly without a lot of whining.<br /><br />My husband commented that it 'soothed' his itchy scalp.  And neither of us us have seen any flakes.  HOWEVER, he also commented that he didn't  think it cleaned to his complete satisfaction: at least not for Summer.  After a particularly grueling day of sitting on a lounge chair watching me mow and then weed the garden, he said he had to wash through twice to get to the point where his hair felt super clean.  This is more or less the same comment he's been making about every other shampoo that he's tried lately:  Pantene, Aussie, and Suave.<br /><br />So FIVE STARS.  This is a shampoo/conditioner that is going to be good for someone who doesn't want their shampoo to dry out their hair and scalp.  It also smells night without being overly perfume-y.  It appears to be soothing to the scalp, but you might find you need to use more shampoo if you have excessively greasy hair.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/summary: Works Well
review/text: This is the third of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy products that I have tried. All use the same active ingredient, Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), to treat the dandruff. This shampoo seems  be a general anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner rather than one geared toward dry or oily hair or scalps.It is a good product that works well.<br /><br />I have also tried the 2 in 1 Dry Scalp Hydration anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner  and the Strong and Full anti-dandruff shampoo. I don't notice a whole lot of difference between them other than the perfume smell seems stronger in both shampoo and conditioners. The smell seems to go away after I am done washing my hair which is a good thing since I don't want my hair smelling sweet.<br /><br />You only need to use a little of this product to get your hair covered in soap. It feels fine on my scalp. It is a daily shampoo and conditioner.<br /><br />I had been using a store brand anti-dandruff shampoo as well as a coal tar based brand name product.  I am happy using clear men scalp therapy products.  They seem to keep my dandruff under control.

review/summary: Cleans well
review/text: I don't have much problems with dandruff so much as sometimes just having an itchy scalp.  I've always tried to use some dandruff shampoo at least a couple times per week because it seems to help.  This shampoo is well geared toward men - not much scent, lathers well, and works.  The lather is very dense, and the shampoo cleans well.<br /><br />This particular variety is supposed to "Refres", which I'm guessing is why the ingredients include menthol and one other incredient not found in some of the other variations.  Some shampoos with menthol have set my head tingling immediately - I don't notice that with the Clear brand.  If it does anything, it's barely perceptible to me.  Scent is the same as the other variety I tried - basically, a fresh apple sort of smell.<br /><br />My only complaint is the bottle - it's top heavy and one of the two bottles I received had leaked even though the lid was taped shut.  Therefore, I wouldn't throw this in a suitcase or gym bag.

review/summary: A Fine Choice for Men in Need of a Dandruff Shampoo
review/text: The Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2-in-1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner is a fine choice for men who need a dandruff shampoo that works.  This product contains ginseng, mint, and tea tree oil along with its active ingredient, pyrithione zinc, which means it may sting a little bit until it's rinsed off (I tested this myself, even though the scent is all wrong for a woman); once rinsed, however, the scalp feels much better and does not itch.<br /><br />I'd recommend this product for men who have contact dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis, as it does exactly what it says it'll do -- it leaves the scalp and hair in better condition, and it doesn't itch.  (Pity this maker hasn't yet put out a similar product for women as of yet.)  It should work well on a daily basis.<br /><br />Five stars, highly recommended.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey

review/text: Normally my husband uses whatever shampoo that is within reach while in the shower.<br />He tried this 2 in 1 Anti Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, it lathered up nicely.<br />Years back when I purchased 2 in 1 anti dandruff shampoo and conditioner, it did not lather and reminded me of like school glue (if that makes sense)<br />This was not like that at all.<br />Removed all of his hair product residue from his hair and left his hair soft, shiny and very clean looking and healthy looking.<br />Like this product and the results.<br />The scent is not over powering in my opinion and I think a woman could use this as well and not have to worry about the scent being too much.

review/summary: He Loved it!
review/text: I got this for hubby to try and he loves it. He has poor vision and hadn't noticed the flakes over the past few years, but they were there. One use with the shampoo, and his hair is soft, smells nice and no little flakes. From my point of the view the bonus is how both the men's and the women's Clear shampoos hold down the overpowering odor some health and beauty aids dump in their products because of fragrance allergies. Because this shampoo's fragrance was so mild I can stand to be around my husband after he shampoos.

review/summary: Anti- dandruff yes
review/text: This is another in the Clear line of shampoos. The bottle says it is for men, anti-dandruff, shampoo and conditioner, clean and refresh. The back also states that there is ginseng, tea tree and natural mint. None of these smells are really noticeable, although the scent of the shampoo is a clean fresh one.<br />One strange thing about this particular bottle of shampoo is especially since it says it has conditioner in it - it did not seem as thick as the other varieties of the Clear line that I have used. This seemed like a normal thick type shampoo. The conditioner seemed to work well and so did the anti-dandruff.<br /><br />The problem with the entire Clear brand lies in 2 factors. The bottle itself seems to be made so that you can leave it `upside down' in your shower so that it will dispense right away, but it leaks/seeps out of the opening as it stands. The herbal essence, that my whole family uses... we stand it upside down on its wide lid and it has never leaked once. The other is that this seems a bit pricey for doing the same job that other shampoos do.

review/summary: An Anti-Dandruff Shampoo that works well
review/text: I have been using anti-dandruff shampoo for quite some time.  When the symptom is severe, I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043OSIVM">Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength Anti Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)</a> which contains 1% selenium sulfide.  For normal maintenance I usually use regular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F51RH4">Head & Shoulders Ocean Lift Dandruff Shampoo, 23.7 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)</a> which is less strong.  Comparing to other regular Shampoo, the Head & Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo does not smell as good, and is not as smooth feeling.<br /><br />This new Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner contains the same active ingredient as the regular Head and Shoulders shampoo (1% Pyrithione Zinc).  However it is formulated to be really smooth.  Just a tiny drop can produce a lot of form for shampooing.  It also smells better in my opinion than Head & Shoulders.  After using it for a couple of weeks, I think the anti-dandruff effectiveness is the same as Head & Shoulders if not better.<br /><br />This shampoo also claims to have essences from herbs such as ginseng, tea tree and others.  I do not doubt the claim but perhaps the concentration is just not enough for me to identify from the smell.  Anyway that's not important for me.<br /><br />This shampoo is for you if you use Head & Shoulders and want to try something for a change.

review/summary: I love this stuff...
review/text: I really enjoy the smell of this stuff, and it really seems to be working fantastically. The only reason that I am rating it 4 stars is because the mail lady stuffed into my mailbox and exploded the bottle, leaving me with only a very little.<br />But I hope you enjoy this product as much as I do.

review/summary: Strong scent that lingers
review/text: CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Clean & Refresh, 12.9 Fluid Ounce is a very manly product.  Thus, I had my husband use it and he is happy man with controllable thin hair.  There is not that burning, tingling feeling of some dandruff shampoos; instead a smooth lather is produced with a rich conditioner as well.  The scent is a spicy, heady smell and it lingers long after the washing.  Maybe a bit too strong, but in all honesty I am not sure.  I tend to like a softer, perhaps fruited scent to my shampoo's and conditioners.  My husband found it very pleasant.<br /><br />Try CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Clean & Refresh, 12.9 Fluid Ounce and see what you think?

review/summary: great for ladies, too
review/text: I have been on a mission lately to try and eliminate some of the many products that we have to keep in the shower, so I thought I'd try this to see if I can share with my husband. Currently, I use Aussie shampoo and conditioner and he uses a generic 2-in-1 dandruff shampoo.<br /><br />I have long (well below my shoulders) thick, slightly wavy hair and I am very happy with this! I sometimes have itchy scalp/dandruff, and this has helped that. It leaves my hair feeling clean and not weighed down, but still easy to comb out after a shower (some 2-in-1s make detangling tough). I've also recently started trying to only wash every other day when possible (using Suave dry shampoo on the days off), and this works fine with that routine - I don't feel greasy on day 2. I've found this to be more pleasantly thick than some 2-in-1 dandruff shampoos, which are very thin and kind of get all over the place as you squeeze them out of the bottle.<br /><br />I also tried another variety of this brand - just because I was curious of the difference between that and this. I thought one might have a "manly" fragrance, but neither I nor my husband can tell a difference in smell or anything else. (The smell for both is just pleasant and clean.)<br /><br />I think I might switch to this permanently - it eliminates some bottles AND a step in the AM!

review/summary: Works well for son with eczema and seborrheic dermatitis
review/text: My 10 year old son has seborrheic dermatitus. It's like eczema on the scalp, with thick flakes well beyond normal dandruff.<br /><br />The Clear Men Scalp Therapy is the most effective shampoo we've yet tried for him. The flakes are very much reduced when he's been using this product.  It seems to have a soothing, moisturizing effect.  This is a product we will stick with!

review/summary: Works on the itch without getting the smell!
review/text: I have relatively short hair (sometimes no hair), but my scalp gets itchy and dry. I have used several different shampoos and while they all worked decently, I really hate the smell! I don't want to smell like an old medicine cabinet after I shower. The Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo leaves my hair/scalp clean without drying it out and without smelling like medicine. I always shampoo twice, and I don't use much either time. I think this offers good value and I would recommend this to anyone with an itch or flakes! Give it a try, I think you'll like it.
