review/summary: Healthy alternative to potato chips
review/text: Crispy, salty, tasty -- and healthy. For me, a bag holds two servings. But if I occasionally pig out and eat the whole bag, no harm done. Snapea Crisps have fewer calories and less sodium than potato chips.  They are baked but contain some corn oil so they feel slightly greasy like potato chips. I much prefer the Original flavor to Ceasar (which tastes a bit tangy).

review/text: My co-worker tried these snacks and we were happy to find the product online.  They have a nice crunch and are made from healthy ingredients, making them a great alternative to other "puff" snacks.  They are very oily on the hands but that's the only drawback IMO.

review/text: I tried the original flavor and loved them!  Can't wait to try the Caesar flavor.  Calories aren't too bad, the serving size is decent, pretty low in sodium as far as crispy snacks go and 5g of protein.  A yummy snack when you are looking for something "chip-like".

review/text: I can not eat these due to allergies, but I order them for my mother. I thought the box would last her awhile but within 1-2 weeks, she sheepishly asked me to order more. I then watched her and my boyfriend fight over a whole bag. My 2 year old friend even loves them. They seem to be like a cheeto type texture and my mom says they taste like peas but a little sweeter. She says, "Great snack!"

review/text: My kids love Snapeas.  I personally do not care for the caesar flavor, but stick to the original.  They have a somewhat peanuty flavor, but with a cornpuff texture.  A much healthier snack than most kids processed snacks out therre, so we bring them along when we go on outings or roadtrips.  I do wish the bag had a resealing zipper to it, though... the material of the bag does not like to stay closed when folded down!

In fact I seek these out at the grocery, and love that they are baked, have natural ingredients and score on the calcium content too!  Glad to see I can order them by the case at Amazon.  The danger is that once you start a bag, it calls to you until all the crunchy crisps have disappeared.

review/text: I love Snapea Crisps.  The Caesar more than the original, although they are both really yummy.  My children and I eat them instead of cheeto's.  They have that sort of consistency, crunchy and salty, but disolvable enough for my infant son.  They do have fat in them, and the aforementioned salt, but they also have 5 grams of protein per serving, so I feel they are a justifiable snack, as long as they are in place of, rather than in addition to, other salty snacks like chips and french fries.

review/summary: An insanely delectable little snack!
review/text: First things first. Snapea Crisps do have 8 grams of fat (and 150 calories) per serving, with a serving size being one oz., which is approx. 22 of the cute little life-sized pea pod thingies. The good news is that they also have 5 grams of protein per serving, so you can hold you chin up while scarfing down the bag, which has been the compulsion of everyone I've known who's tried them. Kids love the taste, too! These also make great finger food snacks for toddlers, as the little pod thingies are finely textured. My only complaint is that I have to share them with every one else in the house. At this price, tho, you can afford to buy a case and hoard a few bags for yourself.

Remembering the Weight Loss Mantra, "Everything in Moderation!", I am reminded of an article I read about how easy it is to NOT lose weight or even gain it by eating healthy snacks - just because it is healthy doesn't mean you can eat the whole thing! So keep the portion control in mind and buy with confidence because these things taste great!

Mine have never made it to a salad. I didn't even realize that was what they were supposed to be used on top of!

I recommend this product as a healthier alternative to Cheetos or potato chips.  Enjoy!

review/text: at least I pretend that they're healthy. These are SO TASTY...and not a chemical burn...some time ago the company revamped the recipe and it no longer includes MSG or other scary multi-syllable preservatives. I am obsessed with this snack and they're tough to find locally. Check 'em out.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I'm excited to find these for sale on Amazon, and at a very reasonable price!  I just tried them for the first time a few days ago, and was wishing there was a nearby store that carried them.  Everyone I've given them to has liked them, even those who are not normally healthy eaters.  These crisps are reminiscent of puffy corn snacks (like cheetos), but with a different light flavor.  The calorie content is similar to other chip-type snacks (150 per serving), but these have the nutrition benefits of peas--protein (5g per serving), calcium (6% DV per serving), and iron (4% DV per serving).  I haven't tried the Ceasar flavor yet, but intend to do so in the near future. :)

review/summary: The Next Generation of Snack
review/text: You know, they used to say that smoking was good for the lungs.  Now, we're told that a greasy little snack in a bag is "healthy."  But, while this isn't an apple or a cup of yogurt, Snapeas are a far cry from bright orange Doritas or Ding Dongs.  They are baked (not fried), and perhaps there is merit to the pea foundation, as opposed to the potato or corn chip format.  They are major addictive - full of unique flavor, a pleasantly crisp but foamy (as in styrofoamy) texture, a dash of saltiness, and just enough oilyness to satisfy.  Try these and then spread the word.

review/text: Our whole family loves this snack. These make a great toddler snack (they're kind of puffy, so if you don't actually chew them, they'll just melt). My 2-year old has been eating these for a year now, and is constantly asking for his "Peapods?" A portable snack, far superior nutritionally to the typical cookie, cracker, goldfish, pretzel and other processed junk most kids are eating. These are just dehydrated snap peas, corn oil and salt (and there's still LESS sodium in these than Pepperidge Farm's low-sodium goldfish!). A great alternative to the usual snack highly processed of white flour, sugar, salt and/or chemical preservatives. They're better for you, and they taste great. We love them.

review/text: To be fair, these Snapea Crisps taste great.  The Ceasar have even more flavor, but contain dairy, which we avoid.  The kids love these in the car and they can be quite addictive.  Unfortunately, they are quite oily and can become very messy when eaten with the hands.  From the packaging it may appear that these are actual baked peas in the pod.  They are actually pea flour shaped into pods. If you don't mind the oiliness (comparable to kettle chip oiliness) give 'em a try!

review/summary: Tastes really  good
review/text: I got these because I was intrigued by the idea of snapped pea crisps.  They were much better than I expected.  I found that I had to eat the whole bag although one-serving is supposed to be about 3 OZ.  There was no good way to close the bag after opening unless you put it into a large zipper food storage bag.  I did like eating them, but they might get to be too much if I eat them everyday.  They were crispy upon opening and looked like they could easily go stale if left open for long.  My DH thought they tasted like french fries.  I thought they definitely had a "green" type taste although it wasn't overpowering.  I will buy again...but it will be a while since I plan to "pace" myself with these rather than get tired of them.  They do have corn oil and salt added as well as other preservatives of some kind.<br /><br />Also these have the same type of crunch that Baked Cheetos have.  They aren't really greasy, but there is a powder residue that is left on the fingers.

review/summary: Green, different, and completely yummy
review/text: If you judge this snack by the packaging, you might never try them. Baked pea pods don't exactly sound like the most appetizing (or satisfying) snack, but these guys really deliver.  As one of the other reviewers said, they are crunchy and light, with a texture similar to Cheetos, possibly a little more dense.  They have the taste of lightly salted snow peas, only light and airy.  While they might not be as healthy as a raw or steamed vegetable, they're a good alternative if you don't want all of the chemicals and sugars in most packaged snacks.  These guys have no sugar at all and the ingredient list is wholly recognizable.  I usually buy two bags at a time because they tend to go so fast.  Both flavors are delicious, though I prefer the original.<br /><br />Since it appears that Amazon is no longer carrying them, you might try Wild Oats, Trader Joes or Whole Foods, if any of those are nearby.

review/text: I, too, thought these would be dried snap peas.  Boy, was I wrong.  The picture on the front of the bag is VERY misleading...when you actually get a look at the product inside the bag, there are no visible "pods" on the snapea crisps.  The crisps are actually more like sad, green Cheetos.  At this point, I'd rather eat some Cheetos...at least they have some flavor.  These snapea crisps (original flavor) are on the bland side...even after adding salt to them, they still weren't very flavorful. They also left my hands greasy.  I thought I might be able to keep a bag of these in my desk at work to eat as a healthy snack, but I have reconsidered.  The crisps don't seem like much of a health food at all.  If I want to eat something with 6g of fat per serving, I'd rather go with chips and salsa or a handful of pretzels.

Not that it is bad, not at all, but I had very high expectations. These are very crunchy, with a slightly sweet flavor (which is one of the reasons I didn't care for it as much). They are baked, rather than fried, so the fat content is not as high as most crunchy snacks. Try them, you may like them better than I did.

review/summary: AAAAAAAaaaaccccKKKKK!!! PRICE WENT UP OVER 50%!!! When can we subscribe for this great healthy snack?
review/text: A half-pack of this (if I can stop at a half-pack) usually suffices when a craving for SOMEthing to snack on fights the knowledge of blood sugar readings that are borderline for type 2 diabetes. Other reviewers have described it most adequately, with nearly all finding it quite enjoyable, perhaps not TOTALLY virtuous, but much healthier than most snack foods. This is the best price I could find for it, at this writing a dime per pack cheaper [[AS OF JUNE 6 50% MORE!]] than at W**-M***. Amazon does not yet offer it by subscription, which would bring further price improvement and freedom from having to place repeat orders.<br /><br />UPDATE: THE PRICE WENT UP BY OVER 50%!!! These were $1.50/bag at a "national discount chain," so I can no longer recommend buying them from Amazon.  The store had them in stock when I checked, but another store wanted $2.50 per bag.  If Calbee drives the price up so horribly everywhere, I CAN NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL.<br /><br />Oh, Amazon, why do you keep doing this to us?  This isn't the first time that your price for a beloved item rose by some huge amount.<br /><br />Ya know what?  We can buy a bag of frozen microwave-steamable sugar snap pea pods or edamame (soy beans, either shelled or in pods) and be eating them five minutes after the urge packs us.  The bags costs less, contain more pods, and contain no fats or seasonings, so we can control the amount and type of added sinfulness.

review/summary: We don't like them....
review/text: I ordered these based on the reviews on this site, and recommendations by other parents of GFCF childen.  I really wanted to like them, but my son will not eat them.  He's tried a few times, but does not like the taste.  They taste OK to me, but this is not the type of snack I typically eat.  I will look for someone to donate the remaining 11 bags to.

review/summary: Leave a weird sensation
review/text: These are a little salty, a little greasy, and a little 'powdery'.  The taste is not bad, BUT, I did have the strangest sensation after eating a couple handfuls - I don't have any known allergies or 'texture issues' with food whatsoever, so it was really bizarre:  they started to sort of taste prickly, like the outer part was sharp or rough, and it was unpleasant to continue eating them.  The closest thing I can compare is imagine chewing on a mouthful of roasted peanut SHELLS.  Very very weird.  I wouldn't buy again, not worth it.

review/summary: HORRIBLE
review/text: Horrible. That is a word to describe these treats. To start, you pull one pea out of the greasy bag and you really can't distinguish which one is the pea and which one is the rice flour. Almost undistinguishable. Second, the pieces are SOAKED with corn oil, literally. Just leave the bag out at room temperature and you'll notice. The description of the product says it is OVEN made but there is no advantage if you soak them in oil!! Fake fake fake nutritional benefits. As described in the package, 9gms of fat in 1oz. it might be understated.<br />Flavorwise is average. Taste like pan-fried tempura-texture like pea, pre-soaked in Mazola oil.

If you like greasy fatty corn y cheesy cheetos then send yourself into any early grave with these green ones! You will pack on the pounds with this high fat high refined food. If you too are dissappointed with this product you may be looking for roasted green peas. Those are actually whole peas. Or just go to the produce section of your grocer and buy a pack of fresh snap peas!!!

review/summary: These are not "veggies."
review/text: There's a slightly odd taste about this product that I can't figure out from the ingredients.  These are not a substitute for veggies as some people reviewing seem to think.  They're basically a potato chip replacement and just as unhealthy but slightly lower in fat.  These are definitely "junk food" and should be eaten with that in mind in terms of frequency and quantity.  The fact that they're called peas is only because they're molded to look like peas.  Read the label!<br /><br />I won't order them again mainly because of the weird off-putting taste.

review/text: To each his/her own.  I was suckered into buying a case (and the regular ones) on a Friday sale.  I'm now trying to give them away a package at a time.  They are blended, pureed, formed into peapods, but NOT any remote resemblance of an actual green bean.  I hate them (although one of my sister-in-laws and parents have ordered 3 more cases).  Like I said--to each his/her own.  I personally hate them.  But if you like salt, perhaps you'll like these---grab a Brita pitcher before you open to sample.

review/summary: Not What They Advertise
review/text: When I bought this snack I was expecting dried snap peas, which is what they lead you to believe from the packaging. However, they are a far cry from this. They are really a smashed blend of many ingredients bent back into a pea shape. There are a few benefits like fiber and there is some sort of pea in it but overall there are still some poor ingredients in my opinion, especially when I was expecting dried snap peas. Also, the flavor was very bland. Almost like cheerios, or a stale corn puff. Somewhat overpriced too, although I bought them from the grocery store not Amazon. I wouldn't recommend them.

review/text: Okay, so I realize this isn't a real veggie... merely a veggie that's been pureed and turned into a pea pod shaped chip.  But man they are GOOD.  What's more, there aren't any bad ingredients in this product AND they're baked, not fried!  Better still, my kid prefers them to chips.  So while I don't totally win the "Make Your Kid Love Veggies" award with this snack, I feel I'm one step closer.  Oh, and I love them too!

However, this stuff is definitely one addictive snack.  In Japan it's marketed by the same company as "Saya Endou".  Not a strong flavor, just something to munch on.  Not too salty and not too sweet.  Kampeki (Perfect).  A purchase of the snack is a victory against terrorism.

review/summary: Snapea Crisps
review/text: I wasn't real sure if I would like baked snapea crisps when a manager brought me a bag. After the first couple I still wasn't sold on them but the more I ate them they are really good baked and lightly salted. Multiple managers and I tried to find these again in our local store and was not successful. One manager was told it was a promotional item to see how well they do and not sure if they would be carrying them. I go to my trusted website Amazon found them and made my purchased. These are healthier and better than reaching for potatoe chips - I purchased these now with my veggie chips in place of regular chips. It took my family time to get use to them but when they ran out of their regular chips then they start eating the snapeas and veggie chips.

review/text: I love these too much.  It's *VERY EASY* to wolf down<br />a whole bag in just one sitting.  I'm glad this is a<br />12 pack box!  I can plow through a box of these in<br />record time if I'm not careful.  They are good on<br />salads, yes, but they are fantastic right from the bag.<br />I actually eat them instead of potato chips.  Since<br />they are made from peas, that's got to be better for<br />you than potato chips, I imagine.  Even if you do eat<br />the whole bag, you will have only eaten around 300<br />calories, so it is not the end of the world.  Try<br />doing that with potato chips (ha ha).  Once you have<br />tried these,  you will want more.  Everyone I have<br />offered them to does.  Try them, you'll love 'em.

Not to oily not to salty and the appearance of a health food, they might just be too good. The ceaser flavor is a little too strong for my tastes; but that did not mean I couldn't finish the bag.
