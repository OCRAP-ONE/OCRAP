review/summary: Delicious
review/text: When I discovered that there were cookies n' cream pop tarts (and me being obsessed with everything cookies n' cream) I just knew I'd have to get these. I looked for them at a local grocery store but they didn't have this flavor, so I bought the Chocolate Chip Cookie flavor instead. Did not like those at all. Finally, after weeks of searching, I found them. These are VERY good! They definitely remind me of oreos (why wouldn't they? oreos are chocolate cookies with cream in the center, you know!) with a marshmallow-y center. These are definitely really sweet though, and I could never see myself eating them for breakfast, but they are a nice treat.<br /><br />I would recommend these to a friend (and I already have)!

review/text: If you're looking for something other than cookies on which to snack, be sure to give these a try. It's almost like eating an Oreo, but without the extra fat and with added vitamins.  They're marvelous as a pie crust too!  Not to mention, crumbled up on top of a hot fudge sundae!  Great stuff, comes fresh too, highly recommend!

review/summary: Not quite as good as the S'mores flavor
review/text: I bought these because they are a little cheaper than the S'mores flavor which I love. These aren't as good as the S'mores ones but I still would buy these again.<br /><br />Others have compared these to Oreo cookies which is a fair assesment. The outside chocolate is kind of dry and doesn't have a strong flavor. The filling in the middle has a melted marshmellow texture to it, somewhere between Oreo filling and marshmellow. They aren't overwhelmingly sweet. I like the frosting on the outside. These go perfectly with a glass of milk.<br /><br />I think kids would love these along with adults and I would recommend them. Great snack for the office, school, or just anytime you're craving chocolate. I'm a bachelor who can't cook so I'm sure I eat Pop-Tarts more than most people.<br /><br />Not bad, Pop-Tarts. Not bad at all.

review/summary: Great dog food, not full of filler
review/text: I have been feeding my dog Nature's Recipe since he was a puppy and had skin problems. I researched dog foods qutie a bit and concluded Nature's Recipe was superior for a variety of reasons including that it doesn't have excess carbs and there are lots of different varieties that have different health contents. You can purchase vegetarian, lamb, chicken, venison, etc. I buy a combination of this and the dry food for him and it has kept him happy and healthy (though it hasn't helped with his poor behavior walking on a leash ;). The issue with a lot of the other foods is that they do not have a great deal of health content in them; they contain lots of grains and other carbs. This is a bit more expensive but well worth it in my opinion.

review/text: I have heard a lot of reviews about coconut palm sugar (especially on Dr. Oz), so I decided to buy some.  Quite honestly, it has been kinda difficult finding things that I can use this stuff on or with.  I love coconut but it has a very distinct taste, which is not good in combination with some other flavors.  For the most part, this product is a novelty and has remained unused in my pantry. It isn't too expensive though and should be tried.

review/text: At first, I had to add a little raw sugar to this to kind of calm down that burnt taste (as the product was described), then I found I was okay with just the coconut crystals.  I actually got these for my husband as he has (well-controlled) diabetes and I dislike artificial sweeteners, but he had purchased a huge supply of those yellow packets and said "talk to me about it when I'm finished using these up".  So I still have some, and may be back for more.  I can see this being delicious for a glaze over a cake or flan as well as everyday beverage use which is all I've done with it.  Product arrived fast and in good condition.

Very disappointed because I thought I had finally found a safe treat for my dogs.  Guess I'll keep looking<br /><br />Update.<br />So, I sliced a pound of semi frozen chicken breasts the long way ($1.99), put them in my food dehydrator and wallah....Chicken Jerky in less then 4 hours!  I know what's in them, where they came from and how they were made. I ordered a simple electric food slicer today (from Amazon of course) just to simplify the process and will never, ever have to worry about where my dogs treats come from.

review/text: We practically DRINK this Herdez Casera - its that good! We find the CANS to be far superior to the jarred ones, tho. Sounds strange, but as others have said, its true, the cans are more authenic. It is VERY close to the fine homemade salsa found in upscale Mexican restaurants, and costs less than making salsa from scratch.  But make sure you get THIS LABEL because the "new" label is NOT the same stuff - it seems like a different recipe. We pour this in a jar and store in the fridge and have NEVER had it go bad, even for a month or more. These are large, 28 ounce cans that fit nicely in a quart (or two pint) jar.)

review/summary: Not as good as Senseo Paris French Vanilla
review/text: I bought this to replace the Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee Pods that I like to use in my Hamilton Beach 1 cup pod brewer because the Senseo brand has been unavailable for quite some time.  Unfortunately, this is not as good.<br /><br />This review is mostly for those people who like a light to medium strength coffee, not the hard-core espresso drinkers.  I drink my coffee weak -- not super strong -- but also not watery.  My daily one cup of coffee is a treat I allow myself, and I use a smaller coffee mug (holds up to 8 ounces comfortably) so I don't need a lot of coffee, but, this coffee is extremely weak (even for me) and I have to be sure to use **no more than** 6 ounces of water with this brand, otherwise it is just too weak and watery.<br /><br />I've tried using 2 pods at a time to see if that would help but, oddly enough, even with 12 ounces of water per cup the coffee comes out too strong for my taste.  Plus, I just don't need or want more than one cup of coffee each morning.<br /><br />I've also noticed that this coffee has a very "acidy" aftertaste and tends to severely aggravate my heart burn which is not normally bothersome for me if I have only one (or rarely, two) cup(s) of coffee.  I also have had this problem with 'Folgers' brand coffee (the regular loose coffee) that we use in our large coffee maker if someone other than just me is having coffee.<br /><br />If you want a larger mug of coffee, you might be able to make this work for you by using 2 pods per mug of coffee.  It's just hasn't worked out for me.<br /><br />Note:  I have also tried Wolfgang Puck's "Caramel Creme" flavored coffee and it is a bit smoother without the acid aftertaste.  The caramel creme is much more like Senseo's Paris French Vanilla, but it still only makes a 6 ounce cup of coffee.

review/text: Right from the top, let me be clear.  I probably didn't purchase this for it's official and intended purpose.  I bought it for those hotel room coffee makers where the packets they provide are usually old, stale, and may have been in the room with the previous 20 people who stayed in your room.  The little 4 cup coffee maker on the counter used 3 of these at a time in order to make a decently-strengthed cup of coffee.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt (maybe it was the coffee maker itself).  That said, the flavor was good, just not very "rich"/"bold".

Hints of spice and earth and a nice finish.  The tannins are supple and well integrated, so it makes a great food wine. I keep a few bottles on hand for parties, as everyone, including the white wine drinkers  really like it. In fact, I've had some non-wine and white wine drinkers convert to red wine because of Zinfandelic Zin.  The duo pack includes 2 bottles of the current vintage and a fun wine tote (which, I'll be honest, I kept for myself).

review/summary: Not the same candy cigarettes i had as a kid.
review/text: I have to say, either the other reviewers have lost their memories, or they did not have the same candy cigarettes that i had as a kid.  These are not the same things, they are a cheap knock off with a different taste and texture.  I am saddened by the people who thought these were the same things, that some of us remember as a kid.  Maybe they are younger than me and did not get to taste the wonderfulness of the original ones or maybe they have just forgotten.<br /><br />These imitations are just as someone else had stated on a different set of the same cigarettes.  I thought maybe since this one had better reviews, that it might be a different manufacturer selling the same cigarettes.  However i was wrong.  The other person is absolutely right.  These cigarettes do not have that chalky texture that the originals had.  Sure you may say, well isn't that a good thing.  No, it is not.  It wasn't like they tasted like chalk.  If anyone remembers pepto-bismal and how it was the only thing you actually didn't mind taking when you were sick.  You remember that flavor was very similar to the flavor of candy cigarettes.  The new texture is more gooey and chewy, which just doesn't feel the same when you eat them.<br /><br />The flavor was similar to wintergreen breath savers, but a little different in the originals and the new one is an off flavor of the same but just doesn't taste as good to me.  This product has left me completely disappointed, since i was hoping to get the same candy cigarettes i had as a kid, but am now left with 24 boxes of candy cigarettes that i do not even enjoy.  If you are a fan of the originals and remember the greatness of them, you will be hugely disappointed when these arrive.  The only way you will enjoy these, is if you never got to experience the originals in the first place and must have had these ones all along.<br /><br />Luckily though, they were under 8 dollars with free shipping from amazon, otherwise i would be demanding a refund.  I guess i will just give them out to random friends and hope they enjoy them.  I miss the originals, but now after trying these i am afraid they are gone forever.<br /><br />Also, i forgot to mention, the size of each box and the cigarettes inside are almost half the size of the original ones as well.

review/text: A blast from the past, all my friends were blown away by this product!  They were so surprised that these still existed!  Just opening the box and taking a deep breath was a scent I had not experienced since I was a child.  I've had a blast passing them out to friends, most of who are x-smokers.  They enjoyed having a "cigarette" at their desk at work !<br />Thanks for the item that has given so much joy to me and my friends!!<br />[ASIN:B000BXSRT2 World King Sized Candy Sticks 24 boxes]]

review/text: These candy cigarettes are great - exactly like I remember them as a kid.  Very fun to eat.  Not all of them have red tips, but I don't think they ever did.<br /><br />Free bonus - the case is perforated so you can fold it up into a fun display, like you might see in a store.

review/summary: Favorite candy but not happy when I received them.
review/text: These are my FAVORITE candy! I decided that, when I went to a local candy store here and they wanted to charge me $1.00 a box, that I needed to just order my own for cheaper! The shipping was very quick.<br />However, when I received them, they're all broken! I opened numerous boxes and all are in pieces. I couldn't find one full candy cigarette. On top of THAT, they are hard as rocks! Definitely not the delicious candy that I know and love. These were disgusting. I will not be ordering from here again.

review/text: I bought a box of these, excited that I would finally get to try the infamous candy cigarettes but the sender sent it to the wrong place- it had been delivered and I received the confirmation email but the mail-room that should have received it had no packages for me.  I emailed the seller that I never got my package and they apologized for not being able to help me because according to their records, it was received.  A few days later, I found the package, delivered to the wrong place- the sender told me they couldn't mail it to me again if it was sent back to them because it "wasn't covered" in the money I spent buying the candies.  Terrible, TERRIBLE customer service- if it's they're fault, they should take responsibility for it.

review/summary: Great Deal and Original Taste
review/text: These are a great deal.  They cost about $1 per box to buy at the store.  I was worried that many would be broken from shipping but was surprised that only a few packs were broken out of the 2 cases I ordered.  Not Bad!  These tasted great.  There are some other Candy sticks that I have got before that had a different taste.  They were more chewy (not the gum) and barely had a taste.  These are the good original tasting ones that I have had for at least 15 years.  They have a good hard snap to them too.

review/summary: Not the same
review/text: I was disappointed when I tried these. I was expecting a wintergreen flavor with a texture similar to the dipping sticks included in Fun-Dip, at least that's how I remember them tasting fifteen years ago. I wouldn't be surprised if the company that originally manufactured the original either went out of business or discontinued them as these were probably very controversial.<br /><br />This item tastes more chewy and chaulky and there's not much flavor other than sugar with a waxy coating. I can't help but compare these to antacids. They are also thinner and bent and look more like a hand-rolled cigarette than one that is mass-produced.<br /><br />I would like to add that even though I consumed candy cigarettes as a kid, I do not smoke as an adult. My parents and school always reminded me of the negative effects of smoking so I honestly never had an interest, but I do ironically enjoy candy cigarettes, but sadly these aren't what I remember.

review/summary: Excellent Product!
review/text: I saw these on the website and decided to have a little nostalgia party. I always bought candy cigarettes when I was little but as far as I can remember I don't think I ever got a box of completely unbroken sticks from the candy store. These came packaged very securely which is important for fragile candy, and I can happily report that not a single stick was broken. They tasted delicious and fresh(though I don't really know how one would taste for expired sugar). It was a lot of fun to have the box that folded into the little marquee. It was like having a piece of the candy store in my own home. Though this didn't bother me at all, the packages are not individually wrapped in cellophane like ones made for individual retail sale, but I could see some germophobes throwing a fit about this so I thought it would be worth noting. Overall product was perfect and exactly what I wanted.

review/summary: Awesome Candy
review/text: Candy cigarettes are awesome! These are exactly how I remember them. They come in 24 "packs" decorated with a made up brand (Stallion, Kings, Lucky Lights, etc.) but they all taste the same. Each pack contains about 10 cigarettes, with maybe 2 of them broken. But as I remember them, you would always get a few broken ones, so it's not a big deal. They are sugar sticks, like you would get with the lik-a-stick in a fun dip package. But these are way cooler because it looks like you are smoking, without killing yourself (as quickly). I live in a dorm and gave packs of these to people on my floor and few people have heard of candy cigarettes, but everyone loved them.<br /><br />This product is really hard to find in stores, and if you do you will definitely pay more. That is why I recommend this product. Happy smoking! (Don't actually try to light these on fire)

review/text: These candy cigarettes came in very useful for me in recent weeks.  Here is the problem:  Smoker's get to take an unfair number of smoke breaks throughout the day, and don't get judged for it, while the few of us making healthy life decisions are forced to work without breaks.  Here is my solution:  Buy candy cigarettes and pretend to be a smoker (works even better once it's cold outside).  48 calories in a pack, or lung cancer... you decide.

review/text: I remember being 10 years old and having these bad boys in my pocket. I would walk down to the corner store and pick some up, it was a very proud memory of mine that has been crushed by the present day purchase of this box. These sticks are only good enough for sidewalk chalk. They may not cause cancer, but it sure feels like it because they taste like they're 20 years old.

review/summary: Good complex carb breakfast
review/text: It is difficult to find a good breakfast if you are diabetic.  You need complex carbohydrates, but also something filling and a food you can eat regularly without getting bored.  I now have Grape-nuts every morning for breakfast.  Low to moderate glycemic index, filling, good to chew (which is necessary to satisfy our desire to munch), and mixes well with whatever I want to spice it up with.  I add one packet of Splenda if I am eating the cereal alone with rice milk.  However, I usually add mashed up strawberries (just a spoonful or two is all it takes) or sugar-free flavoring syrup, a banana, or whatever I find in the cupboard.  Fills me up, moderates my blood sugar, and stays with me most of the morning.

review/summary: Looks like 2-star cocoa being sold as 4 1/2-star cocoa... don't buy it!
review/text: Ordered a package of this cocoa around April 25th 2011.  It was fabulous.  Worthy of the 4 1/2 stars rating. Deep rich color.  Well sealed.  So good we needed to reorder about a month later.  So went back to same amazon site, same picture and did reorder.  This time however, upon arrival it was not same company, packaging or label (hokey looking)... Instead of "Frontier" it said "Organic Herbal Essence".  Upon further investigation I went to my Amazon history and noticed first batch came from Sold by: Bangalla Organic Wholesale LLC and second batch came from Sold by: Organic Herbal Essence.  Keep in mind that Organic Herbal Essence is the cocoa that sells on Amazon that is only rated at 2-stars:[...]  I checked and can't return it. Called Organic Hebal Essence during business hours, left message, no one returned my call.  My opinion is just slapping a tiny white Avery label on the bag with tiny print (really tiny) that says "Frontier Cocoa" doesn't eliminate the huge color label on the bag that says "Organic Herbal Essence... Dutch Cocoa".  it certainly doesn't turn a 2-star cocoa into a 4 1/2 star cocoa.  My main frustration is it is obviously a different company and different packaging, but no explaination or offer to refund. Seems like a "bait and switch".  My advice; take a pass on this one until they get it sorted out.

review/text: This is the first time I've purchased "Dutch process" cocoa, and I have to say, it is delicious! It is rich and mild, lacking the bitterness of regular cocoa powders. I bought it with no particular purpose in mind (I don't bake), just looking for ways to add more cocoa into my diet to get that great chocolate taste as well as the healthy antioxidants it provides. I've been enjoying experimenting mainly with adding it to hot beverages such as coffee or coffee substitutes. Often I don't even bother to sweeten these beverages - the mild flavor of this cocoa allows me to enjoy its natural chocolate flavor unsweetened. I even added a big spoonful to my oatmeal recently, along with everything else I normally add, and that was a treat! I'm looking forward to finding more ways to work it into my diet.

review/summary: Do Yourself a Favor...Buy it! You Will LOVE IT!
review/text: Thanks to the other fine reviews, I opted to try this cocoa powder. It is delightful. While I really like the idea of fair trade certified, without the superior taste and texture it would mean little. Fortunately, it's not necessary to sacrifice quality when purchasing this 16 ounce bag of cocoa powder. Not only is it organic but it's delicious. The texture is fine/smooth, the fragrance is everything you would expect (maybe a bit more!) and the flavor is superb....all for a price you can't pass up. Unlike other varieties of powdered cocoa, this does NOT seem to have vanilla included which makes it a bit more versatile for some recipes.<br /><br />Excellent product!

review/summary: YUCK.
review/text: I was so excited to receive my first dutch-processed cocoa powder especially after all the wonderful reviews of the Frontier one on Amazon.<br /><br />I was first apprehensive about the 'Organic Herbal Essence' - 'Frontier' mixup but when I saw a big red rimmed label with "Frontier" in green on the bag along with USDA Organic & Fair Trade mark/logos among other print, I quickly opened the bag and took out a spoonful of the powder to examine. I was slightly disappointed in the color, as I've read that dutch-processed cocoa powder had a deeper and sometimes redder color. I took out my box of natural, unsweetened Trader Joes cocoa powder and saw that the dutch-processed cocoa was darker and slightly redder in color in comparison, though not as much as I had hoped (and certainly not as deep as the picture on Amazon).<br /><br />I've also read that dutch-processed cocoa has a richer 'chocolatier' fragrance to it and so I took a whiff from the bag. To my dismay, a medicinal, acidic, spicey smell met my unsuspecting nose. I once again grabbed my Trader Joe's unalkalized cocoa powder and it smelled more 'chocolatier' than the Frontier bag. The expiration date is sometime in 2014 so I believe I either got a bad bag or this product is definitely not up to the hype. I even tried to mix some in my cup of coffee, as another reviewer had and raved about, and it tasted so.. 'off' and unappealing I had to mix in some sugar (I dont usually sweeten my coffee) and gulp down the rest (I hate wasting food and the coffee beans were kind of expensive heh).<br /><br />I'm still searching for a good dutch-processed cocoa powder, which is more difficult to find than I had hoped.. Thinking of looking into E Guittard, Pernigotti, or Green & Black next, at the recommendation of others, and Penzeys or Valrhona as last resorts (not available where I live and shipping is a killer). I'd suggest anyone looking for dutch-processed cocoa powder to skip this product and try the next option instead.

review/summary: Frontier Cocoa powder-an excellent value
review/text: This is a fairly light Dutch-process cocoa. The fat content is slightly lower that other premium cocoas, so it doesn't produce quite as lush a product. However, it has a nice balanced flavor--being organic and free trade, it's an excellent value.

review/summary: Hook and Switch
review/text: The first time I ordered this the chocolate had a good cocoa smell. It was reddish (more than I had anticipated), but when I baked it, it was a deep almost black brown. The flavor was amazing. I was instantly hooked, however the second time I ordered it I received a completely different product. The packaging was different, it came in re-sealable bags and the cocoa smelled minty, and this mintyness is transferred over to your baked goods. Moreover, the chocolate flavor is weaker, too. I was not happy about this at all. I will not buy from them again, since they send you a completely different product after the first order.

review/summary: it ain't Pernigotti... Not even close.
review/text: Thought I would try this - its cheaper than my regular - Pernigotti Cocoa. I use this as a daily hot drink, sugar and milk to taste, topped with cinnamon and nutmeg.<br /><br />I would consider this product in the same class as Hershey or Trader Joe cocoa. Nothing wrong with it, but its not nearly as good as the Pernigotti. Not as dark in powder form, not nearly as intense cocoa taste as a hot drink.<br /><br />Its just "ordinary" cocoa powder, while the Italian stuff is really special, and worth the extra price. If I was baking with huge quantities I might feel differently, but in a hot drink this is the only thing you taste, and the difference is immediate.<br /><br />.

review/summary: Very good, not sure I'd call it great
review/text: I'm really new at buying cacao products (2 years new), so consider this a non-pro review. I have discovered the health benefits of raw cacao so my family has adopted eating cacao products (70% or more) and drinking cacao drinks, specifically smoothies blended with almond milk and raw organic cacao with a pack or two of splenda.  Talk about delicious! Remember I do this primarily for health benefits as a diabetic and you should do an internet search also if you are interested in what cacao products can do for you as a diabetic. New research is promising, so from that standpoint I give cacao products a 5 star rating for health and helping in my weight loss. Now for the taste rating. I've ordered several brands from Amazon and other companies also over the last 2 years. Frontier's product is good and the most recent of my orders, but I don't consider it as good as several other brands I've tried. Too be sure, it is good, and I recommend it, and maybe for cooking it would be outstanding, but it is to me not as tasty as some of the other brands. I would not say that there is a wide margin of difference, and my wife says that this Frontier brand tastes more like the cooking variety. That may be the case. For my smoothies, this individual prefers to give this a "good rating" of 4 stars, but take one star away because of my preference for other brands.  Maybe it is the "Dutch process" thing, not sure. Your tastes may find this brand exemplary, so as they say, try it for yourself. I will close by saying again that I think this is a good product and worth trying.

review/summary: Weak flavor, boasts a great impression though.
review/text: I was so excited to try this cocoa powder, being that it is dutch-processed (smooth, non-acidic), organic and fair trade. I figured it would have a deep dark rich chocolate flavor. I make my own chocolate at home and to be quite honest, a generic grocery store cocoa powder or Hershey's renders a much more fulfilling chocolate flavor.<br />Why does this cocoa powder feel so weakly flavored?<br />3 stars because it wasn't bland, and has a wonderful impression being a sustainable product. Won't buy again.

review/text: If you're looking for a big ol' bag of great tasting powerful  chocolate cocoa at a great price,  then look no further.<br /><br />I split this with my sister who is a cookie making maniac,  and some of the cookies she made were to die for!  This time she got an entire box for herself.  Really good stuff!<br /><br />Try Cook's Illustrated Best Chocolate Cake,...bet you can't stop eating it.  It's super quick and easy to throw together.  No sickening sweet sugary frosting and just perfect.  I use this Frontier cocoa,  of course.<br /><br />BEST EASY CHOCOLATE CAKE:<br /><br />Makes one 8-inch-square cake.  Published March 1, 2009.  From Cook's Illustrated.<br /><br />We recommend using one of the test kitchen's favorite baking chocolates, Callebaut Intense Dark L-60-40NV, or Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar for this recipe, but any high-quality dark, bittersweet, or semisweet chocolate will work. Instead of confectioners' sugar, the cake can also be served with sweetened whipped cream.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (7 1/2 ounces)<br />1 cup sugar (7 ounces)<br />1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />1/4 teaspoon table salt<br />1/2 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder (2 ounces)<br />2 ounces bittersweet chocolate , chopped fine (see note)<br />1 cup fresh black coffee, hot<br />2/3 cup mayonnaise<br />1 large egg<br />2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br />Confectioners' sugar (for serving; optional)<br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray 8-inch-square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.<br /><br />2. Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl. In separate bowl, combine cocoa and chocolate; pour hot coffee over cocoa mixture and whisk until smooth; let cool slightly. Whisk in mayonnaise, egg, and vanilla. Stir mayonnaise mixture into flour mixture until combined.<br /><br />3. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth top. Bake until wooden skewer inserted into center of cake comes out with few crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes.<br /><br />4. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack, 1 to 2 hours. Dust with confectioners' sugar, cut into squares, and serve straight from the pan; or turn cake out onto serving platter and dust with confectioners' sugar.

review/text: When it came for the first time, the corner of this package was torn. Half of the cocoa powder was gone and was flying in the shipment box. I was upset, and I called the customer service, and they sent me a new one without sending the defected one (which is bothering!!)<br />I like the taste of this. I use this for drinking hot cocoa rather than baking. This tastes so mild. I mean, this is not too bitter for 100% cocoa. I like bitter taste of cocoa, but maybe it'll be a good point for most of you. Honestly, I think the taste of Ghirardelli cocoa is better than the taste of this, but this is organic so I believe this must have a better quality.(also fair-trade!) Anyway I am enjoying this with sugar-free vanilla syrup. This is a perfect way to enjoy delicious hot cocoa free of bad chemicals and high calories.
