review/summary: Easy and Delicious Pasta!!!
review/text: Great pasta! All it takes is a little mayo, about 10 min of boiling and BAM, delicious pasta! By far my favorite flavor of the Betty Crocker Past line. I definitely recommend. Also, buying in bulk like this is great. Especially with the Prime shipping savings. Only like $2 a box right to my door-step!!!

review/summary: Best Chai to date
review/text: This is probably the best loose leaf masala chai  I have tasted in the US (outside of an authentic Asian restaurant). I dont often write reviews, but if you've ever had real masala chai (and not the syrup stuff they sell in Starbucks et. al. coffe shops) you'll love this stuff ... inexpensive, high quality ... beats Teaism hands down ... I just ordered more, and I'll keep ordering more ... if you're British/European, and you're looking for a nice black tea ... this is the one xxx!

review/summary: Spicy Deliciousness
review/text: This candy is a lollipop that has sweet hard candy mango center covered in a spicy tangy chili powder. Its almost like a blow pop getting to the center you get the gum. Except there's not that much chili on these. Some of my friends growing up would scrape of most of the chili to "tame" the candy. In M&eacute;xico you can find these candy at every corner market. If you don't like spicy food, these aren't for you. But for those of us that like to have a little kick with your food then you'll love these. Now not everyone likes mango flavor.... But I've never met anyone that didn't like the watermelon flavor. They do make the lollipops also without the chili. But I rarely ever see those. The water melon is my favorite but these are these run a close second. The balance of tang to chili to sweet is perfect.

review/text: Vero Mango tastes so great and it reminds me of my childhood. I received this product really fast in the mail, it wasn't melted or anything. There are different Mango colors in the bag-Red, Green & Orange, etc. Great Mexican Candy! It's an accustomed taste. My aunt tried it for the first time and she loved it; she's a fan of spicy food. To her, it was different having a spicy coating over such a sweet candy. Try it :)

review/summary: No Mango Flavor at all!
review/text: I've had a chili covered mango flavored lollipop before and absolutely loved it. The mango flavor was also artificial but was very very mango-like and tasted perfect with the chili spice. This one, however, was a complete disappointment. The chili was oddly sour and the mango-flavored hard candy inside is completely red food colored sugar block. (The one I had before had a shade of green-yellow-orange-red.) I disposed the whole bag after trying the first one.

review/summary: I didn't know something could be so gross
review/text: Every once in awhile I like to try different food, and Amazon is a great place to find the unusual.  This time I decided to try chili covered mango lollipops.  I like spicy, I like sweet, I like mango, and so many people in the reviews loved it.  Turns out the chili part tasted dry and stale, I didn't find it in the least spicy like I thought it would be.  So I washed the chili part off thinking that all was not lost yet, and I could still have the mango center.  However, the mango center tasted like when you get a not quite ripe mango in the grocery store to eat.  It was inedible and I had to throw the thing out.  I had my mom try it as well, to see if it was somehow just me, but the face she had on spoke louder than words-Gross!  I hated it, and will be foisting the rest off at work.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />A week of the bag sitting at work, and only about half the bag was taken.  The general consensus was that they were horrible, and people wanted to know who brought them in to complain to.

review/summary: Expired Dog Bones
review/text: Amazon.com had the nerve to send me expired dog bones. I do not believe this was not the manufacturer's fault (Sergeant's). In my opinion, this was the intentional wrongdoing of Amazon.com. The packages of bones said "BEST IF USED BY SEPT 2011 (mind you, it is almost June 2012 now). Then they placed a sticker (that you can peel off) over the Expiration Date of SEPT 2011 that read "MARCH 2012," which would still be considered 3 months expired!<br /><br />How illegal and sneaky is that? To boot, the dog bones were covered in chicken...not something you mess with regarding the possibility of spoiling.<br />SHAME ON YOU AMAZON.COM<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, you should not be allowed to be in business for doing something so unethical and potentially dangerous to my dog's well-being. These bones were incredibly expensive to boot, and now I have to deal with returning them to Amazon, making sure they credit my credit card, and also deal with a third party seller for one of my dog bone order returns.

review/summary: Different flavors indeed!
review/text: I bought the mini-8 pack at a holiday chocolate show in San Francisco.  They gave a very interesting experience!  We were told to rub it with our fingers to release the oils and the aroma, smell it, break off a piece, let it melt in our mouths and note each distinct flavor that comes from each kind of chocolate (chocolatey, nutty, fruity, and citrusy).  I almost felt like I was sampling wine!  And yes, they are very similar to their descriptions even though they don't add anything to it to flavor it.  Supposedly the cacao beans come from different countries/soils and are processed differently (different temperatures and more?) to enhance the flavors.  I can't say I like any one over the other though..  It's fun to try all four and ask yourself why even though they're all made from cacao beans, they taste different!  The chocolate being vegan was a nice surprise!  I didn't realize that until I came onto Amazon to review it.  It's good chocolate (good but not as gourmet as you can get..  this is like a really nice Hershey's bar that you want to keep around and munch on to satisfy chocolate cravings).  I would say the real fun is in tasting the different flavors.  Seems good as a stocking stuffer or to give as a small gift.

Then when I moved, the vet I took her to put her on some type of allergy food. That was horrible. So I searched for food that was good. This way 1 of the top best food for dogs.<br />She's not a big meat eater. Very picky. She'll eat chicken and fish but she rather eat peanut butter all day.

BINGO!<br />The peanut butter cookies are good, but too chewy for my taste. My husband suggested a few minutes in the over. 350 degrees for five minutes made them wonderful! REAL peanut butter w/ molasses flavor in a nice crunchy cooky.<br />The pecan shortbread are simply fabulous!! I think because of the texture, some were crumbled, but I'll do crumbled any day for a cooky this good. My husband, who loves Oreos told me to put these away and keep them for myself because the cost is, of course higher than ordinary cookies. He agreed that these taste better than any other shortbread cookie either of us has ever had.

The only problem is, and it's a BIG PROBLEM, that they were shipped in a tiny, tight box and so they were all in crumbles by the time they arrived!  Had Amazon packed them in a larger box and used bubble wrap OR the plastic air bags they often package with, the cookies would likely not have crumbled.  So disappointed, because these are GOOD COOKIES.

Definitely will order this item from them again.<br />==================================<br /><br />I left above comments right after I received the case of apple juice(12 big bottles). But after we went through couple of the bottles, we found out there was a FLY inside of the just opened apple juice bottle. That is very gross,nasty and yuk!!!<br /><br />Without second thoughts we discarded the whole bottle juice and contacted the company right away by email. After exchange couple emails and because we didn't take any picture of the fly was swimming in the apple juice pool, the company said he can't replace or refund us anything. I completely understand that, this is an evidence world and honestly speaking, a bottle of apple juice doesn't cost that much of money (maybe $5?).<br /><br />But the main problem is, if there is a fly inside of the bottle, is that mean the whole container be polluted during processing by the fly in the factory? I hope not!!!<br /><br />It's not about the money issue or we try to steal few dollars from this company, it's about quality control and do you care about how does your customer feel? For people will buy cases organic apple juice that means they really focus on food safety and quality. It beyond just dollars!!!!

review/summary: Tasty, healthy, good price.
review/text: I love almonds in general, and this particular brand is quite good.  They taste great, with just the right amount of salt and oil (for me, anyway).<br /><br />They're individually packaged in 6 oz. cans, which makes them an easy and portable snack.  Portion control is also easier with the small can size.<br /><br />I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.<br /><br />Almonds are relatively healthy too - high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.<br /><br />I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA.

review/summary: Perfect little guys
review/text: Yup, no stray pieces, just whole brown almonds. Which is to say that these are not "blanched" - blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond (not the husk) and leaves a pale buff-colored product. And the description of "lightly salted" is accurate. I can barely taste it. The can says the ingredients are almonds, vegetable oil (canola, safflower and/or sunflower) and salt. That's it. Gluten-free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be "Pasteurized", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a "light" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]<br /><br />They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just-created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo-carb and gluten-free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet. I'm pleased to report that these Blue Diamond Almonds are properly dated: on the bottom of the can it says "BEST BEFORE JUL 20 14". That gives plenty of time to use up six little cans.<br /><br />And about the cans, they seem to be metal bottom and sides, making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be breachable by the ubiquitous rodent. The little cans are nicely reusable.

review/summary: One of my very favorite flavors!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.

review/text: If you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options, almonds are a great way to go.  These almonds are lightly salted and roasted.  They are absolutely delicious.  I could easily see getting in trouble with these since I could sit down and eat the whole can in a sitting and not even realize it.  I snack on them pretty much every morning to tide me over until lunch without having to eat a big meal or something very unhealthy for me.

I happen to love all of Blue Diamond's different flavors for their almonds. This flavor - Smokehouse is the best IMO. It's got just the right amount of smoky flavor to it without being overbearing. I believe this is Blue Diamond's best selling variety of Almonds. These come in 1.5 ounce packages and for me each package is good for 2-3 servings - about a handful each serving. Very tasty

Almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty.<br /><br />UPDATE -- I contacted the company and they provided a replacement. The new bag was perfect, the almonds were tasty and not too salty. It seems that I purchased a bag from a bad batch. The company was prompt at correcting the problem. I originally gave the product a 1 star rating, I'm updating the review and giving the product 4 stars.

It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity.

review/text: DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are "heart healthy" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the "lightly salted" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4" in diameter by 2 3/8" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay "openned" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.

review/text: I can't eat wheat, and it's hard to find cookies and baked goods that don't taste like cardboard, or worse. These chocolate chunk cookies are so good, even my kids beg for them. There are lots of large, chocolate chunks, and just enough cookie to hold them together. They're gluten free, so whether you have a wheat allergy or a gluten sensitivity, these work. I've tried every brand of wheat-free cookie, and these are by far the best.

review/text: Having celiacs disease...you still want you sweets and sometimes you would just love a chocolate chip cookies.  These cookies are fabulous.  The chunks of chocolate are larger than "regular" store chocolate chip brands.  They are sooo good, my kids want to eat them now instead of<br />the other.

review/summary: Best when frozen!
review/text: My family went wheat free about 15 years ago.  This is the first cookie I absolutely loved.  Yes they are crumbly which is why my family puts them in the freezer.  They taste best that way and are good for dipping in almond milk (we are also dairy free).  The only time I find my body has an adverse reaction with this cookie is if I over indulge and eat the whole box in a day.  Its been known to happen but 1 or 2 at a time and my body handles it fine.  Good luck and happy eating!

review/summary: Pretty, pretty, pretty GOOD gluten free cookies!
review/text: I like these cookies!  If you've eaten GF items before, you know that GF foods tend to be a bit more "dry" than items made with wheat flour, so GF cookies can be more crumbly.  These aren't too bad - they hold together, but aren't a rich gooey type of cookie.  The chocolate chips are nice and big.  I would definitely buy these again.

review/summary: Cross-contaminated!!!
review/text: I used to sell these cookies in my health food store.  Several years ago my celiac and gluten sensitive customers began complaining that they had reacted to these cookies.  I read the back of the box,(you should always read the back of the box) where it stated that these cookies were made on equipment also used to process wheat.  I also found that in order to make these cookies more price competitive, the manufacturer added soy flour to the recipe.  I would suggest to anyone who is celiac to look for another brand that is made in dedicated wheat free facility.

review/summary: My son LOVES these cookies
review/text: We order these items in bulk because they are one of the few cookies my 17 year old son will eat.  He loves the taste and it is not unusual for him to go through a box in one day. We started him on these cookies when we were trying to limit his gluten intake, and while the rest of his diet has returned to non-restrictive items, he keeps these cookies as his primary snack on a regular basis.<br />The only reason for a 4 rating instead of a 5 is that the cookies are not cheap, but the bulk purchase and subscription discount helps bring the cost down a bit.  There are 9 cookies to a box.

review/summary: Excellent Gluten Free/Dairy Free cookie
review/text: I've had a lot of them, but this is probably the best I've eaten.  I'm talking about Gluten Free cookies, of course.  I love chocolate chip.  Always my number 1 flavor, but most of the GF cookies are so bad, that I find no pleasure whatsoever in eating them.  That totally changed when I found this product.  I understand everyone has unique tastes, but I can't comprehend the many negative reviews I read about this product.<br /><br />The price on here is FANTASTIC by the way.  Currently under $3 per box with Prime shipping included. I think I paid $5 most recently for one box at my local grocery store.

review/summary: disappointing, dry and eggy-tasting
review/text: I've been trying a lot of gluten-free cookies, and these are one of the disappointments.  They're very dry, almost powdery, and the flavor is dominated by what I'd describe as the taste of plain egg whites.  Even the chocolate chips can't make up for it.  Obviously they're working with very little since the product is also non-dairy, but so are Mary's Gone Crackers chocolate chip cookies, and they're delicious and have the consistency of real cookies: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TRGYEW">Mary's Gone Crackers love Cookies, Chocolate Chip, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I recommend those instead.

review/text: This is not a fabulous tasting cookie, but it is better than some of the gluten-free cookies that I have had. I like to have something once in awhile without having to bake it myself. The chocolate chips are large and do taste good. The Walmart in this area sells this cookie and I would recommend buying a box there first to find out if you like it. If you do, then ordering six boxes here would make sense.

review/text: I used to have an allergy to wheat products.  I still try to eat a relatively gluten-free diet.  Therefore, I have been looking for a good cookie alternative.  These cookies are delicious.  They are slightly buttery-flavored and do not taste grainy.  While they are slightly crumbly, they are better than any gluten-free cookie that I have come across.  Definitely a recommend buy for any gluten-intolerant person.

review/summary: Not bad!
review/text: I got the chunky chocolate chip cookies. They TASTE really good, yummy flavor and the chocolate is great. Like many gluten-free desserts, the texture leaves a lot to be desired. They're very crumbly, many of the cookies didn't even make it to me in one piece, and they'll often fall apart in your hands. Not sure if the other flavors are the same, I have only tried the chocolate chip, but they do taste good enough that I'd try another flavor when I run out of these - which will take a while, I'm the only GF person in the household and six boxes of these plus some Betty Crocker GF mixes and I'm set for a while!<br /><br />I'm fairly new to gluten free baking at home, but I've yet to find many recipes that have very impressive or even edible results. Some aren't bad, but few come anywhere close to the "real thing." These might have a bad texture, but they're still very satisfying cookies. No weird tastes from the flours used. The few cookie recipes I've tried at home were absolutely horrible, but if I could choose any GF dessert, I think the (other brand) cake and muffin mixes are better than these for sure. Nice to have around when you don't feel like making your own though. For ready-to-eat GF foods, these are great.

Imagine my surprise when the new Organic Chocolate Chunk Pecan Shortbread showed up packed well enough to survive a direct hit from a nuclear warhead-not a single cookie was so much as dinged! The new packing for the individual cookie packets is amazing. The cookie packets are lined up, single file, in this long, super heavy cardboard box. You could whack somebody with that sucker and not crack a cookie. I wish ALL flavors of Pamela's cookies came packed like this. So now not only are Pamela's cookies delicious, they also show up in one piece (at least the single serving packet ones do).

review/text: I had already tried the Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chunk and thought THANK HEAVEN for Pamela!  I would be able to survive GF!  There's a slight sugar grain in the 'bite' of them but they are tasty with a nice crunch.  No artificial 'beany flour' flavor.  I even took those to a baby shower (to share with a GF cousin) I was completely in love.<br />Then I tried these.  I was absolutely shocked at how awful the Chunky Chocolate Chip cookies were.  They are tasteless with that lovely texture you've come to know and love.  I make cookies for a living and would close my doors rather than put my name on these.  I've been inspired to start working on GF cookie recipes as soon as my Christmas rush is over.<br />As far as the 11 good reviews - if you've been GF for a long time or think Chips Ahoy are great cookies - you might like these just fine, otherwise, go for the double chocolate ones:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZH19U">Pamela's Products Organic Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chunk Cookies, 5.29-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: I just found out that I have Celiac Disease. I bought these at a local supermarket really excited that I could  have a cookie after 2 months of no bread or cookies and was very disppointed. They had no taste. I tried to mask it with Vanilla Ice Cream but it didn't work so I tossed them. Maybe the pack I got had been on the shelf too long not sure but I did not like them. I realize that things made without wheat are going to taste differently and maybe I need to get used to that but I really can't eat these..

review/summary: Great Cup of Coffee!
review/text: I am very picky about my coffee.  I decided to just start trying a bunch of different coffee roaster's coffee and see if I could find the diamond in the rough.  So far this has been a favorite.  It delivers a darker roast without the bitterness.  I would say it is just a bit lighter than your French roast bean.  For the price it's worth a try!!

review/summary: good coffee
review/text: I'm a bit of a coffee snob, but for the price of these beans I had to try them. The beans look great: dark and oily. Just brewed my first pot and it's good. It's not super strong, and maybe that's because this is "Gold Cup" (I'm not familiar with all of Cameron's roasts), but fresh out of the pot it's still tasty. Not my favorite because I like a stronger kick, but for the price this is a fantastic buy. Haven't let it sit in the pot for too long yet so we'll see if it turns into gas station coffee in half and hour, but hopefully not.
