review/summary: So Good and fresh tasting!
review/text: I bought this because I am on Weight Watchers and didn't want to give up PB. Only 1 WW point per Tblsp. I love the roasted, fresh taste.  There isn't anything funky tasting at all. It's just roasted peanut powder and a very small amount of salt & sugar. You just mix it with a little water.<br />It would be really good mixed with honey but I eat it with apple slices.

review/text: I love PB2.  It mixes easily, and you can vary the consistency to your liking.  I liked mixing in extra water to make it like a pudding.  I bought a whole case, but the problem is that I liked it too much - I could eat a jar in about 3-4 days!

review/text: After reading the reviews (and trying the walden farms calorie free kind...gross!) I didn't have very high expectations for PB2. I was very happy to find that it was much better than I thought! I am a peanut butter addict, so it won't replace the good stuff... but it really is an awesome product.

review/summary: Great addition to protein shakes
review/text: This is good stuff.  I have not reconstituted it and tried it as spreadable peanut butter and I doubt that I will, BUT I am mixing it with CLICK Espresso Protein Drink, Mocha and Vanilla Latte (14-Servings in 16-Ounce Canister) mix for a fabulous protein drink.  Even if you come across a fleck that has not dissolved in the mix instead of a burst of yuck on your tongue you get a burst of peanut butter!  Unless it was a burst of chocolate, I cannot think of how that could be better.  I've only tried the "plain" PB2, but have the cocoa PB2 on order.  I've gone from having nothing palatable in the way of protein powders to 2 wonderful products that I found on Amazon--PB2 and Click.  Check them out!!

review/summary: A fantastic product for a Peanut Butter lover that needs to cut Calories
review/text: I had seen this on Amazon and wanted to order it but was appalled at the shipping +cost of product, but put it in my wish list cart. Later I was at the store and found a different no calorie peanut butter and took it home and tried it and found that it was chemically tasteing and i threw it out. My husband bought me PB2 as a stocking stuffer (seeing that it was on my wish list) and I tried it that day and was AMAZED at how good it was at such a low calorie count. I mixed mine with water as per the directions and ate it with a spoon it was so good. I am fully intending to give up full-fat peanut butter for this as I need to watch my calorie intake. I am going to the Bell Plantations website to order a full case. It's THAT good. I plan on adding some to my morning protein smoothies and experimenting with stir-fry....but just off the spoon and on a PB & Jelly sandwich has been so good. My husband even says it's good...and he hates ALL diet food type stuff. Just try it once....you may love it.

review/text: I use powdered peanut butter for cooking and smoothies. I'm not as crazy about it for PB&J, but it definitely works for dishes like Thai peanut sauce and peanut butter pie while saving calories. However, the cost of a small jar of this stuff is ridiculous! I buy 2.5 pounds of it for $13.90 with $4.49 shipping on ANY amount. Just do a search for Honeyville powdered peanut butter. The stuff will last 5-10 years sealed in the #10 can it comes in.

review/summary: Great full-fat pb substitute
review/text: If you're like me, then you LOVE peanut butter so much that you can't really keep it in the house.  The 'real' stuff is so full of fat and salt and hydrogenated oils that its yumminess comes at a pretty high cost.  PB2 is a great alternative.  It's not exactly the same taste as a commercial product, but it's close enough that when you put with the other things you would normally eat you will not notice much of a difference, and if you do, just imagine how much fat you're not eating!<br /><br />One of the great advantages of this product is that you can make it whatever consistency you want, just by altering the amount of water you add in the mixing process.  I find that makes it a very versatile product for cooking when I want to make a peanut sauce, or when I put it on apples and want it a bit thicker than the standard ratio delivers.<br /><br />Also, the fact that is has to be mixed up short circuits the spoon-to-mouth pattern that made it impossible for me to keep the 'real' stuff in the house.<br /><br />The only real down side is that because it's a powder there is no 'crunchy' version, but I suppose you could chop up peanuts and mix them in if you wanted to.

review/text: I grew up eating whatever peanut butter had the lowest calories, so I'm used to the taste that some people complain about. I've been adding a tablespoon of Skippy peanut butter to my protein shakes and this stuff has 1/4th of the calories and I don't notice a difference in taste.<br /><br />This stuff is -very- fine. Practically peanut dust. You won't find any chunks of peanut in this stuff and it's really easy to pack it down. I'm afraid to see how much my jar will compact down to because I might feel a little ripped off.<br /><br />But this stuff is great! As soon as I opened it I sprinkled a spoonful into my mouth - dry! It tasted just like peanut butter and had the same texture as smooth peanut butter. Good stuff. Really wish it was cheaper though!

If you are used to eating natural PB, then you will likely appreciate this product a bit more. I bought this yesterday out of curiosity, and it is quite delicious. I LOVE PB, but try not to eat too much because it is so calorie dense. I like to get my healthy fats through nut butters, but some days you want to spend your calories on other foods. THis is GREAT to put into a protein shake or smoothie without adding 200 calories and I just had some on my lightened up french toast (low cal bread, egg whites & sugar free syrup) and it was delicious!

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: I saw this in a segment on a television show about foods to try if you want to cut fat and calories. I decided to try it by first ordering a small jar. It is very easy to mix (two TB powder with one TB water) and this  makes two TB of  creamy peanut butter and is only 45 calories. (I think REAL peanut butter is about 190). I was amazed  and very pleasantly surprised with the authentic peanut butter taste and consistency. Two TB is plenty to make a sandwich or a topping for another food. I even had my husband try it, as he loves the extra chunky, fat-filled kind. His words...."not bad!" He won't be eating it, but he doesn't need to watch his waistline anyway. For someone who does, it's a great substitute.  I just ordered a large bag!

It tastes great, is not gritty, and the best party is 2 TBSP of this stuff is VERY low in points and calories. I highly recommend this!

review/summary: Not a substitute in taste
review/text: I really wanted to like this product. I really, really did. Having to cut back on fats and sugars, this seemed an ideal product for me. However, I just can't cope with the flavor. Mixing the powder with sugar free jelly produced a water mess that seeped out the sides of my sandwich. Plus, the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the little bit of jelly I threw in, despite using two heaping tablespoons of powder. Using it on its own, mixed with water, produced a consistency that was more what I'm use to encountering with peanut butter, but again the taste was lacking. It tasted like an echo of a slightly burned roasted peanut. I'm sure the product is a great one for what it is, but I just can't see using it as a substitute for non-powdered peanut butter.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because the texture,when mixed with water, has a nice consistency, and it was very finely ground which made it easy to mix. I also think that it would be great for baking...maybe for rolling truffles in to give it a powdery hint-of-peanut coating.

review/summary: So Good why isn't it Bad???
review/text: After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the "bowl" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called "netrition.com" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food. Netrition is a whole lot better!

review/text: I was, at first, very skeptical about this product, wondering what peanut butter sans the fat would possibly taste like. But a friend of mine suggested it and said it was really good, so I decided to give it a try. Since I love peanut butter, PB2 is really helping me stay on my lower-fat diet, since I can use it just like "regular" peanut butter. It's great for those times, late at night, when you want a snack--just mix it up and smear it on an apple or a banana--very satisfying, and for very few calories, too!

review/summary: Better than peanut butter
review/text: PB2 is a GREAT product.  I love peanut butter but I don't love the fat so I never buy it.  PB2 is a powdered peanut butter to which you just add water.  You can add a little less or little more water depending on the consistency you want.  It tastes just like peanut butter but has only 45 calories for a 2 tablespoon serving.  What's not to like?

review/summary: Amazing!!
review/text: When I first tried this I was skeptical, I mean powdered anything doesn't sound too appealing. But I have to say I was pleasantly surprized by how much I really like this peanut butter. It doesn't have any "weird stuff" in it and it actually tastes like peanuts. I cant say it tastes exactly like jarred peanut butter but it is very good. At a difference of 45 calories vs 190 calories for same serving size...it's well worth it!

review/text: PB2 turned out to be a pretty good alternative to peanut butter. Although its definitely not as sweet it still tastes good on PB and jelly sandwiches and overall I thought it was pretty good. Its no Jiff, but if you are trying to cut back on calories it's a great substitute.

review/summary: Awesome low-calorie alternative
review/text: No, it's not peanut butter. Yes, it's an all-natural 45 calorie snack and it tastes AWESOME!<br />For everyone who's watching their calories, this is the answer. If, like me, you've been denying yourself peanut butter all this time or adhered strictly to the 2 tbs rule. Now you can eat, and then eat some more.<br />I brought this to work and had my colleagues try it. One person said he didn't like that the consistency was different from PB, which it is. All others loved it.<br />Would I rather dip my spoon into a jar of Teddy's? Of course. But since I can't I will be buying PB2 by the boat load from now on!

review/summary: PB2 terrific for Weight Watchers
review/text: I have been on Weight Watchers since June 24th of this year and have successfully lost 35 lbs. The one thing I missed was peanut butter!! It is very costly on the weight loss system that Weight Watchers established, Points Plus. When I saw it on Dr Phil's show, I was curious, ordered it and was I HAPPY. Mixing it with water, the recommended serving is 1 point, regular peanut butter can be as much as 5 points. When using sugar free jam or syrup to mix the powder in, the taste is wonderful and has the consistency of peanut butter, thanks to whom ever developed this product,for someone like myself, trying to get healthier,well this is just a blessing. I encourage anyone who is a peanut butter lover like me, and would like to have the taste without all of the fat and calories, GO FOR IT.

review/summary: Awesome product, just wish it were cheaper
review/text: It's really hard to believe how good this tastes for just 45 calories. To put that into perspective, 3 Tbsp of normal peanut butter is ~ 280 calories. The 5 grams of protein in it is just a bonus. I put it in protein shakes with a lot of other ingredients [...], and the taste still shines through and really improves the overall taste of the shake.<br /><br />The only downside to it, if there is one, is that it is pretty expensive. Even if you buy the 12 pack at $70 with prime, that still works out to almost $0.40 per serving, which is pretty steep for peanut butter. However, if you are on a diet, this is a very calorically efficient way to get some solid flavor and a few grams of decent quality protein.

review/summary: Not as tasty as regular PB, but a good low-fat substitute
review/text: I love peanut butter, and I bought this product in an effort to save some fat, while keeping the protein.  Truthfully, I don't think it's that great on its own... I mixed a little with water to make a peanut-butter-like paste, like it said, and ate it on whole-grain toast.  The flavor just isn't the same as regular peanut butter, and the texture was a little gritty.  For this, I'd rather just use a tablespoon of regular peanut butter - with such a small amount, it isn't much fat anyways.<br /><br />However, the PB2 powder is MUCH better in a protein shake or smoothie because it mixes with the other ingredients and provides that hint of peanut butter flavor.  I think it also might be alright if you made it in to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Either way, it is a great substitute for peanut butter, if you can get past the fact that it doesn't taste exactly the same.  I'm going to try and get used to it!

review/summary: Good, but missing something
review/text: I had very high expectations once I opened the box.  There was one problem that may have affected the taste, the seal was open when I unscrewed the lid but I was hungry at the time and didn't really care.  So I mixed up some peanut butter and gave it a try.  It is truly very peanutty and the texture is somewhat strange, not quite creamy or chunky.  I find that it is best mixed with the real stuff, or when it is mixed using milk instead of water.  Overall it is a good healthy product, just not addictive like the real stuff is.

review/summary: The diet answers you're looking for!
review/text: I really never thought I could find a PB substitute this amazing.  I have heard about this one for some time and found out that it was sold locally so I picked some up today.  I chose to try it first as the package suggests, 2 tbs of PB2 (45 cal) with 1 tbs of water.  I found it to be thick, creamy, and very good.  It has everything I enjoy about peanut butter except for the oil.  I just love it.  The possibilities for this stuff are endless.  You can put it in shakes, yogurt, mix it with jelly or honey, anything you like.  I have tried the Walden Farms Zero Calorie version and Better N' Butter in the past, but this really makes the cut.  It's great stuff.

review/summary: Excellent low-fat peanut-butter powder.
review/text: I mixed 1T of PB2 into 2T of sugar-free preserves and made an open-face PBJ sandwich, which was lovely.  (Yes, the "contrast" of peanut butter and jelly is not the same, but the taste is really quite good.)  I have also added 1T to a CLICK protein drink (Vanilla Latte), and it was also very good.  I plant to add plain PB2 and the chocolate PB2 (which is also delish) to a banana smoothie over the next couple days.  The Thai noodle recipes on the manufacturer's web site are also very good, but, as with any other recipe, you need to play around with it a bit to find the heat/salt level that works for you.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I don't find PB2 to be too salty, nor do I think it has an aftertaste of any kind.  The texture of it when mixed with water is not exactly like that of regular peanut butter, but then it wouldn't be, given that it doesn't contain any oil.<br /><br />Bottom line: I love PB2 (and chocolate PB2), and will be ordering this product again--either from the manufacturer, or Amazon.

review/text: I love peanut butter! I decided to purchase this product to try and cut a serving of regular pb in half. My favorite way to eat pb is a couple tbs. mixed into oatmeal with vanilla soymilk. So good! With PB2 I was able to use the 2tbs serving for 45 calories and then add only about 1 tsp. of regular pb(as some fat is a good thing-keeps you fuller longer)and it tasted great! Would be a great addition to the diet of someone watching their weight. Though it is obviously not as delicious as regular pb-it is a smart,quality product.

review/summary: Excellent where you wouldn't expect it
review/text: This was recommended to us from a friend at weight watchers as a lower fat peanut butter alternative. It works very nicely for that: Mix with water and you've got yourself a spreadable peanut-butter that's much lower in fat and pretty satisfying.  But we've also used it a couple other ways that have been fantastic.<br /><br />Making chocolate covered peanut butter balls (Buckeyes): Use some of this instead of powdered sugar to increase the peanut flavor and reduce the oversweetness of some recipes.<br /><br />Take a teaspoon of it and add to chocolate ice cream.  It's excellent.<br /><br />This is a great product not only as a low fat peanut butter option, but also for many different desert recipes (and maybe some non-desert recipes).

It's great, and a lot less fat for those who would like eat to peanut butter more frequently than its natural fat content allows. It tastes like a natural peanut butter brand, not like a Skippy or Jif. I like to add 1 teaspoon of honey to it sometimes. Be aware that 1 serving of prepared PB2 is not the same amount as a TBSP of peanut butter, it is a little less.

review/summary: WAY healthier than regular peanut butter & tastes great!
review/text: This stuff is amazing.  Simply comparing the nutrition facts with any regular peanut butter immediately shows you the extreme difference in fat.  I know, I know, fat from nuts is supposedly "good fat," but you still don't want too much of any type of fat in your diet.  PB2 essentially gets rid of the fat you don't need.  As I understand it, the peanuts are crushed down and the oil is soaked out of them.  Then, the remaining powdered peanuts are packaged up with a "seasoning" of salt and sugar (the ONLY other 2 ingredients in it) and you have PB2!<br /><br />To reconstitute it, all you do is add 1 tablespoon of water to 2 tablespoons of the powdered PB2 and mix until you have peanut-butter-consistency.  It really does taste just like peanut butter.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not afraid to say something tastes nasty when it's trying to be healthy.  He loved the taste and was even happier afterwards when I showed him the back of the bottle compared to our regular peanut butter bottle.  This is especially great for any baking recipes that call for peanut butter b/c we all know how difficult it can be to make those cookies and other sweet things "healthy."

review/text: Being that I am on a diet, ( As of Aug 19,2010 I have lost 94 pounds) I am always looking for good protein and low calories, fat, salt and sugar.  I learned about PB2 on a web page where I can log my calories, and exercise. I ordered my first pack direct from the factory, but then found it here on Amazon and get it faster than from the factory. PB2 is only 45 calories for the same 200 calories found in most peanut butter, and it is the same 2 tbsp serving. This is great just as a snack if you love peanut butter like I do. It comes in a powder, and you simply mix 2 Table spoons of powder with one Table spoon of water, stir until thick and enjoy how ever you want. Worth the money!

review/summary: strong chemical smell
review/text: Came packed in mylar bag that is typical of the frontier products I buy. But upon opening the bag it reeked of a very strong chemical smell that completley overpowered any of the sweet smell of nutmeg, I thought it smelled just like insecticide. Was immediately turned off.<br /><br />I went ahead and grated some up. It still smelled awful to me, so I compared it to some preground nutmeg I have in my cupboard for probably at least 8 to 10 years. The preground still smelled great, especially when compared to what I had just grated.<br /><br />So I took about 15 of the nuts and scrubbed them with scrubrush in hot soapy water, rinsed, dried, and then stored in new fresh storage container. They definitely smell some better now, but I am so turned off, I don't know if I can even try to actually use them. Yuck.<br /><br />I'm sorry I wasted my money.

I highly recommend this product, especially if you are using the pre-ground nutmeg from the grocery store.

review/summary: Super Fragrant, can't wait to use in more recipes!
review/text: I ordered this last week and they were promptly delivered.  The Nutmeg seeds were a little smaller than those that I've used in the past, which I think is better because I can store 2 or 3 in my microplane nutmeg grater.  I tried this on coffee only so far and it was great, I ended up using so little that I had a lot left over.  I probably could have just run it across the grater two times and had enough for the mug of coffee.  A little goes a long way with these seeds.  I attribute this to the good quality seeds and also the effectiveness of the grater.<br /><br />You know you have a good quality product when you open the bag and the strong fragrance fills the house.  I'm telling everyone I know about these because it is such a waste to use pre-ground store-bought nutmeg with very little flavor.

However this tea had this boldness with a twist of Apricot, which I enjoyed. It is great to break-up a routine of always just black and have some additional flavor to it, and this tea is the one.

review/summary: Unparalleled Taste & Quality
review/text: I've always liked Grape Juice- I didn't have it often, but liked white grape juice best, tending to prefer extremely sweet things. White grape juice & apple juice are near-universal bases for juice-blends, as they're bland & cheap to produce. Reading about their high sugar content & relative lack of vitality/food value, especially in comparison with heart-nurturing purple grape juice/wines, I decided to try darker juices.<br /><br />Welch's Concord Grape Juice was nice; Juicy Juice was OK; generic juices were generally not bad, tho of course they might not actually be juice but re-confabulations of concentrates plus high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). I've noticed over the past few years that HFCS tends to make me feel draggy; more recently, high fructose corn syrup's been implicated in our nation's widespread obesity, no pun intended.  "Great, thanks, now ya tell me"... at least I know now!<br /><br />Kedem Concord was available at my local warehouse store, price comparable with other juices, and a label check said it was made of Concord grapes, with some Concord grape concentrate, no HFCS. With one swallow, it was clear to me that this product was distinctly superior in flavor, texture, non-obtrusive sweetness and tartness, and bloomin' wholesomeness than any other grape juice I've ever had. It has body, a velvet touch to the tongue, and many more dimensions than just one jolt of flavor. It's a genuine food, not a slug of sugar & color & liquid as currently so many so-called juices are, like a pre-mixed kool-aid that needs refrigeration.<br /><br />I'm far from wealthy & rarely buy treats (yep, even with the obesity!), especially juice, since actual fruit's better for me: more complete, cheaper, etc.  I am regularly buying Kedem Concord grape juice though.  Balancing dollars & quality, after again running my own consumer comparisons with other purple+/or concord grape juices, Kedem's still got it far, far over the other drinks available to me. I truly wonder what on earth could account for such a vivid difference.<br /><br />I still hate spending the money- it's good when cut half-& half with cheap raspberry lime seltzer, good mixed with other fresh & store-bought juices, good in cereal instead of milk (OK, an acquired taste, but I don't drink milk well), great mixed with nutritional (nicer than brewer's) yeast.<br /><br />I do have to include a caveat, tho, as it's preserved with Potassium Metabisulfite, which some might have reactions to, esp. asthmatics like myself. Man, am I fortunate NOT to have experienced any reaction to the Kedem Concord Grape Juice that I like so much!<br /><br />Yep- I likes it! And I whole-heartedly recommend it!

They must not put any in the chocolate itself, however, as there is only 50 mg. of sodium per serving (two servings per bag).  These chocolate rounds are an excellent way to indulge yourself.

For royal icing make sure it's dried for 24 hours before you paint it, or it will pit.  One note, it doesn't work well on chocolate.  The silver luster dust covered nicely, but the gold just didn't look right.  You couldn't get it on thick enough to look like gold.

The ham was OK, nothing to shout about, but it was good. I thought that the meat was coming boneless, but that was a blessing because the ham bone made for some excellent bean soup after all the meat was consumed. I would order again. One big plus was the speed of filling the order, and the rapid delivery. It was originally stated that when shipped it would have a window of 8 days to be delivered. it was delivered 4 days after I ordered it.  I was impressed, and so was the Wife.

review/text: My aging 9 year-old Maltese has always suffered from skin problems due to varying ingredient sensitivities. I've tried so many brands of food trying to find one that will work for her. Even low fat prescription diets from Hill's, Royal Canin contain ingredients like chicken, beef, or wheat that cause her to itch.  According to our vet, to be considered "Low fat," the formula should generally have no more than 6% fat.  Since the fat content of this product is around 8%, I mix it half and half with fresh veggies and fruits.  After a 30-day trial, her cholesterol levels are now normal.

review/text: I normally like Assam teas, but this is pretty bland -- the flavor is simple & shallow.  There's no richness, earthiness or depth.  Considering that this a pound bag of the stuff, if you buy it there'll be a lot of boring tea to slog through (or throw out).<br /><br />One reviewer commented about the paper package impairing retention of flavor.  FWIW, while the outer bag is paper, it's plastic-coated on the inside; it may not be a hermetic seal, but it's adequate.  Based on my experience, if you're spooning single servings, you can probably expect the wire fold-closure to break halfway through the bag, so have a clothespin around.

review/summary: From Tetley's to Assam Banaspaty !
review/text: I was drinking lots of tea from the local Jewel, Tetley's British blend. So when I saw this I thought it was an opportunity to try something better. Indeed its a lot better tea, does get strong nicely and I use skim milk. It tastes much better obviously than the Tetley in a box, its full bodied, but it did not have a refreshing taste.<br />The reason I say that is I was drinking some other Assam team from a store in Cleveland(Teavana) and that was very refreshing, full bodied. Likely it wasn't organic. Obviously the price at Teavana for a few oz. was a lot more per oz. than the Banaspaty tea, so it has that going for it.<br />The Twinings are pretty good, likely they have their own tea-estate, but my guess is the tea-estates vary in flavor.<br />But, hey, remember where I came from, Tetley's bags to Assam Banaspaty. Big leap for me.

I like mine strong with a couple teaspoons of honey, organic sugar is great as well. It makes a good cup of iced tea and it does get milky when cold so just be aware of that. I recommend this tea to most anyone. If you have this first thing in the morning, be sure to eat something with it.

review/summary: Weak; little flavor
review/text: I decided to try this tea based on the description and reviews, but found it weak, with little flavor. For reference, I like my tea very strong and normally buy the Davidsonas English breakfast tea.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I had high hopes for this tea, but I have to agree with the reviewers who called it bland. I normally drink Twinings Ceylon OP, English Breakfast, or PG Tips, and those are all much more flavorful. Even using twice the tea I don't get as strong or dark a cup with three minutes of steeping. The tea itself looks fine and seems appropriately packaged. Davidson's seems like a great company (check out their website) and has lots of organic and Fair Trade teas, so I'll give them another shot with a different variety.

review/summary: Disappointment
review/text: I was sadly disappointed in this brand of Assam tea. Once properly brewed, the tea was weak. When I brewed another pot, I added more tea, in the hopes of making it drinkable.  The second pot was weak, and bitter.

review/summary: What I hoped for
review/text: Good flavorful tea.  Organic and tasty.  Stands up to some milk or to drink plain.  I love loose leaf teas and this is an easy way to find a good one.  It's nice to have it come in a 1 lb bag.  The bag is a self closer zip lock one, but it doesn't really work once you open it.  I just use chip clips or put it in anoterh container.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Not so Hot
review/text: It was neither fresh nor tasty.  Perhaps if they wrapped it in an airtight container it could change my opinion but by the time I got it it tasted as if it been lying around gathering dust.  The flavors of the tea didnt matter because they were overshadowed by the other factors. Had high hopes but had to toss it all out.

review/summary: It is okay ... I'll drink it....  but won't buy it again
review/text: Perhaps just this batch... not a flavorful tea.  A milquetoast quality.  I like a robust tea so this may be my own misunderstanding of how this blend is supposed to taste.  I'm glad I tried it.

review/summary: Tasty. Not 'bland', but not as strong as other Assam teas.
review/text: This Assam tea is delicious, and a good deal, especially for organic and fair trade. I will say that I expected it to have a bolder flavor, which I am used to with other Assam teas I have tried. It has the same flavor characteristics of other Assam teas - it just doesn't brew dark and strong even with a lot of leaves in the infuser. That said, I am enjoying this somewhat more delicate Assam tea a lot, and the price was right. The listing promises "fair trade certified" and "certified organic", but the label on the bag doesn't have any fair trade certification. Hopefully the advertising is correct.

review/summary: I am not a tea snob
review/text: But, I have tried some other teas to find something to replace that awful Lipton junk that I have been using for my iced tea for years. What I do know is that it has great flavor in iced tea, better than anything else I have tried (although I haven't tried any of the other Davidson teas). Tastes like dirt? That reviewer needs a taste bud tune-up.

review/summary: Davidson's Bulk Assam Tea
review/text: I found Davidson's Banaspaty Estate Assam tea to be a very good Assam at a very reasonable price. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I've had better but at more than twice the price. Davidson's is the hands-down winner on value. This is the second time I've purchased it and I intend to buy more in the future.

review/summary: An excellent tea
review/text: It was a pleasant surprise to learn that one can buy loose tea on Amazon, though I admit to a degree of trepidation because I had never heard of Davidson's Tea before. Their catalog of available teas is quite large, and it quickly became a matter of choosing teas for now and saving new teas for later, because their descriptions are both interesting and helpful. Their packaging is good; delivery was timely; but the real test is - how does it taste? I enjoy the full-bodied flavor of Assam, and this is an excellent tea. I recommend it highly to other customers, and I will be re-ordering when this lot has been happily consumed.
