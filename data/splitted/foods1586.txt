review/summary: Very warm and spicy
review/text: This is a very strong, spicy cinnamon tea, great for cold days.  However, you do need to really like cinnamon to enjoy this tea.  I find I have to be in the right mood for it, as it can be overpowering.  In contrast, I have a friend who LOVES it, and just bought her 2nd box of 50 bags of this tea. It's well-blended, but it's serious about its cinnamon.

review/summary: Great Storage Unit!
review/text: I love this product. Before, I stored my little K cups in Zip Locs or boxes. Now I just go directly to my Keurig, which sits on top of the drawer. It is great. The only issue is, that if your Keurig had has the cupboard above it, and the storage drawer underneath it, the coffee maker sits too high to open the lid, so you have to slide out the unit. So think about where you are putting them.

review/text: I had a storage tower that held 24 capsules and a storage rack that held<br />several boxes of coffee capsules.  Then I saw this device and decided<br />that it was the best alternative because I could stack my Bunn coffee maker<br />and my Keurig coffee maker on top of the storage drawers and not lose counter<br />space.  Works absolutely great.  Wish I had seen this first and saved the<br />money I spent for the other devices.

review/summary: Great system, fits perfect
review/text: This storage system works perfect in our space. It fits the k-cups and gives us perfect easy access to our cups as we need them. The only thing that you need to keep an eye on is your clearance from your counter to your cabinets. I had to pull my maker out a bit from the wall to make sure I could open the top of the keurig machine. If i didn't do that, I would never be able to open it enough to put the k-cup inside. That's the only draw back.. but then again, for the convince you get out of the drawer, it makes up for it.

review/summary: Great accessory
review/text: The price of this unit was a good bit cheaper then other similar Kcup organizers.  I bought it because of all the good reviews, and am very happy with it.  It's very sturdy, and it looks good.  Like some have mentioned, it won't work directly under our cabinets, it makes the coffee maker too high to open.  But we have deep counters with a lot of space so I just pulled the coffee pot out far enough for clearance and left it there.  It will hold 36 cups.  However, if you have a lot of the same flavor, (and you don't need to read the label) you can put the cups in alternating cap up, cap down, and get 6 more in.  If you set the coffee pot a little to the left or right of center on the unit, there is some room for sugar, small tea boxes, or whatever else you may want to put there.  You could also put 5 rows of coffee cups in and use the last row for sugar packets, tea bags, etc......

review/summary: DecoBros� 36 K-Cup Storage Drawer (ACTUALLY HOLDS 42 K-CUPS)
review/text: This DecoBros� storage drawer advertizes it holds 36 K-cups, but it actually holds 42 Keurig K-cups, if you put one up and one top down into the rows.  It would be nice to place it on my counter with the Keurig coffee maker on top, but alas I know my cabinets sit too low.  I use the carousal to hold my K-cups on the countertop.<br />I needed something to store my extra coffee/tea k-cups on the shelf in my pantry.  The two storage drawers ($14.99 each from Pretty Star Store and fulfilled by Amazon) fit perfectly stacked on my pantry shelf and I even have room on top to store several different size boxes of plastic zip bags, foil, waxed paper and plastic wrap.  The drawer slides out easily and tilts slightly so I can see the back of the rows.  I would recommend these drawers for on the counter or in the pantry.  They are sturdy, well built and have a nice rubberized top (which keeps the items stacked on them from slipping off).

Many of my family members have the same type of drawer but paid more. Holds just as many pods and just as sturdy. You don't need one made out of stainless steel because of the weight of the pods. Perfectly happy with this item.  The coffee machine sits right on top of the drawer nicely.

review/summary: Great product! I bought 4!
review/text: The coffee drawer is the perfect "pedestal" to showcase your Keurig brewer. I gifted the drawer filled with 42 K-cups to 3 close friends/family members and they absolutely loved it! The packaging says it fits 36 K-cups but you can fit 42 if you alternate K-cups right-side up, upside down in each row. K-cups are easy to access and you can get your morning joe even faster! LOVE this! The seller also had a good price and shipped quickly.

review/summary: It's great, but together, they're too tall
review/text: I didn't even consider the height of the combined drawer Keurig machine combo when I ordered. But we have to pull the two out from under the cabinetry to place k-cups in the machine. Not that big of a deal, but it typically sits in the middle of the counter instead of tucked nicely against the back.<br /><br />The functionality of the drawer is fine. It opens, closes and holds k-cups. Shipping seemed extremely fast. Very pleased with that service.

review/summary: K-cup drawer
review/text: Great product of solid build and quality. I don't imagine this unit breaking with normal adult use. Only problem I can see with the unit is it does not contain smooth rolling wheels, the fact you cannot fill it from front to back without pulling the tray completely out, and the lack of you being able to take the foam pad off to wash. All these are minor problems that a swiss designer can solve for an additional $70 purchase price. If you are looking for a nice way to store those k-cups without spending $70+ this is a wonderful long lasting unit.

The pad on top prevents any heat at all from entering the storage area.  I've never felt even the slightest temperature increase as a result of using the toaster oven!  This order from Pybriefs store on Amazon was my second one of these. I have stacked the 2 for more storage.  Pybriefs store shipped it VERY quickly and had the best price that I could find.

I put our toaster there for more room in our corner counter space.<br /><br />Holds a good amount of K-cups so you aren't always refilling.

review/text: I got this to put under my Keurig coffee maker, and it has been wonderful in clearing up the clutter in the area. The coffee pods fit well in the tray, and it looks exactly as it does in the photo. The only problem is that the Keurig occasionally vibrates on the tray when it starts up. This is easily remedied by securing the silver part of the Keurig overflow tray (the base part you put the coffee cups on) with a little tape or just removing the overflow tray completely.<br /><br />The seller was great - I got the item fast and in perfect shape.

review/summary: Morning coffee
review/text: Morning coffee just got a whole lot easier with this Keurig K-cup organiser.  I have been wanting one for months since I saw them in Bed, Bath & Beyond, but got a better price here on Amazon.  Made of metal mesh welded/soldered over a metal frame, both the outer shell and the drawer are very sturdy and do not wiggle at all under the weight of the Keurig machine when we use it.  Each of the 6 rows holds 6 K-cups with room to spare.  We also use the refillable cups- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZCSAEO">Solo-fill Reusable & Refillable K-cup� for Keurig� Brewers</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">Ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> - and they fit into the rows just fine, too.  There are hard rubber "feet" on the bottom corners to protect your counter tops, and a covering on top to protect the unit and prevent spills from getting into your drawer.  I tested this by accidentally spilling water onto it when I was refilling the Keurig, and it just puddled there without seeping through, so I didn't have to scramble to wipe it up right away.  It's easy to clean.  I put the drawer into the dishwasher (but didn't put it through the heat dry cycle), and sprayed the framework with some all-purpose cleaner, rinsed it in the sink, and laid it on a towel to dry.<br /><br />Seller shipped fast.  It arrived 2 days before the estimated delivery date.  Packaging was perfect for the item.  All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase.

review/text: A great storage solution for those less than convenient k-cups.  The key here is that your k-cups are right at hand. The platform serves as a sturdy base for your brewing machine and the unit itself is a substantial metal construct, not a flimsy plastic deal by any means. Caution though for you perfectionists, the drawer itself is a bit hesitant to fully open.  Matched with a showy k-cup carousel this accessory makes a great addition to your k-cup countertop ensemble.

review/text: This drawer is a great space saving idea for k-pod storage. Our machine is on a very small counter next to the fridge. This drawer allows storage of a good number of pods without taking up much more space than the footprint of the machine itself.<br /><br />Tip for heavy drinkers - to get one more pod per slot, invert every other pod in the line. If you notice, that's how many boxes of pods are packaged.

We use it to store our K-cups and place all of our coffee accessories on top of it.  It still functions, but is not as convenient as I had imagined when it was purchased.

Everything at one's fingertips without having to rummage through cabinets. Other smaller units were available but this gives one flexibility to store several product types at a handy and functional space. I cut a plastic place mat to fit the top for easy clean up of spills.

review/text: I bought this storage drawer to go under my Keurig Coffee pot to help de-clutter my kitchen counter. It's a great product! I like the rubberized mat that is on the top. It is easy to clean and neat looking.  Great transaction with the seller too!

review/summary: Sturdy, no surprises
review/text: This drawer for k-cups works well so far. It's sturdy enough to support the weight of my Keurig Special edition. Keep in mind the height of your kitchen cabinet, once you set your machine on this drawer you may not have room to open the kcup compartment without pulling the machine away from the wall. Great product, fast delivery. Thank you!

review/text: It fits perfectly under my Keurig Coffee Machine! It actually holds more than they say if you turn the pods back and forth instead of one way.

review/summary: Storage
review/text: Saves on space and storage of coffee, but it is quite a bit wider than the coffee maker itself so it takes a little more space than necessary.  However, this is fine because it holds 36 K-cups, which is great.

review/summary: k cup drawer
review/text: I love it.  It's convinent and saves space on my counter.  I like that I can put my favorite coffee and others and keep them seperated. The only thing I have a problem with is, if I put the coffee maker on top of the drawer it makes the coffee maker bump the top cabinet when I open it.  I would suggest measuring your cabinets before you buy the drawer.

review/summary: Perfect solution!
review/text: I have a small kitchen with little counter space and this drawer is great.  So much more convenient than storing all the K-cups in a cabinet, too. I couldn't use it under my  B60Keurig machine only because my old upper cabinets are too low to accommodate opening it while underneath. (If the holder slid out the same way as the drawer I would have kept my appliance on it.) But I did place it under my mug tower beside it and hardly lost any counter space. And the price was great, too!

review/text: The drawer opens and closes easily.  I saw some reviews about my Keurig not opening because it is underneath the cabinet.  I had the same problem but just pulled out the Keurig and it's good to go.  The price is also reasonable and am glad that I ordered it.

review/text: I'm very happy with this product.  One thing that did shock me was how fast I received it!!  I have it filled with all my flavors and one row for various creamers.  Everything is in one area.  Love it.  I'm also getting a second one for my desk.  Not for coffee, but for pens, pencils, markers, etc.  I don't like those stand-up containers.  The dark mesh design matches the rest of the desk items and I can put other things on the top of it.

review/summary: Great solution for storage of Kcups
review/text: This coffee storage drawer is very well made and holds allot of K-cups. One of the things I like the best is that it doesn't take up much space because it is right below the Keurig coffeemaker. I took the advice of another reviewer and store the cups in an alternating fashion of one right-side up and the next one right-side down so you can store more cups than if they were all upright. I am very happy with the quality of this product and also like that the drawer has a stop on it so it won't fall out of the surrounding base.
