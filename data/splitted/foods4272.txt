review/text: Celiacs need to have GF bread but I'd like to at least have some bread with eggs and milk because it would improve the taste and textue of the bread.  This bread is dry and very small.  Not large enough for a sandwich. If I'm in a hurry I'll get a Chick-fil-A grilled chicken club without the bun and add my own bread.  Can't do that with this bread because of it's size.  Also, have to add more condiments than I normally would because it's so dry.  However, it DOES make wonderful toast and I've made garlic croutons with it.  This bread also stands up well for carrying out when you might be traveling.  I toast some slices, stick them in a ziplock bag  and can use it that way.  I'll probably purchase this product again, however, if Ener-G reads this please make the bread more moist by adding eggs, milk etc. and make the slices/loaf bigger.

review/text: I subscribed to get this product monthly cause I would save a substancial amount of money since me & my wife DO enjoy our coffee.Everything was going smoothly until after about 2 months when I got a notice that they could not deliver this brand to us anymore(Maxwell House Lite Coffee)No reason was E-Mailed to us or anything.I had to write Amazon an EMail asking them to explain to me what had happened.They said something like the company didn't want to participate anymore ?<br /> So the service was good while we were getting the shipments, but the communications of not telling us earlier weren't there.I feel that they(amazon)should have informed us about the plans to stop thw shipments.Why subscribe if it's only for 2 months?I'm disappointed on that.For some reason,it's hard to find Maxwell House Lite.

review/summary: Decent quality for the price, but not the best
review/text: It's difficult to find ground vanilla beans locally that don't have added ingredients, so it's nice that Amazon has a couple of brands to choose from.  I tried this brand because of the generally positive reviews and the relatively low price.<br /><br />I must say that while I think this product is good, it isn't great.  I had a little bit of ground vanilla powder left that I had purchased at a local store a year or so ago, made by Madecasse.  (I see that Amazon has a listing for whole beans by Madecasse, but the ground beans seem to be no longer available -- even on the manufacturer's website -- and some Amazon Marketplace seller is trying to get over $100 per ounce for it!)  I must say that the Madecasse beans, grown in Madagascar, have a better aroma and flavor than this brand.  This brand, grown in Papua New Guinea, is a little harsh in both aroma and taste when compared directly to Madecasse's product.  Note that I only felt this way when doing a side by side comparison, however; with more time separating the two products, I quite enjoyed the aroma and taste of these beans.<br /><br />Since I seldom bake anymore, my principal use for vanilla beans is to put a little bit, along with some sweetener, in some Greek yogurt.  Delicious!

review/text: I have really enjoyed using this product. It really is a great product for the price. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because this vanilla powder is a very dry powder. Other vanilla powder I have used is not as dry and actually clumps a little bit and is darker in color which leads me to believe a drier product may have been more processed. This vanilla powder adds an excellent flavor to anything that you are making though and for the price is a great choice.

review/text: Excellent ground vanilla. I wanted pure vanilla that had no sugar which was difficult to find but here it is. It tastes great. I sprinkle it on yogurt, use it for baking, or sprinkle it on cereal. If you're used to the sweet artificial stuff, this isn't for you. But if you want a natural unadulterated vanilla taste, you'll love this ground vanilla.

review/summary: Good Eating If You Are A Bird
review/text: When amazon debuted its grocery store, product choice was quite limited and so in order to take advantage of the discount offered if one bought a certain dollar amount of goods, I included this in my cart.<br /><br />My breakfasts tend to be cereal because the meal is quickly prepared and there is no mess. I like cereals with a lot of fiber, but I also like honey and almonds so I chose Bob's Red Mill Granola, Honey Almond. Well, this is great eating if you are a bird but unless my taste buds have been destroyed by decades of eating spicy food, I detect little of the flavor of either honey or almonds. I am not implying this tastes bad, it does not, but its sorely in need of something to jazz it up. My choice for that has been fresh berries.<br /><br />Blandness aside, I do think I got value for my money as the price is hard to beat and I will get many mornings worth of nutritious meals from it. So if you don't mind your cereal a little on the bland side, this isn't a bad choice. But next time, I'm going to look for a product with more flavor.

review/summary: Hooked on Honey Almond and Bob's Red Mill
review/text: Before I begin, I should make it clear that I am not a fan of breakfast cereal -- or even breakfast in general.  I don't care how much the nutritionists wail and gnash their teeth. Breakfast is not the most important meal of the day in my book. Give me coffee and kick me to my desk, please!<br /><br />But for Bob's Red Mill Honey Almond Granola, I make an exception. I would eat this as a cereal seven days a week from now until Bob's Red Mill runs out of oats. It's not too sweet, not too crunchy, not loaded with ingredients I don't know or can't pronounce (or both), not too hippie, not too yuppie, not too sun-drenched fields of happiness commercials.<br /><br />What's in it?  Oats, honey, canola oil, almonds and vanilla.  That's it. That's plenty.<br /><br />How to serve it? That depends on your schedule. Out of the bag and into the right hand, on the run - that works if you're in a mad-dash hurry. Right-handed? Use your left hand to catch the granola. Ambidextrous but drive a stick shift? Use either hand.  If, however, you prefer milk on your cereal instead, use a bowl.  And a spoon. And wait until you've parked, please.<br /><br />Not in a hurry? Pour a few ounces into a bowl, bury it in water and nuke for 2-3 minutes. Voila - almost-instant hot breakfast.<br /><br />Need a snack? Grab a handful out of the bag.<br /><br />Hate raisins like I do? No worries! There aren't any of those pesky little former-grape critters to pick out and destroy.<br /><br />Love raisins? Add 'em in! They'll be right at home, whether you're serving your breakfast or lunch granola or snack hot or cold. Amazingly versatile product!<br /><br />So Bob's Red Mill, employee-owned Oregon Nirvana, has moved yet another person closer to a healthier lifestyle. They're to be commended, not only for having some of the best granola on the planet, but for holding to the highest standards of product quality and customer service known to mankind. Yep, I'm a fan of both their granola and their corporate mindset.

review/summary: I guess I'm in the minority here, but
review/text: I really liked this granola. Yes, as that one dissatisfied reviewer said, You can't see any almonds in there, but really? Did you expect to see whole or half sliced almonds in there?<br /><br />I think the granola tastes good. It tastes crunchy and sweet ( but not overly sweet). I think that sweetness is the honey, and the slight crunchiness is some of the almonds.<br /><br />I use this granola as a topping on my plain yogurt, in my smoothies, and as cereal. I really like to use it as cereal because it fills me up and it tastes "refreshing" and it's healthy. I'm a college student, so if I'm short on time I eat the granola as cereal or in a strawberry-banana smoothie.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this granola. Since I ended up loving this granola, I recently bought it again and bought some yeast & bread flour from Bob's Red Mill so I can bake my own bread.<br /><br />I'd recommend potential buyers to try this granola. I did, and I really like it! :)

review/text: I have tasted many ginger beers in my time, because of this I was looking for a healthier alternative. I found this diet ginger beer by Regetta with the hopes of it keeping the sugar and calories down while quenching my ginger beer sweet tooth. I have to say that in the first part of the question it passed with flying colors but it failed miserably in the second. The sugar and calories are almost non-existent but it sacrifices the most important factor for this point and that is taste. Their is almost no ginger "tang" and very little carbonation to boot.<br />Still looking for a better diet ginger beer replacement.

review/text: This green Matcha tea has wonderful healing qualities. This is the first time I have experienced this kind of tea. It is interesting when mixed until foamy as instructed. Similar to foamy, hot spinach soup. I tried it with honey, and with milk and sugar, but prefer it plain.

review/text: Just back from Cayman. Pretty pumped that I could buy it here. However, this fruit punch in Cayman is pink...this fruit punch (same label) is a dark yellow (like an apricot nectar). Best by date is 6 months away. Not sure why its different. Even the drink on the label is pink. It doesn't taste the same either.

review/summary: Good idea, but fall short
review/text: I do like the energy blasts.  The coca-cola flavor is by far my favorite.  But here is the catch!  I was racing the Xterra Mountain Championship course last year and i tried popping one in my mouth and i nearly choked.  These are great for right before you start a race when you aren't winded.  Once you start, they are almost impossible to chew and breathe at the same time.  Great energy, but difficult to chew!  Also, then the weather turns cold, they go rock hard.

review/text: The PowerBar Energy Blasts chews really help out when riding a bicycle.  It is very easy to burn calories fast during rides and the Energy Blasts chews help to fuel your body to get you through.  I will eat 2 to 3 at a time about every 15 minutes.  This helps keep my energy up, so that I can keep my pace at an intense level.  They are easy to eat during the ride and are quite tasty.  Just remember to chew them thoroughly, as it could be easy to accidentally choke on them.

review/text: I really like these chews a lot - particularly the raspberry flavor. Good amount of chewiness, and the flavor center is not like a gusher or anything gross. Not sticky at all, which is a big complaint against Gu Chomps and Honey Stingers chews. My only complaint is that they do get super, super chewy when they get cold and they are kind of high in calories. Having 1.5 servings in a bag is not the easiest portion amount either, particularly if you only want to down half a serving. But this is a very technical complaint, and the flavor and product itself is good.

When I returned home I felt of the other packages and they all seem to be the same way!!  I have ordered other products like the GU CHOMPS and they weren't melted together, so I was very disappointed on my ride to have to eat all my energy blast in one massive blob!!

review/summary: Needs reengineering
review/text: I've been using gel a few years for running since they really are an important adjunct to the sport, but boy do they get old after awhile.  One of my coaches aptly described them as both "essential" and "gross".  Kilowatt for kilowatt, these blasts are more expensive and bulkier and do take more time (if that's a concern) to consume, but they don't leave you second-guessing your lifestyle either as they are "yummier" and more palatable.  A big downside is that they require way too much chewing, enough that it really interferes with my breathing trying to eat these while running.

review/text: I recently took a pack of these chews and it worked pretty well. I went out on a 16 mile run and pulled out the chews early on in the run. I love the taste of the raspberry but the chewing is impossible! I tried to chew it enough to get the gel to come out but it was impossible. So I just ended up swallowing it whole after failed attempts at chewing. Other than the chewing, the taste is great! Training for the Marine Corps Marathon 2012!

review/summary: Power Bar Strawberry Banana Energy Blasts
review/text: Ok, so I haven't really been using these for their intended purpose, which is to have them during a workout or before a workout.  But they're working for me as a soda replacement in the morning.  I need the energy quite frankly and weaning myself off the soda is hard to do.  But these help a little.<br /><br />I absolutely love the flavor of these strawberry banana chews.  They really do taste like strawberries and bananas.  You bite in through the sweeter outer layer and get to the gooey gel filled center which is where the strawberry flavor seems to come from.  And they're addicting.  I can easily put away a whole pack in just a few minutes.  My favorite part is the gooey gel center.  I always love getting to that part.<br /><br />The ingredients are actually really good for something that is essentially candy.  Flavoring is natural, sugar is real sugar.  There's real fruit juices in there and the color is made from carrot and elderberry and a few other natural products.  One pouch is 190 calories, which makes sense since it's geared towards the workout and running crowd.  Actually PowerBar is the official sponsor of IronMan, although not the Ironman superhero, but rather the intense grueling athletic event.<br /><br />For the energy part, it doesn't give me tons of energy.  But it's enough to keep me out of my lack of soda slump.  And I'm sure for runners and other athletic events it provides a good amount of calories and sugar boosts that are needed during an intense workout. But let's be honest, they taste good enough to eat as candy and if you need the extra calories, these will do the trick.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy these again, and hey, if I keep training for Warrior Dash, I'll probably use them for their intended purpose eventually.  A great product that gives a little bit of extra energy.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: These little gels are indeed very tasty, but I'm not sure I'm convinced of their effectiveness as an energy source anymore than say some Good 'n Plenties or the fruity kind of those are. The ingredients/nutritional gains are about the same. If you are looking for some good energy, I'd go for the gels or bars. However, these are really good so maybe there is some psychological pick-me-up in them at a minimum, and really, isn't that the main thing we need anyways?

review/summary: Powerbar Energy Blasts Lemon
review/text: Ok, so I've had some of the other flavors from these PowerBars before.  And I liked them.  But then I tried this lemon flavor and blech.  It just did not work for me.<br /><br />The flavor actually was somewhat reminiscent of a lemon cleaner.  It just didn't taste like natural lemons at all and the gooey center was even worse.  It was sickly sweet to go along with the fake lemon flavor and I just couldn't enjoy them.  I managed to eat them all in one quick succession, but I didn't enjoy it.  I guess one good point was that it was kind of lemon zesty, so if you like that type of lemon flavor this may work for you.  But I like my lemons to be somewhat sour, with just a hint of sweet, kind of like a good lemonade.<br /><br />The ingredients in these chews aren't too bad.  They're designed to give energy, so there's quite a bit of sugar and glucose in them.  The flavoring and colorings are natural and even though I kept commenting on a fake lemon flavor, it is actually real.  So who knows what happened there.  There are 190 calories in this packet of gummies.  Which is a lot. And the sugar content is 35 grams, which is also quite a bit. This is designed to go with a fitness regimen, and not for just snacking on like you would a fruit roll-up.  Granted I haven't been using it for it's intended purpose, but I thought it might give me a little extra energy.  Which at this time I'm on the fence about, because I'm still awake, but I certainly don't feel like skipping around.  So maybe it's just enough energy to keep me going through the day.<br /><br />Not my favorite flavor.  I'd go back to another flavor of these, but certainly not this one.<br /><br />Review by M.

We could always find Botan Calrose rice in California and Utah, but since moving to the East coast, we have not been able to find it. We've searched all the foreign food markets (and there are a lot!), but my lovely wife is pining for a taste of home. One day it occurs to me: world wide web to the rescue! Sure enough, within a few minutes I found a supplier who offers a bargain. 50 pounds of rice?!? With 2 daughters, 2 sons-in-law, and 5 grandchildren living with us, it's half gone already. Packed well; shipped quickly, and I love meat pies over this rice!

Lotus purchased one, patented it, and began producing the spread in 2008. Other companies followed. Lotus brought a lawsuit and lost the first round. There's nothing like cookie drama! I've tried 3 different brands, Lotus brand stands out as the most "cookie-like" and creamy.<br /><br />In Europe? Look for Speculoos Crunchy Spread. This one has 66% Biscoff cookies in a courser consistency (think: crunchy peanut butter). Not available yet in the USA. Worth an airplane ticket to Belgium to buy!<br /><br />Biscoff Spread, a fantastic turn toward the delicious!<br /><br />From: Best Anywhere Reviews

review/summary: thankfully you can order this one jar at a time
review/text: I'm glad you don't have to order twelve jars of this at once because I don't think the elastic in my pants is rated for that kind of thing.<br /><br />This does taste exactly like the cookies, which if you aren't familiar, tastes sort of like if you peeled the crust off a really good cheesecake, then made that into frosting and - voila! - there you have Biscoff Spread.<br /><br />One hundred percent ridiculously awesome.<br /><br />02/05/12 Edited to add: ummmm, considering the title of this review please *don't* ask how I know this but as it turns out you can order multiple jars of this from seller Vitacost and the shipping charge remains the same, reducing the overall cost per jar.<br /><br />Strangely enough ordering in multiples conversely increases ones waistline measurement.

review/summary: A delicious & different treat!
review/text: I was lucky enough to discover Biscoff Spread  (with smudged labels) at the 99 cents store and decided to give it a try since I am such a fan of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40">Biscoff brand of Belgian speculoos cookies</a> that they have served for many years on Delta Air Lines.  It's an odd concept, a spread made of cookies, but I'm glad that I didn't let that stop me from trying it.<br /><br />The label says that this is a "European alternative to peanut butter."  I completely disagree as it it only has the look and texture of peanut butter.  It smells and tastes just like the Biscoff cookies, but sweeter, with a hint of caramelized sugar and cinnamon.  It is much more like dulce de leche than peanut butter.<br /><br />This spread is good with ice cream; on pancakes, scones, and apples; or just eaten from a spoon as a nice treat after a meal.  A thin layer even salvaged the plain graham crackers I bought by mistake instead of the cinnamon honey variety.  It would also be good on cupcakes, waffles, or popovers.  Eating it on toast doesn't appeal to me but maybe with raisin bread it would be good.  It really is tasty and hard to resist, especially with milk or coffee.<br /><br />The basic recipe for Biscoff spread is speculoos cookies, canola oil, and sugar so it's not particularly healthy.  Each tablespoon has 88 calories with 52 of them from fat.  On the bright side, a tablespoon only has 33 mg of sodium.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Biscoff 57% (wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oils [one or more of soy bean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, palm oil], soy flour, brown sugar, sodium bicarbonate, salt, cinnamon), canola oil, sugar, soy lecithin, citric acid.

review/summary: Yummy dessert treat, I keep the jar in the freezer
review/text: Recently, I bought a jar of this after having dental surgery when I was limited to liquids and mush foods for 2 weeks.  I had never tried Biscoff spread before but I wasn't disappointed.  Lemme tell you, Biscoff Spread made the 2 weeks bearable, but I went through the jar in about 3 days, taking tiny amounts of it off a dull butter knife because I couldn't really open my mouth much.  It doesn't have protein like peanut butter does so for me it won't be a pb replacement... for me, Biscoff is a dessert treat.  A super fantastic treat.  I'm going to buy these as stocking stuffers - If you like cookies and you like the consistency of peanut butter, this spread is very good.<br /><br />Biscoff spread is amazingly tasty but it isn't health food, as I'm sure you've noticed if you've ever looked at the nutrition label.  =)  But everything in moderation, right?  I'm one of those people who likes a bite of sweetness after a meal and this spread is a wonderful, rich treat.<br /><br />*Update*  I bought a 2nd jar locally the other day but this time it wasn't as thick and it was rather greasy feeling in my mouth, and it dissolved in a second so I didn't get to savor the flavor of it much.  I realized that we were now keeping the house about 6* warmer than we were just a couple of weeks ago and this temperature change was enough to alter the consistency of the Biscoff spread... a 74*F house was too warm.  I now keep the jar in the refrigerator (edit: I now keep the jar in the freezer, it's even better! and because I have to basically chip it out of the jar, it slows me down when eating it so I can't shovel spoonfuls of the stuff into my face), and found that I really like the spread when it's cold (I eat it straight off a spoon, I don't spread this on anything).  So if you happen to try Biscoff spread and you think it's greasy and isn't as thick as you like, it may be because your house is a bit too warm... try keeping the jar in the fridge or freezer.

review/summary: This stuff is addictively good
review/text: If you've ever had those free cookies (Biscoff cookies) on a Delta flight, you'll know what these taste like (if you haven't, you seriously need to try one next time you're on Delta). This is the spread version (basically they just take biscoff cookies and pulverize them), and it's absolutely delicious! The flavor is a little hard to try, you've just got to try it. I have never met anyone who doesn't like it once they've tried it.<br /><br />This is also called speculoos spread and is originally from the Netherlands. If you live in NYC or am visiting sometime soon, you can also try this spread (but a different brand) on waffles from the Wafels & Dinges waffle truck. It's fantastic.<br /><br />I personally like to toast 2 pieces of bread and spread Nutella on one and Biscoff spread on the other for a delicious breakfast. I might try baking with it sometime (though it seems strangely circular to bake with a spread made out of baked biscuits).<br /><br />The only downside is how expensive this is (though Amazon is the cheapest place I can actually find it). A little bit of Biscoff spread goes a long way for me, but I had weekend guests over once that ate more than half the jar. Trader Joe's also has it's own version but I haven't found it or tried it yet. Most likely it's possible to find these at a speciality European market somewhere.

review/summary: Delicious -Nut- Butter Alternative!
review/text: This is the one time I get to be thankful for the peanut allergy - I am forced to branch out and try new butters! This is the best one I've found to date. It beats out any (peanut free) almond and sunflower butter on the market, has a better consistency than coconut butter, and even a slight edge over the chocolatey goodness of Nutella.  This has a bit more of a sweet taste than actual peanut butter (which pairs perfectly with fine dark chocolate, I might add) yet it still worked out well to make "ants on a log" - the original version being something my peanut allergic daughter has never had. My whole family willingly eats this delicious spread by the spoonful!

review/summary: Sinfully delicious
review/text: I discovered this spread in a local gourmet store before Christmas when I was checking out Nutrella and trying to see what its nutrition info was. I picked up the Biscoff Spread jar and found it to be less calories and fat than Nutrella, so I bought a jar. I didn't anticipate that I was about to start a new addiction. I love the taste. It takes just like eating a rich cookie. It is fairly sweet and has a smooth, peanut butter-like texture.<br /><br />I didn't want to put it on a salty cracker and didn't have any plain/neutral biscuit type crackers and I didn't really need to add the calories, so I developed the habit of just eating a spoonful of it when I needed a little treat or dessert. It would be good on a plain bagel or English muffin, but it is just great to have a spoonful by itself once in a while.<br /><br />I came to Amazon and found a good deal and bought several jars and gave them out at Christmas. Then I tried to take one to my sister and my jar got confiscated at the airport security check!  I was so upset. They considered it (same consistency of peanut butter) a "gel" and took my lovely gift away.<br /><br />When I got back from my trip I came back to Amazon to order more and found the best deal -- buy it here through Vitacost for $3.70 a jar. Shipping is $4.99 - no matter the quantity. Much better than the $9 plus a jar from the other sellers and Amazon Prime. I just ordered 10 more jars for a total of $41.99. They make great gifts. I can't imagine anyone not loving Biscoff Spread - unless they absolutely hate anything sweet.<br /><br />One tablespoon is 89 calories and 6 grams of fat, lower than peanut butter and most days just one tablespoon is very satisfying. Give it a try and you too will be hooked. The jars are fairly small, so buy more than one at a time or you will be sorry!

review/summary: Crazy Good For Me, But Maybe an Acquired Taste
review/text: If you live in the US, you're probably most likely to have eaten Biscoff cookies if you travel by air.  The cookies seem to be an in-flight snack on a number of airlines, and on both international and domestic flights.  The first time I tried the cookies, they were straight from the apron pocket of a flight attendant on a discount airline, warmed by body heat, and broken.  In short - creepy, and they became the butt of jokes.  I was surprised to see them again on a "normal" airline, and gave them another try.  At first, I didn't like them, but later decided they were delicious with tea... a mildly sweet cookie with a bit of a spice flavor.  I then noticed them in my local grocery store, and was once again surprised... I assumed these were some weird brand only sold wholesale to airlines.  But no, they are available for the masses, and available under another name in Europe.<br /><br />When I saw Biscoff spread in my grocery store recently, I couldn't resist... given my history with the Biscoff cookies, I found the idea of a spread amusing, and I bought it as a novelty item.  But it was delicious!  It's more accurate to say that the consistency is that of Nutella, not peanut butter.  It doesn't have the stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth consistency of peanut butter, and like Nutella, it melts in heat.  I like to eat this on a cinnamon raisin English muffin, but I have to let the muffin cool quite a bit or else the spread will become so runny that it runs all over the place.  The spread tastes just like the cookies, but perhaps more sweet, and it has somewhat of a "powdered sugar" texture - a very, very, very fine grit (which I like.)<br /><br />I've only eaten this plain and on English muffins.  But, I could see this used as a frosting or icing on a cake.  Its tendency to thin and run when heated would make it an excellent icing.  I could also see it heated and poured over vanilla ice cream.  Careful... it is perhaps less nutritious than  Nutella, which is not very nutritious, depite being marketed as a good alternative to peanut butter.  I would not make this a part of my daily breakfast... I just eat it on occasion.  I think it will be an acquired taste, but addictive once you acquire a taste for it!

It should honestly be called 'alternative to Nutella'.  This stuff tastes like smooth cookies, which is what it is.  I was happy to see the only allergens are wheat and soy, so I can eat this without my toddler being exposed to any nut products yet as we haven't introduced them into his diet of yet.<br /><br />We have had this spread on toast, with apples (yummy), and any other place you'd use Nutella or a nut spread.

Personally, the taped lid/jar was excessive.  Because they were gift items, I had to remove each one very meticulously.  Alas, some of the labels ripped and I could not used them as gifts. Use that extra packing tape around the clear bag for more security, and leave the product untouched! Thanks

review/summary: A sweet vegan friendly nut-free peanut butter alternative
review/text: I looked several weeks for a vegan friendly alternative to peanut butter with a different kind of flavor. Three hours ago, I found just the thing I was looking for! Biscoff Spread has a sweet carmel like flavor, with the same amount of sugar as peanut butter, less than 90 calories per serving, and it's all natural. The manufacture is based in belgium, and I know very little about how it's processed, although I've heard soy based products in the US are overly processed so, if it's similar to the way chocolate's processed... I'm thrilled to have found this spread!<br /><br />One word of caution... If you decide to have more than the recommended serving size, I strongly recommend having something to balance out the flavor. It's delicious by itself, but when I had two heaping spoonfuls of it... It was too rich for me to handle without adding a bit of something tart as a berry or bitter as tea.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I liked this spread so much I decided to share it with my Facebook friends, and the people following me on twitter(and that was the first time I've ever felt inspired to recommend a packaged food item to more than a couple people!) along with this review.

review/summary: Very Happy Dog
review/text: And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.

review/summary: Great grains!
review/text: This is a review for the Keysands Live Organic Milk Kefir Grains (Tibetan Milk Mushroom), which is what previously linked here and is being discussed by other reviewers...<br /><br />Like one of the other reviewers, I also purchased two brands of kefir grains at relatively the same time from Amazon. In my case, I ordered these from Bulgaricus and also grains from Lifetime Kefir. I am a fan of both grains, though they produce kefir differing in flavor and consistency.<br /><br />The  Bulgaricus grains arrive in relatively large quantities, allowing one to consume the kefir produced after only one "healing / restoration" batch.  The grains are relatively thick in diameter--allowing even courses mesh strainers to be used without worry of too many grains passing through. The kefir produced is rather creamy and fairly viscous.<br /><br />Lifetime Kefir arrives in a very small quantity, and it takes about a week to set up.  The grains themselves are extremely tiny, and even after a month or so of cultivation, the individual grains remain small in diameter. The kefir produced by Lifetime Kefir is stronger in taste (acidity) and somewhat less viscous when compared to Bulgaricus.<br /><br />Another reviewer here was complaining about the curds being thick and (perhaps) overly grainy.  The  Bulgaricus kefir curd does separate substantially from the whey.  I like this, as it allows me to remove the milk serum prior to pushing the curds through the strainer, and thereby to effect a thicker, more yoghurt-like kefir.  Leaving the whey in and re-mixing it with the curds, will yield a thinner kefir drink if that is what you are after.  By contrast, I find it harder to get thicker kefir from the Lifetime Kefir grains when I want it, so I appreciate having both varieties around to process in different ways.<br /><br />In the end I find the Bulgaricus kefir to be a fine strain!

review/summary: Acceptable Kefir but I like Lifeway Better
review/text: I don't really know anything about the different companies that are selling Kefir.  Just for fun, I purchased Milk Kefir Grains from Keysands and from Lifeway.<br /><br />I have made 4 batches of Keysands Kefir.  These batches did produce a drinkable beverage.  The 4th batch did seem to be getting somewhat thicker than the previous ones.  Overall, the Kefir from Keysands has been more sour than the one from Lifeway.  I do understand that the flavor may change over time.  I will say, though that the replication of the kefir has been impressive.  Even in such a small number of batches, I have significantly increased the number of Kefir grains I own.  Excellent!<br /><br />I feel like the Keysands Kefir is a little more "touchy".  If I let it go just a bit too long, it separates aggressively into curdles.  But if I remove it prior to this point, so far the product is a little bit thick, but not overly impressive.  But I do feel like I have to watch it a lot more, and be home to catch it when it is "done".  I have now put it in the refrigerator, and am working with the Lifeway Brand.<br /><br />The other brand immediately produced a much thicker kefir, and the curdles were very fine.  Even within two batches of the other brand, I had a thick and smooth result - that didn't need any monitoring or doctoring.  The flavor of the other is, so far, more mild, and the increase in grain size a little more slow.  However, I feel like the other brand does not need to be "babysat".  It is OK if it sits a little too long, because I won't end up with a useless pile of super thick milk curdles.<br /><br />Pros:  Rapid increase in number of Kefir Grains, Produces a drinkable - slightly thick beverage with (so far) a fairly sour taste<br />Cons:  Curdles too easily and needs more monitoring, has not yet produced a very thick beverage (although it may with more time/effort - the con being that it is taking more time/effort)

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.
review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/text: Despite the photo showing 3 bundles of chews, if you order this item you will only get one bundle of under 50 chews.  Too pricey for me - I returned them and will order something else.

review/text: You don't get much for $15.97, that's for sure!  And, to make it worse, for some reason the dogs don't like them--have given them to four dogs who LOVE rawhides, but these just sit.  I should have returned them.

review/summary: Nice quality
review/text: This product is perfect for dogs between 7 and 20 lbs.  Small enough for my 7 lb Chihuahua (the treat is halved) while the entire stick is fine for a 17 lb Rat Terrier.  These treats are made in Columbia according to the packaging, and the product doesn't have any chemical odor that I can detect. The product description is for the "Natural Cuisine" item which does not include the 2 darker color products in the same picture. It's a nice product which I enjoy giving to my dogs.

review/summary: Beefeater rolled chews
review/text: Beefeater products are made in china. I was fooled when there site info said it was USA rawhide. The first one I gave my Bull terrier, made her sick with diarrhea. I threw away the rest of the package. Please buy only the USA made chews for your pets. They don't have the chemicals & the hide is much thicker & doesen't flake & and break off in little chunks. But , please supervise your dog when they're chewing any rawhide, toy, etc. As they can get a large piece caught in there throat.
