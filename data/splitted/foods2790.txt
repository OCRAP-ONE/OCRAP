review/summary: Not tastey
review/text: I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.

review/summary: Great food for cats
review/text: My two cats love Science Diet. Only problem is I wish they would have a picture of the food on the outside of the bag. There is the dry which is tan, triangle shaped and the other is a dark brown,round shape. I always end up buying the wrong bag and the cats only love one.

review/summary: BAD, do NOT buy!
review/text: Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling "corn gluten meal" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google "U.S. Patent 5,030,268" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.

review/text: I got this product for my girlfriend as she has had trouble getting a good sourdough starter going. She prepared the mix as instructed and it was bubbling in no time. She followed the directions about feeding, etc and made a loaf a few days after she started the mix. I'm a southern fella so I don't know how authentic her bread is compared to the San Francisco sourdoughs, but I think it is great. Makes good bread with a nice sour crust to it. She's still experimenting with rise times and whatnot to get lighter loaves, and I'm happy to eat the results!

review/summary: It's alive!
review/text: When I received my starter I followed the instructions and placed the sourdough in a canning jar. As a precaution, I opened the plastic envelope with a wooden spoon and added some flour/water "feed" and left that as a second chance to successfully start a sourdough.  Both were active and alive, but the smaller plastic envelope I kneeded and mixed after feeding was off to a bubbling start that could not be mistaken.  I now have two containers of very active sourdough and have baked bread, and sourdough pancakes.<br />I formally had a sourdough from a start a local bakery had given me.  This sourdough is an excellent active yeast, but also departs a great flavor to bread dough if retarted overnight in the refer before baking the second day.

review/summary: Died and needs a lot of room
review/text: We purchased this sourdough starter because, well, we wanted some fresh sourdough!  But -- upon arrival -- all we ended up with was disappointment.  We followed the directions explicitly and still ended up with a bad batch of starter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-"high maintenance" -- it has a laundry-list of things to do and not do.  We followed them to the T, but still ended up killing it.<br />-It requires you to put it in the oven for 7 days with the oven light on.  Not only is it slow-to-grow, I hated leaving the oven light on for that long.<br />-Requires a lot of food and space.  We ended up growing it in a medium-sized kitchen bowl because it probably wouldn't fit in a jar.<br />-Obviously the biggest: after babying it for 5 days, it ended its life.<br />-Looks like its a "tourist gift."  I don't know, but -- for some reason -- this really bothered me.  It felt like something you'd pick up out of a gift shop rather than a baking supply.  This may also be the reason for the above.<br /><br />I can't speak to the quality of bread because we never got to that point.  But there are better starters available then this one.

review/summary: Too much trouble for very little difference
review/text: I've been experimenting with sourdough starters for about 4 months now and I bought this one expecting it to be the real San Francisco deal.<br /><br />After following the instructions, I got a bread that tastes virtually the same as home-made starter. I think the trick that bakeries like Boudin have is their baking process. So If you want to mimic their bread, buy the industrial ovens they use and make your own starter.

We did not hear from our friends for some time and I wondered if they had actually received it or it had been left somewhere for them to find!  I do not know what the bouquet looked like or what condition the flowers were in so I cannot really give an objective review.  I just wish that I could have filled some kind of gift card message to go with it.

review/summary: Great Customer Service, Beautiful Flowers
review/text: I ordered these flowers to cheer up a friend of mine. When I purchased them via Amazon, I was told the flowers would be delivered between the 17-22 of November. I had ordered the flowers on November 10Th and did not want to wait that long. I contacted Falcon Farms directly via email to ask if the flowers could be sent sooner. Falcon Farms had not yet received my order from Amazon, but told me if I could send them the order number they would process my order ASAP and get the flowers sent out. The NEXT day the gorgeous flowers arrived at my friend's house! Though I haven't seen a photo of the flowers, my friend tells me that they are beautiful and that the buds are nice and tight (meaning they will last a long time).<br /><br />I use Amazon often, but this is only the second time I have written a customer review. I was so impressed with Falcon Farm's customer service; they were quick to respond to my emails and sent the flowers out quicker than I had hoped. I recommend Falcon Farm to anyone wanting to send flowers to a friend or loved one. They sell a high quality product at a fair price and provide great customer service. I will definitely be ordering flowers from them again.

review/summary: A Hearty Breakfast...in Seconds!
review/text: Even in Southern California, the winter mornings have a chill in the air, and it's nice to have a healthy bowl of oatmeal to warm and satisy the body. Quaker Instant Oatmeal packets are the perfect solution, for those with little time to cook breakfast, or those who don't want to deal with a messy saucepan afterwards.<br /><br />I don't have a microwave oven, but you don't need one for this product. Just put the contents of a packet (I like 2 packets!) in a bowl, and pour enough boiling water for the oatmeal to reach the consistency you like (the instructions say "up to � cup" of water per packet). Stir for a few seconds, and you have a delicious meal. Quaker Instant Oatmeal can also be made in a microwave oven of course, and you can use milk instead of water.<br /><br />The Maple and Brown Sugar flavor is my favorite, but there are many others to chose from. At 160 calories a packet for the Maple and Brown Sugar, the low fat content makes it a good choice for dieters, as it is a breakfast that is nourishing and "sticks to the ribs" as my Mom was fond of saying (the fat content is listed as 2 grams per serving, with 0% on the saturated and trans fats). And it's a good source of fiber! And we all need lots of fiber. For those harried mothers who have to get their kids off to school, Quaker Instant Oatmeal is the answer, to give them a breakfast that has some nutritional value, is tasty, and ready to eat in seconds.

review/summary: Something Good For Low-Sodium Diets...Vegans Will Enjoy It Too!
review/text: This review refers to "Amy's Organic Soup - Low sodium Minestrone(12 Pack)<br /><br />I'm always searching for something tasty in low sodium foods. We started out on low sodium several years back, when my husbands Doctor insisted on it for him, but added that EVERYONE should be on low sodium. It was quite an adjustment at first, salt was definitely my 6th food group. But we did adjust, the thing is trying to find new and different things we couldn't find in our neighborhood market.<br /><br />Amy's low-sodium minestrone will taste bland to those who are not used to low-sodium products, but just doctor it up with maybe a little pepper and you may just enjoy it very much.If you are already on low-sodium, you will be happy to find something new that is very flavorful. I was buying the Campbell's Healthy Request Minestrone, which has just a little more sodium then this, and the difference is quite noticeable. But the texture of Amy's is not as watery, more like home made(although nothing's like homemade) and the veggies seem more like real veggies then Campbell's. It is packed with veggies and has a good portion of pasta as well, and with a little bread(low sodium/whole grain) it makes a great lunch.There are 2 servings per can, and the servings are a pretty generous size.<br /><br />There are other benefits to this soup beside the low-sodium.It is really nutritious. It is made with al Vegan/Organic ingredients,is very low fat, has NO cholesterol, and you just heat and serve.It's a good source of Vitamins A and C, and has some iron benefit as well. Unlike the condensed soups, no water is added. Also it is marked as Kosher.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Filtered Water,Organic Tomatoes,Organic Onions,Organic Carrots,organic Kidney Beans,Organic Potatoes,Organic Celery,organic Pasta(organic semolina flour),Organic Green Beans,Organic Peas,Organic Leeks,pure herbs and spices,Organic High Oleic Safflower and/or sunflower oil,Sea`Salt,Organic Garlic. It DOES contain Wheat(for those with allergies). The facility also processes milk, soy,tree nuts and seed products, however does not use any peanuts,fish,shellfish or eggs -(all from label)<br /><br />sodium per serving is 290mg,dietary fiber is 3 gm,sugar 5g and protein 3 g. total fat is 1.5g(no trans or saturated fat and carbs are 17g.<br /><br />I also think this 12 pack case is a really good buy. Even if you tried to make homemade soup-have you looked at the price of organic veggies these days.And don't think you will get bored with this, the case I received has a shelf life through jan 2011, so it's not like you have to eat it up all at once(but it is pretty good!) And by the way, my order shipped and arrived promptly.<br /><br />So remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy.........Laurie

review/summary: Best canned minestrone I've tried...and organic!
review/text: I've had some unfortunate and disappointing experiences with all sorts of canned soups, but for some reason, especially minestrone. But I love the combo of tomatoey broth, beans, veggies, and pasta, so I always kept searching.<br /><br />This is probably the best I've had. Now, that's a mitigated "best". Canned soup can never approach the wonderfulness of the freshly made stuff. However, I'm a lazy cook, and I often rely on canned versions, especially when cold/flu strikes.<br /><br />This lighter in sodium version is really good. It's density is perfect--not overly brothy, not overly thick--and the saltiness is just right. The beans are yummy, though I agree with another reviewer that a bit more pasta would be welcome.<br /><br />I am not vegan, so I do tend to add a sprinkle of shaved or shredded parmesan on top, which hides the imperfections magnificently. By imperfections I mean the "tinny" quality that canned products tend to acquire and the bit of herbal imbalance I sensed. The parmesan took care of that, added that cheesy loveliness, and made this canned soup a satisfying lunch. I didn't even need crackers or toast. This was just fine.<br /><br />So, if you, like me, depend on canned soups and prefer organic to non-organic, this is a very dependable choice.<br /><br />I would, however, think twice ordering from amazon. I buy a LOT from amazon--thousands a year--but my experience with canned goods is spotty. And with Amy's bad. The cans can be pretty messed up. And I won't eat soup out of a badly dented can. I was raised with the admonition that this damages the intergrity of the product and you risk food spoilage.<br /><br />Mir

BUT there's enough of a difference from the regular version for me to opt out of this low sodium version.  It's just bland and I can't get through bowl without adding my own salt.  If you have dietary restrictions, then this is a good option.  Otherwise, buy the regular version or be prepared to add your own salt.

review/summary: Best Low-Sodium Minestrone out there!
review/text: Tried several low-sodium soups, and along with Amy's low-sodium Tomato this is very good.  Add half a cup of water and some frozen veggies or beans and it becomes outstanding, and plenty for two or three people.

review/summary: Mediocre Soup
review/text: Bought this soup in search of low salt easy to make lunch. It still has a fair amount of sodium in it, with about 25% of the "daily needs" per can. I add a very large quantity of black pepper to the soup and it has become my basis for pepper cravings.

review/summary: Very good for low in sodium
review/text: Before purchasing this product I was a little hesitant and feared Amy's Light would taste kind of bland and very different than Amy's regular Organic Minestrone. IT DOES NOT. It is very tasty and only slightly less flavorful than the original Amy's. In fact, in some ways it is better without the overpowering salty taste sodium provides.  A nice product, particularly considering this organic soup is low sodium.

review/summary: AMY'S LOW SODIUM MINESTRONE SOUP
review/text: I ordered the following Amy's Low Salt Products: Lentil Soup, Pea Soup, Minestrone Soup, and Medium Chili.  All of them are great.  If you are just now switching to Low salt or no salt you may find them to be bland until your body adjusts to the lowered salt intake (that could take months or up to a year).  The biggest complaint most have is the dented cans.  My Minestrone and Chili came in without any dents, the Pea Soup had 2 dented cans and the Lentils had dents in every can.  These dents are not caused by shipping.  All of my shipments came in with the packages totally intact with no signs that the outer shipping box had been roughed up in shipment.  These dents are caused by Amazon or Amy's warehousing.  The cans are not in boxes, they are shrink wrapped so when stacked the cans are actually bearing the weight.  Too much weight and the cans begin to buckle and this buckling will look like dents.  You can also get this same effect if the warehousemen are slamming the 12 pack cans down hard on top of each other.  This happens when workers in the warehouse get tired and become careless, are untrained, or just plain don't care about their job.  If you want to feel better then stay on a low salt diet, if you have ankle swelling then get on a low salt diet and get checked for congestive heart failure.  If you have high blood pressure get on a low salt diet and then increase your intake of magnesium.  Backing off your salt is not easy as it begins to change the way you taste food but if you stay with it and get off the high salt diet you will begin to taste food and not just the salt.  Have you ever eaten at a restaurant where the cook's salt intake is so high that the cook can't tell if he has too much salt in the food he is preparing?  I have more than once and it just destroys the meal.  Instead of buying 12 cans now try the Amy's Low Salt by getting it at your local health food store one can at a time then if you like order from Amazon and save.  Right now they have a 25% discount code when you order.  Write it down and use it as it saved me a few bucks.  Hope this review helps you.

review/summary: Lame!!...
review/text: I bought this for my husband for Father's Day. My 3 year old son and I were looking at Amazon golf gift baskets, and we decided on this one. Upon arrival the bag all this came in was crushed. The bucket of golf balls is actually two big paperboard cut-outs that are stuck to the front and back of a regular gift bag with tape. I thought it was a bag designed to look like a pail of golf balls...no.<br /><br />As for the items that came in this...not worth the $30. Some pasteurized cheddar cheese 'flavor', some Cajun mix, which I thought hubby would enjoy, but it was crushed, so it was more like Cajun crumbs. Some crackers, biscotti, sub-par coffee, and dry cookies. Overall, I say PASS. We were able to laugh about it and say 'It's the thought that counts!'...but really, this was just bad.

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: Tastes & works just like regular pasta!  I was stunned.  I've tried all the funky lower carb pastas from health food stores in the past, & they don't even taste like real pasta.  A low-carb diet is a challenge when you're Italian.  I made baked sausage and penne with a low carb tomato sauce that I made for dinner last night, & today I made a baked macaroni & cheese with the elbow macaroni.  This is the real deal!  My local grocer (Publix) sells this for $1.99 a box, though.  So glad I waited to look for it elsewhere before buying on here.  Seriously overpriced! Go for this!  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Primary Flavor is Sugar
review/text: I don't want to say these are awful but I won't ever get them again. The praise in other reviews, especially for the hickory strips, convinced me to try them. I now suspect the praise was "planted" by vested interests.<br /><br />The weaknesses of the product are legion. First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.<br /><br />Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.<br /><br />Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.<br /><br />At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close. For a vegetarian jerky product that is both tasty and relatively healthy and won't leave your fingers covered in pancake syrup, I recommend Stonewall's Jerqee.

review/text: I am a vegetarian, and I wanted so badly to like this vegan jerky. As soon as I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was that the jerky is very moist, not like real beef jerky at all (which I understand to be dry and chewy). Also, it smelled like pure dog food. I decided to take a bite anyway, and found that it tastes exactly like it smells. All I could think about was that I was eating dog food. I gave it 2/5 stars because one of my friends actually liked it, and apparently so do a lot of Amazon users since it comes highly recommended. Hopefully you like it better than I did, but beware if you are easily put off by unpleasant smells!

review/text: These are great tasting tofu jerky strips!  Low in fat, high in protein, and pretty low in calories (99 calories in this flavor) across the board.  This flavor can be a bit spicy, depending on the batch.  My last batch was great, but the current one has some very small, but whole peppercorns throughout the jerky.  It's still good, but I'm on the fence as to which batch I prefer.  The only real complaint I have is that the packaging is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to open without a pair of scissors.  It's not real great for on-the-go when you have to wrestle with the package with both hands and your teeth to get it open.  I can't understand why they made the packaging this way, what a bummer.

review/summary: Disgusting! Horrible! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!
review/text: I took one bite of one of these things and had to throw all the rest of them away. The taste is indescribably yucky, sort of sweet yet caustic. The worst part is the TEXTURE! It was like trying to bite through soggy cardboard. Utterly disgusting. I guess if you were trapped in a collapsed coal mine and awaiting rescue and there was NOTHING else to eat, you might choose this over a coal-mine rat, but it would be a hard choice.

review/summary: A decent vegan snack, tbut with some drawbacks.
review/text: The first thing I noticed is that it smells JUST like the canned cat food I give my cat. This was a big turn-off, but I have had good experiences with wheat gluten in the past, so I gave it a shot. The flavor is nice, and has a decent aftertaste. The texture is OK, but not what I would expect from a "jerky".. I would have preferred something much chewier. I did eat them, but it's not something I will purchase again.

review/text: I was looking for alternative healthy protein snack with less fat than slim  jims. Texas BBQ sounded like an awesome flavor---so I bought them. For those of you who have never tried them....pick up a rubber band, baste it in bbq sauce and then eat. That is what this soy protein jerky taste like...a bbq flavored rubber band. The only way I will ever eat these again is if the world no longer has any other protein choice available.

review/text: I've eaten a few of these, and while they tasted interesting at first, I can't bite into one now without gagging.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I was looking for some high-protein snacks so I picked these up.  A vegetarian friend of mine tried one and instantly hated them, calling the taste "disgusting" and the texture "too much like meat."  The taste is not something that grows on you and I can not recommend these to anyone, especially at this price.

Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like these, they didn't taste like food - hard to describe, but the 'primal' branding doesn't help as I did feel like I was eating something I wasn't supposed to.<br /><br />While the first one I tried was novel, I easily tired of them and then plain got grossed out by them.

review/text: Bought this REALLY hoping to like it, as Stonewall's Jerquee is so expensive, but this stuff is repulsive.  For one thing, isn't jerky, by definition, supposed to be dry?  This stuff comes covered in a greasy, slimy coating.  After trying hard to get passed that, on to the actual jerky...it's not chewy, like jerky is supposed to be, it is too easy to bite off a piece.  And the flavor is beyond description, in a bad way.  I've tried almost all of the flavors now, and would never buy ANY of them again.  They have a weird perfumey taste.  So, they're slimy and taste awful.  That about sums it up.

review/summary: made in Taiwan?
review/text: I bought this without realizing that it is a product of Taiwan.  Considering all the health risks from eating foods made in China, I don't think I can trust the ingredients used in this product.  As I understand, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea, all import many food ingredients from China, and they have found many harmful chemicals in them (I am not even including those that are unsanitary, i.e. made from sewer water).  So what guarantee is there that this product do not contain carcinogens or other harmful chemicals?  FDA do not, and cannot, test every single foreign product coming into U.S.<br /><br />Eat at your own risk.

review/text: I became a vegetarian about three years ago, and before that, Teriyaki was my favorite flavor of beef jerky. So when I saw this, I immediately bought it. However, this was NOTHING like jerky. It was squishy, and tasted like bread, and the supposed "Teriyaki" flavor was nothing like any Teriyaki flavor I've ever had. No one in my house will eat it, so I'm returning it. If you buy, I guarantee you'll be sorry.

review/summary: Not as good as it could be (misleading ingredient label also)
review/text: A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much.<br /><br />  With that said, there is a company making soy jerky that has better flavor, texture and quality. They even make jerky that is unsweetened. Most importantly, this company tasty eats does not have any garlic or onion powder in any of their products.<br /><br />  This was the biggest, we felt, downfall of this product. Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has "vegetarian spices" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion. But there is. In these primals strips, all are having some form of garlic, possibly onion.<br /><br />  We found tasty eats soy jerky to be Perfect. Really, in quality, texture and also the fact that they use no onion or garlic whatsoever.

review/summary: IF you like this, just try tasty east Soy Jerky
review/text: First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to "spices". Here it is part of the "vegetarian spices" ingredient.<br /><br />  The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available.<br /><br />  Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5. This primal strip does not compare.

review/summary: Not what it claims or a bit deceptive
review/text: We tried this product, a bunch of us. And we are all vegetarian. We also do not like onion or garlic; one of the friends esp. is sensitive to this. Well, even calling the company, they are not forthcoming, because we could taste garlic in it, and compared to "tasty eats" soy jerky, this does not even compare.<br /><br />  So first, the ingredient "vegetarian spices" includes granulated garlic powder, possibly onion. In ayurvedic terms, this is not Sathwic for one's body.<br /><br />  We totally recommend the soy jerky by tasty eats. We ordered six cases of the ginger. They use no onion or garlic in any of their products. Most companies do list "spices" but they will almost always label garlic or onion powder separately. This company who makes the primal strips does not. After all the comparisons, we found tasty eats soy jerky to be the best taste, quality and texture.<br /><br />  In fact, they are out of Teriyaki, their best selling jerky, the original flavor, peppered and hot n' spicy. But we will order cases of them when they become available.  They provide a first class jerky that is healthy and proper for everyone; esp. vegans and vegetarians.

review/summary: "Better than meat!" says the carnivore.
review/text: I am a card-carrying carnivore.  Having said that, I am also the Laziest Man This Side of a Lebowski.  Even chewing is too much work for me.  Given that, Primal Strips are heaven.  The texture is very close to meat, but is consistently chewable, with none of the gristle often associated with beef jerky.  Spam is too gooey.  Real beef jerky makes my jaw ache, and I end up spitting out gristle too frequently.  But this?  This is perfect.  If "they" replaced meat with this Soylent Brown-type food, I'd happily leave the Real Thing behind.  I'm not sure of the health benefits.  I guess it's good for me.  I've seen people who are healthier than I eating it, so I figure it's nutritious.  Anyway, it tastes robust, has a perfect texture, and is a perfect snack.

review/text: There really aren't any vegetarian jerkies that replace meat jerky.  Some vegetarian jerkies are so horrid, it is surprising they made it to market.<br /><br />Even in their tiny packages, a lot of vegetarian jerkies are so bad I can't finish them.<br /><br />But there are a lot of varieties of this brand that we like:  teriyaki, hickory, and thai peanut are our favorites.  This is seitan, which is a chewy gluten product.  It is stringy in texture, moist, and is a good match for the flavors.  There are some flavors I don't particularly like, such as the lime flavor, but even the ones I don't like seem like someone else would. (As in, I don't like barbecue potato chips, but I can see where someone else would.)

review/summary: Tasty but with a big drawback
review/text: Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is "imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west."<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the "wet" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).

review/summary: Very Convincing Meat Replacement
review/text: I ate beef jerky every single day at my school cafeteria when I was growing up. I loved the stuff. And then I became a vegetarian and, alas, I thought my beef jerky days were done for. Until I discovered this. It is very convincing - the texture isn't gross or suspect like many fake meat products. It isn't too tough, is a bit moist, and has a nice flavor. It is much softer than Tofuky Jerky beef jerky replacement, so the texture is easier to deal with, but this flavor is more sweet than the spicy Tofuky Jerky version. I'm excited to taste other flavors to see if there is something a bit on the spicy barbecue side rather than sweet barbecue side, but in general, I really like this and it might convince even the most skeptical meat eater. My dad even liked it, which is saying a lot - he is an old school eater who was very skeptical of anything vegetarian.

review/text: I am not by any means a vegetarian (I eat my steaks rare), but I do try to eat healthy.  Beef jerky is a great snack if you are on the go (I travel a lot), but the constant intake of red meat is not good for you.  So, I tried the Primal Strip vegan strips.  I have had every one that they make.....and they are all good.  The Thai Satian Peanut is by far my favorite (the hot and spicy shiitake mushroom jerky is my second favorite).  I have recommended this snack to even the most devout meat eaters and they even like it.  I give it 5 stars - but just like everything - they are not for everyone.  I recommend buying them individually first, and if you love it then come back to amazon and get a box (amazon is the cheapest for the boxes).

review/text: I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.

review/text: Wonderful! I have a busy job that keeps me occupied with little time to take meal breaks. I take a couple pieces of this and some fruit and veggies, and I get to have healthful snacks instead of relying on fast food or candy bars. Helped me lose 20 (and counting) pounds!

review/summary: The perfect snack
review/text: I cannot give high enough praise for these incredibly delicious and protein packed little snacks. Even my very food fussy 5 year old likes them. They are the perfect light lunch or snack to throw in your purse for a busy afternoon. The flavour is delicious, sweet and smokey. At under 100 calories and packed with 10 grams of protein, you can't go wrong. I HIGHLY recommend these snacks, they are worth every penny.

review/summary: Tasty and filling!
review/text: The flavor is robust and tangy, and the texture is very pleasing and moderately chewy - not enough to hurt your teeth, just enough to satisfy! Also, they're not salty-tasting at all. The "jerky" flavoring is moist enough to make a little mess on your fingertips, but you can suck it right off. :)<br /><br />I have bought these in single-serving sizes in our local grocery store as well. I buy them every week and carry them with me for emergency sustenance.

review/summary: finally!
review/text: i've searched high and low for a delicious, healthy, meatless jerky product.  i'm a pescatarian, so tuna/salmon/halibut jerky is great, but super expensive and often incredibly high in sodium.  i found these in the aisles of pcc and absolutely fell in love.  first thing i did was search amazon for them, and here they were!  the price is better, and i knew i would eat these every day.  i take two to work and have at least one at home.  i would recommend these to anyone, carnivore or vegan, looking for a delicious, healthy source of protein.  wow!

review/summary: Vegetarian and Very Tasty
review/text: I have searched for a good vegetarian jerky for several years.  There have been some hits but more misses.  This is one of the best; a great BBQ flavor and a consistency similar to real jerky.  Definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Awesome veggie snacki
review/text: I absolutely love this stuff -- the mesquite lime flavor is sweet, spicy and tangy, and the consistency of the jerky is chewy yet moist. At 74 calories and 10 grams of cholesterol-free meatless protein, you can't beat it as a snack.

review/summary: Great snack and 10g of protein in 74 calories!
review/text: This is my favorite flavor from Primal Strips.  I like the others but ordered this one last since it sounded weird, but it's great.  The lime flavor is strong and their texture is very good (moist and chewy).  Lowest calories (same as Thai Peanut) from their line.  An excellent no-guilt snack!

review/summary: Worst jerky ever
review/text: Disgusting, slimy, stinky!  I love jerky but have a weak jaw and have trouble chewing it. A diet website recommended this meatless jerky, so I ordered it to try it.  Absolutely horrible!  I recently gave the entire order (except for a small bite I tasted) to a friend to be donated to feed the homeless.  I hope someone may like it.  It comes from the package wet and slimy and has a clove-like odor.  That's about all I can remember about it.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: Just be forewarned it is a bit "moist."  Have plenty of papertowels/napkins around when eating it.<br /><br />However for vegan jerky, this has by far the best texture. You will be picking it out of your teeth for hours! And for me, that is a good thing!<br /><br />My fav is the BBQ flavor, however their other flavors are very tasty as well :-)

review/summary: Try every flavor in singles before buying in bulk.
review/text: I've tried almost all the flavors, and my favorites are Teriyaki and Thai Peanut (both are sweet and savory).  For about 100 calories and 10 grams of protein, this makes a great snack.  I hadn't eaten these in a couple of years, but when I got pregnant I started craving the Teriyaki again so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon in bulk.
