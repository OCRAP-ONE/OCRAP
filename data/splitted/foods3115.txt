review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I was disappointed with this one.  I bought after seeing such good reviews but it has a very strong artificial taste to me.  It smells good but the taste is just so strong and does not go well with any type of creamer I have tried.  I have now been using lots of almond joy creamer which makes it taste better but not great.

review/text: Raspberry and chocolate my favorite! So I had to naturally give this a try. Taste just like a raspberry mocha from Starbucks. Has more of a creamy milk chocolate flavor then the bitterness of dark chocolate. Is Delicious! Smells great and automatizes the house when you brew a cup. Is a mild coffee unless you brew on a smaller more concentrated cup. Great price for the quality.

review/summary: Absolutely incredible!
review/text: This is the best K Cup coffee I've ever had!  Normally they don't actually taste of the flavor they're supposed to, or smell much like it.  The aroma of this is absolutely incredible, as is the taste!  I normally add milk and a sweetener of some kind to make the coffee less bitter, but with this the flavor is enough that I can drink it black.  The initial chocolate taste overcomes the bitter but is subtle enough to not be overwhelming, and the aftertaste of raspberry is just right - and keeps you wanting your next sip.

review/text: I bought this flavor as an indulgent treat but it's mild enough to make a great everyday coffee.  That said, the chocolate raspberry flavor is very noticeable when drinking.  It's the perfect balance in my opinion and the perfect morning drink with a little bit of agave and a splash of plain creamer or milk.  Delicious.  One of my top favorite K cups ever.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZJZE8">Kool-Aid Invisible Watermelon Kiwi Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.13-Ounce Packets (Pack of 96)</a>  I have an awesome recipie that (almost) everyone should try at lease once in their lifetime. I had an idea and after some trial and error this is what I came up with...I always say safety first! PLEASE MAKE SURE NOT TO SERVE THIS DRINK TO A DIABETIC. THEY COULD GO INTO A DIABETIC COMA. HERE IS MY VERSION OF A HOMADE SLUSHI. Go buy 1 Gal. Drinking WATER, pour apx. 3 cups into a clean container and save for later. Add 3 pkgs. Invisible Kool-Aid Watermelon/Kiwi. Add 3 cups sugar and 2 drops of your favorite food coloring. Put the lid on tight. Now take turns shaking the bottle till the sugar is disolved. Add some of the water you removed earlier, (till the water level is about 1-2 inches from the lid (room for expansion). Put in your freezer. About every 3-4 hours, go to the freezer, pull the container out and shake. Return to freezer and repeat this process till most of the kool-aid is frozen. Shake the container very good just before serving and enjoy! Keep in the freezer. I purchased a rubber malot that I keep in my utensil drawer to beat the jug with if it gets too froozen. Extra Pleasure for Adults ONLY. You can add alomst ANY booze to this drink and not taste it!!! Enjoy and be safe. ...The reason I increased the number of Kool-Aid paks and sugar is because when you freeze a beverage the sugar taste is diminshed and so is the flavor. Thanks for letting me share.  Rhonda

review/summary: Absolute Favorite for My Family
review/text: Love, love, love this product-- the first time we found it at a Walmart it was like a life saver- my children didn't particularly like the dyes of most drink mix flavors. It was worth the extra cost to purchase the brand name Kool-Aid to not have the dyes. There were two flavors then-- Watermelon and Grape.<br /><br />We've moved-- and the Walmarts in this area don't carry it YET. I am trying to justify spending $20 on Kool-Aid at one time. Granted it's the same cost (or comparable) to the store, but I don't typically buy 96 packs at a time. :-)<br /><br />If you haven't tried-- give it a try.

review/summary: This is a fantastic product and NO dye
review/text: I was looking for an alternative to carrying 2-liter bottles of Diet Rite up to my 3rd floor apartment. This is it.<br /><br />I tried regular Kool-Aid but the dye really does a number on the counter and I don't think it is necessary or healthy.<br /><br />This is the only flavor I found that doesn't have dye. And it is as good as any other Kool-Aid flavor.<br /><br />I have two 2 gallon pitchers and they both have this in them. I use two of these packets and about 1.75 cups of Splenda and fill it all the way up.<br /><br />I am writing this because another reviewer gave this product 1 star because "After further taste tests we did not like the Watermelon taste." I think that is unfair so I am giving it a little bump. Flavor's are subjective. If you don't particularly care for watermelon that is no reason to trash the product. In my humble opinion.<br /><br />The price listed here at the time I am writing this review is okay. I get them from the local Walmart for 16-20 cents. That would make 96 between $15.36 and $19.20 plus 2.5% tax so about the same.<br /><br />I recommend you get one at a local Walmart or other store if it is available before you get a box.

review/summary: The invisible threat becomes better camouflaged
review/text: OH YEAH!  Five stars to applaud your ingenuity and audacity, Kool Aid man!  The Kool Aid man has been and remains a giant threat to liberty and freedom.  He was originally designed in the late 70's and early 80's to undermine free societies the world over.  He is usually filled with red `Kool Aid', red for communism and he intended to flood our cultures with that oppressive red liquid.  Furthermore, he is characterized as someone for whom no wall can stop.  He was specifically designed to burst through the Berlin Wall and end democracy in the western world.<br />His original plan failed.  But that is not the end of the threat.  Kool Aid is manufactured in Mexico.  That is right people, the wall defeating menace is poised on our very borders.  Imagine the immigrant problem we will have when our border walls (like in Arizona) are turned into swiss cheese.  And as if that were not enough, now he has developed camouflage!  Now he is an invisible wrecking ball of doom for our borders, our children, and our very way of life.  The Kool Aid man, like all truly dangerous foes, commands my grudging respect.  While I salute your cleverness and tenacity, I will not rest until your mask has been removed and all see you for the threat you are.  I long for the day when your plans are derailed.  I cannot wait to hear you look upon the ruins of your plot and cry with despair: "OH NO".

review/summary: Do not like taste but no color to stain.
review/text: My gf and I did a taste test of this and Kool-Aid Twists Blastin' Berry Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZED2M">Kool-Aid Twists Blastin' Berry Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.17-Ounce Packets (Pack of 96)</a>).<br /><br />They both tasted good. This has a lighter taste with no after-taste. The big plus about this flavor is that it has no dye so it looks like water. We have white carpets so I could not take the other flavors onto the carpet. This one is great as it will not stain.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste. We have changed to using slightly less than 8 cups of water to make the taste richer. We have also increased the Splenda to 12 packets to make it sweeter.<br /><br />Addendum: After further taste tests we did not like the Watermelon taste. I wish they had more invisible flavors.

review/text: I bought this product after hearing Dr. Oz tout how it 'changed his life.' Well, it also changed mine because for the first time ever, I threw away food that wasn't spoiled. In short, even with following the cooking directions, it was like eating paste -- only more bland despite how much garlic & olive oil I added. I tried to pawn a couple boxes off to my parents and they weren't happy with me. They donated their boxes to a food drive.<br /><br />Money down the drain...don't buy (unless you have an affinity for eating paste).

My 2.5 year old ate about 5 bites, and that was more than anyone else. Thank goodness for take out Mexican food, I guess.

review/summary: OK but not the best gluten-free pasta
review/text: One of my 18-month-old twins is allergic to wheat and corn, so I am always on the lookout for good gluten-free products that are also corn-free. I've tried a few different wheat-free pastas. This one is OK, both my toddlers will eat it, but it overcooks very easily and the flavor and texture are not as good as some of the other brands I've tried. Unfortunately I bought it in bulk so I have a bunch more boxes to use up, but I don't think I'll buy it again. It's not bad; there are just better options out there (e.g. the Tinkyada brand's version).

I rinse than throw back in pot with whatever sauce I'm using.  The texture isn't grainy, unlike corn pasta and tastes like a "real noodle" (as my husband says).

review/summary: Want your dog dead?  If so, buy this product!
review/text: I was in a hurry as I shopped at my local pet food store late on a Saturday night.  My dogs needed dog food.  I buy a high quality dog food, it's ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these "gourmet" chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time, they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag "not for human consumption, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product"-"made in China" would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat, which caused bloat because nothing could pass, salmonella and e-coli poisoning, and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery, 7 sets of xrays, 2 ultrasounds, multiple blood tests,an ecg and we're not done yet.  She is still in recovery, tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past, never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart, which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn't take the time to carefully look the product over. Thank you, Cadet and IMS Pet Products for contributing to my dog's pain and suffering.

review/summary: Smells one way, tastes another, but thankfully both are pretty good!
review/text: My boyfriend really wanted to try this blend as he has always enjoyed blueberry flavored coffees in the past. We picked up one of the sample packs of this blend from keurig's website to give it a try. I was skeptical about how a berry flavored coffee would translate when being brewed in the Keurig. Fortunately, though, the end result is very good, although not at all like either of us expected.<br /><br />From the moment this coffee begins brewing, the blueberry scent is unmistakeable. Very nice, but that had me worried that this coffee would have some sort of artificial sweetness to it. Thankfully, however, that isn't the case. While the scent may overpower you with the fragrance of fresh blueberries, the taste is a whole different thing altogether. The taste of this coffee is incredibly woodsy with a bit of a hint of cinnamon (very subtle in the latter). It's quite pleasing although totally unexpected.<br /><br />All in all my boyfriend even prefers this to the coffee shop blends, which speaks volumes in my book. I think it's great and I'm sure we'll restock it when our current supply of pods runs out.

review/text: I tried this when I thought I would give up dairy and found it on Amazon for a good price with the Subscribe & Save feature.  A friend had recommended the Light version for using in coffee as it is the consistency of milk and she was right.  I'd tried both a can of the regular and light and the regular is very thick--great for sauces, soups, puddings, etc. but not appealing for coffee.<br /><br />The cans came well packaged, boxed within another box, unlike other canned goods I've gotten from Amazon that unfortunately have arrived all dented.<br /><br />The one thing I want to point out is that this coconut milk DOES have guar gum.  Since I have eliminated additives like guar gum and carrageenan from my diet and am eating dairy again, I gave away the remainder of my cans of coconut milk to a friend.

review/text: I really enjoy this sauce.  It can kick anything up a few notches.  But, if you eat hot sauce straight, DO NOT attempt that with this sauce.  You will regret it.  I will definitely buy this sauce again.  (That is, if I ever run out.)

review/text: Ok, we love HOT sauces, but this is rediculous! We thought that like a good hot sauce, this would go good on tacos, nachos etc with some nice heat, but this stuff is stupid hot! I bought a three pack and regreted it the moment we tried it. This is their standard insanity sauce (not the hotter one's that Dave's sells) and we cannot even tolerate a few dashes on our tacos. I'm good.

review/text: I have been gluten free for over two years and have gotten quite used to gluten free snacks having their own "special" taste somewhat like cardboard with the gritty after mouth feel to remind you that they are healthy.  LOL.  These pretzels are even better than I remember "normal" pretzels to be.  My husband who is not gluten free constantly steals my stash.  I do not live in the US and have to go through a complicated process to get them as AMAZON only delivers these to US mainland addresses. They are worth every bit of the expense and complications as they are really really fantastic.

I would highly recommend to anyone who cannot eat Gulten to try this product as in my case it is a life saver!

I am the only one in my household who must eat GF, but everyone -- husband and kids included -- agrees these are good pretzels. They're crunchy, but light (not rock-hard on the teeth like some pretzels can be). Great alone for a snack, or just the right thing to combine with Rice Chex, peanuts, and seasoning for a great GF party mix!

review/summary: The BEST GF pretzels available
review/text: We have tried MANY GF snacks and these are our families favorites. Most brands of GF pretzels are hard and flavorless. Not these! Light, crisp and yummy, we tear through them at our house!<br /><br />My 3 year old and I are the GF members of our household, but everyone loves them! My 11 year old generally thinks all things GF are "ick" by default, but she inhales these. Many of my kids friends say they are the best pretzels they have had, and they have no idea they are GF.<br /><br />We mix them with Rice Chex (GF but not other types of Chex or generic brands), raw almonds and chocilate chips for a yummy snack mix we call "Finnie Mix" - named for my 3 year old. Good stuff!<br /><br />We also grind them with raw almonds and use them as a fabulous breading for chicken nuggets.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey, but well worth it. The subscription offer from Amazon is a great deal (about $2-3 less per bag than any of the stores in my area) if you want to drop $60ish bucks at once.

So glad to be able to buy them by the case since they are hard to find in stores.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Pretzels
review/text: My kids and I love these.  We take them on trips and outings with ease. Wish they weren't so expensive, but without any other G.F. pretzels in single serve packages that taste as good I guess sometimes you just have to pay for it to have something "normal" again.

review/text: My 14 year old was recently diagnosed with celiac.  It has been difficult finding snacks that she enjoys and can bring to school.  We have found these pretzels to be great, really delicious.  Even her friends prefer them to regular pretzels.

review/text: This product comes to us from the Middle East, which represents so much carbon impact for a food product that gluten-free folks (such as myself) may be purchasing frequently.  There are other gluten-free products made in this country which have similar quality...which is how I'm going to spend my money.

review/summary: Great deal on best GF pretzels I've found!
review/text: I fell in love with Glutino stick pretzels when I started a gluten-free diet six months ago. I actually think they taste better than the regular pretzels I used to eat! The only downside was the price -- the local store charged $8.99 per 14 ounce bag. When I checked on Amazon, I was pleased to find they carry Glutino pretzels. Interestingly, the 8 ounce bags turn out to be a better price per ounce than the 14 ounce ones, so that's what I ordered. With the subscribe and save deal, the 8-ounce bags came out at just over $3 apiece. If you or your gluten-free child loves pretzels for a snack, and you have the space to store a dozen bags, this is an awesome deal! I have a handful of friends who also are gluten-free, so I've shared some of my order with them. These are amazingly good pretzels and Amazon's subscribe and save price is the best you're going to find anywhere!!

review/text: Of all of the gluten free pretzels I have tried, these by far are the best.  They are close to the real thing as I recall.  Sometimes they are difficult to obtain.  Stores do not stock them since they are a bit pricey but well worth it for those of us who are gluten-intolerant.  These are a must for me.

review/summary: Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE
review/text: I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch.  They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.  Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward.  Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night.  Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.  The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose.  You will find they are synonyms if you Google them.  All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.  If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with "side effects" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea.  Never again.  All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned!

review/text: As far as the product goes - these are excellent.  Can't even tell they're gluten free.  Nice and crispy and good flavor.  Usually they're packed well but the boxed was partially crushed on this last shipment and half the pretzels were broken. They had slapped a shipping label right over the "fragile" that was printed on the box.  Not good thinking.

They are, hands down, the BEST PRETZELS I've ever had. A nice crispy texture, not hard, with a great flavor. Much better than any regular wheat flour pretzels you can buy. Try them... if you dare...

review/summary: Awesome snack choice for Celiacs
review/text: I bought these pretzels for my dad, who suffers from Celiac disease and Type 1 diabetes. He has a hard time keeping any weight on due his restricted diet, and often resorts to potato chips for his sole source of carbs between meals. He absolutely loves these pretzels, and said he enjoys them more than the regular kinds. I think they taste excellent, with that very slight "burnt" flavor that makes pretzels so good. They also seem to have a delicious buttery aftertaste IMO. Plus, they're very satisfying and healthier than potato chips.

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Pretzel - I love these!!!
review/text: I love these pretzels.  They are just hard to find.  I think pretzels have too much salt on them and I am always trying to scratch off the salt with my finger nails or a knife or something.  Even if I wasn't trying to watch my salt intake I try to take the salt off because they just put too much salt on pretzels.  These pretzels are really very good tasting.  I was afraid because they are gluten free they wouldn't taste very good because a lot of the gluten free products you sacrifice taste.  But not with these.  These are very close to regular pretzels and I am so glad they come in salt free.  I buy them by the case.
