review/text: I really like the idea of the large filter on the bottom.  I hate when one of my K-cups would not work correctly and leak everywhere but this design prevents that. The coffee tastes great with no bitter after taste. I will be buying this again!

review/summary: Great coffee, less waste in packaging
review/text: This coffee is a good selection if you like a dark, full-bodied brew to chase the fog, and dislike the waste inherent with the convenience of a Keurig K-cup brewer. Works great, less material waste and less packaging waste. I do think it is a good idea to keep them in a sealed container, but an old coffee can works great.

review/summary: Not bad - Had better - I'd buy it again
review/text: The flavor of the the Fog Chaser is pretty good. Bold, yet not "too" strong.<br />The cup design seems to work/brew okay, just maybe allows for a small amount of "fines" to sneak into the coffee cup.<br />The price is attractive and makes it a "re-buy" if I'm running low on Coffee People Donut Shop...<br />These need to be kept in a air tight container. I use a zip baggie.

review/summary: Great aroma, rich taste
review/text: When I ordered this coffee, I hoped the majority of the reviews were correct, and they were. I am really happy with Fog Chaser. I've bounced around through all the Keurig dark roasts and in my opinion, this is better than all of them. The aroma and taste far surpass any K-cup I've ever had. I store the coffee in an air-tight container, and have had no problems with freshness. They work perfectly in my B70 brewer, and I do wash the K-cup holder every couple of days or so because these have a real filter instead of plastic. The price is great, especially with Subscribe and Save - never going back to plastic K-Cups!

review/summary: Review for non-coffee snobs
review/text: I like coffee but I don't have a palate that can differentiate between a coffee with subtle hints of vanilla, grass and one with "smokiness." I just know whether I like it or not. To me there's two kinds of coffee, the smooth kind and the kind that has a bite.<br /><br />I feel like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts have a bite to them, something that makes them different. This Fog Chaser coffee is like that. There's something about it that makes it different and I think it's really good!<br /><br />The cups are not your normal K cup so I just got a metal tin and put them in there to keep them fresh.<br /><br />If you do the subscribe and save on amazon, it makes these cups very affordable (for k cups).<br /><br />Overall, very good coffee.

review/summary: Very Good Tasting/Pleasant to Drink
review/text: Coffee has a very good taste, is not bitter and has a pleasant aroma. The only problem I have with it is it comes in a fiber womb, not plastic like most other K-Cups. And sometimes it allows the coffee sediment to leak through. It doesn't happen all the time, found to be about 20-25% of the time. Also you have to place cups in a zip lock baggie to keep fresh, after you open Mfg's.bag. If it weren't for this I would have given it 5 Stars.

review/summary: Not Quite a K-Cup, but awesome coffee!
review/text: First of all, the coffee is quite rich, and definitely appropriately labeled Fog Chaser!  Non bitter, smooth bold medium-dark roast.  It is one of my personal favorites.  But the purchaser should be aware of how this coffee is packaged. It works great in the Keurig machines but the packaging is not a true K-cup.  A K-cup, as designed (and probably patented), is a small plastic cup sealed with a foil lid, under which is a coffee filter pouch of a single serving of coffee.  The packaging on this does not have the plastic cup encasing the foil lid and filter paper pouch of coffee.  I suspect the manufacturer is saving in paying licensing fees from using the K-Cup design by excluding the cup.  But you have to use different storage containers for these packages, as using the usual racks and other means of storing K-Cups will allow air to get to the coffee and cause it to go stale unless stored in an air-tight container or plastic bag.  Also, this packaging may not work in Keurig brewers that automatically dispose of the spent K-Cups.  Another slight inconvenience is that the brewed package leaves a wet coffee filter sack of coffee grounds, whereas with a genuine K-Cup, the spent package only has one small hole in the bottom of the plastic cup, the rest of the package is dry upon disposal handling.

review/summary: Fantastic Product and a BIG Surprise
review/text: I am very surprised that the biggest secret about San Francisco Bay single service coffee , which works perfectly in famous brand K-Cup makers, has not been revealed in any of the previous comments.  Or at least I did not find the secret yet revealed.  I love Amazon.com and am a high volume customer but folks, you can get this product at COSTCO at a significant savings.  An 80 count box at COSTCO is just around $30; unit cost is about 34 cents.  Do not hesitate because of the 80 count box.  The contents are packed 8 units to a heavy duty sealed nitrogen filled bag that will hold for over a year.  You will find the 'good until' date clearly printed on each bag.  When you cut open the bag (you will need scissors) the phenomenal fragrance of freshly ground French Roast coffee comes right at you.  If you like that rich smell of fresh ground, this will be almost as good as when you drink it after brewing.<br /><br />So is this a good coffee?  I am an old restaurant guy and I always prefer my coffee rich, dark and not bitter.  I tried virtually all the K-cup samplers available so I could do a comparison of the DARKS, BOLDS and FRENCH ROASTS I could find.  Other than a few Sumatra brews, this SF BAY product stood out at the top of the list.  That even includes the really expensive stuff that is good but not good enough to be price competitive or flavor superior. If you do not at least try this coffee in your K-Cup brewer, you are missing a unique opportunity for quality and value.  If you shop at COSTCO, you need to look for it and get the best competitive single serve French Roast around town.  You will also find that San Francisco Bay bulk coffees have been sold at COSTCO for a very long time.<br /><br />Now, about that little filter material container in place of the plastic cup you are used to seeing.  Well, the Rodgers Family who produce all the San Francisco Bay Coffees (and other labels), are independent and want us all to get their premium coffees without having to pay the Royalties to use the "K-Cup" brand name...and they do not want to infringe on copyright designs, so they were inspired to have this design created.  The entire container portion of the unit is indeed a filter and allows for the best extraction methodology.<br /><br />You must be asking yourself if I am a "shill" for this company and the answer is an emphatic NO.  I am just a life long student of consumer economics and I really like to give credit when and where it is earned.  The Rodgers family business is located in Lincoln, California in the vicinity of where I live - and I also like to support my local business.<br /><br />You may forget all about what I have said here, but you will always remember San Francisco Bay French Roast once you have tasted it.

review/summary: Good Cup of Coffee
review/text: Like others here I am always on the lookout for a K-Cup bargain. With such an attractive price I finally decided to give San Francisco Bay's Fog Chaser a chance. I was a little worried about the unique design of these cups. However, after receiving them and brewing a couple of cups of coffee I can say that there was no need to worry. I would describe this coffee as Medium roast, maybe leaning towards dark. It has a nice distinctive flavor, and the Amazon Frustration Free packaging really is frustration free. We store our open cups in a sealed container to help maintain freshness. All in all a good cup of coffee, and as long as the price remains competitive I will be a repeat customer.

review/summary: Wow It Really Works!
review/text: What a surprise when I got home from the grocery store and opened this package to find cups that really look nothing like the ones you are used to.  I was a little worried when I saw that instead of all plastic, this actually is made out of very little plastic and the coffee is actually held in material just like regular coffee filters.  I love that they are not as destructive to the environment as the others.  The company really believes in freshness since they put these little pod/pouches in a sealed pouch and then stick them in the cardboard.<br /><br />Now mind you I am truly wedded to my Green Mountain Dark Magic, but I decided to try this because of the price.  And I'm not one bit sorry I did, I feel a tad guilty for semi-abandoning my Green Mountain! This Fogchaser blend  makes a good strong  cup of coffee without giving me the  feeling that the lining of my stomach is going to burn out.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to see that I now have an alternative to Green Mountain and I can even save money since it is at least 3 dollars cheaper (at least in my grocery store) a package.

review/text: Decided to give this a try since k-cup (all coffee?) prices have been going up.  Brewed with the large mug (not tumbler) size on my Keurig B70.  It isn't as dark as Peet's from my ekobrew adapter, but that might be because Peet's does a darker roast.  Stronger than Green Mtn Colombian.  Maybe about the same as Dark Magic.<br /><br />Coworkers agreed that we'll probably buy more since we don't have to do any coupons from other vendors to get good coffee at this price.

review/summary: A step in the right perfection
review/text: 5:45 a.m. The alarm just went off. You want to be on the road before 7. You find the kitchen, get out the kettle and start the water boiling. Get out the Boodum, fill it up. Wait. Water boils. Pour it in the press. Wait.  Wait more. Can't wait any longer. Push plunger, drink, coffee is weak, pillow starts calling your name, you lose the will to shower, next thing you know, it's 8:15 and you're praying for the grid to melt down.<br /><br />OR, you get up at 5:45 a.m., drop a K-Cup in your Keurig, push a button and your cup runneth over (especially if you accidentally pushed the button with the picture of the mug on it).  And if it's San Francisco Bay Fog Cutter, you also get a deliciously rich, full-bodied, fragrant brew that is acid free and gentle on an early morning tummy.  Best of all, you can drink your Fog Cutter while waiting for the stuff in the Boodum Coffee Press to be ready. Now you can face the shower, the hair dryer, the curling iron and the eyelash curler without fear.<br /><br />I prefer the Boodum to the Keurig, but when you need coffee now, this blend can't be beat.  It's the best of all the K-Cup offerings that I've tried, and I've tried everything from Donut Shop to Newman's Own and most points in between.  It is my early morning wake up favorite.<br /><br />I was very amused, not to say impressed, by one reviewers comments about the packaging  He notes that there is a drawing of a K-Cup type machine on the front of the box and a list of various K-Cup brewers that will accommodate this version of the K-Cup.  He points out that the San Francisco Bay Coffee supports many environmental projects, as noted on the top of the box, which also shows photos of these worthy projects.  The Rodgers Family, who own the company, are shown in a family photo on one side flap, along with an essay on the company's values.  The other flap has a description of the actual coffee.  This guy is a whiz in the a.m.  I'm happy if I find the sink on the first try.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the best pre-coffee coffee I've ever had. And it's an excellent main course coffee too.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I generally like the stronger coffees.  A lot of the k-cups have been very weak and flavorless.  I have nearly finished my first order of the Fog Chaser and it is one of the better coffees I've had for the Keurig.  The k-cups are little different than the traditional plastic cups, but who cares?  And I can't figure out what "smell" other reviewers are talking about.  When you open a bag, it smells like ground COFFEE.  Uh, that is not a bad thing.  It is because the cups are made of a breathable filter pouch.  What does a box of regular K-cups smell like?  Plastic cups?<br />Each twelve comes in its own sealed plastic bag so I am not worried about them going stale unless it takes you a couple months to drink 12 cups.  And the price is much lower than most of the of the other brands.  I can't see spending 1 1/2 to 2 times as much for coffee that is either not as good or at best just as good.  I singed up for the subscribe and save to get it delivered regularly so I dont run out.  I just hope others find it as great tasting as I do so amazon keeps carrying it!

review/summary: Tasty, but too messy.
review/text: I wish I didn't feel like I have to give this product a low rating, but I wouldn't buy it again without some changes.  It's really delicious coffee -- bold and flavorful, without the mouth-puckering acidity of some of the coffee I've tried.  The flavor changes as it cools, too.  Most delightful.<br /><br />However.  The first time I used one it really made a mess.  I had to clean coffee grounds out of the brewing doohickey on the Keurig (which I hate doing because it's tedious), and there was quite a bit of sediment in my cup, too.  It's exactly the same thing that happens with my reusable k-cup.  I was trying to find an alternative to that, and to contributing so many of those little plastic planet-polluter K-cups to the landfill.  (We drink a lot of coffee.)<br /><br />If the company could find a way to keep that from happening -- a coarser grind, maybe? -- I'd for sure try this again.  I can use the remaining pods, though. They'll be handy for traveling with. I tried opening one and brewing the coffee in my Aeropress and they're just right for that.<br /><br />And then, later on...<br />I had to come back and update this review.  We ran out of Kcups, and I dug these out of the cupboard in desperation.  My husband likes them so much that I'm ordering more, messy or not.  BTW, he said he considers the sediment minimal, and not much of an issue at all.

review/summary: A "Greener" K-Cup!
review/text: These brilliant K-cups have about 10-20% of the plastic of a normal K-cup.  A persistent criticism of K-Cups in the press is the amount of plastic that winds up in the landfill.  We all know (and love) the ease of popping in a cup, pressing the brew button, and tossing the cup afterwards.  So easy!  However I've always felt guilty about the waste, as normally I compost coffee grounds and of course there is no plastic associated with a paper coffee filter.  You can buy refillable K-cups but none of them fit my B30 apparently and anyway the convenience factor diminishes greatly.  These work in my B30 perfectly.  It's hard for me to judge the taste - I add milk and sugar - but the bouquet is pleasing.

review/text: Function: these cupless k-cups work perfectly in our Keurig B130 (the business version of the small personal brewer).<br /><br />Less waste: I was terribly disappointed when I discovered that the plastic k-cups aren't recyclable.  These are a terrific low-guilt, more responsible alternative.<br /><br />Less storage space: they take up much less room to store.  I buy my k-cups in quantity to save money, but then I had to dedicate a large cabinet to storing them!  Not so with these, partially because they're less bulky and partially because...<br /><br />Great Price: these k-cups are much less expensive than other brands, especially at the Subscribe & Save price.  At this price, I can buy less at a time and still pay way less per cup than I could finagle with coupons & sales & bargain-shopping the major brands.<br /><br />Taste: Ok, obviously this is the most important factor...and so as soon as they arrived I threw one in and...hurray, they're tasty!  Fog Chaser is a slightly less strong taste than I usually drink, but I find it pleasant & smooth & complex in flavor.  It tastes like it smells, which is very nice.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm keeping my subscription.  How can you beat cheap, tasty, less bulky, and less waste?  You really can have it all.<br /><br />Update a month later: this roast has really grown on me!

review/summary: Great Coffee -- some of cups flawed
review/text: Yes, these cups have to be kept in a bag or jar to keep their freshness. However, there are only 12 cups per bag, so I didn't find any flavor loss when I clipped the bag closed. I used 12 in about 15-18 days.<br /><br />I loved the flavor: a nice, rich cup when set on medium setting on my Keurig (which is what I always use except for some weak flavored blends). They fit perfectly in my B70 Keurig -- and I love saving on extra packaging.<br /><br />But I had a problem I don't see anyone else mentioning: Of the 36 cups total, 3 were duds. The water flowed them, but only light brown water came out. Three out of 36 is too high a failure rate for me. With regular k-cups (of which I've used at least 1200 in 5 years), I've only had maybe 5 duds.<br /><br />Therefore I rate this as 3-stars for now (not less as I don't see anyone else having had this problem). I might try this or another flavor again at some point because the coffee is good and the price is right. Then we'll see...

review/summary: Great Tasting Strong Coffee!
review/text: I purchased the Fogchaser Kcups and really enjoyed the strong earthy taste. The coffee tastes like "organic" grown beans. I stopped buying Kcups because I just wasn't getting the caffeine kick that I demand from my coffee. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser coffee is the only Kcup coffee I have ever purchased that actually tastes like strong black coffee as opposed to the usual Kcup brew of hot colored water.<br /><br />I will definitely keep my "Subscribe and Save" order for SFB Fog Chaser coffee.

review/summary: Great coffee and great pod/kups
review/text: I have been having trouble with my small Keurig with the regular kcups.  (this is the smallest Mr Coffee made by Keurig and is brand new), but it would only brew half a cup and sometimes the pressure would rupture the seal on the k cup and grounds would overflow...I bought the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser and not only is the taste awesome...but my keurig loves them...I think the filter bottom vs, the plastic cup allows the water to flow thru better and I get a full cup every time and no more mess!  I was going to return the Keurig and try something different...Not now!  Mr. Coffee Single Serve Powered by Keurig Brewing Technology

review/summary: Good coffee with one BIG flaw!
review/text: I really liked this coffee, but it will not be on my list of coffees to buy again because of the one major flaw.  It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused "k-cups" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.  I like to have variety in the morning whether it be Jet Fuel or Italian roast according to how I feel that day so these won't be purchased by me again.

review/text: I went into this purchase with an open mind. I liked the price and thought about how nice it would be to finally get a serious French Roast for my Keurig. Unfortunately this one did not measure up in the strength of flavor dept. I may try some of their other coffees though because I liked everything else about them very much. I just need my French Roast to have more punch than this one.<br /><br />***** price<br />***** fast shipping<br />**  French Roast flavor<br /><br />Sorry guys but I'll stick with Midnight Magic and Jet Fuel for now.<br /><br />Please some show me a reasonably priced French Roast K cup that actually tastes like a French Roast.

review/summary: Great coffee. Great price. Get a ziploc & enjoy
review/text: I like strong coffee and this coffee taste very good even when brewed on the big/travel mug setting. It's flavorful, not burnt tasting, and has a good kick. And to me represents a standout value in the world of Keurig choices. Do the math, especially with Subscribe and Save. I know some folks complain about them losing freshness... I just transfer them to a ziplock bag upon opening the package. Not a big deal and I don't sense I've lost freshness.<br /><br />I'd dock them half a star for the bag-to-bag transfer  (here's an idea: package them with a zipper, like cold cuts!) but it still rounds up to 5 stars. :-)

review/text: I have purchased these k-cup/pods a couple of times.  They brew a nice strong cup of coffee.  Bold flavor without bitterness.  These pods work great in my Keurig.  They brew a great clean cup of coffee.  I haven't had a problem with freshness because I go through a twelve pack in a few days.  If you want a flavorful and bold cup of coffee give Fog Chaser a try.

review/summary: Half a K-Cup?
review/text: I at first thought I ordered the wrong product, and had to go back and check. This defeats much of the purpose of a K-Cup, having a sealed package with nitrogen gas to keep it fresh until ready to use. When I opened the bag, it was a great smell, as all the aroma escaped into the atmosphere!<br />Know how do you keep the rest fresh? Opening and closing a zip lock isn't going to cut it, as air gets in each time.<br />Also, without the cup, I don't think the coffee gets a chance to 'seep' long enough, as it seems a bit weak for something called Fog Cutter.<br />Think I'll avoid this one in the future.

review/summary: If you like McDonalds Coffee...,
review/text: I found this coffee to be a bit too mild and flavorless for my taste. It reminded me a lot of the coffee I sometimes have to have when the family all wants to stop at Mcdonalds for breakfast. I also found that the coffee pods/K-cup quickly lost its freshness after two days. I had it inside an air tight container but soon after a couple of days the freshness was gone and the aroma of the coffee smelled like the can of Folgers that my mother-in-law has on her shelf. They also make a french roast which I thought was OK. But again, a bit weak for a french roast coffee. The french roast coffee, as was with the fog chaser,after a couple of days, soon lost its flavor and the aroma became "Folgers coffee" like. I guess the packaging makes a difference. In conclusion, I do not think I will be purchasing this again.

review/text: I actually stopped using my Keurig coffee machine for several months before finding these tasty SF Bay fog chasers.  Now I'm using my k-machine nearly every day again and loving it.  The best part of these k-cups is they're not made entirely out of plastic like all the rest.  I do think that the "all plastic" k-cups affect the overall taste of the coffee.  The fog chasers have a "filter paper" bottom that contributes to a much more authentic brewed coffee taste.  Great deal and a great cup of coffee!!!

review/text: Yep - I'm totally sold!  And it's about time too :)  I love a strong / bold flavor that's not too bitter.  My favorite brands were Black Tiger by Coffee People and Extra Bold by Paul Newman.  However, the price of K-Cups keeps going up and up! So I saw these and decided to give it a try. I'm a big fan of Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" program b/c it's so flexible where I can choose my delivery from anywhere from once every 1 months, all the way to every 6 months.  So I generally signe-up for the S&S for many things starting off a delivery every 6 months just to see if I like it.  Unfortunately for me I end-up liking many of my S&S items and bumping the delivery to every 2 months! But the price for this at .41 cents is unbeatable.  And the flavor is right up there with my Black Tiger & Extra Bold.  So this is it - I've found my new coffee, at a great price, with less plastic.  A win-win all the way around!

review/summary: Good coffee, less plastic!
review/text: I love my Keurig, but the cost of the cups had me looking for a better deal, and I was getting tired of adding to the plastic in the world with every cup of coffee.  I tried peeling the tops and bought the new lids to iron on (too messy and time consuming) and I do have the refillable cups you can use repeatedly, but those are messy, too.  I always thought the goal of a Keurig was a quick single cup of good coffee without the mess or fuss of a regular coffee maker. During a recent browsing day on Amazon, I ordered this product.  Surprisingly, the missing bottom to the cup is not an issue!  Spouse and I love the coffee, it is rich (read strong) enough for him, and tasty for me (I add a little hot water to mine.)  If you want to recycle the grounds, they are much easier to get to since you only have to tear open the paper basket on the bottom.  The cups come in sealed bags of 10 cups at a time to preserve freshness, so buying 80 is no problem.  This purchase was cheaper than my local Costco, too.  I also bought the decaf, and it is great as well.  Definitely a recommend!

review/summary: Excellence in every way!
review/text: This product is exactly what I have been looking for - a reasonably-priced per-serving K-cup!  San Francisco Bay has successfully found a solution to the royalty/licensing issue that has kept K-cup prices in the $0.60-0.80 per-serving range.<br /><br />My requirements for coffee are best described by Louis L'Amour - "hot as hell and black as sin."  Surprisingly, the quality of this coffee tops any Starbuck's I have ever tasted.  In fact, having tasted nearly every coffee offered by Gevalia (of which I am a subscriber, and have been for years), I can say San Francisco Bay Coffee rivals even some of the seasonal/limited edition coffees from Gevalia.<br /><br />For anyone snobbish enough to bad-mouth the quality of this coffee, if one is really such a connoisseur of coffee, one should also know enough to keep the bag tightly closed and preferably in the freezer.<br /><br />I wish this family-owned company the best of luck, kudos on meeting a market need in such a delicious way, and PLEASE offer subscriptions in 2- or 3-week intervals!  36ct. will not last me a full month!<br /><br />Protip: Store in an emtpy resealable plastic coffee container in the freezer.<br /><br />EDIT: Looks to me as though someone was dissatisfied with the coffee (for some reason...maybe poor taste) and reinforced their lack of taste by systematically voting every 5-star rating as Unhelpful.  Classy.

review/text: Having tried 20 or more different k-cup varieties from Amazon over the past 2 years, I must say that this is probably one of the best (if not THE best) k-cup variety I have purchased.  I was skeptical at first because the pictures showed a lack of complete shell for the coffee, and I wasn't sure how the pressure brewing would work.  But I must say that this coffee has more aroma, strength and flavor than most Keurig brewed coffees.  It comes in small bags, containing 12 each.  I usually transfer them to a freezer bag right away once I open each bag.  This helps keep the flavor a little more.  I like it so much that I started my first coffee subscription from Amazon for this product!  If you love coffee, you MUST give this a try, at least once.

review/summary: Best K-cup yet
review/text: I consider myself a bit of a coffee snob. Living alone I love K-cups ability to brew a single cup instead of wasting a whole pot. I have tried dozens of different K-cups and all of them made a decent cup of coffee but when I really wanted something good I had to use the french press. These K-cups are by far the best. I love opening up a bag of them and smelling that sweet smell of coffee, something you just don't get with the plastic ones. The taste of these is bolder and stronger than even the most potent plastic version. Lastly these will biodegrade a lot quicker than the plastic ones making them better for the environment.<br /><br />One last quick tip: Put them in a ziplock to retain that fresh ground coffee smell and taste.

review/summary: Fog Chaser K Cup
review/text: Found this coffee at Costco, 80 count for $25.95, purchased 1 box, should have bought more!!! Went back today to buy more and they have discontinued it ! My whole Italian Family loves this Fog Chaser Coffee, we have been using other flavors, mostly Paul Newman's, but we like this much better, It is Rich, but not strong, it has a wonderful taste that appeals to us. I will be ordering the 80 count from Amazon, I am so happy to find it available.

review/summary: Great Bargain
review/text: I read some reviews stating this coffee was stale and didn't taste good, so I was skeptical, but the price was low enough for me to try at least once.  I'm glad I did!  I would pay $25 for the same amount of K-cups at the store, and this gets delivered to my door for $14!  Not only does this product waste less plastic because of the design, but it also tastes good.  Now, I use a lot of flavored creamer in my coffee, so I may not be the best judge, but my husband, who likes his coffee strong and black, also drinks this coffee daily.  He agrees that it is good, and a bargain too!  This product comes in three individual, sealed bags, each with 12 cups, so I think this helps keep it fresh.  It is definitely worth a try, and they do sell these in stores if you want to buy a smaller package.

review/text: I really enjoy this coffee! I was skeptical about the packaging, thinking it wouldn't fit correctly in my Keurig, but it did! And for the price, AWESOME! I have used the refillable Kcups, the ones where you can get lids and "refill" other cups, but hate it! (I guess I am too lazy to keep refilling and cleaning my kcup) This coffee tastes good too, not the best I have had, but good! I still get most of my Kcups from Kohls when I get a 30% off, I stock up-I love the variety packs there! But I will definitely keep getting these!

review/text: this is a very enjoyable 'cup'. the packaging is not a normal plastic,but a mesh of a sort.it did not pose any problem for my machine. the only thing i worry about,perhaps needlessly, will the 'mesh cause a decrease in shelf life.it comes in a airti ght clear plastic package but i break the package and add the kcups to my other kcups on 50 unit display unit. anyway the coffee is nice. im not a expert but i would say its a medium,so it required 2 mugs for my normal bowl movement.im retired so it does not pose a problem.but you younger whipper-snappers may want to keep that in mind. i always kept a small bucket in my car for that reason when i was young,just saying. and no,thats not gross,whats gross is not to have a bucket,cant make it to a rest room,or when u get to one,its in use. be perpared,anyway happyness and peace to u,ur family,and friends,bye-bye.

review/text: I was disappointed that Timothy's Midnight Magic was no longer available as a Subscribe and Save item. I looked around for a replacement that has a bold flavor and was economical. After reading several reviews I ordered a case of Fog Chaser. This coffee is great. Really great. I also picked up a case of Starbucks Cafe Verona and I prefer the Fog Chaser. It has a wonderful aroma and a bold but not harsh flavor that I really enjoy. The slight inconvenience of having to keep it in a air tight bag to keep it fresh is mitigated by the excellent flavor and price. It's a good trade-off. I have a case coming every month and I may run out sooner.

review/text: The price of this coffee and the fact that it could be a little "earth friendly" convinced me to at least try it. The coffee came packaged as described, so "hat's off" to the seller. But that first cup just didn't do it for me. It's lacking that rich dark coffee taste and the pods leave a residue at the bottom of the cup, so that last gulp just doen't happen. I'd rather fill the little coffee baskets, use a mini-coffee liner and fill it with my favorite coffees than buy this product again. But again, this is a $reasonable$ price for Keurig compatible cofee.

review/text: I was hoping this would be as good as many people said, but it falls way short!  The price was great, but the taste wasn't.  It tastes like cheap regular coffeepot coffee!  And it was too weak as compared to many stronger Keurig coffees.  I will stick with my trusted Dark Magic.  I can make a 12oz. cup and have it taste like coffee.  This brand I had to reduce it to 6oz. to get something I could drink. That's not cheaper nor more convenient when I have to make two cups in the morning.

review/summary: review of unique cup design-not the coffee inside it
review/text: This is a first impressions review of the unique cup SF Bay uses in place of the traditional sealed K-cup design after using 12 cups.<br /><br />The cups work fine. They may take a few more seconds to brew (I haven't timed it) because the filter bag inflates with the hot water before the coffee comes out. This makes me think that the mesh bag is actually sealed somehow and that seal is broken with the pressure of the hot water as it's injected into the cup. A strong smell test indicates that there is some sort of seal there because there is not a strong coffee smell coming from the dry cups.<br /><br />If there is some sort of seal these cups should stay fresh longer than they would if the coffee was completely exposed to air. I am still storing these cups in the sealed 12 pack bags they came in and would recommend storing them in a sealed container if you don't go through them quickly. The need to store them sealed takes some convenience out of the K-cup system but the lower price of these cups should offset that.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, it was good, strong, and tasted more like a fresh cup of coffee than any other k-cups I've tried. It could be the coffee or could be the cup itself. I plan to order a few different flavors in this cup style to find out.

review/text: This is really a great cup of coffee. It has a deep complex taste and is not at all bitter. It is a good balanced strong tasting brew if made at the 8oz recommended level. While not a K-cup per se, it is just as well thought out with it's open mesh design. It is basically the inside of the K-Cup without the plastic bottom.  The person that gave it 2 stars because he/she says the 1st cup may be good but the rest will go stale, is just plain stupid. I guess he/she has never heard of a plastic bag or container. Once you open the package just stick them in an airtight container or plastic bag...oooh that's difficult! I wonder when he wrote that review if he had something more than just coffee in his cup??

review/summary: A Great Cup & Storage is not a problem
review/text: Have the rest of you coffee lovers nearly fainted over the sharply rising price of coffee? When Amazon sent me an email with a link to this coffee it was cheap enough that I thought I would give it a try. I use and love Newman's Own Organic-Caribou Blend and Sumatran Reserve on a daily basis. The price on those k-cups right now is $65 to $.70 per k-cup. I am always looking for a good bold k-cup that is less expensive. These look different than a k-cup and they need to be in an airtight container after you open them. You need a small container as you only open 12 at a time-the rest stay vacuum sealed. I can't understand the fuss about the packaging-it is a simple thing to put them in a Tupperware type container. The bottom line for me is that the subscription price for this coffer is about $.41 per serving as opposed to $.70 per serving-and the coffee is GREAT! I love the coffee and I now drink it daily. I have not given up the expensive blends that I love-but this one works for me for my 3rd and 4th cup of the day. Just give it a try-some of you will not like it-but some of you will find it to be an excellent and reasonably priced supplement to those very expensive k-cups that we all love.

review/summary: Great price for a strong, delicious k-cup coffee!
review/text: I had to try this coffee in an attempt to find a lower price on k-cups. I love it! It's a good strong brew, with a nice smoky aroma. The 36-count comes as 3 plastic bags of 12 cups. After opening the 1st bag, I'm keeping the remainder in the bag, sealed with a clip. It's possible that these could have freshness issues if left out for several days/weeks. I don't think my supply will last long enough to go bad though. I like the idea of less plastic - I like to compost my coffee grounds in the summer and these have much easier access to dumping out the grounds. (I can just tear open the mesh bag.) They fit in the Keurig and brew just fine.<br /><br />In fact, I usually buy the strongest coffee k-cups so I can "double-brew" mine into a bigger mug. True coffee aficionados may not prefer this. It may be too strong if you like lighter roasts or flavored coffees.<br /><br />Tastes great, cheaper and more environmentally friendly than other k-cups!

Maybe if you like bitterness in a coffee without the pleasantness of a well-rounded rich coffee, then this is for you.<br />I found it not an experience to be repeated. I tried to like this coffee, but will go back to another brand. Sorry San Francisco Bay Coffee company - I really tried. The decaf French Roast was even less likable...

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I regret to say that we were disappointed with the coffee pods.  Immediately upon opening the package there was an obvious lack of wonderful coffee aroma, but rather a stale one.  Although the title of the coffee itself was most appealing, we would not purchase again.  Thanks for letting me remark.<br /><br />\

review/summary: Great coffee at last!
review/text: Finally...a coffee for my new machine that I like.  Usually the coffee I have tried has been too bitter with a nasty after taste.  This Fog Chaser is just wonderful.  I can finally enjoy more than one cup of coffee in my day.  Any coffee will pretty much do first thing in the morning, but that awful after taste has no place in my afternoons.  Fog Chaser is flavorful but smooth. If you have had difficulty finding a good coffee for the new machines, do give this one a try.

review/summary: Chasing the Fog and Forgetting the Bug!
review/text: I have been drinking coffee for over 40 plus years now.  Folks, I have tried so many varieties from Instant to Drip to K cups, and the list goes on.  Hopefully, the reader gets the picture...I love my coffee.  Yet, I am not sure what this "stuff" is.  Here is my experience...<br /><br />First, I get the shipment.  Open it up, and I must admit, I do like the nice box the coffee arrives in.  I do appreciate the added note on the box from the Robinson Family along with their mission statement.<br /><br />"Taste the Difference - Make a Difference - Community Aid Program" and there is more information on the side of the box which really sort of made me "feel good" about my purchase.  The Robinson Family goes on to state "Offering the best value to you, our customer.  Treating our employees, suppliers, and customers as if they were part of our family."  I mean all this really made me feel good and I was glad I had purchased a product where a "family" supported others...<br /><br />Yet, that is where it ended.  I opened the box, cut open the plastic sealed containers this "cups" come in, and grabbed my first little strange looking but new looking "k cup".  Please note, as others have said, these are completely different than an actual "k cup", but I thought unique and liked the design....<br /><br />UNTIL...yes, UNTIL...I hate to write this, but the very first thing I noted on the side of this "bag cup" was something that looked like a bug!!  It politely dropped in the palm of my hand, and since it was not "wiggling", I figured I could examine it very closely.  I did....<br /><br />YUCK!  It was some sort of freaking small, slim BUG!!  I thought maybe it was my ole' eyes, but had my son examine it and he confirmed my verdict....<br /><br />Did I go ahead and try the coffee???  Well, again, I hate to admit this, but I figured the bug could not "kill" me, so yes...I went ahead and tried the other "cup" things (honestly, I don't know what to call these little cups").  My first reaction was just "disgust"...The flavor was weak and the cream and sugar simply diluted to the bottom of the cup.  Nothing like the Rev K Cups or other K cups I had used...<br /><br />So, I went to the computer to write a review...no, not today I thought...I wanted to be fair, because, again, I felt a part of the "Family" the manufacturer had written about on the box...and maybe the "bug" was still in my mind!<br /><br />Thus, here I sit today several days later, and just finished another of these cups....and after using a few of the things...I just honestly cannot understand why all the high positives written by other reviewers?  Honestly?  I am trying to like these things due to the price and the "Family" caring thing...but, this coffee is simply too weak and does not taste like "coffee" to me.  In comparison, it sort of reminds me of an off the wall instant coffee on the weak scale...<br /><br />Folks, all of you who have written such positive reviews...trust me, I want to be open minded...I want to like this coffee.  I tried smaller cups on my K cup machine, and it simply gets worse...<br /><br />So, in conclusion, maybe I got a "bad box"?  I mean should there have been a "bug" in it to begin with??  Even with that...get past the bug issue...where is the flavor?  Why does the cream and sugar simply dissolve to the bottom of the cup leaving a bad looking residue as you get to the last sip?  It dissolves "into the coffee" with other brands...<br /><br />I love the price, and wish I could like this...is there another type other than the "Fog Chaser"???  Would like to stay with the Robinson Family, but not left in the "Fog" as this is sort of how I feel trying to drink this coffee ....."Fog Chaser"????  Well, I am definitely "chasing the Fog"...trying to understand how this is called "coffee"????<br /><br />I will continue through this box the best I can, and "if" I find one of the cups different, then in all fairness, I will update this review to treat the "Robinson Family" fair...And yes, I guess maybe I am crazy to drink through all these things since the bug was on the first one, but I figure the hot water should kill any harmful bacteria...hope I am right??  But, again, I want to emphasize, it is not the "bug" that is causing my dislike of this "wattery, weak...very odd coffee".....

review/summary: All packaging, lacks flavor
review/text: The Good:<br />+ Eco-friendly packaging<br />+ Less expensive per cup<br /><br />The Bad:<br />+ Stale taste<br /><br />While I was excited to see the innovative packaging of this new product, it just doesn't taste good.  It tastes likes the coffee is stale, which makes sense considering that the coffee is exposed to air.  I realize the packaging reduces the amount of "exposed air" but it doesn't matter - the taste speaks for itself.

review/text: The coffee is not bad however the product is not a full K-cup. There is a K-cup top and a filter bottom. By not being a full K-cup it looses the benefit of being air tight and not as fresh as others.

review/summary: Not k-cups
review/text: As others have mentioned, these arent k-cups.  Its a paper top with a filter bag full of coffee stuck to it, no plastic bottom.  So the coffee will go stale far faster than a real k-cup and they dont fit properly in my k-cup rack.<br /><br />You have to license the patented k-cup design and pay green mountain a couple of pennies per cup made in royalties, these guys seem to have tried to cut that corner.  But I wont buy them again, I buy k-cups because I want a fresh cup of coffee not something thats been exposed to circulating air until I use it.

review/summary: Bad coffee
review/text: Im usually happy with all my purchases from Amazon, however this was my worst purchase ever. I went by other peoples reviews when I purchased this coffee. The coffee was rated good by everyone so I took my chances and ordered it. My boyfriend and I both tried it and it was not drinkable! The taste and the smell of it was terrible! I didn't even feel I could give them away to anyone because I didn't want to subject anyone else to the terrible taste of it, so I tossed them in the garbage. What a waste of money! I will stick with familiar brands like Green Mountain.

review/summary: Shelf Life
review/text: Received the package and tried one out immediately. I don't know what the expected shelf life is on a coffe kcup but I think this one expired a long time ago. The coffee had a harsh smell, like when you left the can open and the coffee went stale. The taste was bitter and did not meet my expectations. Cross it off my list!!!!

review/summary: Horrible Coffee- STAY AWAY
review/text: I made the mistake of buying 72 of these K-cups. The other reviews were good, so I thought I would like them. First of all, I enjoy strong coffee thats not bitter.  When I got these and opened up a pack, the odor was wierd, in a way thats kind of hard to describe, they smelled terrible, not like coffee at all. They are to be used in the Keurig machines but have a filter casing, not plastic like the regular K- cups, which is not a problem.  The coffee tasted terrible. The date was fresh, so it wasnt that the coffee was old. I will never again waste my money on this brand.  I cant understand why the company would put out a product like this and expect it to sell, I for one will never buy it again.  I drink alot of coffee, 4 cups at least daily, So far the best ones I have had are the Starbucks,Caribou,and Newmans Own (bold).I hope this helps with your future buying decision. John from Buffalo

review/summary: unhappy
review/text: I was unhappy with the smell and taste of the kcups.  There wasn't any.<br />This product has such a great smell when you open the package and bold<br />flavor when you drink it. I missed it maybe due to the no fuss package.<br />I didn't need or want the extra box it comes in but the plactic package<br />it comes in should be air tight but it wasn't.  Other than that, the price<br />was good as well at the timely manner it was rec'd.

review/summary: Good coffee, not a K-Cup
review/text: While I am happy with the coffee itself, I find the description of this item as "for Keurig K-Cup Brewers" to be slightly misleading.<br /><br />As a recent reviewer points out that these OneCup pods are mesh pouches with a foil top. Twelve of these pods are contained in a sealed plastic bag. Once the bag is opened, the coffee does seem to be more "exposed" to air which raises the possibility that they then go stale faster than a sealed K-Cup.<br /><br />Comments on the previous review said that the coffee has noticeable degradation in quality after 14 days of opening the sealed plastic bag. This seems unacceptable to me because the point of a Keurig Brewer is choice - having to use all 12 OneCups within 14 days limits my ability to choose other coffees.<br /><br />All considered, the company is using this "OneCup" packaging to expand their market to other brewing systems and save the costs associated with multiple types of packaging (and possibly multiple licensing agreements?). They pass this savings on by pricing these cups a couple cents less per cup than K-Cups - the price can be further reduced a few cents with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save was the initial reason why I chose these cups - being a convenient way to keep a steady supply of a "house" coffee for myself and guests. This convenience is reduced by the fact that the packaging is not ideal for maintaining freshness. As noted by other commenters, the solution may be to put the rest of the OneCups into a Ziplock bag and hope that this will maintain freshness until I use up the others - not exactly elegant.

review/summary: Not residue, but crema!
review/text: What some think is residue is actually crema, though not as heavy as in an espresso shot. Crema is a flavorful, aromatic, reddish-brown froth made when air bubbles combine with fine-ground coffee's soluble oils. The strong presence of crema indicates a quality, well-ground coffee Crema helps give espresso a fuller flavor, longer aftertaste than drip coffee. This is excellent coffee and the crema makes it better.
