review/summary: Great Substitute for Pilot Crackers, great with Chowder!
review/text: Since they stopped making Crown Pilot crackers I was unable to find a decent substitute till now. These crackers are great for thickening Clam Chowder, at least that is what we use them for ..Rhode Island "Rocky Point" Clam chowder. Heres the recipe...<br /><br />Rocky Point-Style Clam Chowder<br /><br />1/4 pound salt pork, minced fine<br />3 medium onions<br />1 garlic clove<br />Old Bay Seasoning, (optional)<br />1 quart quahog or clam juice<br />Water about 1 cup or more-taste the broth first to see if it needs any at all.<br />2 pints shucked quahogs cut up small or 1 pint clams and 1 pint quahogs<br />About 5 medium potatoes cut into small cubes, old potatoes are best<br />Pilot crackers or crushed up oyster crackers about 1/2- 3/4 cup or as needed to thicken<br />1 can tomato soup or tomato sauce<br />Black pepper<br /><br />1. In a medium pot, fry the salt pork till browned well.<br /><br />2. Throw in the onions and garlic and cook until translucent. You can, if you like, add a teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning.<br /><br />3. Add the clam juice and water. Bring to a simmer and add the quahogs or clams or or a mix of both, cook for 15 minutes.<br /><br />4. Add the potatoes, cracker crumbs(put a a cup of broth into cracker crumbs, mix up and then add to pot so they don't clump up", tomato soup and simmer another 15 to 20 minutes till done. Stir it so the crackers disintegrate and thicken the chowder. Also break up a few of the potatoes, as that also thickens it nicely. Add pepper to taste.<br /><br />5. Serve with clam cakes and more oyster crackers.

review/summary: Perfect as an Appetizer or Snack
review/text: I recently rediscovered these Jacob's Cream Crackers. They are crispy, flaky and creamy all at once. What I love to do is to spread them with cream cheese and then top them with sardines. A good way of getting some Omega-3. The ingredients include wheat flour, palm oil, sunflower oil, salt, sodium bicarbonate and yeast. Notice no artificial anything or hydrogenated oils? These crackers are better for you than 99% of the crackers you will find. I also think these crackers are delicious with cheese. You may also want to use this brand of crackers when preparing appetizers. They are sturdy and won't crumble all over the place when you take a bite. One thing that goes well with these crackers is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QYCH2A">Martinellis Sparkling Apple Cranberry ( 12x25.4 OZ)</a>.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: LOVE JACOBS CREAM CRACKERS
review/text: I was so pleased to find Jacobs Cream Crackers, I used to eat them all the time in the UK. I was excited when they arrived, and got the butter and cheese out to put on them. They tasted like they always did. I've only opened one packet so far, and there are a few broken crackers, which makes it hard to assemble my cracker sandwiches. I'm hoping the other 5 packets aren't the same. Fortunately I can get a large selection of Carr's crackers (also from the UK) in my local Walmart, but I may buy Jacob's from time to time, hopefully they will be better packaged next time.

I rate them 5 star and glad Amazon can deliver British food of quality right to my front door within 2 days. Great food and great service.  I would counter this with a caveat that American palates might find these crackers to be very different from what they are used too as they are not sweet and not highly flavoured but are very crunchy and maybe not to everyone's liking but for me I love them!

review/summary: my dogs liked them, but I admit it does scare me a little that they are made overseas
review/text: I purchased a bag of these at Cotsco and my dogs loved them.  They did not have any of the terrible side effects some of the other reviewers spoke about, thanks goodness!  And after reading that they were made in China, yep didn't even realize that until I read it on Amazon (I know I'm no rocket scientist), I am actually hesitant to buy them again.  My dogs only eat dry food and I give them the K9 Showstopper as a coat and skin supplement (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093W6YCE">K9 Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz.</a>).  They also come with Jerky which is made in the USA which honestly I did not even put much value into until reading about the dangers of dog food manufactured outside of the country.  Anyways, my dogs love them and they come free with a product I get for them to keep their coat shiny and soft anyways so I am a happy camper and so are my dogs!

review/summary: Kingdom Pets Chichen Jerky caused bloody diarrhea in my puppy.
review/text: Last October I purchased a 3-pound bag of this product at Costco and stuck it in my panty until my French Bulldog puppy was old enough to chew it. At seven months, I unsealed the bag and gave her one piece. I could tell that she loved the taste as I watched her consume it.<br /><br />The next day, she wasn't at all interested in her morning feeding (this never happened before) and she was acting very weird. She was making very strange postures with her body (in hindsight this was probably a mild seizure). Then I noticed that during the night, she had had some bouts of diarrhea out of her dog potty on my laundry room floor. I took her to her vet and she sent in a fecal test to the lab. (The next day, the test came back negative.) The vet told me to feed her rice and chicken and gave me a feeding schedule along with Fortiflor powder to put on her food to build up the "good" bugs in her digestive tract. The vet diagnosis was that of Colitis.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't associate the eating of the chicken jerky treat with this incident so about two months later, I gave her another one of these treats and like before, she relished it. The next morning, again she was acting listless and wouldn't go near her morning feeding. This time she had fresh blood stains around her anus. I freaked out. I went to the laundry room and there was bloody diarrhea all over the place. I immediately took her to see her vet. Again, the vet sent in a fecal test which came back negative the next day. This time the vet prescribed a medication for Giardia (just in case) and an antibiotic and told me to put her on the rice and chicken diet again. My puppy was on this medication for a week to 10 days (I don't remember exactly).<br /><br />I STILL didn't catch on to the chicken jerky/bloody diarrhea association, so last week I fed her another one of the chicken jerky strips. The next morning, I  saw that she had bloody diarrhea again and FINALLY realized the association between feeding the chicken strip and my puppy getting sick! I am 100% POSITIVE that the treat caused my dog all of her gastrointestinal problems. I know that she is NOT allergic to chicken. I googled "Kingdom Pets Chicken Jerky" and found all kinds of reports of people experiencing similar reactions with their small dogs after feeding this treat. I only wish that I had realized the association earlier, and I could have spared my little girl a lot of pain and discomfort (and about (...) in vet bills).<br /><br />I read the FDA warning on their website, I called Costco to report it, and I left a message on the Kingdom Pets Voicemail. I also phoned the FDA complaint coordinator in my area (N. California) and spoke to the S. California coordinator who told me that MANY similar complaints have been made about this product. I wonder how many complaints have to be reported before this product is banned? If this was a "people" food, I'm sure it would have been recalled immediately. However, since it's only for dogs... .<br /><br />The Kingdom Pets man called me the next day and told me that the product had been thoroughly tested and found to be safe. He did admit that he was aware that some dogs were not able to "tolerate" the treat and that those owners should just NOT FEED IT. Of course he had to say that so his company would not be culpable. What a crock! I just hope that my nine-month old puppy hasn't suffered permanent damage to her organs.<br /><br />FDA WARNING:  (...)<br />DON'T RISK YOUR DOG'S HEALTH; DON'T FEED THIS TREAT TO YOUR SMALL DOG!!

review/summary: Not Worth The Risk
review/text: We have 3 mixed breed working dogs.  We purchased these as a treat and they loved them. There have been several dogs in our area that have been sickened by tainted products from china. We recognized the issue immediately in our dogs, because other pet owners had written detailed reviews that clearly defined the symptoms. Thank you to all the reviewers on this site and others.<br /><br />We no longer purchase any pet food or pet treat that is made in China or contains products made in China (hard, you have to really check out the maker) to our dogs. They are willing to poison there own people to make a buck, so why should they care about animals in another country. We bake our own dog cookies (lots of great recipes and books out there) we recently purchased a food dehydrator and use locally grown chicken and beef and make our own jerky treats. It's remarkably cost effective if you buy meats and chicken from the producer, instead of a store.

review/summary: Avoid these treats!!
review/text: We got these at Costco, but same brand and size.  Our dog didn't get sick immediately, but a friend at the dog park mentioned some issues with this brand so we looked around and saw mixed reviews, but most of the really bad reviews were old (2007 or so), so we didn't stop giving them to her altogether, although we didn't give her many either, although she seems to love them.<br /><br />A few days/weeks went by, and then last week we noticed that she was peeing 3-4 times in the morning and in the evening, when she normally would go 1 or 2 times depending on how much running around she did.  At that point we decided to stop giving her any of these treats, and within a few days she was back to normal.  Since other people complaining about these treats mentioned renal failure, and urinating often is a sign of this condition, I'm assuming there's a direct connection as it was immediately after giving here these treats that she started having any issues/conditions with urination.

Her vomiting stopped.<br />We were not sure why this had happened. We suspected the treats but were not sure. Three weeks later we tried again, giving her a small piece. Same effect! She became even more ill and began vomiting blood! We rushed her to the emergency care for dogs and they checked her out completely. They could find nothing wrong. Her vomiting stopped. We will never give her these made in China products again. You have to look closely, when we first looked we say Newport Beach, CA and thought it was made there but more careful inspection showed it's made in China.<br /><br />Your dog can't tell you if this is making him/her sick, they are a lot tougher than we are and don't complain like we do.

If they're not safe, they should be pulled off of the market.<br /><br />There's a lot of Google chatter about this product being toxic (just look up "Kingdom Pets Chicken Jerky"). It looks to me like only one or a few dogs got sick, and those one or few incidents are being cited over and over on different sites, making it seem like there's an epidemic. If only a few got sick, it might be from an unknown something else that just happened about the same time. Our environment is full of dog poisons, such as insect spray, snail bait, many ornamental plant, raisins and grapes, to name a few.<br /><br />I give my 55 lb. dog one strip every other day as a treat. He's gone through three bags so far with no obvious problem.

review/summary: Possible Chicken Jerky Treat RECALL
review/text: I've had a client develop an adverse reaction to this product/brand. Please read the FDA warning below! I've also posted more information at:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee<br />Author of "It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet" and "It's a Cat's World... You Just Live In It"<br />[...]<br /><br />FDA Continues To Receive Complaints about Chicken Jerky Products for Dogs and Cautions Consumers<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to caution consumers of a potential association between the development of illness in dogs and the consumption of chicken jerky products also described as chicken tenders, strips or treats.  FDA continues to receive complaints of dogs experiencing illness that their owners or veterinarians associate with consumption of chicken jerky products. The chicken jerky products are imported to the U.S. from China.  FDA issued a cautionary warning to consumers in September 2007.<br /><br />Australian news organizations report the University of Sydney is also investigating an association between illness in dogs and the consumption of chicken jerky in Australia. At least one firm in Australia has recalled their chicken jerky product and the recall notification stated the chicken jerky product was manufactured in China.<br /><br />FDA believes the continued trend of consumer complaints coupled with the information obtained from Australia warrants an additional reminder and animal health notification. Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be used occasionally and in small quantities.  Owners of small dogs must be especially careful to limit the amount of these products.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the U.S, is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs.  To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses.  FDA has conducted extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified any contaminant.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs which may occur within hours to days of feeding the product: decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; and increased water consumption and/or increased urination.  If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product.  Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours.  Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine).  Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem.  Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky.  Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator [...] in their state.

review/summary: Beware!  Comes from China - check out FDA website
review/text: I cannot belive this product is still being sold at Amazon, Costco etc.  The FDA has put out numerous warnings about chicken jerky treats from China.  Go to their website to see.  I would not feed this product to any animal. PERIOD.  Yes dogs like them, but is it worth the risk?  There are jerky treats made in the U.S.A. or better yet, you can make them yourself.  Either in the oven or in a dehydrator.  I use the oven method, cut chicken breast into strips, hang from metal scewers and bake at 200 for 4 hours and you have dried chicken jerky.  Easy, less expensive and good for your pet.

review/summary: Undecided
review/text: I have 3 dogs. A 2yo fox terrier, a 5yo shitzu and a 10yo cocker spaniel, all rescues. I have been purchasing this product from Costco for the past 2-3 years. I feed them one piece in the mornings for break fast. I have not noticed any negative side effects. The two younger dogs love the treats but the older cocker is not so enthusiastic anymore. Maybe she knows something I don't. I have even tried them myself and they are not bad, although it does say "Nor for human consumption" on the bag. I have often wondered what it is about them that makes them "unfit" for human consumption!<br /><br />I have read a lot of reports here stating that their dogs started to vomit or have bloody stools after consuming them. I have noticed that the treats are quite hard and difficult to chew. Most dogs do not bother to chew anyways, especially something as delicious as a piece of chicken, so could it be that they are swallowing the treats whole and this is what is causing the distress? This is a reasonable hypothesis and should be studied further. It's hard to believe that Costco would sell a knowingly tainted product so for the time being I will proceed with caution.

review/summary: Risky - irradiated chicken jerky from China
review/text: I was fooled by the "100% Natural Ingredients" (given you can label almost anything "natural") and the "Premium dog treats" so clearly labelled on the packaging.<br /><br />Google: FDA cautionary alert for chicken jerky made in China.  Look online and you will see many complaints concerning this and similar products.<br /><br />I bought a bag of this without doing any research. I think that vendors that continue to sell product this despite the FDA alert are acting very carelessly. Although my small puppy didn't show symptoms after two pieces of jerky, I will not feed any more of it to him. In fact, I gave puppy a course of Denosyl and milk thistle, to help support his liver function just in case it was compromised - with the prior approval of my vet.

review/summary: Don't risk your pet's life with these "treats"
review/text: We just put our 9 month old puppy to sleep Monday from kidney failure. Two days in ICU with aggressive treatment but couldn't pull through. After trying to figure out what the cause was, our vet asked if we had fed him chicken jerky from China. That was the only thing we could come up with that could have caused this. And we have come across many postings complaining about this specific product. For those commenting on portion control: he weighed 45 lbs and the recommended amount for his weight was 3 treats a day. At most he was fed only one a day, if that. Why would you ever risk feeding your pet these treats when there is a chance that they are unsafe?

review/summary: NEVER BUY THESE!!!
review/text: PLEASE do your homework... any chicken treats or any treats at all for that matter that are made in China are sure to get your dog sick and possibly kill him/her! As one reviewer mentioned... just google chicken treats from China and you will find hundreds of articles linking the terrible treats to kidney failure and ultimately death! The FDA is sure to eventually ban these from being sold. I was guilty myself of buying these treats made in China until I started hearing of all the deaths and did some research. I threw away what I had left immediately! I was fortunate to find a replacement chicken treat made in the USA and my dogs are crazy about them! I may pay a bit more for them but it's certainly worth it knowing that they're safe and seeing how much my dogs absolutely love them. I highly suggest them... Bodo's Yum Yums... 100% pure chicken breasts with no additives made in the USA. I found them online at [...]. If you don't get those than at least make sure that whatever you do choose to get for your dog is not made in China!!!... only the USA.

Shortly after vomiting she started having bloody diarrhea. I didn't know what to do. I do not have money for a vet. I started googling the symptoms and was shocked to find out about the jerky. Yesterday, Thursday, she seemed to be better and was wagging her tail and then today she is vomiting and listless, again. I am so sad. She is like my child.

review/summary: They're great.
review/text: I have been feeding these treats to my dogs for several years without any problems.  I have two dogs, 60+ pounds, who get one to two treats a day.  They love them and have never had any vomiting or bloody diarrhea issues related to the treats.  I don't know if people are feeding them to much, or if the dog is swallowing the treat to quickly and it scraps the esophagus, or maybe the specific dog had a difficult time digesting all the protein.  Of note, if the bag is left open to air, the treats do get very hard quickly, maybe that is part of the problem.<br />Anyway, love the treats - not thrilled they are made in China, but what isn't these days.  I have done some research on the products as well.  On the products website they have put copies of their inspection reports.  Also, after reading many replies from Costco (who carries this product), they do testing on the product not only in China, but once it is in the USA as well.<br />As for the 70 dogs killed, I could never find an accurate source to verify that.  All I see is the rumor mill which went crazy reporting the 70 dead dogs.

review/summary: My Greyhound loves these
review/text: IGNORE MY PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW: This product is from China and was among Chinese pet food products to be found UNSAFE for your pet. If you have any, return them to the merchant. Do not feed them to your pet.<br /><br />---- old review begins here ---<br />I have one of the pickiest eaters you could imagine. She likes very few treats. She loves these.<br /><br />At 74 pounds, she a big female Greyhound. We watch her weight carefully. She's within ounces of her track weight - which is important for joint health. It's another reason we like these treats.<br /><br />Since they are made from sweet potatoes and a bit of chicken jerky, they are healthier than most other pre-packaged treats you can give a dog.  (I've toured pet food plants - you have no idea how low the standards are for on non-human foods)<br /><br />By contrast, these treats are of a very high quality. I've read a few other reviews here and it seems like some pets had a bad reaction to them. Every dog is different, but mine has no problem with them at all. They are by far her favorite treat.<br /><br />My Costco used to sell them but stopped carrying them. Luckily they are on Amazon.<br /><br />Give them a try.

I have had to take her to the vet, each time her tests have come up negative for anything but she was given Metronidazole and Cerenia and it helped heal her sickens.  Her last case of diarrhea, was VERY severe.  There was blood actually dripping out of her.  I did not catch on that it was the treats until I started reading other reviews stating the same situation.  Yes she love the treats but I think they definitely causes this!!!

review/text: My two dogs get a chicken breast filet at bedtime each night.  They love them.  I have tried many different brands; they love them all.  This particular brand has one thing I really like; they are fairly uniform in size.  However, the ingredients list vegetable glycerin which I don't see the point of in a jerky type treat but also provides some carbohydrates.  This may be good or bad, depending on if you are looking for a pure protein source. The reason they get 3 stars, and the reason I probably won't buy again, is they contain salt.  Why? Other brands are only chicken breast filets with no additives.  And yes, they are made in China, but most are.  Just have to use good sense; they are a treat and should only be a small percentage of the dog's daily intake.

review/summary: Made in China, or not; My dog LOVES them!
review/text: Okay, no matter what treat I bring her, sausages, hot dogs, pork hide, she ALWAYS takes these first!<br /><br />I don't know why, but she prefers them over any other. My dog is a mix between a Labrador, and a black retriever.<br />She's 6 months old.<br />I guess she loves to chew on her food. These treats are dried meat, chicken hide, and other things. They're NOT dry or hard, but more like chewy hard leather!<br /><br />My wife tried to taste it, she says she does not understand why the dog likes these, as they are flavorless.<br /><br />A bag like this lasts us almost 5 months.<br /><br />Whether or not they are made in China, or elsewhere, I really don't care.<br />My dog loves them, and they're tested by the food agency and inspection.<br /><br />If they pass the food inspection agency of the USA, they can get imported, and will be sampled regularly. If they are found unsafe, they will be recalled. Usually you will be aware within a few weeks, to a few months. By that time you may have given her only upto a quarter of the bag.<br />To many it may sound like you've poisoned your dog, but that's not true.<br />Chances are very small you'll get your dog sick,as long as you don't feed her this instead of food, only give one or two to her a day as a treat, the levels of toxication are far below anything dangerous.<br /><br />There are people freaking out that they might kill their dog, and perhaps, there is a 20% chance that your dog will die of cancer in the future because of this treat you gave her; but then perhaps that cancer could come from a barbecued hotdog too!<br />So either way, I'm not too worried about it. as long as it looks safe, isn't full of fungus or maggots, or weird colors, and it passes the food administration service, I'm fine with this.<br /><br />Again, if you keep these to a maximum of 2, 3, maybe 4 treats a day for a large dog, the chances of intoxication are so low, that they are virtually non-existent.<br /><br />My dog's happy with them, and I'm happy with them. I add them as a variety to the other treats she gets, like pork hide, cookies, and chew sticks.

review/summary: Pups beg for these -- no problems!
review/text: I am appalled by the negative reviews of this product!  I have two Jack Russell terriers and they just love these jerky strips.  They each get a half strip about 2-4 times a day, and have for their entire little lives (4 years).  Absolutely no problems, whatsoever.  One of my Jacks is allergic to wheat and corn, so finding treats he could tolerate was a big problem.  Almost all dog foods and treats have wheat flour.  These jerky strips are pure chicken -- nothing else.  I have given a few strips to friends for their pups, and all of them are now purchasing these treats.  Haven't heard any complaints, only praise.  Pups are like people -- we can't all eat the same things.  I can't eat shellfish, but do I want all shellfish banned?  Of course not.  Just be careful with anything new that you feed your pets (or family), and respond accordingly.  FDA says they have not found anything wrong with this product, and can't explain why some pet owners are reporting problems.  Irradiation only kills microbes, and leaves no residual radiation in the product irradiated.  Heck, almost all dogfoods are irradiated, and have been for decades.  Bottom line is my pups have no problems with this product, and chances are favorable that your pups won't, either.  Two thumbs up and five stars for chicken jerky!!

We had been giving him the Kingdom Pet Chicken Jerky that I had bought at Costco about a month ago.<br /><br />In looking at the bag, and I'm embarrassed that I didn't do this when I bought the product, I noticed that there was not a clear description of the ingredients on the bag and that the product was made in China.<br /><br />In email conservations with the packager I was told that the ingredients are on the bag and that they were chicken breast, chicken and natural flavorings.  This is on the bag but not as formal ingredients statement but more as marketing fluff. I had to send a second email to ask what the natural flavorings were and they came back with salt and vegetable glycerin.  I was also told that the packaging conforms to standards set by the "Association of American Feed Control Officials."  I looked up this organization and it appears to be a trade association with the purpose of influencing regulation concerning animals feed products.<br /><br />I find it interesting that a packager that claims that their product is natural is not utilizing the marketing advantage of that fact by stating on the package exactly what the product contains and that is all that it contains.  Because of the lack of disclosure and the chatter I see on the internet, it seems to me that there is something up with this product?  Perhaps it is just that the packager doesn't really have any control of what goes on in China in the manufacturing process and is trying to avoid legal liability for statements on the packaging that they have no way of insuring.<br /><br />The tone of the emails from the packager were defensive and my inquiries to Costco as to their policy as to the labeling of this product have gone unanswered.  At any rate, we threw away the remainder of the product and our little dog has been seizure free.  Not strong evidence that the product was tainted, but it makes one wonder.  I will not be buying any further dog food products that are not clearly labeled or that are made in China.

review/summary: Don't listen to the misinformed masses
review/text: There have been no recalls on this product.  The FDA re-released a warning about chicken treats from china.  There have been no actual links made yet which is why there is no recall.  Fox news reported the same thing and I doubt anyone posting here with a 1 star has actually watched the story.  I encourage you to go to Fox new's website, search for chicken treats, and actually watch the story.  Also I find it laughable when people say 70 dogs have died.  70 is the number of complaints the FDA has received this year of illness or death.  Illness or death, which does not mean 70 dead.  It means probably 68 dogs have had the runs when introduced to a new foreign food.  My dogs get the runs every time they get into the cat box.  Recall the cats!  Anyways, it's up from 56 last year which is why they released the caution.  Which is in my opinion a just in case save their bacon response.  Stop listening to facebook and if you hear there is a news story go actually watch it before you flame a good product.  My dogs will be getting one chicken treat each when I get home.

review/text: This is not designed to blow the top of your head off, you want it hotter then add more chiles.<br /><br />Now, this is an island curry, not an Indian curry, so the flavor is much less complex. What you<br />can do is make a great mild Butter Chicken or Fish Curry with this in a snap, and just a few minor<br />additives. A cornerstone in any aspiring foodie's kitchen.<br /><br />BTW, I make a Catfish Curry with this that is fan-f'in-tastic, and it only has 4 ingredients! I love<br />this powder.

review/summary: She'll eat 'em... eventually.
review/text: After buying my 16 year old cat a bunch of different natural cat treats for Christmas for her to try, these were the only duds.  They sounded like they'd be great but, as another reviewer pointed out, some cats have issues figuring out how to eat these - that would be my cat.  She'd pick one up and it'd drop back out of her mouth onto the floor and then she'd leave it there and walk away or stare at the cabinet until I gave her something else, which is quite rare because normally she happily gobbles up most of the treats I give her right away.  She also wasn't enticed by the scent of these as with the other treats I got her, where she was licking the packaging or meowing to have some, and these she seemed like she could care less.  Hours later after she dropped the treats, she eventually went back and ate them but it seemed to be in a way that said, 'Meh, it's better than nothing.'  I don't know if she doesn't like them because she's not used to jerky treats and will be in due time or if she just simply doesn't like the taste, but if she continues to be this unenthusiastic as we go through the rest of the package I won't buy them again.<br /><br />Edited to add: After a couple more tries, my cat refuses to eat these at all.  Didn't even make a dent in the package!  Will give them away to another cat owner so they don't go to waste and hope they have better luck with them.

review/text: My cats love the Ziwi Peak "Good Cat" treats. In fact, my youngest loves them so much that she will bite and destroy the bags to get to the treats. They're flat and small, like pieces of jerky, and some cats take a little time to figure out how to eat them. I've given them to friends and family with cats, and all in all, every single cat likes them...<br />And they're grain free, all natural treats, so you don't feel guilty about giving them to your kitties!

review/summary: My Cat's Favorite Treats
review/text: My cat goes nuts for these, unlike any other treats.  Oh, she'll gladly eat the other treats, but she purrs from the moment she smells these and then she sniffs around for ten minutes after she's eaten the last one, hoping to find more.  The only real downside is the price, but the bag lasts quite a while if you only feed your cat a few of these at a time.

review/summary: My kitty goes nuts for these!
review/text: I purchased a bag of these for my kitty to try because I liked the all natural quality of this treat. You get a fairly good portion of little jerky "bits". My cat is a pretty picky eater but absolutely LOVES his ziwipeak treats. He goes nuts if he sees one of us walking anywhere close to where we keep them, he even tries to grab the treat and the bag out of our hands as we are trying to give them to him. He would eat the entire bag in one sitting if we let him! I would recommend keeping the bag tightly sealed after opening because the portion is so large and lasts so long, I think they might start to dry out too much if not tightly sealed. This time Im ordering three bags, one of each flavor for him to try!

review/text: It's a pretty big bag- it'll probably last me a while since I don't give out treats too often. Little meaty bits look tasty and less "processed" than the grocery brands, which I really like.<br /><br />One of my cats (4- yr old neutered male) likes it, the other doesn't (2-yr old spayed female). But then again, she seems very wary of any treats so I'm not surprised (very strange, indeed). I'll bet most cats will like it.

review/summary: Best Organic Baby Food by Far
review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Fruit & Whole Grain Combo, Peach - Oatmeal - Banana<br />This variety was a huge hit with my son and was given to him most every day until about a year and a half. My daughter on the other hand hasn't taken to it. All children are not created equally and each has their likes and dislikes. I'm still hopeful that she'll take to this, but for now it's a no go. That's why I'm giving it four stars as opposed to five. Although, I would say this flavor is definitely worth a try for any child who has moved passed the basic stage one foods.

The smell is pleasant and it doesn't stain.

review/text: My 3 1/2 month old was eating all the time and reconstituted rice cereal with breast milk just wasn't doing the trick.  After reading what is in this (and what isn't in this), I decided to give it a try.  I LOVE this particular Earth's Best food.  My baby loves it too (I tried a few others too but this one is the winner).  Now she is sleeping more soundly and so am I. At 4 months, she eats 1 jar a day so far.  It is well worth the cost, especially if you get on Amazon's automatic monthly shipping which reduces the overall price. Being post-partum, it gives you less to try to remember too!

review/text: I make almost all of my baby's food, but we buy some for on-the-go and unexpected outings.  The bar is set very high on taste and quality, as my 9 month old has refused to eat some brands we have tried to feed him.  I also always taste anything I feed to my son, so again, I have high expectations.  This food was a great deal, and we like the Earth's Best brand, so I bought some.  My son loves it, and I think it tastes great.  An easy way for breakfast on-the-go, instead of having to deal with mixing rice or oatmeal cereal and his fruit.  The only warning I have is that I thought I would be getting a banana/grain & apricot/grain variety pack, but it is banana/apricot/grain all in one jar.  The wording was a little confusing & the flavor on the jar pictured was really small.  But it turned out to be a hit!

review/summary: A "Charming"  Way to Give
review/text: I have an elderly friend in another state that is suffering hard health and economic times.  She would not take money so I sent this as Lucky Charms is her favorite cereal.  It was expertly packaged and the cereal was in perfect condition.  She was thrilled and to date has eaten every carton.  This year I'm going to expand this to include church pantry and help center donations.  Children simply love getting their own individual little bowl and it makes them feel special.  I believe this is very cost effective on Amazon and is a wonderul way to help someone in need without the "charity" feeling that giving money can sometimes cause.  I can testify that your recipient will not receive "Lucky Crumbs" but the well packaged intact cereal.

review/summary: Perfect Low Fat Snack Food
review/text: These are all natural, gluten free, low in fat and calories and they taste great. Simply put I love everything about these chips. The only problem with them is that they're definitely addicting and I want to eat them all the time. I guess it's a good thing they're such a good deal here on Amazon (much cheaper than at my local grocery store).<br /><br />Each bag has 140 calories and 3.5 grams of fat (one serving per bag).<br /><br />The texture is somewhat similar to a rice cake, except that it's much thinner so it has a better crunch to it. They taste like salted popcorn minus the annoying hulls and un-popped kernels.

review/summary: Cardboard!
review/text: I bought these based on all the wonderful reviews.  They are very flat and artificial tasting.  I brought them to work and no one cared for them.  Sorry but these are not tasty.  I love anything with sea salt but even that didn't help.

review/text: I tried these on a whim and my kids love them!  They haven't been able to have popcorn because of their braces, but now they can.  We tried the sea salt and the kettle (yum!), and now they are begging me to get the white cheddar.

review/summary: salt crave
review/text: These sea salt popcorners, purchased through Amazon.Com, have just enough salt when you crave a "salty" snack.  Delicious.  But best of all, they are natural and gluten free.  This is my new addiction from potatoe chips.

review/summary: Housewife
review/text: Our family loves this product, and my daughter likes it especially because she must eat gluten free foods, and this is good for her.  We have only been able to get this product at a rest stop on the turnpike, and was so glad to find it on the internet.<br />I came back from vacation, and wanted to make another order, and I discovered that the price had doubled.  I was very disappointed  and if that is the case, I will not be ordering it again.<br />We do love the popcorn taste and the seasalt makes it taste so good.  I would like to write to the company and see how to find out about the price of the 40 bags.

review/summary: Cheaper than the vending machine
review/text: I realized I was pumping a lot of money into the vending machine in my office to have a bag of chips with my sandwich from home. At less than $0.43 per bag these are half as much as vending machine chips; and they're pretty good.

review/summary: These are really good, low fat snack!!!
review/text: I have tried a couple of the varities and they were both good.  I like the Sea Salt, because they are a little lower in fat.<br />I was really disappointed to see that Amazon is not longer carrying these, and that I had to pay a pretty hefty shipping charge.  Still worth it, though.
