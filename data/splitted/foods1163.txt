review/summary: delicious hazelnut chocolate
review/text: This is one of my favorite chocolate from Kinder Bueno. It use to be my top favorite, but there is also the Happy Hippo from Kinder which is so very good. Also a must try.<br /><br />Kinder Bueno: each stick has four chambers, the outside is a wafer type material, while the inside is filled with hazelnut chocolate. There are 2 sticks per package. It is addictive. Some people say that one stick is enough. But there are days when I can eat 3 or 4 of them.<br /><br />I absolutely love hazelnut chocolate. When I'm dieting, this is one of the few chocolates that I would eat.. since I believe in saving calories for the best.

review/summary: Amazon saved the day !  Yummy memories of Italy!
review/text: Fell in love with the Kinder Bueno candy bar on a vacation in Italy a year ago.  Got home and started craving them.  Couldn't find them in stores anywhere here in the states.  A computer search let me know that I could order them thru Amazon.com.  The only problem is that I had to order a whole CASE of them (boo hoo).  Order arrived quickly, chocolate was fresh and not melted.  I'm now stocked up, probably for the rest of the year, but will definitely be ordering again when my supply runs out.

review/summary: By far, the tastiest candy bar, ever!
review/text: Recently returned from 2 week holiday in the Netherlands. Always trying different chocolates and licorices in NL- the Kinder Bueno Bar was an instant addiction and favorite!! Found them in 5 packs at the market, single candy bars at kiosks and cafes- wonderful light wafer, the mmmmmm-derful taste of Nutella/hazel nut & chocolate paste. What a wonderful taste and texture sensation. Sure hope it's marketed soon in the USA.

review/text: I'm pregnant and recently miss this chocolate very much!! I could buy it in China, Korea but dont know why it's not sold in US. At first, I don't know the English name of this chocolate and could not find it online. Then, I tried some different key words and found it on AMAZON!!!!!! I know there're different sellers on AMAZON. At first,I chose the one who marked the price a little lower, but then I found add the shipping fee, the total price is almost the same. Finally, i chose this seller with high reviews. After I ordered, the seller sent me an email to let me know I should keep the chocolate in fridge after receiving it. This is so sweet! On the first day I got it, I had 2 bars!!!I know I should have less chocolate especially during pregnancy. But I really could not resist the delicious chocolate!!!!!

review/text: I bought a whole case of these to satisfy my chocolate cravings while I was pregnant, based on the 5 star reviews it had received.  I'm not sure why everyone is so enamored by this bar.  It doesn't have any 'real'chocolate in it at all - it has more of a marshmallow fluff consistently filling flavored with hazelnut.  Don't like.

review/summary: Excellent chocolate bar
review/text: I tried this product on a whim, having remembered ages ago buying Kinder eggs and other Kinder products in Canada and enjoying them.  This is an excellent product, the hazelnut filling is very good, and the wafers quite crisp.  The outer chocolate coating is tasty as well.  I wish American mass produced chocolate was of this quality.<br /><br />The chocolate did come melted, but the product description does warn that one should refridgerate it upon delivery for an hour.  When I did so, it was fine and was still quite fresh and tasty.  Considering I ordered it in early July it's not exactly unexpected for it to come melted no matter how quickly they ship.  (Which is was shipped quickly as an aside).

review/text: I first tried Bueno chocolates when I was in France a couple years ago and got hooked.  Brought lots home and they were gone shortly after.  I was very glad to see them again when I went to Italy a couple weeks ago.  I guess they really are Italian (?), however, I don't care.  It's very, very tasty.  Similar to Ferrero Rocher chocolates minus the crunchy stuff and nuts in the center.  I highly recommend Bueno to everyone.

review/text: Since I can't eat wheat, whole eggs, yeast or soybean oil, I'm very limited in my cookie choices unless I bake them myself.<br /><br />These are GREAT with coffee in the morning or when you want a snack.  Not too sweet, good chocolate taste and very crunchy.  Unfortunately, they're almost five dollars a box at the health food store, so I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.<br /><br />I'll be buying eight boxes of them, so I guess that says it all!

review/summary: Feldkamp Whole Rye Bread , 16.75-Ounce Vacuum Packs (Pack of 12)
review/text: Thank you Amazon for bringing in this excellent product. Yes, it is crumbles a little when you open a package so you need to open it carefully. I open the package and carefully take bread out. I use my ceramic knife to cut it in half. Then I put those halves in plastic bag. The bread doesn't break after you toast it. I love rye bread; I love its smell, taste, consistency. I cannot get enough of this bread. One reviewer said that the bread is not fresh. Well, it is vacuum packed bread and tastes a little different from bread right from the oven. Thank you to Feldkamp's amazing process we have this tasty German bread on our plates. Well done Amazon!

review/text: The bread tastes good, especially when toasted, and pairs well with a variety of foods. My only complaint is it breaks in half with a jagged line just from lying on the counter. I use halves in the toaster anyway, but I prefer to cut with a knife myself, with a straight line. This is a minor beef - still a great product.

review/text: I remember growing up in southern California and my Mom would make beanie/weenies for dinner. That was a good night cause we always knew we would get B&M Brown bread right along side. Now I'm almost forty, and terribly troubled that now where on the West coast can you find this wonderful treat. I will have to order some and hope that it is as good as I remember. I really don't want to be disappointed like I was when I tried Spam again for the first time as an adult, that was truly a disgusting venture. However I do believe how can you go wrong with a classic like brown bread in a can?????? Enjoy your childhood memories as have am and indulge in the past.

review/text: I remembered loving brown bread in a can as a kid. If you've never had it you're in for a treat. My sister in law serves it sliced and tops it with cream cheese, round pineapple slice, and a candied cherry on top. I just slice, warm in microwave, and spread with butter. It sort of tastes like bran muffins but with mollasses. Unfortunately it is hard to find at the grocery store, though sometimes I can find it around Thanksgiving. I was so happy Amazon had it and at a great price. I ordered a case of 6 and shared with family. It arrived on time and in perfect condition, and my family enjoyed it very much.

review/summary: B&M Brown Bread is THE best!
review/text: A genuine New England staple.  For generations, Moms have served this to their kids with hot dogs and baked beans.  We had it every Saturday and it was always my favorite meal. If you've never had it then you've got to try it. Not only does this bread taste delicious warmed and spread with butter,(always serve it warm) but for the preppers out there, this bread has a shelf life of 10 years if stored properly.  It's also a great product to take with you on a camping trip.<br /><br />HOWEVER!<br /><br />The price on this site is WAY too high.  You can get it for about 2.99 a can if you order by the case from a site called BUY THE CASE dot com.  You'll have to buy a case but for 38.00 and some jingle, you can get 12 cans versus the 6 cans sold here.<br /><br />Try it, you'll like it.  Even Mikey likes it!  ; )

review/text: Who would think that bread from a can would taste so good? Well, this one tastes delicious, especially toasted and buttered. Smart balance or butter spray works well too. Whether straight from the can or toasted, this bread tastes moist and chewy. You can't go wrong. If you like bread, I suggest yo try it. The plain is good, but the raisin one is much better. That is, of course, as long as you like raisins. A great item to keep in your emergency food kit.

review/text: I grew up in New England and somehow never came across this tasty, tasty bread.  Not sure why, but I'll trust other reviewers that B&M brown bread is a New England thing.<br /><br />Anyway, this stuff tastes superb!  It has just the right amount of moistness and sweetness - a bit like a thick hearty cake, or a very dense banana bread.  Very good by itself, or heated up with some butter.  I haven't tried using it like sandwich bread, because to me it just seems much more a breakfast or dessert item.<br /><br />It comes out of the can easily, and is very easy to slice.  I don't know how good it tastes after it has been hiding in the cupboard for awhile, because usually I end up opening it a few days after I buy it.  It does very well wrapped in plastic or foil in the refrigerator, though.<br /><br />Both kinds are good, though I prefer the one with raisins in it just for snacking on.  The plain would be very good to use if you plan to top with fruit or some other such thing.

The same goes for all the maruchan instant soups and noodles on this site currently. Wait until the price becomes reasonable, then stock up, otherwise buy elsewhere.

It took many months for them to give us a shipping label to return the item and they have not given us a refund.

review/summary: The biggest let down I have bought from Amazon!.!
review/text: I will be the first to admit. I love Amazon. I love the bargains, my customer service experience has always been excellent. I love the bargain price of prime & benefits of being a prime member.<br />I had been buying Herseys with almonds in the 6 bar / 4 package sets.  All were bought & filled from Amazon, so it seems like I am compairing "apples to apples" so to speak.<br />My expectations were exceeded. I was receiving them quickly & most important..... FRESH!!!<br />So I thought....  "Hmmmm...  The other Herseys were coming fast & super fresh (expiration dates of 03-2013, a bit over a year away from right now, with tonight being 29 February 2012.)  Maybe I should graduate to the 36 count.  After all, they will last longer."<br />So I did go for the 36 count box. The first time I have ever bought one anywhere.<br />When the box arrived tonight, I opened it & looked at the expiration date. To my horror, it is less than three months away.<br />I know it might sound crazy. They are in date. I understand that. But it makes all the difference in the world in the taste to buy & eat one with the longest time you can find to expiration.  Try it sometime.  Take one bar with a date of expiration  with about five months away, open it and take a look at it.  Usually, in my experience, bars that are five months or less from expiration tend to be easily broken, dry, crumbly, stale tasting,  The almonds are usually not tasty at all.<br />Then get a bar with nine months or more to go before expiration.  Open the wrapper.  Notice the appearance of the bar, not crumbling or dry looking, the chocolate is fresh looking & smells wonderful.  The chocolate melts in your mouth smoothly & the taste is fabulous!  The almonds are fresh & appealing.<br /> I 1000% believe you will honestly taste a difference between the two bars and most likely you will want to finish eating the fresher bar.<br />When I shop for food, the first thing I check is the date of expiration.  I have found things out of date by months & still on shelves for sale.  That is a bit disturbing to me.  It happens more often than I like.<br />This is the first item in food that I have ever bought from Amazon that I was disappointed in.<br />For the $28 + I paid, I want to savor the little candies. These I know I will not enjoy. I am sending it back, unopened.  Tomorrow.<br />Still love my Amazon. I hate to write a bad review, but I thought that if there are any other folks out there like me that like to receive very fresh & tasty chocolate bars, that the batch I received, were not it.<br /><br />********** UPDATE **********  16 March 2012<br /><br />I am a bit late in writing this update. my apologies.<br /> I wanted to say "Thank You" to Amazon & Mohammed K. in customer service for promptly contacting me & going out of their way, in my opinion, to make things right!<br />I really appreciate all you have done for me & once again, this is another example of great reasoning for me to continue to give my business & quite a bit of my monthly budget in both discretionary & essential spending dollars to your company.<br />I will continue to do business with Amazon.<br />Thanks Amazon for being a business I am proud to spend my money with & for making me feel like my business & my complete satisfaction matters to your company!

review/summary: Smooth Darjeeling Tea (added pictures)
review/text: I enjoy Darjeeling Tea.  This black tea is mild, almost nutty in flavor.  In my view, the summer flush is the best.<br /><br />Flush refers to picking times in India, where this tea is grown. First flush resembles oolong, and sometimes could be too green.  Second flush (summer flush) is mild, and to me the best smooth black tea you can drink.  Monsoon is least desirable, most often combined with other teas, because of it's bitter taste.  Autum flush is ok, but too mild sometimes.<br /><br />This tea is packaged in singular plastic bags, and the shape is pyramid-like.  I added a few pictures to amazon archives.

review/summary: The Best Organic Oregano
review/text: I purchase Oregano as a necessary brain food. Believe it or not oregano increases the removal of free radicals that can damage brain cells. Oregano is high in Anti-Oxidants.<br /><br />I particularly prefer Organic, so, I recommend Simply Organic's brand. When you purchase this product from Amazon it comes in a case of 6 bottles. The savings over purchasing from a grocery store like Whole Foods is significant.<br /><br />Also, I joined Amazon's automatic grocery delivery program which gives you an additional discount. You will only be able purchase 3 to 4 bottles at Whole Foods for the cost of the box of six at Amazon.<br /><br />Simply Organic Oregano is always fresh with the dates clearly marked on the box and bottles. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: This is a really funny story
review/text: I only drink coffee in the morning and usually only one cup. I'm a pharmacist and used to drink coffee all day long for a little pick-me-up when my energy flagged, but the coffee sometimes bothered my stomach since I drank so much. My doctor suggested I switch to tea.<br />I started drinking L****n tea, you know the one in the yellow and red box, what did I know about tea? I was working at the time with a young Chinese man (a friend of my son's) and he was a Star Trek fan, as am I. When I went out for a container of tea one day I asked if he wanted anything and he asked for Earl Grey. I asked why and he told me that Capt. Pickard on Gen II always ordered "Earl Grey hot" from the replicator. I laughed as I had seen that too and just never connected with the brand and had one also.<br />Well, I liked it so much that it became my favorite tea. I still have English Breakfast and some Chinese teas sometimes, but I must have Earl Grey with my dinner. Sometimes people wonder at my "tea sophistication" and I don't tell them where my preference actually comes from.If they only knew.

review/summary: Ruined a good thing!
review/text: Have been drinking Twinings Earl Gray for the last 10 years or so. However the last batch from Amazon was so mild and lacking the flavor that I had grown to love, that it was almost bland. Do not know how genuine the report on Wikipedia is, but it seems Twininigs, in their infinite wisdom has tweaked the original formula in April 2011. Going by my experience, it sounds about right.<br />Sad when a company has to tweak a great and well loved flavor, and still sell it as 'classic'.<br /><br />I will not be ordering it, till they bring back the original 'classic'<br /><br />Shame Twinings.<br /><br />Update: And just so you folks know..Twinings had said that they would send me a pack direct, to make up for my dissatisfaction. It is over 3 months and I am still waiting. I will not hold my breath. Looks like they changed their customer service formula too!

review/summary: Not a fan
review/text: My favorite of the traditional Earl Grey teas is Bigelow.  Personally, I find Twinings too light and a bit sour.  My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient.  If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo.  If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception).  Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version.  Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves.

review/summary: New earl grey flavor is not good
review/text: I didn't realize this until after drinking my first cup and some googling but apparently Twinnings altered their Earl Grey formula in April 2011 and has added more citrus flavor.  I agree with the mob of Brits upset with this change, the lemon taste now is overpowering.  Try some other brand if you really want Earl Grey.  If you have a really strong lemon tea then go ahead and buy this stuff.

review/text: We love getting this by the case since we drink so much of it.  However, the last case showed up and about 90% of all the bags were not "stuffed" and folded closed properly.  Resulting in massive amounts of tea spilling out.  Not the end of the world.  you could just stuff the bag into a tea ball and that would get you by.  We resorted to shaking all the tea to the side of the bag that was folded closed properly and rolling up the edge and winding the string around it to keep it that way while steeping.  Again, not the end of the world but an annoyance.  If the next case shows up like this I think we'll send it back.  But I don't know who to request to make good on it; Amazon or Twinings

review/summary: The best Earl Grey out there
review/text: Twinings invented Earl Grey blend tea. It is a very light and refreshing blend. The bergamont flavor (derived from a type of Mediterr. orange, not an herb as the last reviewer stated) is not very overpowering at all. It is not as caffeine heavy as some of Twinings other blends (English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast). If you like this blend, you will also enjoy Lady Grey (which adds a little lemony flavor to the blend). They also sell this tea as a loose leaf. Cant beat Amazon's price either.

review/summary: All-time Favorite
review/text: I used to be a coffee drinker. I was raised on the stuff. Being up first in the morning meant I filled the electric pot and got it going. My mother did not emerge until the pot finished, some 20 minutes later. I started drinking it myself when I got my first job at the ski lift. We got hot drinks for free, and I was soon hooked. Some years later, I realized I wasn't really drinking coffee. I was lacing it with so much sugar and creme that it wasn't really coffee at all. I got headaches if I didn't get my fix, every couple hours, every day.<br /><br />So, as a health benefit, I switched to tea. I began with Lipton, but soon experimented with all sorts of flavors. When I hit on the Earl Grey, that was it for me. It's a mild form of the English Breakfast Tea, laced with a bit of Bergamot which may be the reason it is palatable any time, day or night. I prefer Twinings, although I have used competitor's out of curiosity, or availability, I always go back to Twinings Earl Grey. I am definitely hooked again, but with no ill side effects. I generally drink 2 big mugs in the morning, yearn for more in late afternoon, and top of my evening the same way it began.<br /><br />Try it. You'll like it.
