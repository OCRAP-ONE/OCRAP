review/summary: Reminds me of home
review/text: Eating this reminds me so much of back home. I'm originally from California and you can easily get these as well as other noodles because their are so many different grocery store. I now live in Florida which, I only get "Asian-American" noodles. I love spicy food so I normally add some Siracha and a squeeze of lime..delicious! you can even add an egg too. If your on the go, it and don't want to boil the water eat it like it's chips, literally! ..Just put the dry seasoning and break the noodle up and you get chips pretty much

review/summary: Delicious Raspberry Butter Cookies
review/text: I ordered two pounds of Scott's Cakes' Raspberry Butter Cookies, hoping that they would live up to my high expectations. Well, they most certainly did! I can no longer find what I consider to be tasty raspberry butter cookies in local bakeries or supermarkets. Either they are not available or the quality is alway disappointing. Not so with these scrumptious treats. Soft, buttery cookie dough, with really delicious, slightly tart raspberry centers--not the bland, starchy raspberry fillings that seem to be universally prevalent these days. Well done! I'll be ordering more very soon.

review/text: It stinks, it's sticky-gooey-awful, and my cat loves it!<br /><br />My vet recommended "baby food" for my cat when he was having trouble digesting his normal fare.  I tried several varieties but Gerber Beef & Gravy was the clear winner.  My cat likes it so much that he insists on a jar of it to start each day.<br /><br />More expensive than "cat food", it beats the heck out of having to deal with kitty vomit!  Since Gerber doesn't vitaminize its foods for cats, I add 50-100mg of Taurine to every plate.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are the best!

review/text: So, for some god-awful reason, I opened one of the care packages I'd received and this was in there. I only ate it on a dare, and I am glad I did. It smells inticing and salty and one taste of it and I was hooked. It has the consistency of cream of wheat, except it felt like small bits of sand, and the beef flavor is just mildly infused. Now I am hooked and will probably order a bunch of it. In fact, I sure hope I'll never have a child, because s/he isn't going to be left with any food. I am eating it all!

review/summary: You Ladies Don't Get It
review/text: Come on now, how much of this stuff actually DOES taste and smell good to adults.  The last time I bought it at Safeway, it tasted and smelled exactly the same--it's not Amazon's fault that grown-ups would rather eat pot roast with potatoes and gravy on the side.  So, if you don't like it, fire up the blender, and whizz up your unseasoned hunk of meat (which is why it smells so intolerable to our tastes and smells,btw) into a goopy smelly jelly (very much like the jar you're commenting on here). Walk through the market trying to convince your other kids to keep their hands inside the basket everyone's riding in, you stand in line at the end of the day with your feet killing you in those do-me heels guarding the gum and chocolate bars from the other day-care escapees (now busily reaching OUTside the basket for the gum and chocolate), and then embarassingly survive (you hope) the wet (or otherwise and getting smelly) diaper aroma.  Now, pay more for it than at Amazon,lug it all home while balancing tons of paper towels on your head (vs. waiting for the nice-looking UPS guy to set it inside the door where all you have to do is open it and put it on the shelf.)<br /><br />I like shopping in the quiet of my cleaned up kitchen after everyone's gone to bed, paying less for it (with a Prime Membership), and just putting it away when it arrives two days later.  I think that's what we're supposed to be rating and commenting on.  This works for me and rates five stars.

review/summary: Delicious new limited flavors
review/text: These appeared singly in my local grocery store and in the 3 flavor pack in my local warehouse store (BJs) for about three bucks a canister.  They were marked as being for a limited time and they're all gone now, so the only place I know to get them is Amazon.  My stash of Mojito mix is already gone.<br /><br />The three flavors are Mojito, Margarita, and Appletini.  The Mojito and Margarita are refreshing and very similar to the real mixes that I get at the store.  The difference is, I can (and do!) drink this stuff all day long without any guilt since it's 5 calories a serving.<br /><br />Mojito: like limeade with a hint of mint, so good over ice!  Muddle some mint for an extra delicious treat, use club soda for mint juleps, or even add alcohol.<br />Margarita: tastes like Jose Cuervo margarita mixer to me, it even has the salty tang.<br />Appletini: the more I've had it, the less I like it. It's a bit strong on the fake-apple taste and smell, so it's like drinking a Jolly Rancher green apple candy.<br /><br />These are a wonderful treat!<br /><br />UPDATE: this is the response I got from Kraft when asking if these would be available.<br />We are delighted to hear of your interest in our CRYSTAL LIGHT Mocktail Powdered Soft Drink Mix. As you may already know, this product is only being manufactured and distributed for a limited period of time. For that reason, we are unable to provide any additional information on the stores that may still have the product in stock.

review/text: I was actually very surprised by how good these are.  They taste very similar to the actual cocktails themselves.  I bought them thinking I could use them as a version of "skinny cocktails."  They work wonderfully in that capacity.  I've added vodka to the Appletini and rum to the mojito.  While I would never believe I was consuming the real thing, it's close enough, and low enough in calories, where this remains a winner in my book.<br /><br />Since it is stated that these are limited flavors, I am going to stock up.<br /><br />I did find that with the mojito flavor, a squeeze of real lime and a few leaves of real mint really adds authenticity to the beverage.

review/summary: YUM -- all three flavors are delicious
review/text: After stumbling across the Appletini mix and really liking it -- I was thrilled to find Appletini, Mojito, and Margarita in a single package so I could try all three.  These are a delicious and novel alternative to the more traditional Crystal Light flavors.  I keep coming back to order more.  The Appletini is tart and apply, the mojito and margarita have a strong tart/citrusy taste.  All three flavors are refreshing; none were too sweet for my tastes.<br /><br />Each container contains five foil packets.  Each foil packet makes two quarts.  If you typically use single-serving packets of drink mix and don't plan to make this by the pitcher-full, you'll need to be careful to get the right amount of powder, cause it is easy to mix it a little too strong.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I put these in Christmas stockings for my sister and sister-in-law, and I served some to a friend for lunch one day, with so-so responses.  I don't think that any of them share my level of enthusiasm.  I still like it -- but if you're not a Crystal Light drinker generally, and prefer fresh-squeezed lemonade or just sparkling water, this might be a little artificial for your tastes.

review/summary: Crystal Light Mocktails a Winner!
review/text: Love it. Love it. Love it!  I first purchased one of the mocktails an my local grocery during the summer. I was so pleased with the product that I returned to the store to make another purchase.  All gone!  I was told that that mocktails were a summertime trial and that no more would be coming into the store.  I searched and searched in several national stores. Not available or all sold out! I then began to search the Internet.  The product was so hot that bids on Ebay were absolutely rediculous.  I eventually found the product at a reasonable price through Amazon. Though priced higher than I had purchased at the store, the price was significantly lower than others I had found online.<br /><br />Crystal Light has a winner! I see no reason why the mocktails should not be made widely available in retail stores. I've seen nothing but good reviews! And they taste great.  Quite refreshing!

review/summary: Excellent Health Alternative to a Margarita
review/text: I love margaritas but they are chock full of sugar and carbs. I think this is a very tasty alternative. It's not as good as a real margarita but hey, what do you expect considering there are No carbs and No sugar?  I add a little Fresca to jazz it up a bit and sometimes a splash of real margarita mix.

review/summary: I like the tart, not too sweet taste
review/text: I like the taste of most flavors of Crystal Light and I like that they are very low or no calorie.  It's a good alternative to soda.  These Mocktail flavors are different from most of the run of the mill drink mixes on the market in that they are kind of like mixers for the cocktails they represent.  The thing I like best about them is that the flavors are a little tart and not overly sweet like some powdered drinks on the market these days.  I think the Mojito tastes the best with tart lime taste and a hint of mint.  The Margarita has a tart lemon-lime taste with just a hint of saltiness to it.  The Appletini is a tart apple/lime flavor.  They are all a bright green color.<br /><br />Each container contains five foil packets and each foil packet makes two quarts.  Instead of mixing them in a two quart pitcher, I just pour a little of the powder to taste in one of these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006P4BR3E">Contigo AUTOSPOUT� Addison 24 oz. Water Bottles 3 pack Blue, Charcoal, Honeysuckle</a> which I carry around with me all the time and add some ice to it.  The flavors are all somewhat similar to each other in that they all have that tartness, but just different enough for a little variety.<br /><br />I understand that these are available as a limited trial but I hope Kraft decides to continue them in the future, at least during the summer.

review/text: Made according to directions, the Margarita tastes a bit soapy and you have to add lemon, lime, etc to make it OK.  The Mojito also--my daughter loves them, but not these.  Pouring it in some flavored tea is better--I poured too much Appletini powder--but it tasted exactly like apple.  So I'll use them up one way or another, but I wish I hadn't bought two sets.

Unfortunately, the product description doesn't give the ingredient list and, since it was an impulse purchase, I didn't take the time to research it.  I really wanted to like it and had high hopes for the product.<br /><br />For those who may find it helpful here are the ingredients for each.  You will notice that they are all remarkably similar and the sweetener is Aspartame :(<br /><br />APPLETINI:  Citric Acid, Maltodextrin, Aspartame, Natural Flavor, Modified Cornstarch, Acesulfame Potassium, Contains less than 2% of Magnesium Oxide, Yellow 5, Blue 1<br /><br />MARGARITA: Citric Acid, Maltodextrin, Salt, Aspartame, Natural Flavor, Contains less than 2% of Acesulfame Potassium,  Magnesium Oxide, Artificial Color Yellow 5, Blue 1<br /><br />MOJITO:  Citric Acid, Maltodextrin, Aspartame and Acesulfame Potassium, Sugar, Magnesium Oxide, Contains less than 2% of Natural Flavor, Yellow 5, Blue 1<br /><br />The taste is as one would expect from the ingredient list.  To me, it was not only vile tasting but also a headache trigger.

review/text: Great idea, but it tastes horrible. If you've ever had any regular flavored crystal light sit in your car for several days...and it's a hot day and you're sitting in traffic dying of thirst and all you have is a bottle of stale crystal light sitting there - which has been heated and reheated by the hot summer sun - and you're so thirsty you're wiling to drink anything so you take a swig....That's what this tastes like. Old, fermented, modly, stale, very little flavor, which barely resmbles the flavor it's intended to. I'll stick with the regular flavors and indulge in real alcohol...all the while not feeling guilty about the calories.  If I'm going to consume lots of calories I'd rather it be the real deal and taste fantastic, rather than fooling myself with no calories on something that tastes awful.

review/text: Aeroshot is the first energy booster I've used other than coffee/soda.  It's convenient and they have improved the packaging so you no longer have to tap it on a hard surface before use--I like that they are continuing product development. It's easy to keep in the car and easy to use with one hand (not that I don't drive with my hands at 10 and 2).<br /><br />The energy boost is almost immediate and makes me clear-headed and alert.  The lime is a little bitter, but I'm looking for a wake-up, not candy.  Since it's a powder, be gentle when using it so you don't end up with a coughing jag!  I'm looking forward to trying the new flavors.

review/summary: I LOVE AEROSHOTS!
review/text: I absolutely love Aeroshots. I use them all the time. The product actually works. I don't trust any other form of energy supplement now. Most others give me the 'shakes' or a stomach ache. This doesn't do that at all, and I feel it right away! It's awesome! I use nothing else on long drives or at work now. They are easy, convenient and overall a great product.<br />There are a few things that someone should know before they try them though. First, inhale slowly. The Lime flavor is very tart and very strong. I didn't like it at first, but I soon changed my mind. If you don't like it, try drinking some water afterwards. Some people say that the flavor grows on them. It is just so surprising the first time it is hard to enjoy. The Lime is made to be all natural with no sweeteners. The other two flavors are made with a sweetener and are supposedly not as strong. I have yet to order the new flavors, but I am very excited to try them. So if you don't like the sound of the lime, try another flavor (raspberry or green apple). Second, the powder is supposed to go on your tongue (not your lungs). Don't inhale so that you cough. Finally, my last suggestion is that you can't knock it until you try it. This is something completely different than most energy supplements on the market today. So give it a try. You wont be sorry!

review/summary: Blast off...
review/text: Okay, so let me honest, I'm a bit of an energy-junkie and use some type of supplement on a daily basis.  So I'd like to review this product in terms of lift-off, flight length and landing:<br /><br />Lift-off: Take off is excellent, barely any delay, you're not sitting on the runway thinking...I'm going to miss my connecting flight.  In under 2 minutes, you do feel the difference and are ready to handle the tasks at hand.<br /><br />Flight length: There are no jitters or turbulence on this ride, pleasant attendants, but the in cabin movie doesn't last as long as some other brands.  Depending on the depth your inhale (really an ingest), you are likely to experience about 2-2.5hrs of task completion.<br /><br />Landing: MAYDAY! MAYDAY! You are in for a crash landing.  Again, I speak from mens nutrition, weight mgmt, coffee & soda and the latest caffeinated kind of experience.  I have never had a crash like this before.<br /><br />When I made the purchase, I actually bought 1/2 dozen in flavor varieties thinking I found a new bestie.  But honestly, I have completed the vials just because I made the purchase.  But as Levar Burton used to say: "You don't have to take my word for it!"

I decided to add a very small amount of Cinnamon to it and it came out great. A bit high on calories-180 calories per packet. I would buy it again.

But it's quick and easy, especially when you're in a hurry in the morning or on a camping trip (excellent addition to coffee and hot cocoa for variety when camping).<br /><br />It's not as good as what you'll get at a restaurant, but when you're out hiking and packing light, it's good.

review/text: Is this going to give you Thai tea exactly like what you'd get in a restaurant? No. But is it good? For what it is, yes. I bought it to keep at work so when the craving for Thai tea hits me, I can have it. Obviously I can't brew my own Thai tea and add in the ice and condensed milk at my desk and then stick all of that back in a drawer. But I can grab a packet of this instant mix. I am going to figure out how to make real Thai tea so I can have it whenever I want, not just when I'm at a restaurant or bubble tea place with it on the menu.

review/text: I absolutely can't believe the number of reviews for this product saying "It's not as good as what you get from a restaurant, but good enough in a pinch!".... No, it isn't. It's not decent in any way. It tastes like sugar and creamer with literally not even a hint of thai tea, when you smell the powder there is no hint of thai tea whatsoever. There was one other review saying this when I purchased, but I didn't listen because of all the positive reviews. Completely revolting product, waste of money, avoid.

review/text: I found this at a local asian market where I buy fresh ginger for my chai tea, funny, ha.<br /><br />Try to find this product locally, I paid less than 5 dollars for the 12 pack.  Like others have said it is sweet, and you can taste the vanilla/anise.  I never thought to add cinnamon like another has siggested, but it is definitly a winner!<br /><br />Another thing you can add is cardomon powder.  I mix cinnamon powder and cardomon powder together and sprinkle it on top.<br /><br />Recommended, plan on buying again.  Eventually I will look for something more in bulk.

review/text: I needed two vanilla beans for the Love Goddess cake that my husbands adores. So you can spend exorbitant amounts of money at the grocery store for more vanilla beans than you need, or you can order the amount you need with free shipping. Each bean was in its own plastic vacuum package that looked like it could keep for awhile if you needed it to. The cake was, of course, delicious, and my trash smelled great from the two little plastic vanilla bean packages, so maybe you could use them to make something else smell nice.

review/text: Oh my gosh, I just love this Vidalia Onion Dressing.  This is the same company that makes the Virginia Brand Vidalia Onion dressing and has the same exact ingredients and same awesome taste.  Not only do I love this dressing on salads, I love this dressing as a marinade and cooking sauce.  My favorite way to use this dressing is with fresh salmon.  Take a pan and heat it up on the stove.  Add some Vidalia Onion Dressing and then add the salmon.  Add a little more dressing on top of the pan and cover.  The salmon will sort of poach in the dressing.  The taste is fabulous.  I also make my version of a Greek salad with a little Romaine lettuce, cut Roma tomatoes, cucumber, onions, feta cheese and then pour on Vidalia Onion Dressing!  It's a lunch I could eat every day.  You can also marinate chicken, pork chops and tofu in this dressing.  Just awesome.  Get this, you will not be sorry!

review/text: I picked up a pack of these at LAX airport because they seemed like the most appetizing of the least-harmful options.  I rolled my eyes a bit at the "gluten-free," "dairy free," vegan, yada, yada, but they sounded decent, and at least the nuts and seeds would provide some protein to balance out the sweet fruit.<br /><br />Wow!  They are great.  Not only tasty, but they definitely take the edge off the hunger.  The combination of nuts, seeds and fruit are formed into about 1 inch crunchy cubes.  My teenage daughter grimaced when she saw them but, once she tasted them, tried to abscond with my packet.  We are ordering more of these healthy, yummy snacks.  We're planning to try the other flavors, too.

review/summary: oh my, this stuff is good....
review/text: The closest thing I can compare this to is just a handful of mixed nuts and dried fruit.  Except it is clustered together.  I'm pretty sure it's the dried fruit that holds everthing together -- it says there is a tiny bit of cane sugar syrup here, but it's so little that it hardly shows up.  But the nuts are crispy and fresh; the fruits are minced soooooo small -- it's just yummy.  None of that cloying sugary-ness of so many of the bars and nut/fruit snacks out there.  Just light and crispy-crunchy.  great as a snack alone, or crubled up on a salad... or on top of yogurt.  Or frozen yogurt....<br /><br />I've never seen these in stores down here in Texas, but I'll keep looking.  I can't wait to try other flavors.

review/text: I was buying this soup at my local Health Food Store, but the price kept going up each time I ordered a case. I think it was $38.00 per case when I thought about Amazon. Sure enough there it was and for a much better price.<br /><br />This is a good, healthy soup, but unfortunately about 2 years ago I noticed a change in the taste.  I called the company and they had indeed changed the recipe.  I still eat it, but I don't eat as much since the recipe change.  It seems companies can't leave well enough alone...when will they learn not to mess with something and make it less desirable?<br /><br />NOTE: I always add a healthy dose of fresh ground black pepper and eat it with a salty cracker or add a little salt to the soup.<br /><br />Update 3-21-12: Unfortunately, this is no longer a bargain on Amazon as the price has risen more than $10.00 per case in the past year.
