review/summary: pleasant nutty taste, good value
review/text: I really like these hemp hearts.  Last year, I'd ordered some hemp hearts from another company, and they had a stale, fishy taste.  I thought that was how hemp was supposed to taste, because back then, I had nothing to compare it to.  Because I like hemp's health benefits (omega-3 fatty acids and dietary fiber), I decided to give hemp hearts another try.  These are so good, they kind of taste like crushed walnuts, but fresher. I added some to the chili I made last night, and to the smoothie I made this morning.  I highly recommend this company.

review/summary: Excellent quality.  A new favorite.
review/text: The  most amazing thing about hemp seeds is the energizing effect.  This is not at all like a stimulant, but a deep and gentle energy that feels very natural.  There is a caveat, however.  The hulls.  It is probably impossible to eliminate all hulls and caution is necessary to protect teeth.  I would never sprinkle seeds on anything because of the danger that a hull could cause.  Just not worth it, but taking small bites from a spoon works well.  These seeds are probably as clean as is possible.  I am a convert.

review/summary: I was a bit nervous to try this on my own!
review/text: I initially began my search looking for pre-made hempmilk by the quart and quickly found that prices are steep. I compared brands but most of it remained quite expensive. I happened to browse through comments which advised consumers to consider Manitoba shelled hempseed to make fresh hempmilk at home. I went to youtube to figure out how difficult the process may be. I found that the process of making fresh hempmilk at home is quite simple. I just made my very first quart from home and it is the most delicious drink I've ever tasted. This is a high quality product and I would recommend this as an alternative to the pricey pre-made hemp milk. If you have a blender and water, you already have the other necessary materials. Best of luck! Healthy hemping to all!

My container looks different than the one in the picture, it is taller and narrower (I think) with a screw on lid. I have had no problems with the container at all.

review/summary: Would not order again
review/text: I was not at all pleased with this product. I regularly purchase Nutiva brand hemp seeds but when I saw the price of this brand I decided to give it a try. As the old adage goes, "you get what you pay for". I noticed there were a lot of pieces of the outer shell mixed into the seeds which has a very course texture in contrast to the regular texture. While I can get over that, every day I ate them I would bite into very hard orange crystaly bits which I have to assume aren't digestible. I'm not sure if Manitoba is addings these things as filler as a cheap means of increasing the weight or if they're getting mixed in by accident - in either case though it's unacceptable. I would not recommend this product and would probably not try it again. The extra monetary cost of Nutiva is certainly worth it to forego the filler. On the other hand, Amazon was amazing. Delivery was prompt (ahead of schedule actually) and of course I have nothing bad to say about subscribe and save.

Hemp hearts with protein and omegas make sense. They are great in cereal, salads, cookies, muffins and especially cornbread. Buy with confidence. Eat with gratitude.

review/text: Like others have stated they are speckled with the colored hull  material. At least I think that is what it is but I have not had any hard bits or grittiness.  maybe when I get to the bottom of the bags.  I emptied the jug into 3 quart freezer bags and have the 4th in a quart glass jar.  So far have been eating them plain as a snack but would be great on salads or veggies.  A little sweet and nutty.  A nice soft texture, slightly softer than sesame seeds.

review/summary: Great buy even cheaper on subscription
review/text: I lost nearly 20lbs by adding 4 Tbsp to my oatmeal in the morning. Dont cook them just add them on after cooking. Add to salads and smoothies too.<br /><br />This is a good buy and if you sign up for the subscriotion option you get them even cheaper with free shipping.<br /><br />Nothing suppresses appetite like high nutrition high protien whole raw and vegetable based food and few are better than hep seed hearts.<br /><br />Also, don't let this scare you off.. but there is no better colon clemse than adding 4-6 Tbsp a day of hemp seed hearts to your diet. I am convinced that no "colon clense" product works better and that no other suppliment or food will make you more regular. Your body will likely flush at first and you may experience very loose stool for a while but your body will adjust.<br /><br />For full health benefits, better cleanout, and better sustained weight loss stop consuming drinks with added sugars, junk food, and sweets. If you need a sweet fix turn to fruit. Add more veggies to your diet, cut down on processed foods, and meats.<br /><br />Truly this IS a verifiable super food that will make a difference in your life.<br /><br />Here are two great recipes for you:<br /><br />Oatmeal<br /><br />1/3 cup intant oatmeal<br />1/4 cup chopped walnuts<br />1/4 cup to 1/3 cup raisins<br />Cook it<br />Then add 4tbsp hemp seed hearts<br />Milk or rice milk to preference<br />Do not cook the hemp seed hearts.<br />Do not add sugar. Use unsweetened dried fruit such as raisins for sweetness or add some chopped apple bits before cooking.<br />If you are accustomed to using suguat your taste will adjust after a while.<br /><br />Green smoothie<br /><br />1/2 to 2/4 apple for sweetness<br />1 cup or so fresh baby spinach<br />1/2 - 3/4 banana - I freeze peeled bananas so that it provides a cooler drink but unfrozen is good too.<br />1/2 avacado<br />1 cup rice milk<br />1-3Tbsp Hemp seed hearts. Start with 1 and work your way up to test your preference.<br /><br />If you are unaccustomed to green smoothies give this one a try. It tastes better than most other recipes and the nutrition is undeniable. If you want sweeter try adding more apple up to a whole. 3/4 to a whole apple and 3/4 to a whole or fresh frozen banana and an extra 1/2 cup added to the recipe will make more than enough for two.<br /><br />Also note that your body needs magnesium and phosphorus to properly assimilate calcium. Hemp seed hearts are an excelent source of these nutrients and many others including protien.

review/text: My healthy-eating foodie friend recommended this product to me, however, after reading the reviews about excessive hulls mixed in with the hemp hearts, I wasn't sure if I wanted to buy it. I've had a lot of dental work done, and am sensitive to unexpectedly biting down on hard bits, not to mention getting fibrous food painfully stuck in my teeth. My friend assured me that she hasn't had any problems with the hulls, so I went ahead and bought a tub. I've been putting them in and on everything, and I haven't noticed a single hull! I put them in smoothies, on salads, in baked goods, on oatmeal, in granola; super tasty. I will buy this again, it's a good deal.

review/text: This is the best deal for hemp hearts I have found. I love the freshness of the hemp. The only issue that can arise is fridge space. It is a big tub and to keep them fresh they must be refrigerated. My local sprouts was the old place to get them, but it is costs more. I enjoy them on my yogurt the most and by the spoonful. Great in cereal, smoothies, oatmeal fruit and salads. The texture it's soft with the occasional shell, but it's expected. Actually, if you have seen hemp seeds with shell on it's amazing how clean they get them out.<br />Do your body a favor and get these yummy power house seeds.

There's something about the combination of chewiness and nutty flavor that I almost crave when I'm eating it.  Don't worry, I haven't eaten more than 1/2 cup at one serving and probably had no more than 2 of those servings in one day, so not over-addicted, but also wouldn't be too bad if were. . . ?  I find it tasty and nutritious eaten raw, great for a snack or part of a meal.

But the Nutiva lacked the sand and grits.  All told it's a toss up between the two.  I'll probably go with Nutiva next time, despite the higher price, as so not to put my teeth and dental work in jeopardy.

Maybe it's just me, but It definitely gives me almost too much energy.<br /><br />I just eat it straight with a spoon about a quarter-cup to a half-cup per day. I haven't tried any other brands.

review/text: Before buying this mass quantity, I tried hulled hemp from several different brands. For the price, quality and nutritional value, you really can't beat this purchase.  As others have stated, you want to pull a portion out to keep in the fridge, which you can use ongoing, and store the rest in your freezer.  For those interested in aesthetics, the label is a lot nicer than the one pictured, and the tub is a tall rounded black plastic package that's about a foot tall and half a foot wide (make room in your freezer before you crack it open).

review/summary: Cadbury chocolate is the best.
review/text: I treat myself from time to time to British food.  I have lived in America for 23 years, and crave Cadbury chocolate.  The Cadbury you find in the supermarkets is made by Hershey, and has a waxy taste to it.<br /><br />Cadbury Chocolate Fingers were one of my favorites, when I was growing up, and I found the Mini Fingers here on amazon.com.  I opened the tub, and then the inner packaging, to see these baby chocolate fingers.  I put one in my mouth, and sucked the chocolate off.  The chocolate tasted great, and then I had the biscuit crunch.<br /><br />Well, I couldn't stop at 1 so I ate several.  I have to say that they didn't taste as good as I remembered, but that happens over the years.<br /><br />I do prefer Cadbury Digestives, or McVitie's Digestives over the Cadbury Mini Fingers, but will willingly eat them at any time.

review/text: Unfortunately, I didn't find this coffee at all flavorful. I couldn't detect the rich chocolate flavor it is supposed to have. It tastes a bit like weak butter toffee to me. The coffee itself didn't have a robust flavor either, and I used plenty of it. Perhaps I'm still comparing all chocolate flavored coffees with that of the discontinued Millstone Chocolate Velvet Decaf, which was intensely flavored along with a good full-flavored coffee. The Chocolate Thunder just didn't come close. My search continues ...

review/summary: These are NOT in fact Salmiak Rocks.
review/text: So, what I received were not in fact Salmiak Rocks, but Chocolate Rockies. The incredibly unfortunate thing about this is that these two products look incredibly similar and you cannot tell one from another until you eat them. As such I had already opened everything before I realized the error so I couldn't return them. The chocolate rockies weren't terrible, but they were not NEARLY as good as the salmiak rocks and moreover they weren't what I ordered. When you expect salty black licorice flavor and instead you get "chocolate" (I use the term loosely because the filling was akin to a tootsie roll) wrapped in black licorice, it's rather disappointing.<br /><br />I don't know how you can go about ensuring that you get the right thing here, which is a shame because the price is great and if it was in fact salmiak rocks, those are a delicious soft salty black licorice with a sweet molasses taste to it.<br /><br />If you do order this product, good luck.

It might be a "learn to love" kind of thing, but I honestly can't figure out why Wrigley's still doesn't distribute this gum in the U.S..  I saw a package of Cardamom/mint flavor (not Airwaves) in the store recently, so plain old Eucalyptus shouldn't be a stretch for most of us.  In any case - I'll keep on ordering large packages of it!

The menthol is in the candy coating so at first bite you will get that wonderful sinus-clearing effect, but it is not as long-lasting as when taken in lozenge form. This gum serves to freshen the breath as well - if you are going for that medicinal scent. Slather on some Ben-Gay for the full effect and make the girls go wild!

review/summary: Not the Two Leaves and a Bud I remember
review/text: I ordered this because I once bought great teabags called Two Leaves and a Bud that came in a triangular shaped teabag and were very good.<br /><br />These are not that. I am not sure if the manufacturer has downgraded their quality or what but here are problems with these that I didn't have when I originally bought from this company a year ago:<br /><br />The teabags are packed together more tightly now and are squished into small plastic packages, you are supposed to expand the teabag into it's original 3D shape afterwards, this doesn't work as well as the original packaging.<br /><br />But the bigger problem is that the bit of paper on the end of the teabag string (does this have a name?) is glued, actually STUCK, in each individual package to the teabag portion. Try as you might to detach it so you can put only the bag and not the paper into your tea, it will rip the bag, and then tea leaves will leak out! I should call it tea dust becuase tea leaves are what they used tohave, but squished into thier new package they are just and expensive version of any other organic camomile tea, they are no longer the cool unique ones that had really quality tea in them.<br /><br />I am a pretty picky person about my tea, but I am very dissapointed overall as this is not what I remember or expected about the quality of this tea.

Could be the baggie it was in or the sachet, which is made out of some kind of plastic fabric.

I had to use 3-4 tea bags in a single cup  to achieve any degree of strength or taste or desired result.  In my opinion, the packaging is gorgeous; the product leaves a lot to be desired.

review/summary: Mild tasting, great quality whole leaves
review/text: Excellent quality of individual whole leaves.<br /><br />For some reason I get jittery from green tea but I love the taste, so a decaf version was just perfect.<br /><br />Mild tasting and given the high quality of the leaves, you are able to just drop a little at the bottom of the mug and fill with hot water and you will be able to drink without fussing with additional accessories.<br /><br />A pound of tea is A LOT of tea, so I'm sure this will last a while.<br /><br />It came in a resealable bag but it wasn't the best quality and broke on the second opening, so I had to find alternative storage for it.

review/summary: Just not good -- a strange rancid flavor
review/text: I think that the Tabasco folks tried sincerely to make this a good sauce: the basic idea was to mix a high-quality Worcestershire with Tabasco.  It should have worked, but I just think they misunderstood the things that make the classic Worcestershire so appealing.  Maybe they just opted for smoked anchovies or something, but this sauce has an unpleasant smoky, almost bacon-y undertone to it.  I've tried it again and again, hoping I'd get used to the difference, but in the end I had to chuck it in the trash.  From a man who has ordered and enjoyed multiple gallon jugs of Tabasco Regular and Habanero Sauces: this one is just not a winner.

review/text: This stuff is just not good.<br /><br />I will give the Tabasco company credit, but realistically, you just cant throw Tabasco<br />sauce into every condiment known to man and expect it to work, and this does not work.<br /><br />Worcestershire Sauce, particularly the real stuff, has a specific place in the foodie world,<br />and the only time you find these two in the same general area is in a Bloody Mary, but you<br />also find horseradish and and a half dozen other ingredients that mask the horrible combination<br />of the two. In fact, Bloodies are probably the only thing you could use this stuff for, I<br />don't know cause I tossed it the first week I had it.<br /><br />Tabasco Soy Sauce, Tabasco Mayonnaise, Tabasco Pickles... these are real winners. But this<br />stuff... they should just abandon this experiment and forget they ever tried to take it to<br />market.

review/text: Yep, Unfortunately I have one of those "picky eaters" you often hear about but might not have the pleasure of knowing.  Well, to be fair, she is only really picky when it comes to eating veggies.  I think that she was the only baby that did not eat "trees" and even now (at almost 3 years old) shuns pretty much all green veggies across the board.  Enter HAPPYBABY to the rescue!  I could not believe my eyes the first time I tried one of these out on her ... she gobbled it down and was reaching for more!!  It makes me feel so good to know that she is getting her green veggies at snack time every day (you can't beat the portability of these things ... so nice to be able to pop one in her snack pack for school), and because about 95% of the food we eat is organic, I love it that this product fits in with our organic lifestyle.  The mango and pear combo sweetens up the spinach quite nicely ... my girl has no idea she is eating something that is actually healthy for her.  Her teacher always comments about how healthy her snack is and how she finishes it so quickly ... makes mama proud!

review/text: The recipies that Pamala's Company sent us after we called them called for a set of recipes. They do NOT include recipes within the 25 lb. bag. You will have to go to their website and download their instructions for many variations for their various mixes. The brownie recipes always call for a 16 oz. package, and since we had a 25 lb. package we were puzzled about what to do until we hit upon the idea of measuring the mix into a scale. 16 oz. ended up to measure about three cups.<br /><br />I personally love chocolate and enjoy our brownie mix. Going wheat free is a difficult world in which to shop, and the whole family enjoyed these brownies.

review/text: Every so often, I get my dad and I each a chocolate bar so I can get his opinion and write a review of the chocolate based on both of our tastes.<br /><br />I'm picky about chocolate and want quality. He appreciates quality, but he's a quantity eater.<br /><br />This is the perfect compromise bar between our tastes and budgets.<br /><br />First, the snap.<br />It has the soft muted snap of milk chocolate, as long it's kept cool, it doesn't just bend like some milk chocolate bars and it's not as hard as a Hershey's bar. It's more like Nestle consistency.<br /><br />My dad, who used to really appreciate a good dark chocolate prefers milk chocolate now. Sometimes a 48% bar can be too bitter for his tastes. Not this one, the flavor is a good pure chocolate,very smooth, it's just a touch on the sweet side which he likes. He doesn't have any idea it uses beet sugar, so that didn't affect the flavor at all for him.<br /><br />The vanilla sets off and rounds off the edges of the chocolate flavor. The balance of cocoa butter and milk with the touch of lecithin creates a bar that melts well in your mouth. It's very smooth.<br /><br />To him, it tastes a lot more like Nestle's milk chocolate than Hershey's and he really likes the flavor.<br /><br />It's nearly guilt free except for the calories, and quite reasonably priced.

Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

review/summary: Not the same as the canned version

What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and "other natural flavors", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not "slivered" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned "Honey Roasted Almonds" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased.

Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I love salted and smoked almonds. I had never even heard of Butter Toffee almonds before.  But, wow, I'm glad I tried them.  They are just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth without overwhelming you with a sugar taste.<br />Another reviewer was right, they taste a lot like french toast.  I'm definately buying these again.

review/summary: Should almost be labelled a "BOLD" flavor
review/text: Butter Toffee is not a flavor I thought I would like - for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor. However, I became hooked at first bite. This flavor is much sweeter than the Honey Roasted. It certainly becomes my top "dessert almonds" when in need of that sweet replacement.<br /><br />Absolutely great for those on a low-carb or Keto diet - only 6 Net Carbs per serving. The bold, sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Best almonds ever
review/text: These almonds are my favorite almonds.  Wal-Mart used to carry them, but now I have to order online.  They are the perfect balance of cinnamon and sugar without being overpoweringly sweet.

review/summary: If You Like Almonds and You Like Cinnamon You will like these
review/text: The Almonds are very very fresh tasting.  The cinnamon adds an extra bonus of goodness to the almonds with a great flavor.  We keep them in the fridge.  We also mix them with all the other nuts we have making our own nut mixture.  Excellent snack with protein.<br /><br />Just ordered some more of them.

review/summary: Love the new flavor!
review/text: I love these for a snack. I get a nice taste of chocolate and mint (in addition to the almond, of course), but it isn't super sweet. I hope Blue Diamond keeps coming out with more flavors. The Butter Toffee is great too.
