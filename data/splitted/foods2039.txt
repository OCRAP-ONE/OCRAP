review/summary: excellent flavor!
review/text: This is delicious, and I signed up for the subscription delivery in order to enjoy it often. It's a healthy snack to bring to work or anytime, and it's exactly the taste I remember and have been searching for! The only problem is there are WAY too many bones, which is why I subtracted one point. The flavor more than makes up for all the bones, but still it would be such an excellent product without having to encounter all the sharp little jabs.

review/summary: A tasty treat for pond critters
review/text: I use this to provide a supplimental food to the goldfish in my two "natural" ponds, especially in the early spring and early winter when the ice isn't covering the whole pond and the fish aren't dug-in for the winter yet but natural food seems a bit lean.<br />I don't normally feed them and at first they didn't know what it was. The fish were feeders I bought at the pet store several years ago.  Now they are all 8 - 12" in length.  I wanted something to use as a treat on occasion when I stop by the pond in chilly weather and the fish are hanging around "sunning" themselves.  The fish like it and the pellets float at the top for a long time, giving them opportunity to find it before it sinks into the muddy bottom.<br />I live a very long way from any stores and Amazon is my favorite source for stuff like this -- and for everything else for that matter.  Great prices, great shipping from UPS, no crowds, great customer service, great selection, I could go on and on here -- what did I do before Amazon!

review/summary: Good quality food - the fish like it - easy to use
review/text: I periodically feed the fish in my outdoor pond with this food... they like it a lot.  It floats on the top for a long time, so I don't have to worry about waste.  Since the food is pellets (vs the flakes I was used to with my aquarium as a kid), the pellets are very easy to measure and use.  You just grab a little handfull and toss them in, watch them float, and the fish swarm.<br /><br />I also think this is a good deal for this much fish food.  Hope this helps!

We mourn the passing of their jalapeno turkey chili, but we were thrilled to be able to order this, since no one around us carries it. Doctored with some jalapenos, a bit of Tabasco, and (when I'm feeling health conscious) even a bit of firm tofu, it's delicious.

review/summary: The real deal
review/text: I lived in Belgium for several years and loved the waffles from Liege with their crunchy sugar crystals in the center.  I've tried to make my own and have had little success.  The sugar really makes it what it is.  You can try and break up sugar cubes, but they usually dissolve (undesired) when I do that.  I recently had some at a restaurant in Salt Lake called Bruges Waffles.  This was a legit, Belgian run waffle shop (go there!).  I talked to one of the workers about my failed attempt to recreate these wonders.  He asked, in a French accent, where found the pearled sugar.  I hadn't found any I replied.  You can only get it in Belgium, he answered.  I hopped on Amazon, and there it was.  I admit it is expensive, but I love 'em so I bought the larger quantity, which brings down the price.  The box comes with a recipe that works really well.  They recommend you use a whole 8oz box for one batch, but I use 1/2 box and it seems perfect.  These are delicious.  All I need to do now if find the right amount of cinnamon to add so they taste like those found at the Gare de Liege.

review/summary: Excellent Product - with Recipe
review/text: This is a very good product with a super Waffle Recipe on back - wow they are good!<br />A little pricey but, I buy Pearl Sugar by the case on Amazon.com and it brings the cost down.  Also available on eBay from my Danish friend who lives in the south (USA).<br />The waffles that you make with this product are called Liege Belgian Waffles. NOT DIET FOOD AND VERY ADDICTING - even cold they are outrageously good. Slap some Vanilla Ice Cream with berry of your choice - over the top!<br /><br />For a Liege Waffle recipe we will need:<br />2 cups flour<br />1 cup pearl sugar<br />1 cup melted butter<br />3 eggs<br />1 (1/4 ounce) package yeast<br />1/3 cup lukewarm water<br />1 1/2 tablespoons sugar<br />1/8 teaspoon salt<br />2 to 3 teaspoons Pure Mexican Vanilla - substitute store brand Pure Vanilla<br />  (Tip - Mexican or any other vanilla should not contain syrup or sugars of any kind this is a cheap filler)<br /><br />How to make Liege Waffles in nine easy steps:<br />1. Take the lukewarm water and mix in yeast, 1 1/2 tablespoon sugar and salt. Let the yeast develop for 15 minutes. In the meanwhile you can melt the butter, but be careful - do not burn it.<br /><br />2. Now take a large bowl and put in the flour, make a hole in the middle, pour in the yeast that you made in step one. Also add eggs and melted butter and knead until you get nice and even dough. Then let it rest so the yeast does it's magic and the dough doubles.<br /><br />3. Now take pearl sugar and gently mix it in.<br /><br />4. Again, let it rest for 15 minutes, in the meanwhile you can turn on the waffle maker so its nice and hot.<br /><br />5. All there is left is to pour the waffle dough into the waffle maker and bake for 3-5 minutes. Because we mixed in the sugar late in the process it will melt and caramelize and give that special Liege waffle taste. Just be careful when you take them out of the waffle maker, caramelized sugar can make them sticky.<br /><br />NOTE there are different kinds of Pearl Sugar - know what you are buying and for what!

review/summary: very large chunks, not what I am use to
review/text: I have been making Liege waffles with pearl sugar for over 10 years and this is the first shipment that was not 3-5 mm pearls.  These suckers are huge, maybe 8-11 mm.  Do they work?  Yes. Are they easy to work with? No.  Do they stay crunchy in the waffle?  Yes.  But they also tend to burn on the iron rather than just caramelize.  For cookies they would be a disaster.  Big chunks of sugar where you wanted delicate crunch. Can you break them up so that they are smaller?  NO! They just break into powder. Would I buy them again? No.  I will go to Ikea and make sure I am getting what I need.

review/summary: Kitty crack!
review/text: I wish I could buy these on subscription like other groceries on Amazon.  I start getting nervous when we get low on this stuff.  The moment I touch the bag, my two cats and two dogs line up in a row and wait in eager anticipation for treat time. When we are out of them they all just wander around the kitchen scowling at me.  By a long shot, this is everybody's favorite treat.  And I love the fact that there's nothing else in these except chicken.  I know this product is designed to be sprinkled on top of food and when we get down to the bottom of the bag we use them for that, but for small dogs and cats, these make a great treat.  A big dog would probably devour the whole bag in a matter of minutes so I wouldn't bother for big dogs unless you wanted to use them as a training treat.  The chunks are small, but for my chihuahuas and cats they are practically a meal.<br /><br />If they seem pricey for the amount you get, remember that dehydration removes the water and without the water meat weighs about 1/4 of what it weighed when fully hydrated.  These aren't cheap by any measure, but they aren't ridiculously expensive either when you consider that one 4oz bag is made from about a pound of meat and unlike most treats they aren't packed with fillers.

review/summary: Two Reviews:  The Salmon and The Chicken Breast
review/text: The salmon toppers are one of my cats favorite packaged treats or meals, wet or dry.  It's healthy, grain-free, and to a large extent, shelf stable.  I'd highly recommend it for finicky eaters.  It works as as a stand alone meal with water or, as it's advertised, a topper to add some good nutrition to other cat foods and improve its flavor while doing so.<br /><br />The Salmon has has always been fresh on my subscription here. I mention this because the chicken breast toppers were not and I notice another review has mentioned the same.  Not only was it thoroughly stale, but there was no expiration date on the package where it normally is. I find both those things happening concurrently suspicious. I'm familiar with this product in Salmon, Chicken, and liver varieties. I've ordered it from another pet supply company for years then noticed the two pack price at Amazon was lower.  It's worth if for the salmon which has always fresh with clear expiration marked for the four times I've received it on subscribe and save, but not for the chicken breast which I canceled after the first month.  It's not the product itself, as much as some company involved in missing or just pawning off -expired pet food- through Amazon.<br /><br />While I think Real Food Toppers make the best freeze-dried Salmon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CL5S">Halo Liv-a-Littles Natural Treats for Dogs and Cats, Freeze-Dried Chicken Breast Protein, 2.2oz</a> is the best brand for Chicken in any case. It's much less sinewy and comes in larger chunks.

review/text: My cat and dog both love this salmon treat!  My dog is part shar-pei and needs to eat a special kind of sensitive skin food which he never really liked until we were given a bag of the salmon treats for our cat.  Well, of course she loves it because it's freeze dried salmon but what surprised me was that my dog loved it too!  Being that it is high in fatty-acids like he needs for his skin, we began mixing crushed treats into his food bowl.  He now gets excited for dinner time and eats his entire bowl (before he used to only eat when he was so hungry that he had to).  I love that it's all natural and is only one healthy ingredient: salmon.  The only downside to this product is the smell.  But that comes with anything fish flavored.  But if it makes my dog and cat happy than I am happy!

review/summary: Unacceptable quality--Real Food Toppers Chix Breast Treats
review/text: I have purchased these freeze-dried natural chicken breast treats in the past from a few different suppliers so I know what to expect in terms of product characteristics & quality. I have a dentally-challenged senior cat who is diabetic (in remission), has a hyperthyroid condition & mega colon. He has lost several teeth so it was important that I find a treat for him that he likes that not only is natural, without additives or sugars but also has a soft, tender consistency that is easy for him to chew. These Real Food Toppers freeze-dried chicken breast pieces were the perfect solution & my cat loved them. They even print "soft to chew" right on the packaging. I found this 2-pack listing on Amazon with an outstanding discounted price so I decided my next order would be from Amazon (I also decided to make it an autoship subscription as well so saving even more $). Unfortunately, when the 1st shipment arrived I was quite disappointed to find chicken pieces that were dried up & hard -- maybe 15% of the pieces were soft enough to give my cat. In fact, because when I offer treats to my cat I normally have to break the large chunks into smaller bite-sized pieces, I found the majority of the product in this order to be so hard I could not even break them apart with my hands. If I attempted to cut them up into much smaller pieces with a knife so he could maybe chew those, the product simply disintegrated into crumbs. All 4 pouches in my order were the same unacceptable quality. I also determined that not a single one had a "best by" date on the packaging. Since every other package I'd ever purchased regardless of who the supplier was always had dates on them I figured these pouches must have been very, very old. Because I opened all 4 pouches thinking I'd eventually have to find some acceptable pieces I was unable to return the order. When I receive the 2d shipment if there are no dates on any of the pouches then I'll be returning the order (unopened) otherwise I'll open a pouch & if I find the contents unacceptable I'll return the shipment & cancel the remainder of the autoship subscription.

I've always liked the mustards in Asian restaurants and it seemed worth a try. It's good! Real nice strong mustard flavor. It's quite zesty, but not to the point where it takes your breath away. I'd judge it to be made up with an eye on American tastes. Well, it was just about perfect for me. I wish I had a few Asian friends to try it out on and get their opinions.,<br /><br />Gary Peterson

But if that's not the case where you are, and you don't mind a diet rich in junk food, then yes, this is a candy bar worth going to the trouble of ordering over the internet.<br /><br />Note that here on Amazon you can purchase bounty bars in boxes with varying numbers of bars inside, so it is worth your while to crunch the numbers and think about what package offers the best value for you. At the same time, it may not be entirely in the best interests of your health to have _too_ many of these things lying around at home all at once!<br /><br />Theo.

review/text: I got a pretty good deal on these locally with a store sale and coupon. I did not enjoy it very much. The broth was very salty/garlic-y and I could hardly see any chicken in the cup. The lip on the container makes it hard to get everything out. These would be okay for kids. For my money <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EFBMD0">Progresso Soup, Chicken Noodle Soup, 15.25-Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 6)</a> are better.

review/summary: Poor packaging!
review/text: I really love this soup and have it for lunch nearly every single day. I was happy to find it online and at such a good price when ordered on subscription. I have received three shipments, and every single time, one or more containers of the soup has burst during shipping.  They are packaged in a cardboard box with a couple of large plastic bubbles to keep them from shifting, but there is no padding at all, and the way UPS throws boxes around, I'm not surprised the soup containers didn't stand up to such rough handling.  I cancelled my subscription delivery of this product because of this problem.<br /><br />Update: Someone at Amazon must have noticed my review, because the last shipment of soup that I received today has much more packing material in the box than before, and it was sent USPS instead of UPS. Every container of soup arrived intact.  Thanks, Amazon! :-) I will most likely continue to order this now.

review/summary: No flavor, considering the name and ingredients
review/text: I have had many ginger teas in my life, and the best I would have to say is fresh ginger root ground. Considering this tea is marketed as "ginger peach" and the ingreadients state: : black tea, flavor, ginger root, there is no ginger flavor and the "flavor" in the ingredients does not seem to be peach. The brewing instructions state "one level teaspoon of leaves per 8oz of water". This ratio gave it a watery flavor, and doubling the ratio did not improve flavor. The best way to describe the flavor in "my" opinion is that the tea tastes like my grandma's perfume smells...not the best. I would bet that other teas made by this company don't all taste this way, but this flavor does not meet my expectations for being called a "ginger tea".

review/summary: Main Ingredient is INULIN, not Lo Han!!!
review/text: I've been waiting 18 days for this to arrive a finally it did. So I immediately check the ingredients on the back to find that the Main Ingredient is NOT Monk Fruit Concentrate, but INULIN (a cheap starchy filler that IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU and can have severe side effects including anaphylactic shock). I urge you to do your homework on inulin.<br /><br />INULIN has shown to not only feed good bacteria in your stomach, but ALSO bad bacteria such as Klebsiella. Recent studies have shown that inulin encourages the growth of Klebsiella, a bacteria implicated in Ankylosing Spondylitis and in increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut). Although Klebsiella is present in the colon of most people, it is held in check by beneficial bacteria and is harmless WITHIN the colon. But once it gets to other areas of the body, Klebsiella becomes a major cause of pneumonia, infections in the urinary tract and in wounds...and sometimes death.<br /><br />This "Lo Han" product also contains silica. Who wants to eat silica...you know, the stuff they also use to make those DO NOT EAT dessicate packets.  Swanson ought to list the ingredients in each of their products, cause Purelo IS FAR FROM PURE. This is deceptive marketing at its worst.<br /><br />Yes, i can return it. But I'm ought my time, the shipping and handling and now the hassle to return it.

review/summary: A spectacular alternative to other "fruit" snacks
review/text: My family first became hooked on Annie's products when we tried the delicious mac and cheese.  I've been on something of a crusade to eliminate high fructose corn syrup from our diets, as well as unsavory chemical preservatives.  My five-year-old has always been a big fan of fruit snacks but I normally hate giving them to her as they are no healthier than candy.<br /><br />While I won't claim that these are 100% healthy, I can say that they are completely free of all the artificial and highly processed junk that goes into their cheaper counterparts.  Yes, they are pricier than other "fruit" snacks on the market but the higher price tag on these comes along with higher quality.  I'm more than willing to shell out the extra cash if it means that my daughter will be ingesting fewer chemicals and less corn syrup.<br /><br />What's more, my daughter not only loves the taste of these, I do as well.  Other brands have a very artificial too-sweet flavor while these taste like real fruit juice.  I was surprised at how good they are as I normally avoid fruit snacks because of the taste.  I also like the texture of these.  They are chewy but smoother and will dissolve in your mouth if you suck on them.  They don't have that weird hardness or lumpy sort of quality that other fruit snacks do.

review/text: I love these and my toddler does too. They are not sticky like other fruit snacks that stick terribly to your teeth. They are very soft and easy to chew. I would give them 5 stars if it weren't for the price, for only 5 pouches and over $4 a box (on Amazon) that is very expensive. I have found that they are cheaper at other stores, such as Target where I often find them for $2.99, which I think is still pricey for only 5 pouches but will splurge because they are worth it.

review/summary: Would rather it use fruit to sweeten rather than cane sugar
review/text: These are extremely yummy fruit snacks! I am always on a quest to find organic, easy, yummy foods for our busy family. I was excited to find these and quickly bought a box, I've been impressed with all the Annie's products I have bought. They didn't disappoint in the taste department, but.... I am a little disappointed about the ingredients in these.<br /><br />Ingredient #1: Organic Tapioca Syrup-this appears to be a great alternative to high fructose corn syrup and other sugary additives. Here's what I pulled up about this ingredient-" Tapioca syrup provides the sweetness needed in a natural way. Produced from tapioca starch using a natural fermentation process, tapioca syrup is a gluten-free and non-GMO (genetically modified organism) alternative to corn syrup, sugar, honey, maple syrup and molasses."  [...]<br /><br />Ingredient #2: Organic cane sugar-this is just sugar. It's organic, so it wasn't grown using pesticides or anything, but sugar is sugar and I try to limit it as much as possible. I'm bummed that this is the 2nd ingredient.<br /><br />The rest of the ingredients aren't really a big deal to me, but here they are: ORGANIC TAPIOCA SYRUP SOLIDS, ORGANIC WHITE GRAPE JUICE CONCENTRATE, PECTIN, CITRIC ACID, ASCORBIC ACID, COLOR (BLACK CARROT JUICE CONCENTRATE), NATURAL FLAVORS, SODIUM CITRATE, ORGANIC SUNFLOWER OIL, CARNAUBA WAX (FROM PALM LEAVES).<br /><br />So why am I let down by this product? There are tons of great tasting fruit snacks out there that don't use any extra sugar to sweeten them. Stretch Island Origional Fruit Leathers don't use any extra sugars, here's the ingredients of their summer strawberry fruit leather- "Apple Puree Concentrate, Pear Puree Concentrate, Strawberry Puree, Organic Natural Strawberry Flavor, Lemon Juice Concentrate. All Sugars Are Found Naturally In The Fruit." Clif sells their Twisted Fruit rope that has no added sugar. Archer Farms sells a fruit snack for a great price that has no added sugar.<br /><br />So the Annie's Organic Fruit snacks are a great tasting snack that is far above those icky artificial brands that are loaded with artificial dye's and sugar, but I still think there's some room for improvement by using only fruit to sweeten it, rather than cane sugar.

review/summary: Are you kidding me?!
review/text: How have I lived until the age of 30 without ever trying these things? I'm almost *angry* at myself for passing these by in the store so many times, thinking "what crazy person would pay that much for glorified gummy bears?"<br /><br />I should have known better, because our house loves Annie's mac and cheese, but for whatever reason I just never thought about trying these out. When they went on super sale here, I looked at my nearly-empty snack cupboard, thought "eh, I'll try it" and jumped in with zero expectations. We just had our first pouch, shared between me and my 3 year old, and he wandered up to me after we were done and said "Mama, thank you very much for my favorite treat in the whole wide world!"<br /><br />Now, that alone would be enough to make me stock them for him as an occasional special treat, but FORGET THAT, he's going to have to pry them away from me first. These taste *soooooooooooooooo(add a near-infinite number of oooooo's)ooooooo* good! The texture is soft in a way that is very difficult to describe but is unlike any other gummy I have tried, and makes them taste fresh as the day they were made. The flavor is wonderful. You can really tell that they are made with real fruit juice and cane sugar instead of corn syrup. They really do just taste better than other gummy snacks. Now, I'm no healthy eating superstar. We usually can't afford organics (though for some things we try) and we certainly eat our fair share of HFCS (though again, we try to avoid it when we have the option). I often don't get the hype around natural products and my kid has been known to eat total junk from time to time. This is one addition to the snack stash that I won't feel bad about offering-- as long as there's some left over for me! I'll even pay full price if I have to, and THAT is a true rarity and ringing endorsement from someone as penny-pinching as me.

review/summary: Finally! A Tasty, Convenient Vegan 'Gummy' Treat!
review/text: What's the best thing about Annie's Gummy Bunnies? They're gelatin-free. And frankly 'm a fan of candy sans rendered hooves, bones and skin. Vegetarian gummies are a darn-near impossible thing to find. These are available in al our local grocery stores.<br /><br />Of course, the next-best-thing about these little candies are that they taste good. Sweet, a little tangy. Slightly chewy, but with more of a sticky consistency than traditional gelatin-containing gummy characters, which have a rubber-like consitency. They do, in fact, taste like fruit. I'm not sure why that offends some reviewers, but to each their own, I suppose.<br /><br />I love them, and so do my kids. We use them for my chocolate-intolerant daughter as potty-time treats. They're candy, not health food - don't let the 'organic' and all-natural things fool you into thinking otherwise. But they're candy like candy should be. Good old-fashioned sugar, natural flavorings, natural colors, vs. all-too-common nasty, high-fructose corn-syrup, artificial flavors, artificial colors candy.<br /><br />Are you going to pay an arm and a leg for them? Of course! But if you're vegan or vegetarian you're probably already used to paying more for a shorter/more natural list of ingredients. My advice: Savor them. They're a treat!

Also, the bunnies are not covered in sugar or cornstarch to keep them from sticking, but they do not stick to my hands while I eat them (plus).<br /><br />I also find Amazon's price hard to beat for 4 boxes.  I do watch for it on sale, both here and other places, for comparison.<br /><br />If you are switching to a more natural based diet, Annie's is a great brand. A quick switch is hard to make, so change one small thing at a time.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this product as much as I do.

review/summary: Yummy, yummy, yummy!!! We love these snacks!
review/text: These are fantastic snacks and so much better than normal fruit snacks. They are pricey, but sorry amazon, we buy ours at Target, which always has them at a low price or on sale or as low as $2.49 a box (in which case I buy about 12 boxes!!) We love these snacks, just wish amazon's price would be as low as Targets, then we'd order them here!

review/text: My kids (3 years old and 17 months old) love these fruit snacks.  I love them because they are great on the go and while they are obviously no substitute for actual fruit, they are much better for the kids than other sweets like cookies or candy.  I have to admit that I love these snacks too, and at 70 calories per bag, they are great for satisfying my sweet cravings too!

Not only does my son love them, but I do too! Plus, I love how soft they are! I don't worry about my younger son, who is 1.5, choking on them because they are very easy to chew. I also love how they sell them in only berry flavors because I have never been fond of citrus flavored candy and I like to eat these just as much as my kids. lol

review/summary: Convenient snack pack
review/text: These are snack packs similar in size to other snack packs (these are 0.8 ounces per snack packet).  They have a higher sugar content than some snanks, the main ingredients being tapioca syrup, cane sugar, and white grape juice concentrate, with natural flavors, black carrot for color, vitamin C added, etc.  They are an attractive snack for children in convenient tear-0pen packets.  They can also be dropped into day packs, lunch boxes, etc., or be kept in a desk drawer at work.  They have an expiration date on the box, but have a relatively long shelf life.<br /><br />Alternative snacks include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015MSNE2">Welch's Fruit Snacks, Mixed Fruit, Fat Free Snacks, (80-0.9oz.

review/summary: LOVE THESE!
review/text: I absolutely love these, healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. They aren't hard and you don't have to sit there chewing forever; but if you want you can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect! This flavor is my favorite, but I recommend trying the tropical flavor as well!!<br /><br />The only possible negative comment I have for these is that they are very expensive. Another great fruit snack to try if you like the texture of these, is Ocean Spray brand. They aren't organic but they are less than half the price of Annie's. I like the Ocean Spray Berries and Cherries flavor the best.

review/summary: Good snack food
review/text: First, I'm not an "organic" food expert.  Far from it, in fact.  But recently, I decided to try out some healthier food choices, and that is how I came across Annie's Homegrown Berry Patch Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks.  There's been one thing driving my recent food purchases, and that's something my "Principles of Nutrition" professor in college said: "always eat food as close to its source as possible".  Where possible, it's preferential to eat food that was grown / raised geographically close to you.  Also, eating food "close to its source" means eating food in a form close to how it is found in nature (i.e., not overly processed).<br /><br />While I hold no illusions that these Fruit Snacks are in any way a "health food", I think compared to their competition, they are way ahead, both in quality of ingredients, and in taste.  The "berry" description of the taste is accurate, in my opinion.  I find that they have a great balance of fruit-tartness, along with the perfect amount of sweetness.  They are certainly not overly sweet like many snacks.  The texture of these snacks seems a bit "stickier" than some of the more mainstream competitors, and perhaps less "gummy".  I don't find this offensive, and have grown to prefer it, really.<br /><br />As for the cost - yes, these are expensive.  When you first see the relatively small individual serving bag, you might think you got ripped off.  But these Fruit Snacks are extremely satiating, and even though you may have only eaten a relatively small amount, you end up satisfied, and full.<br /><br />Given the cost, you might not be able to justify eating these every day, but I'd have no problem recommending these as a treat to have a few times a week.  Great taste, a seemingly decent set of ingredients, and a decent increase in quality vs. the competition.

review/text: These fruit snacks are absolutely delicious.  I realize that they're more expensive than the artificially flavored/colored alternative, but they're worth it!  You can actually detect the flavor of the fruit in these snacks, rather than the overpowering flavor of sugar that you get from other snacks.  No more artificial fruit snacks in our house!

review/summary: Wholly crap these are good
review/text: I bought these as a snack for my toddler when we are out. I tried these first and couldn't believe how good they were. Then I handed them to my husband and my toddler, wow wee!! These were a hit with all the members of our family. In fact I recieved this package on a Saturday and we had gone through two and a half boxes by Monday. We just had a self control issue with these. They are sweet but not too sweet and are very soft for a small child to eat without difficulty. I do find them a bit sticky but they dont get stuck to my teeth. My whole family is in love with these snacks. My only gripe is that there aren't very many in the pouch and in the box in general. So if you like these be sure to get a few more boxes to have on hand for anxious toddlers and craving adults.

review/summary: A little pricey, but very worth it.  TASTY & TANGY!
review/text: We've been trying to find a little sweet to munch on in our household of late.  We've tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TDA8T4">Welchs Fruit Snacks Twenty Four 2.25 Ounce Value Box Assortment</a> and we've also tried a Big Box store brand fruit snack and while both of those were more economical, they had so many various additives and I wanted to start with a cleaner slate so I decided to try these.  They are delicious, tangy and of a different consistency than other fruit snacks I have eaten.<br /><br />The Welch's snacks are definitely chewier than the Annie's bunny snacks are.  They are also way sweeter whereas the Annie's Bunnies are tangy and mouth watering (in this flavor at least).<br /><br />You don't have to worry about any dental work with these or stuffing yourself with a lot of additives.  You can taste that and feel it in the texture.  They are a little pricier than mass-produced fruit snacks and these pouches are a little small ... but they are yummy.<br /><br />In this case, you pay for "Organic" and a fruit snack without all the additives.  You just have to decide if fruit snacks like these are worth it for you.  We decided they were.  We are actually finding more Annie's products that we like.

review/summary: Great product, but texture needs improvement
review/text: My preschooler loves this snack.  The flavors for each bunny taste different.  The product is made with wholesome organic ingredients.  I really think they need to put more in each little bag.  I like the fact that they don't get stuck in my teeth.  I also really like the fact that they do not contain gelatin.  It's really hard to find gummy products that don't contain gelatin and since we aren't pork eaters, we don't want gelatin in our snacks.  The only downside is that the texture is a little too squishy and needs to be a little more chewy.  My kid thinks they are perfect, but I won't be snacking on them again because I'm very sensitive to food textures and get a little grossed out by the squishiness.

I'm an avid shopper for healthy organic products, being a health-minded mom for myself and family. I only want to feed my toddler healthy foods that are minimally processed and not filled with bad ingredients (like high fructose corn syrup, msg, etc.)  My daughter gobbled up these lil' bunny snacks right away the first time she tried them. And yes, I admit I did too! they sure taste way better than the junky unhealthy fruit snacks. You can tell a big difference in quality and taste with products like these that stick to basic good ingredients. Good job Annie's company, I'm hooked to your products for life!

She's very finicky, and I was afraid she would balk at anything different, but she immediately loved these. Very yummy! They are a little sticky, and at first I thought they might have a tough, gummy-bear-like texture, but they are very soft.  Even my one-year-old, who doesn't have molars, can eat them. There were some complaints about the price, and they do cost more than average fruit snacks, but you have to realize that companies use corn syrup for a reason - it's cheap! If you want a healthier alternative, you're going to pay more. There was also a negative comment about the number of pieces per package, but I think each package actually contains more pieces than regular fruit snacks.

review/summary: So good- they are addictive
review/text: These are the best gummy bears that I have ever had, I don't feel bad about indulging with them because they are a healthy sweet treat and they are vegan! No animal gelatin used like in other gummy bears :)

review/summary: Very Yummy!
review/text: I love these gummies! The summer strawberry is defiantly my favorite. They have more of a "real" taste to them compared to the HFCS & gelatin filled ones. Very overpriced on Amazon, though. I bought a 24 pouch variety pack at Costco for $10.

review/text: My kids love fruit snacks, but I didn't like them having the dyes in the traditional ones. This is a great alternative. They taste great. A little expensive for the small package.

review/summary: even great for adults
review/text: We LOVE these in our house! They are so yummy and the texture is soft enough for a young toddler to chew.  I sometimes steal these for a little treat for myself :)  My toddler loves these so much that I have had to hide them in the pantry otherwise she'd be asking for multiple a day.  They are a little on the expensive side in the store but they are slightly cheaper on Amazon in bulk.

review/summary: Delicious Bunnies Don't Come Cheap, Silly Wabbit
review/text: These are delicious. Several servings seem to be needed to satisfy.  Genuine fruit flavor.<br />Texture is smooth and chewy. These do *not* have a granulated sugar coating. We are happy campers!<br /><br />Some hop-to-tips:<br /><br />1. These also taste good when refrigerated, but it increases the stickiness-factor.<br /><br />2. Somewhat addictive. Hide the bunnies away, but please don't make rabbit stew!<br /><br />Why did we rate these with only 4 stars?  The price, silly wabbit, the price !

review/summary: Tastes so good!
review/text: I chose these because I wanted a fruit snack to keep in my desk that is satisfying, but not junk food.<br />There are no animal products in the snacks (yay) and you get 100% of your daily vitamin C requirement.<br />They taste great and are so cute!  I like all the flavors.

review/summary: Great product for vegetarians
review/text: My wife and I are vegetarian so we don't eat anything that has gelatin in it (i.e., most gummy products).  I'm fine with that but my wife struggles because she loves gummy bears.  We've tried vegan gummy products, but they usually taste like cough syrup.  The Annie's fruit snacks are the exception.  They taste great, even better than other gummy products.

review/summary: Sometimes quality costs more
review/text: These fruitsnacks are the ONLY ones I will give my child since they are the healthiest I've found. The added bonus is that they aren't as sticky/gummy as normal fruitsnacks, which can get caught in teeth and cause cavities. Being a Dental Hygienist and a Mom, I'm always on the lookout for teeth friendly snacks.<br />My 17month daughter has been given these from before she turned a year old due to the fact that they're very easy to chew.<br />I buy them at Target for much less than on Amazon. I just came on here to see if I could find them in bulk a bit cheaper than that. :)

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: These little things are way too delicious.  I saw some reviews saying they are "healthy".. and I would have to say that maybe they're not as bad for you as the awful traditional GMO-corn-syrup gelatin ones, but still just a sweet dessert treat.  I highly recommend them.

review/summary: best fruit snacks around
review/text: These are the only fruit snacks my son will eat.  We've tried other organic brands but the consistency of these bunnies are far softer and taste better. Plus, I've noticed they get stick less in the teeth. I always order a case to use in goody bags for both my 2 year old son's and 6 year old daughter's parties.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: My daughter reacts badly to red dye 40 (temper outbursts) and we cut all fruit snacks and the like out of her diet.  I didn't try these fruit snacks for a long time because they were expensive but getting them cheaper here helped.  All of my kids love them and I do too!  They are a great lunch box dessert and I am excited to have coming by the case.
