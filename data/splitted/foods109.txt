review/summary: By far the best truffle oil available
review/text: I've read a whole lot of reviews for the various different brands of truffle oil, a number of which suggest that there is no way of infusing truffle flavor into the oil, and that all are full of chemicals.  Well, I can't comment knowledgeably on that, but I can say that the Bartolini brand is by far the best that we have tried, and tastes and smells strongly of truffle.  We use this primarily as a finishing oil, on risotto and scrambled eggs, where the quality of the underlying oil is critical, and have been really happy with the Bartolini oil.  I first used this product when living in London, and had friends bring some out for me when I hadn't been able to find a good alternative in the US, so am delighted to find this on Amazon.<br /><br />The oil is a bright yellow, and the base oil smells like a good quality extra virgin oil.  Each bottle at least has a small piece of truffle in the bottom, lending some support at least to the idea that the oil is infused.  If there is artificial flavor added, as some reviewers have suggested there has to be, then all I can say is that the resulting taste certainly doesn't have a chemical, or artificial taint, unlike some other brands we have tried.<br /><br />In particular, we have also used the Tourangelle brand, available in a tin from Amazon and Whole Foods, which is absolutely ghastly, and the quality of the oil used for that brand is appalling.  The end product is pale, tasteless and almost without any aroma, let alone that of truffles.  The presentation in a tin is unattractive and also lends the oil a somewhat metallic taint...just a generally awful product.  I guess they realize that the product looks so bad that if they put it in glass they'd never sell any of it.  Perhaps they think people are going to use it as a cooking, rather than a finishing oil, which is completely inappropriate....you could hope that heating it may burn off the dreadful chemical taint!<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a good option, that looks and smells good on the food, and at least gives the impression that it is a natural oil, I don't think you can go past this product.

review/summary: You get convenience and value, feed two boys for less than $5
review/text: Hamburger Helper is a quick fix dinner for our sons (ages 8 and 7) on nights when school activities and/or swimming or judo lessons push our family schedule into the night.<br /><br />Chili Macaroni is one of the five Mexican flavors Hamburger Helper offers. Cheesy Enchilada, Cheesy Nacho, Crunchy Taco and Double Cheese Quesadilla are the others. Each package makes five one-cup servings. Our sons like the Old El Paso� seasoning; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4JEC">Hamburger Helper Lasagna</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4IQ6">Hamburger Helper Beef Pasta</a> are too bland for their tastes. This flavor has just the right amount of spice and seasonings to appeal to the under-10-year-old crowd. The box suggests adding a 4.5 oz. can of Old El Paso chopped green chiles five minutes before the end of the simmer time.<br /><br />A prepared serving (one cup) has 270 calories, 570 mg of sodium and 0.5 g of fat; it also provides a good carb load - 22 grams - and 3 g of protein.<br /><br />Adding the cost of the ground hamburger and vegetables as a side dish, we are able to feed two boys for less than $5 and still have enough leftovers to prepare them a weekend lunch.<br /><br />In summary, while this isn't Haute cuisine, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00434KRHU">Betty Crocker Hamburger Helper Chili Macaroni</a> is an inexpensive option when pressed for time. For price and convenience, I give the product a five-star rating. For taste, I give it three stars. Again, though, I'm not the target audience, so I'm settling on a four-star rating. The slogan on the box sums it up well, "One pound. One pan. One tasty meal."

review/summary: Disappointment - salt overpowers all tastes
review/text: I am a fan of Silver Palate cookbooks and was delighted to see this sauce on the grocery shelf. After getting it home and warming it in a saucepan, I gave it a taste. It was so salty, it was inedible. (And I am not reluctant to use salt.) 660 mg of sodium per 1/2 cup? Are they serious? The salt overpowers any subtle flavors in the sauce. With hypertension representing a major health problem, this is irresponsible. It leaves a bad taste in more ways than one.

review/text: This protein bar is delicious!  It tastes similar to a 100 Grand candy bar, has a good crunch, packs 30g of protein, and is HUGE.  I tried one at my local health food store and fell in love, so I ordered them from Amazon.  After waiting and waiting and waiting for the item to be available and shipped, I noticed the nutritionals were VERY different from what I remembered.  There is a carb smart version with 1g sugar and 25g sugar alcohols.  The non carb smart version is reversed.  If you're watching your sugars or carbs don't give up after looking at the content of the regular bar, just look a little harder for the carbohydrate concious version.  It's worth trying!

review/summary: grows and flowers quickly
review/text: I live in a small apartment with no deck, no patio, no backyard. I got a packet of these seeds as an experiment, to see if i could grow a small tomato plant in one of my sunny west-facing windows.<br /><br />I planted a single seed in a single peat pellet. Within about 5 days it germinated, and it has grown rapidly ever since. It's thriving in the hot summer weather, and has already put out two flowers even in a 10-inch pot.<br /><br />Update:<br />My tomato plant has reached to about 3' tall. It grew two lovely, reasonably large, delicious tomatoes. After i cut those down and ate them, it sprouted a new round of flowers, and now has two more tomatoes growing. It looks like, in a 10" pot, this plant can support two tomatoes at a time. In a bigger pot, i'm sure it would grow more (both times it flowered, there were over a dozen buds).

review/summary: Down The Hatch
review/text: I received one 10-Ounce packet of Lamb and Barley dog treats from the Vine program. The treats are fairly large but they are creased and can easily be broken into two treats. My Dobie is a big boy and eating the treat unbroken is his preference. Actually, eating anything is his preference. He doesn't really "eat" in the true sense of the word as much as he "inhales" anything he considers edible. The treats have a very slight odor but sufficient for him to gulp them down in a NY minute. He would never be mistaken for a picky eater.<br /><br />Like most dogs I have ever seen or owned he is not driven by a gourmet mentality but performs more like a vacuum cleaner when it comes to absorbing anything he deems worthy of ingesting. That makes it very difficult to evaluate this particular treat. Based on his performance when offered one of these goodies I can find no reason to deduct any stars and therefore must award this product the maximum five.

review/text: These treats were a big hit.  The dog loves these treats. They are rectangular but are scored so that you can break each treat into two squares if you prefer smaller treats.  These do not have the typical unappealing smell of most dog treats; they almost smell like a treat suitable for humans.  I like that they are not full of preservatives.<br />I have made my own dog treats in the past in order to avoid the preservatives and additives but they are a lot of trouble to make.  This product is a good alternative to making my own.

Therefore, I tried the product on him.  After sniffing the first one I gave him, he now comes running whenever I open the sack to allow the aroma to escape.  He seems glad to have them added to his menu.<br />I would caution, however, that they are hard, somewhat like hardtack.  Therefore, if your dog has a tender mouth, or cannot easily chew hard treats, you might want to skip them.

They are quite thick in size.  Most dog biscuits I give him are less than 1/2" thick...these are closer to 5/8".  He has a bit of trouble getting his mouth around them to break them up. Eventually he does, but has to really work at it.  I would prefer them to be a bit thinner.  I think a larger dog like a lab would do better with these treats.

review/text: I have two dogs: a 5 year old Weimaraner who eats everything except parsley and the colored parts of citrus rinds...even rocks and especially sticks, and a 12 year old German Shepherd Dog who eats as little as I let her get away with--she doesn't even like fish, or beef dog food! Well, both dogs wolfed these down. They are flattish rectangular pieces of what looks like compressed sawdust, scored in half so you can give just a one inch square easily. Of course, being Newman's Own, they don't have added colors or flavorings that could trigger allergies in your pet, or make the biscuits smell off to humans. Not to worry, though-- both dogs knew which bubble-packed envelope was for them. A+++

review/summary: The Dog Agrees
review/text: My faux-Beagle mix agrees.  Lucy, the hyper active dog who looks like a beagle but really isn't, accepted and munched on the Newman's treats just like she would any other.  Not sure what else to say about it other than to try to translate her barks.  She sat up and begged like the other treats and head butted my hand asking for another.

review/summary: My Small Dogs Had Trouble With The Size
review/text: I have four Chihuahuas. They seemed very interested in the treats, but didn't seem to know quite what to do with them. At first they licked them and then walked away. Finally one of them managed to crunch one. After that they ate them. The next day, the same thing. I think they like them, but these treats would be better suited for larger dogs.

review/summary: My Picky Pup Ate Them! Success!
review/text: These are hard dog biscuit treats (like MilkBones) in a square shape about 1.5" on each side and 1/4" thick.  So for a small dog, they're pretty big. I tried to break it up for my little dog, but it was hard as a rock and I wasn't about to try and hack it with a knife so I just gave it to her as-is. This is the only reason I'm deducting a star because the ingredients are great and they are good treats but sometimes a full sized treat is too much for a small dog.<br /><br />We have a 4 year old, 9lb mutt who is REALLY picky and not very food motivated.  She has been known to turn her nose up at fish if not prepared to her liking and has literally spit out most grocery store purchased dog treats - especially if they require any effort to actually crunch them to eat. It's like she can't remember that she has the capacity to eat hard foods, so she'll let a bowl of her (very expensive) dog food sit out for 24 hours before remembering how her jaw works.<br /><br />So. Needless to say I was surprised when she took this treat from my hands and ran off to another room with it.  In the other room, she sat and inspected it and played with it for about a minute before she was struck with the idea to try and eat it. Normally this is when she leaves the treat in the middle of the room and comes back to me to see if I'm going to give her the real treat - usually some kind of jerky - but to my surprise, she ate the whole thing.  And when she was done she ran back to where we were and sat in front of the bag.  Waiting.  This has never happened with a dry treat before so I have to assume that's a sign of approval from a pleased dog.  I gave her a second one, which she hid under her blanket for about 3 minutes before coming back to it to eat.<br /><br />In Amazon's 6 pack it breaks down to about $3.25 for each package.  Compared to the biscuit treats I had tried before with similar ingredients that my dog rejected, this is on par with the pricing.  It's more expensive than treats I'd find in normal grocery store aisles or at the big pet store chains, but about the same price as the stuff I normally get at specialty pet stores.  It's way cheaper than the duck jerky I had been buying, but those are two totally different types of treats so I can't compare the two and this will not replace my dog's duck treats.  The biggest selling point for me is that I have to go to a specialty pet store to find the other biscuit treats with the same kind of ingredients so being able to order this in bulk on Amazon makes it a much sweeter deal.

review/text: I'm not sure I'm qualified to review dog treats, but my little dachschund-beagle mix Bella is, and she scarfed these up with gusto.  I was somewhat surprised because she's pretty picky, especially about dry treats, which these are. So I'm happy to recommend them to anyone with "picky eater" type dogs and I'm sure it will bring a smile to your face when you see your pup wolfing them down with gusto.  A perfect training treat as well.

review/summary: Very nice doggie treats...good for your dogs
review/text: This is a dog treat you can feel good about giving your animals. It has a nice shape...they come in two attached squares but you can break them apart for smaller treats.  They have an unoffensive smell..in fact they smell pretty good for doggie treats.  They are made of a good, healthy mix of ingredients: Lamb, barley, carrots, and molasses.  I have an older golden retriever and a smaller, younger terrier.  Little hyper terrier probably didn't even taste the goodness as he gobbled the treats down.  But my retriever smelled it and played with it a little while...once he started munching, it was gone pretty quickly!  Both dogs begged for more, but after a couple we put the bag up.  Hard as it was, these are meant to be a treat.

review/summary: Not great for little dogs - otherwise OK
review/text: These snacks/treats have excellent ingredients and are suitable for dogs who can chew them up. The one problem is that they are VERY hard and thus not great for small dogs or dogs who have trouble with hard treats. The biscuits are not large enough to be broken up by hand. If you want to break them up, you basically need to use a hammer.<br /><br />Bottom line - good for medium/large dogs or those who can deal with very hard snacks.

review/summary: My Dog Loved Them!
review/text: I have a Jack Russell Terrier who may be the quirkiest dog in the world. I tried giving him half of the treat and he wouldn't eat it. However, he wouldn't let go of it or let it out of his sight. I crunched it up for him on the grass and he spent about 15 minutes eating it and looking for every crumb. My dog is not a foodie so these biscuits must be good. I think that even half of the biscuit may be too big for small dogs, so just crunch them up as I did.

review/summary: Another great product from Newman's Own
review/text: Confession time. I haven't personally tasted Newman's Own Organics new dog treats but they smell way yummier than most dog treats. (My dog Sheila has tasted them and she quickly started groveling for more. It was pathetic.) Seriously, I don't have to taste these to know that they are good. The Newman's Own Corp. and its spin-off Newman's Own Organics have been making quality food for pets and people for almost 30 years. Their organic products are independently certified as organic by Oregon Tilth, a third party certifying agency for organic farmers. Among other things, their certification means that the products used by Newman's Own Organics are grown on farms that do not use artificial pesticides or synthetic chemicals of any kind during the production of their products. In the case of their Lamb & Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, that includes organic, lamb, barley, carrots, apples and molasses.<br /><br />I'm not seriously into organic products myself but there is precious little regulation when it comes to what goes into pet products. I am glad to see that some people take my dog's health seriously.<br /><br />As consumers, we should also remember that Paul Newman and his companies has given over $200 million to charity over the years. Who better to give your money to?

review/summary: Great organic dog treat
review/text: My dog loves these and I feel good about giving them to her since they're organic.  When I first opened the package, I thought the treats were a little too large for my small dog, but was happy to see that they're scored and fairly easy to break in two.  If I had any complaints, it would be that the treats are extremely hard and are a little bit difficult for my 15 year old dog to eat.

review/text: I wish more companies were as good as Newman's Own. You feel like you are getting quality food at a good price. That's why I jumped at getting these for my dog when I heard about them.<br /><br />They are the same consistency as "Milk Bones" maybe a little denser. They come in around 1"x 2"x 1/4", they can be easily broken in two because of a seam in the middle. I have a minature Maltese and they are kind of big for him but I just break it into quarters for him which is a little hard to do but it can be done.<br /><br />He seems to enjoy eating them and I know they are better than most of the stuff out there since they are made by a company with such high standards for food.

review/summary: My dog loves them A++++
review/text: I ordered the new Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats because they looked intriguing and I can always use treats for my dogs. I have to Papillion spaniels.  Unfortunately, after the package arrived, it disappeared. I was frantic and looked everywhere. Later in the evening, my family had found the package. It appears that the smaller dog had managed to climb up on the chest where the package had been set and carried it off. She had spent the entire afternoon gnawing at the mailer, until she'd managed to free the treat bag. Unfortunately for her, the re-sealable zip lock bag the treats came in was impervious to her small teeth, so she ended up simply `nesting' with the package which is what she does with items she likes.<br /><br />So, I opened the package. They are about domino sized and a bit large for my small dog, but they come with a dent in the middle so the treat can be broken.  We gave her one, and she eagerly ate the treat. She then stalked me watching me pleading for more until my sister came and took her away.  I can see the treats are going to be something she really goes for.<br /><br />The verdict: My dog really likes these. Enough to steal the mailer and try to open the package they came in- something she never does.  I like them, because I like Newman's Own because they contain organic ingredients, and I trust the brand. I like the fact that the package is re-sealable, and also that the treats do not smell unpleasant. This is a good item, and one I would recommend without reservation.

review/summary: Taste great but too big and hard
review/text: These are great tasting dog treats but I don't like to spoil my puppies too much and would have preferred smaller pieces even for our Corgi. Our other puppy is about half his size. They are the hardest puppy treats we have tried so breaking them into smaller pieces isn't a simple task even for a man's hands. I was worried how tough they would be for our puppies to chew but they didn't complain. In fact, they took a bit more time and didn't inhale them which is a good thing!<br /><br />Another Newman's Own quality product.

review/summary: Organic, healthy, and incredibly tasty (according to Lily the golden retriever)
review/text: Lily, my fourteen-year-old golden retriever volunteered to test Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. I didn't tell her that they were good for her. After all, treats are supposed to be yummy "extras". When I gave her one to try, she gave it the sniff test and put it down to think about. A few seconds later she picked it up and chomped it up. A bit later I gave her another. This time there was no delay. She ate it with gusto!<br /><br />Aside from passing the taste test, these treats are really good for a dog. Wheat free, these treats are made from barley, lamb and other natural ingredients. Each treat is a rectangular cookie, scored so it can be snapped into two treats. Lily would like me to point out that there is no reason to waste energy dividing a treat. She has no trouble eating the whole thing. I reminded her that smaller dogs might enjoy a more compact treat, so she reluctantly agreed that the scoring is a good idea; but just for small dogs, not her.<br /><br />The treats smell good to humans and based on the ingredient list, are a healthy addition to any dog's diet. The price for a pack of six bags (I didn't count, but a good number in each bag) isn't bad compared to other premium dog treats (I pay $5 for a 20 oz box of natural dog treats). The Newman's Own treats are 10 oz to a package, making them a bit expensive, but not bad considering the quality.

review/summary: He ate them begrudgingly
review/text: I was excited to offer these seemingly healthy treats to my dog, as I love other Newman's Own products such as their spaghetti sauce.  My dog Kirby was very excited as I opened the package and announced "Ooooh, I have a treeeeeat for you!" in the high pitched voice I use to get him worked up.  However, it was all downhill from there.  He eagerly took a cookie in his mouth, then gave me a look like "Seriously?"  He will eat them, but only if there is nothing better going.<br />  My husband was going to try one to give a second opinion.  However, after smelling them he announced that they smell like burnt oatmeal and probably taste like it too, and he refused to try them.<br />  I give these 2 stars because I would like my dog to eat them (as opposed to fatty pig ears), but he really doesn't care much for them.  He gets about as excited to eat these as I do to eat a Triscuit.

review/summary: My dogs love these
review/text: I have two dogs, an Alaskan Malamute and a Shiba Inu. Generally speaking, neither of them are exactly treat-shy and will eat almost any snack you put in front of them. That being said, when I opened up the bag of Newman's and let them try one of the Lamb and Barley treats, they loved it. Usually with dry treats my dogs will sniff them and give you a look of "Ok, this is nice, but where's the dried chicken or duck jerky?" and only eat them after realizing that there's nothing else coming. With the Newman's Own, they sniffed them once and immediately started chowing down without so much as a "What else ya got?" look.<br /><br />While these treats are amazing and made with 95% organic ingredients, there are a few caveats. First they are very, very dry and hard. Each treat is made up of two squares, made to be breakable down the center scoring if you wanted to divide the treat up. Each square is approximately 1"x1". Breaking apart the squares will help release a little of the odor of the biscuits - after the first time I gave the dogs these treats, they started snubbing them a bit until I would break a piece off. I think that perhaps the outer portion of the snack gets dried out and no longer has any smell that the dogs can detect (or it's really faint). Once you break them apart, the dogs recognize the smell and eat it up. Since they are so hard however - if you have an older dog with teeth issues, this is probably not the best treat for them.<br /><br />Second, since the snack is so dry, it is very crumbly. If you have a dog that only eats the chunks and never cleans up the crumbs, you'll have a mess to deal with every time they eat these. As my dog breaks apart the treat, it deteriorates into several pieces including minute crumbs. My dogs generally lick the floor until everything's picked up, but if you have a plush carpet, this might be something to consider.<br /><br />Other than that, my dogs love these treats and I'll probably be picking up more in the future.

review/summary: I know the Features, but not the Benefits
review/text: It's hard to review something a dog eats. Our dog didn't say anything about this treat, but he did gobble it up heartily. Then again, he gobbles up any treat I give him. I can't say I noticed anything different about his reaction to this treat than compared to, say, Milk Bones, except it takes him longer to eat these (they are hard). The makers leave it up to the dog owners to know or assume the benefits of this treat, because it doesn't say what they are on the bag. The bag lists a lot of features, like Organic, No Wheat, No Corn and Baked in Small Batches, but it doesn't say why these things are beneficial. The back of the bag has a fictional story about Newman's dog rumored to be writing a Tell All book. I assume it must appeal to Newman's target audience, and I'm not in that audience. Maybe it's just the marketing consultant in me, but I think it would be useful to list the benefits as well as the features.

These treats look and smell good, without the usual dog treat odor. They claim to be organic with no wheat or corn. Judging by my corgi's reaction, they get an enthusiastic 2 paws up!

review/text: My dog loves this stuff.  No dog I've offered it to has rejected it.  The treats are hard, so older dogs and/or dogs with teeth issues will have a hard time.  The treats, even when broken in half, are about an inch square and 1/4-inch thick, so small dogs may have problems as well.  They don't crumble easily, so transporting them in one's pockets doesn't leave one with a gooey mess after doing laundry.  I'm pretty sure they are pricier than the treats one gets at the supermarket, but I'd spring for them once or twice a year for special treats, as opposed to the "normal" treats I give Bruno when he is doing what he's supposed to do even though he'd like to be doing something else.

We've tried local home-made peanut butter ones that seemed to rank one wag and a yawn. We tried another major brand organic treats that resulted in a look like "are you kidding?". We even tried a different Newmand's that ended up getting tossed - the dogs literally wouldn't touch them and acted outright offended at the suggestion this was their "treat". On the other hand, these were a hit. Rather than acting offended, they actually seemed to enjoy these. Bottom line - pooch approved.

review/summary: A little hard for older dogs
review/text: My dog seemed to really like these treats, but he's nearly 12 years old (he's a German Shepherd mix), and they were SO hard on his teeth. We usually buy him softer, easier to chew cookies because he's teeth are old. He liked these, but they were hard as rocks so after a while he started turning them down, and I'm pretty sure it was because of the hardness. I could see that he actually had trouble biting down on them.<br /><br />However, I think if you have a younger dog who can handle the hard-as-rocks issue, then these would be great. They are definitely all natural, and the ingredients list is very short. They use all natural, organic ingredients, no chemicals, nothing nasty or artificial. They even smell pretty decent. They smell like barley to me, which of course is one of the ingredients.<br /><br />We are big into feeding our dog natural treats and food with no added preservatives, so we were pleased with that aspect of these treats.

review/summary: A Tasty Treat for your Large Dog
review/text: These are large biscuits that can be broken in half easily, but are still large.  I gave a half to my 48 pound mutt and she spit it out at first not sure what to do with it.  She's used to the small peanut butter treats from Costco.  I encouraged her to eat it and she finally did.  She left quite a few crumbs along the way which eventually were eaten.  Obviously my dog liked the way the biscuits tasted but I like the neatness of smaller dog treats.  If you have a small dog, these wouldn't work unless you wanted to spend time breaking them into smaller chunks.  If you have a large dog and are looking for an organic alternative, try these.

review/summary: Good and healthy!
review/text: I have three dogs.  Two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier.  They all have their own favorite treats, but this one is one that all of them enjoyed.  It was nice for a dog treat to be healthy and taste good.  I liked the fact that the treats can be easily broken in half and they are hard and dense enough to take them a while to eat.  This is a very good product.  I will continue to buy them for my dogs.

review/summary: For the big dogs only
review/text: This is packaged in a resealable, air tight pouch which is easy to open.  The treats are thick and quite hard.  They are scored so they can be snapped in two, with a bit of effort.<br /><br />I called my canine food testing panel, Hunter - a four year old, 65 lb Golden Retriever, and Boston - a three year old 35 lb mixed breed.  Both members of the panel were called and appeared quite interested when the treat package was opened, although it must be noted that this is their usual response to any promise of food.  Each caught the treat when it was tossed and quickly gobbled it down, then stared at the bag waiting for a second sample.  After receiving treats for two days both panel members would return from the yard immediately when the bag was shaken and they were called - high praise indeed from this pair.<br /><br /> These treats are quite hard and did require that some chewing  occur rather than their usual practice of swallowing things whole which I considered a plus as it would help clean their teeth to some extent.  I do though question as to whether a small dog or one with diseased (or missing) teeth would be able to chew these treats.  To test this I offered these treats to my cats, and although both expressed interest in them neither were able to bite into the treats.<br /><br />I liked this product, both my dogs were happy with the treats (although to be fair neither one has ever been picky).  I was impressed that the ingredients were all natural and found the packaging quite convenient to use.  For my two dogs the hardness was a plus as it did make them chew even a bit rather than gulping whole.  I do not though think that this would be a good product to give a very young puppy, a small dog or one who had any dental problems as I do not think these animals would be able to safely break up the treats.

review/text: Since having our son 4 years ago, it's been even more important to give our dogs organic healthy food.  The reason for this is for some reason, my son thinks since the dogs eat the food, he can too.  I've tried following this with snacks as well, but we have rather picky dogs.  Most organic or holistic treats are met with either a turned up nose, or eaten without enthusiasm.<br /><br />I loved the ingredients in these (organic lamb, organic barley, and other organic ingredients).  So I thought I'd give them a try.  As soon as I opened the bag, my dogs came running.  I can easily break them in half so the treats are a little smaller (although they are still too large to be good training treats), and my dogs sat, stayed, then came when called to get at these new treats.  They repeated this process several times, which is all I can ask from any treat, especially one that is so healthy.  These treats are scored in the middle, so it is easy to break them.<br /><br />And yes, my 4 year old son did take one and try it, and he says they are really tasty too!  Our dogs are both 75 pounds (a very picky Akita/husky mix who won't even eat raw meat, and a big brown mutt that doesn't like peanut butter), so I'm not sure if these treats would be as good for small breeds.  The pieces when broken in half are a little over an inch square.

review/summary: Healthy treats for dogs
review/text: I love that these are made with organic ingredients and a short list at that:<br />  "organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm  oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), organic molasses"<br /><br />I usually get my dog Milk-Bones (Milk Bone Gravy Bones), which is something I can pick up at my grocery store. And I've always felt like maybe I was buying her junk. But whenk I look at the ingredients for milk-bones, they're maybe not that bad.<br /><br />(Ingredients for regular Milk-Bones, from their web site: Ingredients: Wheat flour, beef meal and beef bone meal, milk, wheat bran, beef fat preserved with tocopherols, salt, dicalcium phosphate, wheat germ, natural flavor, calcium carbonate, brewers dried yeast, malted barley flour, vitamins (choline chloride, dl-alpha tocopheryl ecetate [vitamin e], vitamin a acetate, calcium pantothenate, riboflavin, vitamin b12 supplement, d-activated animal sterol [source of vitamin d3]), sodium metabisulfite (dough conditioner), minerals (zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, ethylenediamine dihydriodide [source of iodine]).) Amazon product link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043P1OIU">Milk Bone Gravy Bones Biscuits for Small and Medium Size Dogs, 19-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />If you have a dog with allergies, or want to feed your dog organic foods, the Newman's are definitely the thing. They are about twice as expensive as the milk-bones at Amazon, FWIW, but that is consistent with many organic foods.<br /><br />I have tested my dog a few times to see which she prefers, making her sit and putting one of each on the floor. The first time, she went straight for the Newman's. The next several times, she went straight for the Milk-Bones. So I think she likes the Milk-Bone treats better, but she likes them both.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. organic ingredients and a short list<br />2. dog likes them<br />3. scored, so that it's easy to break them in half (most of the time)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. more expensive<br /><br />That's the one con, right? Everything else is great about these.

review/text: I have two chihuahuas who couldn't even get their mouths around these treats.  I would have broken them into smaller chunks, but they are very hard.  So, for small dogs these treats are a bust, but I took them next door and tried them out on my neighbors golden labs and they were a hit!  I'd guess that any dog over about 30-40 pounds would be able to crack into these treats without a problem, but dogs smaller than that probably won't be able to chew them.

review/summary: Won't go to waste, but not a fav
review/text: My Shepherd mix ate the first one of these I gave him right away, but waited with the second. The biscuit is thick and hard, and it is scored down the middle so that owners of mid-sized dogs can break it in half. I don't think it's going to be small enough for small dogs, and it's hard to break other than where it is scored. I'm sure these will get eaten, and I'm glad they are organic and have good ingredients, but they weren't especially a favorite. I would say my dog likes the Newman chicken biscuits, the heart-shaped ones, better. They are thinner, and possibly easier to chew, altho he doesn't really hesitate about chewing bones. Not really sure what goes on in his mind, but maybe a hard cookie is not enticing enough for an energetic chew?

review/summary: This one gets a "four ears up" rating
review/text: What is "four ears up"?  Read on, I'll explain later.<br /><br />The first thing I did when I received the Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley Treats was to read the lable.  Darn near everything is listed as organic.  Whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal opinion and personally, I don't even look for organic food for myself.  Is organic food actually healthier?  I don't know, but for the purposes of this review, that's neither here nor there.  The treats themselves are hard and crunchy and about 1" x 2" in size.  Each is scored so they can be broken in half.  I preferred to break them in half for all my dogs even though none would have had issues with the size.<br /><br />My house seems to revolve around my 4 rescued dogs, 2 Australian Kelpie mixes, a Yellow Lab mix, and a beautiful Heinz 57, maybe a doberman/border collie mix.  Weights run from 30 lbs to 85 lbs.  At one point in their lives, all of them had been abused and I do know for a fact that 2 had been starved.  As a result none are too picky about dog food or treats.  When presented with the Newman's treats for the first time 3 dogs took them quickly, but not as quickly as usual.  One dropped the treat and sniffed it before eating it.  My lab spent about 15 seconds sniffing before she would take it.  When given their regular brand of treats, the lab usually sniffs for just a second before taking it and the others just grab and inhale them.  At another treat time each dog was presented with 2 treats side by side on the floor, one of the Newman's and one of their regular brand.  Two dogs, including the hesitant Lab, chose their regular brand first before eating the Newman's.  The 2nd time I tried that, 3 out of four at their regular brand first.  That pretty much ended the experimentation and I just gave the Newman's treats until they were gone. One of the Kelpies actually refused the Newman's a couple of times which for him was highly unusual since he's usually the first in line at treat time. The others never did seem overly excited about eating organic but did eat them.  When we changed back to the usual brand they scarfed them down as usual.<br /><br />Now we get to the "four ears up".  When my four are really excited about something they will sit at full attention with their ears completely perked up.  At the treat times when they were being fed the Newman's, they initially started out with perked ears then once they found out what they were getting, their excitement faltered and they seemed somewhat indifferent.  Since there are four dogs with 2 ears each, an "8 ears up" would be a perfect rating where they were excited about eating or doing something.  Since, with the 2 exceptions, they never did refuse the Newman's but ate them without much excitement, these treats get a "four ears up" rating, pretty much middle of the road.<br /><br />If feeding your dogs organic treats is important to you, definately give thee a try.  Just be forewarned that they may be a bit on the large side for small dogs and they do seem harder and crunchier than some other brands.  Given the cost and the lackluster response from my dogs, it's highly unlikely that I'll be giving them the Newman's in the future.

review/summary: My three shelter pups love them.
review/text: I have two puppy min-pin/rat terrier mixes from the shelter and another older shelter treasure, also a terrier mix.  All three love these treats. I use them to get the puppies to come in from the backyard races they get too involved in to listen to me.  And they work! (I have to make sure I don't run out of these - ever.)<br /><br />They seem very hard, but no more than regular Milkbones, and this is probably a good thing in regard to teeth cleaning.  The treats need to be broken in half, but are scored to make it easy.  They are also somewhat large (approximately 1.5 inch square) for the puppies but I don't mind that so much since the treats are organic and apparently much more appealing than regular dog food.<br /><br />I will continue to buy these on Amazon.  Our local Wal-Mart does not carry them and our pet store is asking $2 more per bag than Amazon.

He NEVER takes ANY treat from anyone's hand.<br /><br />After he ate the 2nd one he waited for yet another!  I told him I'd give him another one after he goes outside.  He stood and waited for another 5 minutes before he finally went and laid down.  Then the cat stole one from the bag.  LMAO!

If I tell him he's got a package, he'll happily and eagerly  open it himself.  This time, after a few sniffs, he couldn't care less.  He lost interest in the package right away.  I took two treats out for him and he just looked at them and walked away.  To be fair, he IS pretty picky.  Like all treats, some dogs will like them, some won't.

review/text: I am Mr. August, the nom de plume, of this Amazon reviewer.  I did lie on this review; I am 12 years old not 13, so that may disqualify me but I am the one that ate Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats.  As a west highland terrier, needless to say, I am very fussy and rather demanding.  I am well loved and my "masters" will buy me almost anything.  This treat is perfect for me since I cannot eat anything that has grains.  All my food must be wheat free.  I had cancer a few years ago and my miracle Vet told me that the other food encourges cancer growth.  Therefore, I am a protein addict and often get hamburger, fish, chicken prepared for humans.  Now that's a treat.<br /><br />I was given these treats and I noticed my "father" broke it in half.  He thought it would be too much for me.  I thought I could handle it, but the cookie took some effort to break down.  I finished it and asked for more.  I know they will buy it for me because it has the ingredients I can eat and they trust Newman's product development and manufacturing.  All my food is expensive so the price will not be a factor.  I am grateful there are good tasting grain-free treats for me, and this one passes my sniffing and palate tests. Now that you know me, you can call me Augie.

review/summary: Good for larger dogs; not so much for small ones
review/text: Let's face facts, dogs will pretty much eat anything that you put in front of them - they really are not that choosy.  They drink dirty garden water, smell each other privates, and occasionally snack on cat turds, so trying to determine if a treat tastes good really is not that easy.<br /><br />Having said that, my two medium size dogs (roughly 30 pounds each) absolutely love these treats. I like the fact that they don't have that smelly dog treat scent that most have (they smell more like people food - kind of like a ginger snap), and because they are harder and larger than my normal treats, the dogs must crunch them, promoting tooth cleanliness. But if you have a smaller dog (I also have a Yorkie), these treats are just way too large.<br /><br />They are about two inches long and one inch wide (with a perforation in the middle). They contain organic ingrediants including carrots, apples and molasses, rather than fillers like corn meal.  They are relatively easy to break at the perforation - but really hard to break down further (though a hammer works well).  My Yorkie looked down at the treat then looked up at me with an expression of "you gotta be kidding me" and stared at me until I gave him one of his regular treats.<br /><br />The only drawback is that unless they are purchased in bulk, they are a bit expensive, so I would not use them as a training treat. But for the occasional atta boy treat - my older boys love them.

review/summary: Inedible for smaller dogs
review/text: I have always trusted the "Newman's Own" brand.  From popcorn to salad dressings, I have never been disappointed in one of their products.  Until now.  Each dog treat is scored to break it easy and is of similar size to a fig newton about 2" X 1-1/4 inch and quite thick - about 1/2 inch. And hard as a rock.  I am all for organic products, but when my dogs don't care for them, it's not like I can bribe them to eat it like I can with kids.  Our dogs are around 15-20 pounds and I think these dog treats are a little bit too hard for them.  The first time we tried to feet these treats to them they turned up their noses. They were absolutely NOT interested at all.  The next time we tried they carried them around in their mouths for a minute or so, and decided, for some reason, that they were inedible.  However, the third try must have been when they were REALLY hungry because they appeared more interested. But this is more like rawhide than a "treat". Our dogs really had to work on this for a long time. Our younger dog, a Shih Tzu did okay and after about 15 minutes was making headway on eating it.  Our elderly Japanese Chin who is 14 (that's 98 in dog years) was  much more fussy.  She seemed interested for awhile and even though she still has all her teeth, she just couldn't be enticed to do much more than sniff it. Perhaps a larger dog would like these better. I haven't given up on "Newman's Own" brand but I doubt that I'll try their New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Biscuits (made with lamb and barley)again.

A couple of sniffs and then the treat disappeared.<br /><br />If I could change anything with the treats, I would love for them to come in a single bite instead of two biscuits together.

I get no meat or lamb aroma from them at all.  The biscuits are about 0.5" thick and 1" x 2.5" in size with a score line so you can break it cleanly in half.<br /><br />I'm pleased that there are only 6 ingredients in the mix but palm oil is being used which, organic or not, takes away some of the health appeal.  Regardless, I would consider these treats to be healthier than most.<br /><br />Would I buy a 6-pack of 10-oz bags? I find the price point somewhat high for biscuit treats so I would consider it if Lucy really showed interest in them but at this time these treats are not high on my shopping list.

These are more for medium to large dogs.  We have a larger Shih-tzu that liked them and did fine, but maybe even if they were a different shape then the small dogs would do better.  They are currently a large, hard rectangle that can be broken into 2 smaller squares. When the smaller dogs try to eat them, they make a bit of a mess.<br /><br />Even with the size/shape limitations, both of my dogs loved them and ate them right up.  And I would mention that our Shih-tzu is super picky.  I would definitely buy these for my dogs.

review/summary: My Pup Eats These Slowly
review/text: I feel good about giving these to my dog because of the organics bit. I have one of those dogs who will eat almost anything.  She sits pretty for these, then takes them.  She doesn't devour them immediately or swallow whole like she does a lot of other snacks I give her.  She drops, sniffs and then carries it off to eat slowly under the bed.  That's probably not a bad thing.  It also may have something to do with the shape.  They are rectangular, about 1"x 2" and about 1/8 of an inch thick.  They are scored so you can break them into squares. They are very dry, crunchy treats.  I believe that is the reason she drops them and picks them up is because of the flat wide/long shape; she has to get them situated in her mouth.  She is an 8-year-old, 21 lbs mutt...looks like a miniature Chow Chow or a really large Pom...meaning she has a normal snout, not like a pug or peke. Anyway, these are slightly too large for her mouth, so if your dog is smaller, they may not work so well.

review/summary: A Two Dog Review
review/text: This review is based on my impression of the Newman's dog treats, and the reaction of my two dogs. The variables:<br /><br />1) I have two Lhasapoos (mixed breed), almost 13 yrs old, with healthy teeth.<br />2) One is 13 lbs & one is 11 lbs, comparable in size to a large (not fat) house cat.<br />3) They are fed dry dog food, which is left in a feeder, so they eat whenever they like -- even so, they only eat small amounts.<br />4) When they are given a "treat," it's not all the time, and they receive either a dog biscuit or a raw-hide stick -- never people food.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the Newman treats didn't smell any differently than their usual dog biscuits, and I was concerned with the large size. I noticed they had an indentation in the middle, but only a few biscuits were easy to break in half; most of them were just too hard to snap -- and I have strong hands...I can't imagine someone with arthritis being able to break one of these in half. The Newman treats are a great size for a bigger breed, like a golden retriever, for instance.<br /><br />I put the Newman biscuits in the same canister that I use for other treats, even though the bag is resealable. I wasn't sure if the bag would affect my dogs' reactions to a new treat. By the way, I did read all the ingredients on the bag & it all looked healthy to me. I didn't see a reason why the dogs wouldn't like the treats.<br /><br />I gave them half a piece each, after their morning potty break; they do not eat at night because they sleep in our bedroom with the door closed. They appeared very excited until the pieces were in their mouths, and then both dogs spit the pieces out & stared at me like I just tried to feed them dirt. I told them, "you're not getting anything else for a treat," and walked away; they reluctantly ate the pieces. Over the past week or so, I've given them a whole biscuit every other day. They always eat them, but they don't wolf them down (no pun intended, really) they way they do with their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBIP5W">Milk-Bone Biscuits for Small Dogs</a>.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a texture issue? Too bad my dogs can't tell me...not to give TMI, but I am the one who does "poop patrol" in the backyard & the biscuits don't seem to have affected the consistency or size of the poop. (Look, I don't normally review dog food -- I'm not sure what other dog owners would be concerned about LOL)<br /><br />Anyway, I don't recommend this product for dogs under 25 lbs, or dogs with weak teeth or dental problems that could affect crunching-ability.

review/summary: Hardest cookies ever made?
review/text: These are apparently very tasty cookies. I have a Jack Russell mix and a Shih Tzu, and they appear to like the cookies very much.<br /><br />However, the cookies are like rocks. I have a difficult time breaking them apart even when they are meant to be broken apart. Each cookie is a sectioned two piece. It's impossible to break them apart further by hand.<br /><br />The JR mix finally succeeded in breaking down the cookie with his teeth. The Shih Tzu couldn't do it, no matter how hard he tried. Frankly, I worry he could break a tooth on these things.<br /><br />The ingredients look good (and they smell good), though I'm a little concerned about the palm oil--is it as bad for dogs as it is for humans?<br /><br />Even though the dogs seem to like them (I used a mallet to give small pieces to the Shih Tzu), I can't see buying them again. They're too much trouble.

review/summary: More than just a dog treat?
review/text: When this arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the bag.  I was expecting a little sample bag but received a full 10-oz sized bag.  Looking at the purchase price on Amazon, I think this is very fairly priced.  At $23.60 for a 6-pack, that is just a little under $4 for each bag which is very competitive with other dog treats - many of which have lower quality ingredients.<br /><br />Speaking of ingredients.....Lamb?  Barley?  Organic.  Okay, I'll admit it - I just had to try one myself.  They're hard so I had to soak it a little but they are actually quite good.<br /><br />My dog is a 45lb mutt who will eat anything, so it doesn't surprise me that he took one with alacrity and I didn't see it again.  I also keep chickens and it occurs to me that for a little protein boost, this would be a fun way to treat them too.  I'd have to soak them for awhile but I think they will also be getting a treat.<br /><br />The only thing I would like to see added is another version of this treat that includes glucosamine.  My dog has severe hip dysplasia and we supplement him with glucosamine twice a day.  He doesn't love the pills and administering them is not a fun job, but because we can tell a different when he's on them, we persevere.  However a treat like this that he wolfs down, that includes the glucosamine?  Now THAT I would be willing to pay good money for.  And as common as this disorder is, there would be a huge market for a product like that.

They are organic<br />4. My dog loved them<br />5. My cat even loved them<br /><br />6. One last thought...they are very hard treats. When you own a Beagle, keeping their attention is a chore. I can hold these treats in my hand and only expose one corner of the treat for my dog to crunch. This keeps her attention longer in situations like a nail trim or Vet exam.<br /><br />****** (6 stars!)

review/summary: Quality Product But My Dog Did Not Care For These
review/text: Newman's Own is a quality company that manufactures quality pet products.  I was surprised that my dog did not care for these treats.  I purposely researched these treats online and they do not lack in quality.  Just because my dog did not care for these, it doesn't mean that it shouldn't receive 5 stars.

review/summary: Not for small dogs.
review/text: As the name indicates these treats are organic which is a positive, especially as many treats have unnamed chemicals in them.  As a rule I only buy organic treats or treats with single ingredients (freeze dried beef lung) etc.  In addition both of my dogs seem to throughly enjoy these treats, which is a positive.<br /><br />However, the problem with these treats is that they are not for small dogs, which is a problem for me, as I have two small dogs.  Even though the treats can be easily broken in half they are still about 3x the usual treats for small/toy dogs (I have one ~20 lb and one ~10).  Not truly a problem with the quality of the treat, but it should be in the title.

review/summary: Dogs gave mixed reviews for this treat
review/text: Pros - I love that there is an organic option for dog treats!  I taste tested it with two doggies.  My dog who wolfs down her dry, diet food like it is steak devoured this treat and seemed to absolutely love it.  My dog who isn't very interested in food in general took the treat, then dropped it out of her mouth like it was a piece of cardboard.  After much sniffing, she did slowly nibble and finish the treat.  So, in the end she did eat it, but not with gusto.  My assessment is that this treat is not going to be a big hit with every dog.  It is quite dry and hard (and does not break into a smaller size very easily), so it doesn't have a greasy, meaty appeal that gets both of my dogs excited.  But the greasy treats are usually unhealthy, so I would choose this option in the future.<br /><br />If you have an overweight dog I would highly recommend it, since it appears like a light and dry snack, and it isn't full of nasty fats and artificial flavors.  It's an excellent choice if health is your top concern.  I try to support organics as much as possible, so I do recommend this product with some reservations and I can see myself buying it in the future.

review/summary: good hard biscuits for larger dogs
review/text: These are basically the same texture as Milk Bones for large dogs, but rectangular (2.25" x 1.25" x 0.5"). They have a ridge across the top so you can snap the biscuit in two. I cannot always get them to break, but I'm an older woman.<br />Both the Rottweiler and the Cocker Spaniel like them.  The cocker has the same problem I do, the hard texture.  But this is no problem for the larger dog.<br />My experience with the Newman's Own brands has always been positive.  And this really is a product from New Zealand.<br />Here's the ingredients list:<br />organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, palm oil, organic molasses.<br /><br />I would consider buying them, but only for larger dogs or ones with strong jaws.

My only complaint is that I wish they were either smaller or scored so I could break them in half.  They are too hard and thick to break in my hand...<br /><br />I love that these do not smell and seem just as good to ray when I have left the bag open... he doesn't complain of them being stale.

review/summary: Quality made, healthy treat for dogs
review/text: Newman's Own Organics Dog Treats - It was a nice surprise to see a quality made, healthy treat made for dogs.  The bag comes with a zip lock top to keep the treats fresh and makes for easy storage after it is open.  Each treat is scored in half so you can break it down to a smaller size.  A whole treat was great for our basset hound and 1/2 of a treat worked best for our beagle.  It would be nice if they came in an even smaller size too, as the 1/2 was a bit much for our terrier.  They are too hard to break in 1/2 again without additional scoring.  Our basset hound often has a sensitive stomach, so the organic ingredients made it a safe treat that she loved. There is no greasy residue, like some special diet treats can have, and they are crunchy enough to help keep our dogs' teeth clean.  I would definitely recommend these to our friends who have dogs with food allergies to corn or wheat.  This is a quality product that our dogs enjoyed and I would purchase in the future.

review/summary: Crunchy treats for the dogs in our life
review/text: Dog treats. What do you do with dog treats? Well, if you have a dog that is very food-centered, then dog treats are the best thing going as you can use them as the necessary treats for helping in training your dog, or maintaining his/her training later on in their lives.<br /><br />We have a big dog, so training her is a must. These treats are definitely a hit with our pooch! They are also small enough that we do not feel too bad using several during a training session. They are dry squares with a look and feel of thick crackers. Once you open the bag, there are many pieces, but there is a line through the center which means that you can break them in half pretty easily. This extends the amount of them you can use by two.<br /><br />I cannot vouch for how they taste but they certainly attract my dog and she is very attentive when I bring the bag out. The label talks about the ingredients being organic, consisting of Lamb and Barley - which is all to the good as there are dogs that are not happy with corn-based products, etc.<br /><br />All in all, it's a nice product and one that my dog appreciates, and I would definitely consider purchasing them at my store.

review/summary: My dogs love them - medium breed, like hard treats
review/text: I have a pair of 50-lb. bird dogs who eat rawhide frequently.  They love these treats--so much that they both run into the next room to enjoy away from the other dog.  For a smaller breed or less enthusiastic and able chewers, these might be a little hard to chew.  The biscuit is scored so it's possible to break it.  My dogs don't have allergies, but the organic, no-wheat, no-corn recipe might be good if yours do.<br /><br />I have a Milk-Bones budget rather than a Newman's Own budget, but I'd consider ordering the 6-pack of these to keep a pack and share the rest as gifts for friends and family with canine sidekicks.

review/summary: Such a hit with my senior dog, I decided to add it to my amazon subscriptions
review/text: My 13 yr old lab developed gastro issues over the last 6 months, so I've had to become very picky about his treats. I received a bag of Newman's Own through amazon's vine review program. The ingredient list is tummy-friendly and my dog loves them. When I tested putting this treat next to another that he likes, he went for the Newman's first. A true lab, he is not picky about what he eats, but he will gobble up things he prefers 1st when there is a choice. Since the item is offered by amazon through its subscription program, I decided to take the plunge. 34 cents an ounce for 6 bags of a high quality treat delivered conveniently each month to my home is a good deal for me.

review/summary: Beat MilkBone in Our Exhaustive Test
review/text: Our two beagles seemed to prefer Newman's over MilkBone.<br /><br />With each dog, we conducted two separate sniff-taste tests between Newman's Own Lamb and Barley Dog treat and the small size MilkBone Essentials Plus Optimal Health Biscuits. We figured the MilkBone product was more like the Newman's than the fake dog jerky-a.k.a. dog crack- we also had on the shelf. The tests took place after they had eaten meals.<br /><br />The test subjects were<br />1.  Maggie - the almost 9-year-old vacuum cleaner beagle who will eat anything, especially if it comes out of a plastic bag (have to warn visitors who bring their toiletries in zip bags because she will take the bags outside).<br />2. Lucy - the 8-year-old rescue beagle we took in, who is pickier about her chow, but can sniff out anything food related from 4-feet away (she could have a career sniffing out illegal food in luggage, seriously).<br /><br />The test method was to hold 1/2 of a Newman's treat in one hand and a Milkbone in the other. First we let them smell our hands with the treats inside our fists. Then we did the switcheroo behind our back and put them out in open palms.<br /><br />Both dogs preferred the smell of Newman's after breakfast and went for the little square as soon as we opened our hands.<br /><br />The sniff part of the after dinner tests were a little inconclusive. Maggie went for the Newman's completely. But Lucy was a little confused at first. She kept sniffing the Milkbone hand initially -- but we believe there was contamination problem with the test because I had just eaten a Cheez-It. After the old switcheroo, she went for the Newman's instantly.<br /><br />So, the dogs preferred to eat the Newman's, but Lucy initially preferred the faint smell of Cheez-Its contaminant in one sniff test session.<br /><br />From a cookie giver's perspective, Newman's did not have an overwhelming gross smell to it. The bag it comes in has a zip top, so they may keep their scent longer than the average Milkbone turning stale inside a cardboard box.<br /><br />Note: I did think the obviously Photoshopped Paul Newman graphic on the packaging was a little creepy. I'm sure he hadn't had arms that looked like that since "Cool Hand Luke." It might be time to just let his image rest in peace.

review/summary: Lamb and Barley Dog Treats
review/text: We all want to do what's best for our dogs.  And with these treats, we can probably feel a little bit better about what we're giving them.  For my dog at least, we had a fairly successful outcome using these.<br /><br />My dog is stubborn, very stubborn, and we're in the process of retraining all the bad habits out of her left by her numerous previous owners.  This is a trying experience, especially in a dog that is not food motivated once outside (inside is a different story!).  Usually I can take her out on a walk, try to bribe her with treats, and she still focuses on everything but me.  These treats produced a different effect.  She got one whiff and all of a sudden I was the most interesting thing around.  As far as I could tell, they seemed to taste good to her and can be used as a high value treat.  Inside we had a different experience with these treats.  She was so focused on the treats that she didn't listen to a word we said and just kept trying to get to them despite our commands.  This may not happen with every dog of course but if you've got a stubborn dog, it could have the same effect.<br /><br />They are fairly large and come in two attached together.  When outside trying to juggle everything else, they were somewhat difficult to break apart or even into smaller pieces (I can't see a small dog handling these treats well).  While the bag is pretty big and full of these treats, they do contain premium ingredients and could be a bit pricey for regular training treats for a dog.<br /><br />In regards to nutrition, these are very healthy.  The ingredients include Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil, and Organic Molasses.  I don't even get that much organic food normally!  I feel good giving her these treats though, and honestly, I've half a mind to try one myself they sound so good for you (although I will resist).<br /><br />I'll probably keep using these treats as a motivator for listening when we're outside.  They seem to be effect and I am pleased with their results there.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011

review/summary: Great little snack for my pampered pooch
review/text: This is a fragrant treat that is great for an in-between meal snack for my little puffball, a 6 year old lovable Bichon Frise.  He deserves to be pampered.  He's sensitive to treats that have a harder consistency.  However, cognizant of treats like these, I hand feed him.  It gives us some time to bond.  I held the treat for him, as he licked the cracker, and bit with his molars.  No difficulty for him, at all.<br /><br />Lamb treats are usually foul in smell and they're just as worse on the way out, too.  I acquired these with a little hesitation.<br /><br />I prefer natural snacks for my dog since he truly deserves the best.  Organic treats and organic diets are what I feed him.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great reward but not ideal for training purposes given the 5 cm size.  From the other end (please do mind the pun), it did not constipate him or give him runny stool - he has a sensitive GI tract.<br /><br />My dog loves it.

review/summary: Excellent Treat for dogs with allergy issues
review/text: Since a lot of allergy issues stem from what dogs are being fed, this is an excellent treat for your allergy prone dog.  You'll know them by their skin and ear issues.  While most dog treats remind me of beef jerky, these actually remind me of wheat granola bars.  They are medium sized bars that are scored in the middle so you can break them in half.  I have 3 dogs of all sizes:  110lb Chocolate Lab, 15lb Miniature Pinscher, 1lb Chihuahua.  All three dogs love this treat.  I give the whole piece to the Lab and then break another in half and give 1 half to the MinPin and the other half to the Chihuahua.  The first two devour this treat in seconds but it takes the Chihuahua half a day to make it through the treat.  I think that's good.  It gives him something to do and it'll clean his teeth too.  The treat is very crumbly if they break it apart.  My dogs always clean up the crumbs afterwards, but probably shouldn't feed this treat to them on the carpet.  All in all - I would highly recommend this product as a good, healthy, tasty treat for dogs that is hypoallergenic and can help break the tartar off their teeth.  It smells very clean and fresh, like a granola bar and the dogs love it!

review/summary: Imported, Organic, Non-corn based treats. Over the top?
review/text: First I must admit that I am not normally an only the very best will do for our pets kind of a person. I tend more towards middle of the road products for our pets, not the cheapest stuff, but I also don't seek out the most expensive. Thanks to Amazon's Vine program I received a bag of these to test out for free in return for writing a review. Judging from the product page, I'm not the only one :).<br /><br />When I read the ingredients list I was tempted to put a few in a pot of water and make stew for the family dinner. Organic barley, lamb and other goodies. Sounds good to me! But, I controlled myself and didn't try a taste.  When I gave one to the dog she absolutely loved it!  But, she loves to eat just about anything.<br /><br />As a matter of personal choice, these premium treats are just a bit of a step to far for me when it comes to pet food. I realize that saying so will probably earn me some "not helpful" votes. I can live with that.<br /><br />If you want only the very best products for your dog and your dog likes these, then by all means go for it! Just try not to think about how much bunker fuel is being burned to ship dog treats from New Zealand to North America.

review/summary: 5 Paws Up! Tasty and Healthy, Dog Recommended, Owner Approved
review/text: Taste wise, these treats have "paw's up" from our 5 dogs. We have a yellow lab who absolutely loved them, a few bites and it was gone. She had no problems chomping it up. Our maltese took her time and ate every last crumb she could find. Our shih tzu did the same. Their offspring had no problems as well. Our maltese is a mere 9lbs and I did not need to break them in half. I do like the fact they have the line down the center for easy breaking in two. Our eldest is quite picky, she is 17 and has years of experience with treats. Dispite being picky and not having many teeth left, she did take half of one that was offered and ate it. Mind you- she is a slow eater and can still chew hard treats and food. So 5 out of 5 taste wise.<br /><br />Parent wise, as their owners we want them to eat healthy food with the right ingredients and these fit that criteria. They are not only tasty but healthy. Because they are a dry treat they leave crumbs. Some dogs will clean the crumbs up like mine; however some eat the larger pieces and leave the rest of the mess for you to clean up- so keep that in mind especially if its on a carpet.

review/summary: Not for Old or Small Dogs
review/text: I have 2 treat-loving Pugs. When I broke the bar in 2 (they are scored) my one Pug chomped his down immediately. The other one couldn't bite through so I had to break it up for him. They both liked them, though. I do not recommend this for dogs smaller than Pugs or old dogs with problem teeth. For all other dogs I recommend--and love the organic and healthy ingredients!

review/summary: Gracie hurries into living room to eat one of these
review/text: Yes....Gracie really rushes into the living room to enjoy one of these treats in peace.  Any time she thinks something is really special...off she gos.  The treats are big enough that I break one into two pieces for a mini-dachshund.  She thinks she's eating candy and I know she's eating a treat that is full of healthy, organic ingredients.  So she's happy and so am I.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Dog and teenager approved
review/text: I have a Labrador Retriever who was very excited to try these. She loves them.  This isn't saying much as she pretty much eats anything.  However, I left them on the counter, my teenager accidentally tried one.  He said it wasn't too bad.  He's not willing to switch from human to dog treats but it's nice to know they have been tested on human taste buds and pass.<br /><br />The size of the treats are quite large as is the size of the bag. They don't smell offensive as many dog treats do. They are organic. I don't feel like I'm giving my dog the equivalent of a doggy candy bar.  They are reasonably priced. Great product overall.

review/summary: Too *Hard* For Small Breeds Or Puppies!
review/text: I thought the NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANIC LAMB AND BARLEY DOG TREATS were like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AEHN5A">Newman's Own Organics Chicken and Rice Training Treats</a>, which are in stick form and easy to break, but these are thick and hard biscuits!<br /><br />My Shiba Inu is only 6-months old and weighs about 13-15 lbs. so she had a hard time chewing on the treat. I had to soak it in water a little bit and that allowed her to break off corners of the treat with her mouth and eat them that way. She seems to enjoy them, though, and they smell really good that I'm tempted to try one.<br /><br />The LAMB AND BARLEY BISCUIT TREATS are pretty big but they're scored so you can break them in half easily and they come in a resealable bag. Another issue is that the treats leave crumbs, but that may be my Shiba's fault, so it's best giving these treats on a hard surface rather than carpet.<br /><br />I posted some pics of the treats so you can get a sense of the scale.<br /><br />Otherwise, these snacks are made with only essential ingredients and skips the wheat and corn products, as well as the meat-by-products, and should provide a healthier alternative to other commercially made dog biscuits that have a bunch of fillers and chemicals in them.

review/summary: Seemingly a good product and thumbs up from the pupster
review/text: I've come to expect good products from the Newman's Own franchise and this product was no exception.<br /><br />The list of ingredients, with the exception of Palm Oil (but at least it was organic AND the second-to-last ingredient listed), were very good.  The fact that they contain NO wheat or corn is absolutely excellent as those are two of the things that I avoid completely for the puppy.<br /><br />They are large-ish squares (about 1 1/4" and 7/16" thick), with two of them attached and easy to break apart should you choose, and very hard and dense.  For my 50+ lb Golden Retriever puppy that is a good thing because he is a major chewer.  For a very small dog, an elderly dog, or one who might not be much of a chewer at all, they might be a bit much.<br /><br />I cannot attest to the taste, as I didn't go so far as to taste them myself (I'm pretty sure they would not have been pleasing to me anyway), but the puppy seemed to really like them a lot.  It actually took him several minutes to get through one square and he is a mondo chewer, but he was not going to let me take that from him!  He was enjoying it a great deal.  Of course, that said, dogs will pretty much eat anything that fits in their mouths but he seemed to have a particular enjoyment for these so I'm happy with them as an occasional treat for him.

review/summary: Sit!  Stay!  Chew!
review/text: Fred, our Aussie Terrier, will eat anything that's not faster than he is.  So the fact that he eats his Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats is in no way a testimonial.  All evaluation will have to be left to me.<br /><br />These dog treats are 95% organic ingredients.  That carries a lot of weight with me.  I have confidence in the Newman's brands and hope that they continue to live up to their reputation.<br /><br />Fred likes the treats, but they're not his favorites.  He's young enough to deal with the hard, dry texture, but I wonder if they have as much aroma as more moist treats.  He eats them on the carpet (of course), then has to lick up the crumbs.  So we know that they're tasty enough for a greedy dog to hustle a bit.<br /><br />Each treat comes as a rectangular biscuit that can be broken into two squares.  Since the biscuits are hard and dry, even though they're scored, breaking them would be difficult for a person with joint issues.<br /><br />Four Stars.  The bottom line:  Tasty and safe, but not a favorite for dog or owner.

review/summary: Healthy & Tasty
review/text: I tried these out on my mom's older dog.  She is 13 years old and honestly, I think she would eat anything that doesn't eat her first.  Of course, she loved them.  She had no problem, despite her age, chewing these.  She is a Bichon Frise, so she's a small dog, but not a mini.<br /><br />I also tried these on my sister's dog who is 1.5 years old. This dog is much pickier.  She has snubbed many treats in the past.  However, she LOVES these and gobbled them up.  She begins whining as soon as she sees you get the package out.  She is a Schnoodle (mini-poodle mixed with schnauzer).  She is also a small dog, but not miniature.<br /><br />I love that these treats are actually healthy for the dogs, and do not have a foul odor.  Doggy breath is bad enough without stinky treats!

review/summary: Our dog *wants* to eat them
review/text: But unfortunately she's an Italian greyhound and these dog treats are too big for her! She really loves the smell of them and totally wants to eat them...as soon as she sees me reach for the bag she gives me her full attention and comes up and waits eagerly. However, these things are 1"+ on each side and she can't fit them in her mouth. They come connected to other pieces, so first you have to break these apart from each other. Then if you have a small dog, like an IG for instance, you'll have to break or cut or crumble them up from there. It would be easier if they weren't almost literally rock hard, which makes it really difficult if you're trying to just break them up by hand (which means if you're taking some out with you you'll probably want to prepare them beforehand). But she does want to eat them and when I managed to get a small enough piece for her she ate it up; a slightly larger one she worked on and worked on trying to chew on it.<br /><br />These are USDA organic treats and they must be doing something right, because as I said our IG gets totally excited when she sees the bag being picked up. It would be better if they were easier for small dogs to eat or if Newman's Own at least advertised that the target is ideally large dogs.

review/summary: Eight dewclaws up.  Everyone loved it, even the picky dog.
review/text: Ok, let's be honest.  There was no doubt in my mind that Harry, Pepper, and Honey would love these treats.  Dixie, on the other hand... well, I wasn't sure.<br /><br />Dixie is right there with everyone else when the treat bag is opened, but when she gets her treat, more often than not she goes back to her spot, lies down with the treat in front of her, and she guards it for a while.  Later we'll find it under the furniture or half buried in the yard.  The really yummy treats (hot dogs, anyone?) are gulped on the spot, but everything else is hoarded for, I guess, the day we forget to feed her.<br /><br />But not these.  Dixie was right there in the lineup, waiting for her treat.  Everyone got one, and there was much loud crunching to be heard.  A couple of minutes later, everyone was back, doing the cookie dance, trying to convince me that I'd somehow forgotten them, and Dixie was right there with them.  The second cookie was crunched as quickly (and as loudly) as the first.<br /><br />This was shortly after dinner, so I know it wasn't starvation that drove her to it.<br /><br />Honey is the smallest, at about 50 pounds, so these are big dogs, and a whole, unbroken treat was the right size for them.  I'd guess that breaking the treat at the halfway mark would make them the right size for a medium sized dog.  Toy breed owners might want to get out the hammer.<br /><br />These are very hard treats, so they're probably good for the teeth.  They left quite a few crumbs when crunched, but the crumbs were gone in seconds.  The package was hard, too... you should be able to tear it at the notch, but mine was still sealed when I tore off the top.  You might want to have scissors handy.<br /><br />Currently the package promises "Made with organic barley - no wheat - no corn".  The ingredients are "Organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), organic molasses."  Hey, these dogs eat better than I do!<br /><br />Guaranteed analysis:<br /><br />Crude protein: 9.0% min.<br />Crude fat: 4.0% min.<br />Crude fiber: 4.0% max.<br />Moisture: 11% max.<br /><br />Of course all that information may change, but since it's not in the description right now I thought I'd include it.<br /><br />Seems like good ingredients, might be good for dogs with food allergies, and they sure are popular here.  They're a little out of my price range, but that's understandable given the organic ingredients and lack of wheat, corn, and meat by-products.  Eight paws up here!

review/summary: Big hearty biscuits for big dogs!
review/text: These dog treats were an instant hit, and unlike most, weren't simply swallowed whole and followed by a happy grin waiting instantly for more.  My "big girl" actually laid down to eat her half of the treat, making sure she got every crumb before attempting to wheedle the other half.  The pickier smaller dog also liked hers, and the list of ingredients is sure to please a picky mom too--it didn't have a long list of unpronounceables and less-than-appetizing ingredients! (organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocophenals, a source of vitamin E,) organic molasses.)<br /><br />These are BIG biscuits, but they are scored to easily break them in half to double the fun of treating your pet to a healthy and apparently tasty treat. The package is resealable, which is nice if you try to dole out treats and keep your four legged buddy's waistline in line.<br /><br />These definitely got my dogs woof of approval, and were liked as well as homemade "cookies" without all the work.  I really like the heartier size too, as these cookies are substantial enough to encourage chewing by the greediest of dogs.  I like that I can break them in half for my smaller dog, as well as to stretch out the fun with the "big girl" of the two.  While neither of my dogs are "picky" eaters, they really seemed to enjoy these cookies more than most, and we've tried a LOT of kinds, including making our own.

review/summary: My dogs didn't like them
review/text: When I read the ingredients of these treats I thought for sure that my dogs would like these. I have 3 large breed dogs which usually love to eat just about anything. I have Rocky, a black and tan coonhound, Buddy, a blue heeler and a very large pit bull named Hutch. Rocky and Buddy have turned up their noses in disdain to these treats everytime I have offered them. The pit bull Hutch will eat them very grudgingly and even then he'll leave half of the treat on the ground, this is odd because, he'll eat just about anything including tree branches. So, I wouldn't pay the higher price for these treats, my dogs just don't like them.

review/summary: Puppy doesn't know what to do with it.
review/text: I have a 3 month old puppy that is teething right now, so I thought these would be good for him. I thought that, this treats being hard that he would gnaw on them for a while to keep him busy. Nope, he either had no interest in it, or lost interest in it fast. And now, I have these square treats lying around my house.<br /><br />These don't really look like treats, and my puppy really doesn't know what to do with it. He might be too young for these? But, I didn't see an age requirement on the bag. I don't know, these treats remind me of something you would give a hamster, rabbit or gerbil to chew on.<br /><br />I read a lot of review on here saying their dogs just love this and wanted more. My dog acts like I am giving him a rock. He did play with the treat a bit and carried it around the house. But, I don't think he has finished one completely.

review/summary: Great ingredients, hard as a rock.
review/text: I like the ingredients that these biscuits have -- everything's organic -- meat, veggies, and grains.  Each biscuit comes in two squares, so I tried to break the biscuit in half to separate the two squares and found it very difficult.  Those biscuits were hard!  I also smelled the biscuits and didn't notice much flavor/scent at all.<br /><br />I gave one square each to my two dogs.  While my one-year-old dog gobbled it up (as she does with everything, and may have swallowed it whole for all I know), my six-year-old dog was hesitant at first.  He sniffed it a bit and then had a very hard time taking that first bite into the very hard biscuit.  I think he was afraid of breaking his teeth!  (And he chews on very hard toys/bones/rawhide.)  He didn't seem too wild about the taste either, as he wasn't in any rush to finish the square after he broke into it.  They looked and probably tasted like cardboard, so I can see why.<br /><br />I appreciate what Newman's is trying to do for dogs in giving them healthier snack alternatives, but please don't break my dogs' teeth!
