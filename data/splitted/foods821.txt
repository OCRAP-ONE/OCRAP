review/summary: Pretty good, more cracker like than chip
review/text: These are like a cross between a cracker and a tortilla chip.  Its tastes pretty good but has a sort of a little cardboard like texture.  It would work really well as a dip cracker.  For snacking, I prefer the jalape&ntilde;o chips of this brand, they are pretty tasty.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with this chip.  It is thick and flavorful.  Good amount of salt, with a hint of other seasonings.  Not olive flavored really, just tastes like a tortilla chip with a little extra flavor.

review/summary: you can actually taste the olives . .very unique
review/text: I like these chips just a bit better than I liked the multigrain version.  The flavor here is unique in that you can actually taste the green and black olives - I think they hit just the right balance here, as well, not too much, not too little.  Salt level is good - I don't care for overly salty chips so these are good for me.  Very textured and multi-level flavor in that you can taste the individual ingredients.  I think they'd go well with a mild guacamole or a smooth cheese and some fruit; nothing should compete with the flavor of these chips.

review/summary: DELICIOUS
review/text: I love these chips.  Wonderfully pristine and interesting ingredients.  1-ounce bag, which is perfect to take to work as an emergency snack if there's no time for a lunch break, has 140 calories, 3 grams of fiber, zero trans fats, 7 grams of total fat (a little high but the truth is sometimes higher fat content equals more filling) and a nice and low 2 grams of sugar and equally nice and low 80 mg of sodium.  I will save the bags and recycle with http://www.terracycle.net/ with my energy bar wrappers.  I rarely eat chips because of weight considerations.  These are definitely worth the calories.  But they could be addictive so I've gotta watch it.  Bottom line:  absolutely delicious and crunchy.

review/text: I love olives and think the taste was slightly more subtle then I would like, but they are still very good chips.  Light and crispy, but very sturdy and can be used for dipping.  Not salty at all.  Seems like a very healthy snack.  I'm really curious to try other flavors as well of this brand.  This is a quality product you will enjoy.

review/text: I really like the flavor of these chips/crackers. The sesame seed flavor really pops after a few bites and they aren't dry in your mouth like some other multigrain products. They are a tad stale feeling, but I think that's intended and it doesn't mean they're old. With that said, I enjoyed my first bag. If I see these in a local store I will buy them again.

review/summary: great flavor, but not outstanding
review/text: To sum it up . . I liked these chips, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy them.  That's not a bad thing since I would chose them over other chips- they're just not a 'must have'.  Flavor is good, multi-layered in that you can pretty much taste the individual ingredients - the oat bran, the grains.  Salt level is good.  To compare, Tostitos regular tortilla chips can be extremely salty, whereas these are not.  Flavor is also more dimensional than the Tostitos multi-grain chips (but not that far apart); the ingredients are obviously much better.  They do look nice with their textured nuts and such in them, so they would look much better than your average chip if you were hosting a nice party.

review/summary: Definitely not a tortilla substitute
review/text: Does it matter if things are healthy if they don't taste very good?  This multi-grain chips may be packed with goodness, but they taste like a stale wheat thin that was left sitting in a bag of real tortilla chips for awhile and managed to pick up a bit of their flavor.  I think I would actually like these better if they were simple multi-grain crackers without the thin brushing of flavoring.<br /><br />Someone looking for a healthy alternative might be happy with these.  If you are a compulsive snacker, then maybe you could get used to the taste.  But anyone looking to chow down on some tortilla chips isn't going to be too happy, and would have to force themselves through a bag of these rather than eating what they really wanted.<br /><br />Unless you covered them with cheese and made nachos.  Because that makes everything taste better!

review/summary: "Food Should Taste Good..." Really?
review/text: For a company who's name is "Food Should Taste Good," they certainly do a poor job of practicing what they preach. I bought a couple bags of their lime torilla chips, and wasn't the least bit impressed. Granted, I only bought them because they were so cheap, and that was only because they had been marked 75% off (after being mark 50% off, and 25% off before that). Suffice it to say, it seems that I wasn't the first person to discover their horrible taste, otherwise people would have been buying them more regularly, and the Base Exchange wouldn't have been getting so desperate to get rid of them.<br /><br />Even with a gob of Tostitos cheese dip, the taste of these chips is barely tolerable.

review/summary: Not That Different
review/text: Imagine a small "wheat thin" that tastes like a slightly stale tortilla chip and you get an idea of what this product tastes like.  The caloric intake and the fat, cholesterol, sodium, protein and carbohydrate amounts are similar to other snacks of this type.  The ingredients lists flax, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, brown rice, oat fiber, soy, but the taste is that of a lightly salted tortilla chip.  The word, "Multi-Grain" is a good buzz word for health and this does not contain any Trans fat or other harmful ingredients.  However, I can't say that it's much different than most snack foods on the market other than it is not greasy.  It's not bad, just not different enough to spark my interest.

review/summary: Food Should Taste Good ....
review/text: ... and these do!!<br /><br />Wow!  I was really surprised at how good these chips are.  These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there.  The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right.<br /><br />They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips.  Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt.  Not these.  An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium.<br /><br />For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts.  Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack.  Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges?  These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers.  Yum!!<br /><br />I'll definitely be purchasing these from Amazon -- I've never seen them in the stores, and I simply must have more of them!

review/summary: Tastes great ... and gets 2-year-old approval
review/text: These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags. Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips.<br /><br />These chips are technically "multigrain" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt. With only 140 calories per bag and 7 grams of fat it's hard not to say yes to this tasty treat.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these chips!

review/summary: snack food heaven
review/text: These are wonderful!  They're definitely chocolate, but not overpowering.  The sea salt provides a nice foil, so you can eat a whole bag by yourself without going into a chocolate coma (maybe that's bad).  They're just sweet enough to make the chocolate happen.  They're like "hint of oreo" without all the garbage and without all the guilt (unless you eat a whole bag in one sitting).<br />I've had them with a peach salsa, which was nice.  I think they'd go really well with a fresh fruit salad.  They'd go well with ice cream, and they're perfect with a tart, plain yogurt.  I dipped them in hummus too, and while it doesn't not work...I'm not sure it's great.  Still, basically they're versatile and not too bad for you.  When you find yourself at the bottom of the bag you can always say, "well, at least it wasn't a bag of oreos."

(The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)<br /><br />The chips are delicious.  They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip.  The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat.  I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip.  I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out.  I tried the Buffalo flavor this weekend and they have a very mild kick; much milder than I expected.  I still like them, but not as much as the plain.

review/summary: Subtle yet sweet tortilla adventure...
review/text: What impresses me first off about this brand "food should taste good" is the fact it is an all natural brand.  They do not use preservatives, trans fats, they are gluten free, Certified Kosher, no Genetic modification etc.  What is even better about all that is it sacrifices all the unhealthy without sacrificing flavor.<br /><br />** CHOCOLATE TORTILLA ** (6oz bags) [5 stars]<br />These Tortilla chips I just had to try.. I mean chocolate Tortilla chips!?  Rather then getting an explosion of sweet sugary chocolate you get this nice, soft subtle taste of chocolate with each crunch of the chip.  These clearly aren't meant for salsa and in fact the back of the bag suggested  to sprinkle them in vanilla ice-cream or better yet... warm the chips up slightly to bring out the flavor.  Both suggestions worked great.  In fact I prefer these to chocolate chips in my ice cream and they probably are far healthier<br /><br />The chips are rectangular in shape and are delightful to eat.  They make for a perfect snack or to help enhance an existing snack; or satisfy the chocoholic in you<br /><br />Definitely a 5 star product with 5 star quality taste.<br /><br />** JALAPENO TORTILLA ** (1.5oz bags) [5 stars]<br />The Jalapeno tortilla chips are outstanding!  I'm a fan of spicy food so I had to test these out for myself.  The chips do not smell spicy at all which means they are spiced properly (not overloaded).  Upon first bite you might not taste much but that is when this chip gets you.  Very quickly a subtle jalapeno flavor kicks in with a bit of nice spice that isn't to overpowering.<br /><br />With the added kick of the chips these would go perfect with a nice mild salsa.  The chips are crispy and fresh, with that nice subtle spice lingering on your taste-buds for a good few minutes so a small 1.5oz bag will last you some time and allow you to savor the flavor.

review/summary: Good try, but tasted stale
review/text: Looking over the ingredients on the bag, I was pretty impressed.  Whole grains, no processed sugar, etc.  And at 140 calories per bag, not too bad in that respect either.  3 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein isn't too shabby, but with ingredients like quinoa and all the other whole grains, I was a little surprised that it wasn't more.  But maybe I have unreasonable expectations.<br /><br />The only problem was when I stated it.  The chips were hard, and my immediate reaction was that they had gone stale.  They had that 'stale taste' as well, if you know what I mean.  But with the bag just opened that moment, and an expiration date over a year in advance, I'm apt to believe that this is just how they're supposed to be.  The flavor was alright, lightly salty and a little nutty.  But this is probably not the best snack for children, as they will most likely not enjoy the hardness and staleness.

review/summary: FoodDOESTasteGood Multigrain
review/text: These tortilla chips should be renamed to FoodDoesTasteGood!  So many times "healthy" or "good for you" snacks are as flavorless as water.  Good for you, but absolutely boring to the taste buds.  These chips, however break the rules.  No Trans Fat, 0.5% staurated fat. 18g carb, 3g dietary fiber, 2g sugars and 3g protein with only 140 calories per 1 ounce bag w/60 of them from non saturated (good)fats.  Remember, not all fat is bad.  Some fat, like these are needed for digestion and brain function.  The flavor is great.  They are filled with flax seed, whole grains, wheat, but have a crisp, thick feel without grainy flavor.  They have a salty flavor like that of a tortilla, but you don't need a topping or salsa for the flavor.  No itchy lips from to much salt like a regular tortilla and no salsa falling on your clothes!  I eat these just as a quick snack but have served them along with hummus, cheese and veggie sticks for a crowd.  I also toss them into my kids lunch instead of chips or pretzels.  Most of the time they take a couple bags because they share them!  I like the one oz. bags because they tide me over at that 3:00 snack time without letting me indulge with too many.  I've had the Olive and the chocolate, but the multigrain are by far my favorite.  Serve these at your next party, but make sure you have quite a few bags...you will need them.

I have gotten many people hooked on it using it as a substitute for rice.  I got these chips (multigrain and the cheddar flavors) simply because I saw good ol' quinoa in the ingredient list but also tons of other good stuff: Stone Ground Yellow Corn, Non-hydrogenated Canola Oil, Brown Rice Flour, Flax Seeds, Turbinado Cane Sugar, Oat Fiber, Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Quinoa, Soy Flour, Sea Salt, real cheese in the cheddar.<br /><br />But having "good" ingredients doesn't often equate to good taste.<br /><br />It does here.  These are addictive.  I typically buy them at Target or Central Market but it's cheaper to get them here with subscribe and save and no taxLove these...and I actually feel GOOD about putting them in my body. A rarity for a snack.  Bring on the cheddar and I'll sign up for auto delivery.  Try em with hummus.<br /><br />Alternatives: I am also equally addicted to barbecue PoPChips...they are also an all natural snack that's low in fat and calories but highly addictive in my opinion.

review/text: As a big fan of sweet potato fries, I was instantly drawn to these chips when I saw them at the grocery store.  I actually bought a few different varieties of Food Should Taste Good chips because I haven't seen them before and they seemed different than other chips.  I'm trying to eat healthier, but not give up all the things I enjoy eating and chips are one of those things.  This particular chip is a great alternative to the normally greesy fried potato chips and they taste just like sweet potatoes.  Apparently they are a combination of sweet potato and corn, but its still good.  Highly recommended as a snacking alternative to regular chips.

review/summary: Guilt free tortilla-chip snacking pleasure
review/text: Are you the type of person that always needs a side bag of chips to accompany their lunchtime sandwich but then feels pangs of guilt afterward for consuming that extra 120-200 trans-fat laden empty calories? If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Multigrain' line of tortilla chips (think of a corn tortilla chip that's tasty yet packed with such whole grain goodness like flax, sunflower and sesame seeds as well as oat fiber, brown rice, quinoa and soy - yes please!) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite. These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself. These chips are tasty enough with the right crisp texture you've come to know and expect from your standard snack tortilla morsel. Great product all around.

review/text: These all-natural multigrain tortilla chips/crackers are very tasty.  Just like the restaurant tortilla chips you nibble on while waiting for your meal, these are slightly salty, crispy, and chewy, and I wanted to keep eating them even when the bag was all gone.<br /><br />The chips are high in fiber and there are only 140 calories per bag, making it a perfect snack.  Delicious!

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised--unsalty Frito meets Sasame cracker!
review/text: I have order anxiety:  so when I go to order something I usually panic and blurt out something I didn't really want, or in this case, click the ORDER THESE button on these Multigrain things.<br /><br />Fast forward to today... I studied the bag with this description:<br />TORTILLA CHIPS (it's a cracker, too!) MADE WITH<br />Flax, Sunflower, and Sesame Seeds<br />Oat Fiber, Brown Rice<br />Quinoa, Soy<br /><br />We have pavers that look like the cracker on the front of the bag... and I have no idea what quinoa is, but I tried one.  Hmmm kind of like a not so salty corn chip, with a little sesame seed flavor thrown in.  Just enough salt.  Crunchy, and without the stab-the-roof-of-your mouth shards.  Nice mingling of flavors...can't say I know what flax seed tastes like, but I think I like it now!  I like them.  I really like them!!<br /><br />The ingredients list is:  Stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt. Not a bad ingredients list!  For one 1 oz bag, 140 calories, 60 from fat.  And each cracker feels like you are eating something, not like a bite of air in a salt-laden wafer.<br /><br />I could seriously go for more of these now.  They would be fantastic with a slice of mild cheddar or something really different with a creamy artichoke dip.  Lots of possiblities, and still good right out of the bag.  They say they are available at your local supermarket or grocer--really, I am going to get more of these, they are that good!

review/summary: Tastes the way it looks.
review/text: The actual product is exactly what it is described as - a hybrid of a chip and a cracker.  Some pieces tasted more like a cracker and others more like a tortilla chip - either way it was pretty good but I think the saltier pieces were better tasting.  It took a few pieces to get used to the taste and texture since it's really not quite like any other snack I've had.  The pieces are very thin and light like a tortilla chip, but they're also textured and grainy like a cracker.<br /><br />After the first 4 or 5 chips I decided I did like the taste and texture and easily munched down the rest of the bag.  The bag is a small 1 oz of 140 calories and seems to have as many chips as one of those 100-Calorie packs.  This would be a refined alternative to Baked Lays.

They have an artisan quality in that they are the exact opposite of processed chips that all taste the same. I munched my sample bag down in mere seconds and decided to buy the full size package from Amazon. They get 4 stars instead of 5 to reflect the high cost per ounce.

review/summary: Average Chip, Good Ingredients.
review/text: Not too bad. It is similar to the stone ground or multigrain chips out there. The smaller size should not fool you because it's still sold by weight. I liked them more for snacking because of this. The smaller size is not as hot for dip or salsa holding. Not too salty, for sure. Had a fairly low sodium content for a chip even.<br /><br />Earthy with a touch of salt is perhaps the best way to describe it.<br /><br />The ingredients are what make this. Simple, nothing crazy or 8 syllables. It is not like eating cardboard or styrofoam, just good stuff. If you've ever made corn chips with rough meal from scratch, this has a similarity in texture and quality.<br /><br />Lastly it arrived nicely packaged from Amazon. I did not have a bag of crumbs but intact chips. Something that is always a plus with products like this.

review/summary: Delicious.....You'll like this so much you'll want the BIG bag
review/text: Well, the manufactures of the Multigrain, FoodShouldTasteGood, tortilla chip has succeeded in their claim.....this chip does taste good.  The one ounce bags are perfect for on the go and the "mini" version allows the consumer to pop the entire chip in the mouth with no mess.  The packaging looks (dare I say it) more sophisticated and "adult like" so you won't feel embarrassed to tote one around in your brief case (no orange tigers lurking around with artificial colors or flavors).  This blend between a chip and cracker taste quite good all in its own right but it is also great with dips and cheese.  I really enjoyed it and hoped the kids would hate it so that I'd have more for myself.....sadly, not the case.  This multigrain chip was a hit.

review/text: I had just taken a Freshly made Spinach, Feta, Olive Tomato Quiche out of the oven when these Olive tortilla chips arrived!<br />Talk about perfect timing....anyways we broke open a bag & I served the quiche with a choice of these & buttered toast crisps...........they ate all the chips & asked for MORE!<br /><br />As I was serving 2 slightly different variations in the quiches, 1 with parmesan & less spinach & one with more spinach & different tomatoes, I asked which did they like the best........they all said the CHIPS!!! I should have just served the Olive Tortilla Chips & saved myself all the work! LOL<br /><br />These REALLY are that good! I have never tasted any that come close & Tortilla chips are a staple in our house, as we have them with salsa over cottage cheese, I make an awesome beans, rice, salsa, cheese, & sour cream dish we serve with tortilla chips etc....<br /><br />As there are only 140 calories per 1 oz bag: 7g fat, 18g carbs & 2g protein,  a bag of these with a cup of low fat cottage cheese & salsa is a low carb (ZONE type) meal or snack (depending on your appetite!!<br /><br />The flavor of the olives is WONDERFUL, with just a hint of garlic.......they are a fabulous combination, I will definitely be buying more, & for the record, the children who had these were all boys, ages 10,12 & 15. They wanted more immediately, but they will have to wait for an Amazon order as you cannot buy these locally here where I live..............:-(

review/summary: Delicious and healthy tortilla chips
review/text: I have been on a quest for a number of years now to eat foods that provide good nourishment to my body without sacrificing taste and satisfaction.  I immediately loved these chips when I tried them -- sometimes "healthy" foods have to grow on you, but not so with these chips.  They come in a nice little pentagon shape, and there are about 16 chips in the bag, which is just right for a snack or to combine with a sandwich for lunch.  If you are watching your calories and fat, it is great that they list the nutritional information for the whole bag and not for 1/2 bag like some companies do.  All the ingredients in these chips are ones that you see on those lists of "healthy foods you should be eating."  All the flavors meld together to make a really nice, rich flavor that is ever-so-slightly sweet, and you get a light taste of flax and sesame seeds.<br /><br />I compared the label with Doritos Toasted Corn Tortilla Chips, and these Multigrain Chips have 3 times the fiber, 2/3 the sodium, 1/2 the saturated fat, and of course the much healthier ingredients, with no trans fats.<br /><br />These are the best chips of the many I have tried that use healthy ingredients, and I'll be definitely ordering more of them.

They're sweet but extremely low in sugar--about 2g. You get 20% of your vitamin A in one serving which isn't bad for a snack.  I bought these for my son for the holidays--he loves sweet potatoes. He enjoyed these. These are much healthier than potato chips and are just as tasty if you like sweet potatoes.

review/text: I saw these on display at my supermarket and tried them on a whim.  Boy am I glad I did!  They are spicy and flavorful.  I would describe them as a medium hot; the heat kicks in after you've eaten a few, but it's not too hot.  They are so excellent with just plain sour cream -- it's hard to stop!  They are also sturdy enough and big enough to use as a cracker if you want to top them with cheese slices or relishes.<br /><br />Buying a case on Amazon saved me $1.00 per bag compared to the grocery store.  And, thank you Amazon for placing the case inside of another box before shipping.  They arrived in perfect condition -- no crumbs!  I think I'll go have some more...

review/summary: Real chocolate and sweet/salty addictiveness
review/text: How could a chip get better than the Food Should Taste Good chips? I love the distinct, natural flavor that's built into the chip, balanced with the perfect amount of sea salt sprinkled on the outside.<br />These are whole-grain, high-quality, no-junk, full-o'-flavor...and the bag looks stylish, besides.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Easy to eat the whole bag - but you actually feel OK even if you do (woops). (I had no sugar rush, only a very slight chocolate rush, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.)<br /><br />Seal of approval from Lovejoy Fitness -- http://lovejoyfitness.com.

review/summary: Delicious!  If you like olives and like corn chips, you must try them!
review/text: AMAZING chips.  I picked them up at Whole Paycheck, and as soon as I'd had a few, I ran to Amazon to see if I could buy them by the carton!<br /><br />I believe I have never tasted a better chip of any sort.<br /><br />They're lighter and crisper than the usual kinds of tortilla chips that come in brown paper bags, and they have the taste of olive oil, black pepper, salt and olives.<br /><br />I ate them right out of the bag, but I could see them working well with some kinds of pate or hummus, too.<br /><br />The main down side:  one 6oz bag contains 840 calories, and they're quite addicting.

review/summary: YUM, Chips...!
review/text: Not optimistic about the taste of healthy chips I was expecting these to taste roughly like chewing a cardboard box. Boy was I surprised and delighted! These chips taste like a cross between a salty Frito and Sun Chips. With no trans fat, no cholesterol, no crazy preservatives to make them look good after months on the shelf. And even though they taste so yummily salty there's only 80 mg of sodium. Compare that to your average chip! I'd definitly eat these again.

review/summary: Tasty Snack
review/text: I am munching on these chips as I type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. I like the way they taste. The flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. There's a nice nutty aftertaste. I like texture, too. Just the right amount of crunch.  These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.<br /><br />One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.<br /><br />My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well.

review/summary: Interesting chip, but maybe not the best for salsa
review/text: These tortilla chips have an "all-natural" feel to them, and a somewhat unique taste, which is both good and bad.<br /><br />First off, I'll just comment on the packaging.  The singular bag is made of a relatively thick foil-like material and is air puffed tightly.  The result is freshly crisp, unbroken chips in the bag.  A nice bonus and much better than standard lunch-sized chip bags you find from most common companies.<br /><br />As for the taste of the chips, they're pretty good.  I liked the olive and garlic flavor when I was eating them by themselves.  However, when I paired them with some salsa, the olive taste didn't match up that well.  They might go better with a french onion chip dip instead (though I didn't try that).<br /><br />So if you want fresh, never-broken tortilla chips to eat just by themselves with no dip, these do rather well.  If you're looking for a chip to go with your bowl of salsa, you may want go elsewhere.

review/text: While these chips taste good, there was no olive flavor in them whatsoever. You can even see the real olives in each piece, but the added olive did not add anything to the flavor. All I could taste were plain tortilla chips that didn't taste much different than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011VYFWQ">Tostitos</a>. I just think if it's olive flavored, it should taste like olives.

review/summary: Very nice chip, even better ingredients.
review/text: A good chip, though some folks might be put off. The olive flavor comes from real olives put into the mix. So this means some chips are -Olive- flavor, and some are just a hint of olive flavor.<br /><br />Personally, this was a sizable plus. Not a every tidbit crunched is the same kind of flavor chip.  If you need something more standardized in the way of flavor you're going to want to look elsewhere.  I liked these better than the multigrain to be sure. Still only 4-stars because it didn't -wow- me the way I want a 5-star product to reflect in my reviews. The smaller chip size should not fool you because it's still sold by weight.<br /><br />It arrived nicely packaged from Amazon,  I did not have a bag of crumbs but intact chips. Something of a plus with products like this.<br /><br />To sum up. Wonderful flavor overall, but don't expect every chip to taste the same.

review/summary: multigrain taste and not too salty; too bad they are fried and not baked
review/text: While I enjoyed eating these chips, I doubt I would order them again.  The positives are that they are not too salty and they have a good, multigrain taste.  (I suppose this latter quality might be a minus for some who don't like the taste of whole grains.)  The negatives are that a fairly small serving size (one ounce) has 7 grams of fat because these chips are fried, not baked.  So while these are made using whole grains that aren't genetically modified, I'd hesitate to call them a healthful snack because of the high fat content.

review/text: I absolutely loved this snack!  If you like olives, you will too.  The taste of olives is just right, not to strong and not too subtle.  The reason I don't just like this snack, but love it, is because I'm a label reader and don't buy products with lots of ingredients that I can't pronounce.  These cracker/chips have no trans fat and only a handful of ingredients that you'd have in your kitchen.  My kids tried them, they weren't too excited about them-but I'd buy these just for my husband and me-they are just yummy!

But maybe the thickness of the packaging and the tight seal at the top is to keep in the freshness better.<br /><br />The price point isn't bad, although I can get chips cheaper in larger bags at local grocery stores.<br /><br />Overall, a very good snack product in a very convenient size.<br /><br />Ingredients: Stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flower, flax seeds, turbinado can sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.<br /><br />One serving: 1 oz.

THe multi-grain is great, and I also like the blue corn. This weekend I just tried a couple of new flavors I found in a store, Sweet Potato BBQ and Sweet Potato with salt and pepper. Oh my gosh good. My husband likes the Jalapeno kind. I generally don't care for spicy things and was hesitant to try that flavor, but it wasn't bad spicy, and just had an all around great flavor like all the others. Add in the fact that they are gluten free, all natural, AND non-GMO.....goodness, if they were only organic I think I'd pass out!

Even when I add extra milk, it quickly thickens up again.<br /><br />BUT, with enough extra milk and cooked before the batter can re-thicken, these really taste as good as regular mixes, better than Whole Foods' "365" mix (where egg is optional but you really miss it if it's not there), and 'way better than the recipes we've tried with egg substitutes. This is a blessing for my son who loves pancakes but is allergic to eggs, and for the rest of us who aren't allergic but just love pancakes on a Saturday morning.

I recommend these pancakes to everyone - even if you don't have food allergies!

review/summary: Pancake Mix Review
review/text: Best pancake mix I have tried. (I have tried them ALL....) My daughter is allergic to dairy and eggs. This was by far the best mix I have purchased. I bought it in bulk a month ago and I am sending in another order this week. My oldest daughter grew-up on "regular" pancake mix doesn't even know the difference!! THANK YOU CHERRYBROOK KITCHEN!!

review/summary: A Great Find!!
review/text: My son is 7 years old and has many food allergies, one of which is eggs.  This mix has been the easiest to make and the best tasting yet.  There was one super market near my home that I used to buy it in, but they don't carry it anymore.  They told me it was discontinued???  My son and I were so upset.  When I went on line looking for it, I found it at amazon.com.  These pancakes taste great and my son loves them.  Worth every penny!  I hope they are not going to be discontinued!!<br /><br />All the other products by Cherrybrook Kitchen are just as good i.e. cake mix, cookie mix etc..  If you or someone you know has food allergies, don't think twice on trying this.

review/summary: The best pancake mix ever
review/text: This was better than other pancake mixes which call for dairy ingredients.  Our family loved it!  It made nice and fluffy pancakes.  The taste was superb you would never guess it was a "special" mix.  I did use silk brand soy milk (plain in red carton) and not rice milk.  But I drink rice milk, so I don't see if it would make too big a difference to use rice milk instead of soy for those being allergic to soy.  I would imagine pancakes might not be as fluffy, but certainly would have same taste.

review/summary: Super Tasty!
review/text: My son has peanut allergy.  I have always made my own pancake mix for the last 4 years.  But my sister in law has egg allergy so I got a box of this to try.  WOW!  Smells great out of the box, yummy while cooking and tastes awesome!  My kids ate so much there was not enough left for me!  I will buy this again for sure.  Amazon has an amazing price.  My local market wanted $7.99 per box!  It is great to know the product is totally safe for my son to eat as well.  Our house will have this in stock all the time.  Thank you Cherrybrook!

review/summary: Nutritious, Delicious and Easy
review/text: This is a wonderful whole grain mix without a bunch of refined ingredients or preservatives.  Our son is allergic to egg and dairy and these come out great without either; they raise well and are tasty.  We just add soy milk and canola oil and that's it!  They are hearty and we thin them down with just a little extra soy milk.  We tried making vegan pancakes from scratch and they were ok but these are much better.  The most normal pancake we had made that we could make without egg or dairy was from Bisquick, but I always felt guilty serving those pancakes because the ingredients are processed and refined.  These are tastier and healthier and just as convenient.  I love all the Cherrybrook Kitchen products I have tried so far and am grateful they are available.

review/summary: Delicious and safe!
review/text: This is a fantastic find for our dairy- and soy-allergic child.  We make it with rice milk and it comes out just fine like regular pancakes, even though cooking other things with rice milk can sometimes be challenging.<br /><br />This tastes a little bit like vanilla and our toddler loves them!  Finally, she can eat the same (sort of) thing my husband & I eat on weekends.

review/text: The kids didn't like it - nor did Mom and Dad.  But we have very much liked other products by Cherrybrook Farm, so it was a bit of a surprise and disappointment.

review/summary: Best pancake mix we've ever tasted (allergic or not!)
review/text: Our family loves these - including our very picky, egg-allergic 3 yr old son. We take a box of these & some rice milk every time we travel. BYOB (bring your own breakfast!) Everyone who has tasted them loves them! ...and they usually ask what mix we used b/c they want to start buying it! We've been ordering this subscribe and save for almost 2 years I think. Countless boxes later, we've perfected just the right amount of rice milk, oil, mix. My FAVORITE "pancake pan" for them is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MYI2Z4">T-Fal Specialty 13-Inch Nonstick Giant Round Pancake Griddle</a> and I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ND1YTU">OXO Good Grips Silicone Flexible Turner</a>  Sounds silly but I really think they make THE perfect pancake!!

review/summary: Great mix to keep in the pantry!
review/text: My son has multiple allergies (dairy, egg, nuts, sesame, etc) and the CK mixes really make things easier for us! Even though I also have other go-to recipes, we always have the pancake, cake, and cookie mixes in the pantry just in case. All the mixes have easy to follow directions so the kids can help too.<br /><br />I think the pancake mix tastes great, and while everyone is a little picky with how fluffy or crispy they like their pancakes, you can easily adjust the liquid without compromising the flavor. We've added vegan chocolate chips before as well.

review/summary: The Best Darn Pancakes in a Box!!!
review/text: There nothing that can be said about Cherrybrook Kitchen pancake and Waffle Mix - other than Flawless!!!.  They're better than IHOP's - and there's no milk or eggs necessary. 100% VEGAN! If you  follow the directions exactly on the box you'll get perfect pancakes every time.  I like to add a teaspoon or two of apple juice to mine - that seems to insure that they're golden brown every time.  BTW, I have not been paid for this review - i just love this mix.  they stopped carrying it at my local grocery store and whole foods (god bless em) was just too expensive, so I came to Amazon and got the best deal ever...Now buy it and enjoy - because i said so!!!
