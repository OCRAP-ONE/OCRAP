I called the distributor who received my payment and they said that I would have to take it up with the candy manufacturer.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned the product was terrible and the service lousy to say the least

review/summary: Yummy, a family favorite
review/text: A very hard and sweet almond bread/cookie, dipped in delicious dark chocolate and individually packaged. My family always has them with tea after supper. Dipping them in hot chocolate, tea, or coffee melts the chocolate just so, and softens the cookie up nicely. It's become comfort food for me. We buy them in bulk at our local BJ's store, and they are just as good as the ones from our local bakery.

review/summary: Biscuits With Tasty Dark Chocolate. Rather Good.
review/text: I picked up a package of Nonni's Biscotti Cioccolati in an individually-wrapped 8-pack box for my wife. She loves stuff like this. Alas, she's been on a diet and refuses to eat any. One wouldn't hurt her but she's afraid of finishing off the box. They're rather good, I might indicate. They're individually hard bread (topped with nuts) slices and are bottomed with a veneer of tasty dark chocolate. A serving (one biscuit) amounts to 110 calories, so I can understand her worries. Well, what are you gonna do? You can't just throw away stuff this good. I ate them. It was a tough job, but somebody had to do it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: INTENSE Flavor
review/text: These are so GOOD! that i wanted to write a review. Ya chips are something that we shouldn't talk about, let alone review...But Normally when I like something... they usually discontinue the product. So I sure hope "these chips stay around". I'm a big fan of BBQ chips, mainly sweet BBQ. The flavor of these are perfect, and are not too salty, actually less salt than regular ruffles. Sweet, intense kick with sweet BBQ flavor. I've been eating my favorite chip... Better Made sweet BBQ (south eastern michigan chips) for years, and love them... they are almost like a candy, Sweet but kind of too salty. These are my new favorite, taste so sweet with a kick and HUGE Thick ridges, and FLAVOR! When you open the bag it looks like every chip is colored with goodness, no one side half flavored chips here. Anyway if you like sweet bbq rather than smoked out Mesquite flavor... then you will love these.

Your mileage may vary, but I find Braga's to be the most accessible pistachios I've encountered in recent memory.

review/text: I purchased Virgin Coco De Manila brand coconut oil and I noticed a marked aftertaste in the product.. and I do not like it at all (after using another brand). We use the coconut oil in everything cooking, baking and eating right out of the jar and on the body in rubs and massages. I bought two gallon tubs at a good price but the aftertaste spoils some dishes. I will not purchase it again. My advice try a small container and make sure you like the taste before you buy the big one.. Live and learn. If I can keep you from making the same mistake.

review/summary: RC Special 33 ... IT WORKS!
review/text: I've had my female Ragdoll cat for six months and every day was a battle with loose and SMELLY stool. I tried every food known to man, all of them high quality and typically grain-free (even raw). Last weekend was really bad and I remembered a sample (12 oz no less) of cat food that I had received at the TICA cat show - Royal Canin Special 33 for sensitive cats with digestive issues. I really didn't want to use this food because the second ingredient is corn gluten meal, but I had a messy litter box that smelled worse than ever (please keep in mind that I scoop at least twice a day). Well, IT WORKED! We have not had one episode of loose and/or smelly stool since and it's been one week.  Thank you, Royal Canin, you will always be number one in my book, and thank you for being at the TICA International Cat Show in Philadelphia.

review/text: Better than the pintos, and that's saying a lot because the pintos are awesome.  We picked up a box of these black beans on sale for the same price as the pintos and wish we had ordered more.  If you have never used these beans, they are very, very easy, convenient and delicious.  If you have never used them before, simply boil water, add to the desired consistency and by the time you can chop a tomato, pepper and onion, you have a burrito. Simple dinner in a pinch.  We have been stocking these beans for about three years now and are not about to stop.  Another product that is a must have is the Villaware Electric Tortilla press.

review/summary: Perfect for Enjoy Trader Vic inspired cocktails at home
review/text: We hadn't tried the Mai Tai mix in several years so we were pleased to find that quality of beverage produced is exactly as we remember it -- just be sure to use fresh, not bottled, lime juice for best results and Barbancourt rum if you can find it.<br />We don't care for the plastic bottle, which is why we didn't rate this product 5-stars. Would much prefer glass, but this is an excellent product to keep handy among your entertaining supplies for the holidays. A Trader Vic's Mai Tai provides a quick and refreshing trip to the tropics without the expense!

review/text: To my taste buds, Trader Vic's is the one and only premade mix to buy. As a kid my dad used to make me a "virgin" Mai Tai with this mix and when I became of legal drinking age adding the rum posed a welcomed addition. I've tried other brands but they are swill. Of course nothing beats a freshly made one in Hawaii (like at Roy's) but Trader Vic's is a close second, especially uplifting on the cold and rainy days here in the Pacific Northwest.

review/text: After reading up on making mai tai's and hearing about this product, I was excited that amazon.com sold it because we wanted to have mai tai's at my sister's bachelorette party, but I didn't want to handmake them.  I'm a wine/Guinness drinker, so I guess I need to have a real, handmade mai tai to compare it to, but, to me, it was bland and didn't have any flavor, only tasted like spiked, watered-down, lime juice.  Directions were followed and I didn't buy cheap rum.  Although the party goers didn't complain, I still have 1 unopened bottle that I don't have anything to do with and we even had 5-7 people drinking these!!

review/text: This mix is the best I've ever had.  It brings me back to the days when Trader Vics was located at the Plaza in New York.  It's very important that you use a good dark Rum as indicated in the directions on the bottle. I use a lime concentrate.  A few drops work great. Shake in a cocktail shaker with plenty of ice. Pour ice and drink into a tumbler. Garnish with an orange slice and a maraschino cherry.

review/summary: The only Mai Tai mix to buy
review/text: Since getting to Trader Vic's might prove to be impossible sometimes, and sometimes in snowy weather, you need to have a tropical drink to take your mind off the snow, the Mai Tai Mix is a great godsend. It's the best out of the Mai Tai mixes out there, but doesn't compare to a fresh one. However, in an effort to thoroughly review the mix, I tried it with rum, bourbon and white wine (at different times) and it made for a smooth, sweet, tropical drink. It's great to take your mind off your troubles or bad weather. I highly recommend picking up the mix, even if it's to make virgin drinks for the kids. The only downside is that you'll find yourself reordering this. Don't forget the lime!

review/text: My year-old Havanese puppy loves these treats. He only weighs 6 pounds and they are the perfect size for even the smallest dog. They make great treats for training, too. I started out buying them for training, but he likes them so much that I always have them on hand. They are a little bit more expensive than other treats, but a 1-pound bag lasts a long time and they are made from real lamb so are healthier for him. So if you're looking for a healthy chewy treat for training or anytime I highly recommend Solid Gold Tiny Tots treats.

review/text: These are one of my dog's favorites.  I think they smell delicious, kind of smoky and meaty.  I prefer the variety that's just called lamb jerky; it has the same ingredients as these, but the treats are square.  They're easier to break into pieces for training.  These treats are bone shaped and the cutout process seems to leave more treat dust in the bag.  Still delicious though, and high quality with natural ingredients.  Other than cubes of roll-style dog food, this is the treat I use the most with my dog.

review/summary: Hibiscus-y and Raspberry-esque!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: This would fool anyone who didn't know it was gluten free!
review/text: We all loved this mix!  I had never made this before so I decided to give it a try and use the banana recipe on the box.  I substituted oil to make it casein free also and it turned out fabulous - I will be making this a stable in my household!  Thank you!!!

review/summary: Truly gluten, egg, and almost corn free...and super yummy!
review/text: Update to my original review:  I found out their xanthan gum is grown on corn, although they state that processing removes all of the corn from the xanthan gum.  We found this out the hard way...my son had a reaction after eating this product 3 times.  He is VERY sensitive to corn so other corn allergics may tolerate it without issue.  Original review revised: This is the best gluten/wheat/egg and almost corn free muffin mix I have found (it's free of a lot of other things but these are the allergies we have to worry with).  I use ground flaxseed in place of the eggs and follow the directions on the box to make banana muffins and they turn out perfect every time.  Don't skimp if you're out of unsalted butter, go get the exact ingredients or they won't rise as nicely...trust me, it's worth the trip.  Everything I've tried from 123 Gluten Free has been 5 star.  They maintain excellent allergen standards and taste better than anything else I've tried.  Follow the baking directions to a T and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: There's cinnamon in the mix!
review/text: ...That was my first thought as I opened the package.  Since this wasn't marketed as a SPICE muffin/quickbread mix and none of the other reviewers mentioned it, this was a surprise. I checked the box and sure enough, cinnamon is in the mix.  Well, in my case, that is just fine.  I actually have been adding a little cinnamon to my other gluten-free-muffin-mix of choice from time to time: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVE3YE">The Gluten-Free Pantry Muffin & Scone Mix, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  However, this additional ingrediant might not work well for everyone.  One of the benefits of the other mix is how versatile and accommodating it is to variations.<br /><br />Preparing these muffins can't be easier.  Instructions are very clear and simple, and unlike the other mix (link above), the temperature and cooking times are spot on (I pulled mine out of the oven about 30 seconds early).<br /><br />The box says the mix makes "15 large muffins".  I have three 6-cup standard-sized muffin pans (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET5ZII">Fox Run Stainless Steel Muffin Pan</a>), total 18 muffin cups, and IMO the mix filled these three pans, all 18 cups, perfectly.  Any more batter and the cups would have been overflowing.<br /><br />The end result was good tasting, light, and fluffy muffins. I always use muffin papers and the paper does not seem to stick to the muffin as those made by the other mix.<br /><br />Unlike the other gluten-free mix, these had no problem browning -- in fact, they are perhaps a little too brown, even considering the cinnamon.  The other muffin mix is very blond and looks identical to regular muffins that are not gluten-free.  In fact, some reviewers of that mix reported having problems getting those muffins to brown.  This mix here however is inherently brown, inside and out, even before baking.  Even so, the muffins are not dry.  They are perfectly moist and fluffy and I do like the spice taste.  However, the spice is very evident.  I had made the blueberry variation, and the spice was so overpowering I could barely tell I was eating blueberry muffins.  I will probably not use this mix with blueberries again (I did so this time because I didn't realize this mix had any spices until I started). I think the other mix is better with blueberries, however I do like these muffins and I suspect the mix will work very well with bananas.<br /><br />Bottom line, this mix is not a substitute in my kitchen for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVE3YE">The Gluten-Free Pantry Muffin & Scone Mix, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>; rather, it is a new addition!  Both mixes are good and which one I buy next will probably be determined by price, to be honest.

review/summary: Great Product and Convenient As Well
review/text: These four-packs of vegetable broth are a great product to use for making soups or to add extra flavor when making polenta, risotto, long-grain rice or quinoa. Each box contains 8 ounces of broth (one cup), so each four-pack contains the same total amount as one 32-ounce box of broth. Normally, these four-packs are more expensive than one 32-ounce box in supermarkets, but Amazon.com has a pretty good price on them -- $3.11 per four-pack (per quart). They are very convenient to use as well, because you never have to freeze or store unused broth in the fridge, as is often the case with 32-ounce broth boxes. Since each box has one cup of broth, you don't need to measure, and you only use as much as you need.

review/summary: Good for what ails you
review/text: Pacific Natural Foods' Organic Vegetable Broth is a savory contrast to the usual drab veggie broths available on the market today. It stands on its own, so it's perfect if you're having to stick with clear liquids. Since it's great on its own, it's also good as a base for recipes. Its spices aren't too intrusive; they accentuate whatever is put in the broth. As an Organic Vegetable Broth from Oregon, it's a savory harvest!

review/summary: not too great as a drink out of the box...
review/text: We, too, are using more and more veggie broth and bouillon these days, so, when several reviewers commented it was nice to have the 8-oz size to drink right out of the box, we thought, hey, portion-control, great idea!  Not really so great, as it turns out.  We probably WILL use the remainder as reviewers also suggested to flavor rices, couscous etc. where you don't need a whole quart and the smaller size is convenient.  But the taste, on its own, just isn't too pleasant.  My husband and I tried them  separately on the same day.  I was surprised how awful mine tasted but resolved not to say anything in case he liked his.  When he got home, I asked how was the wonderful new broth, and he said "AWFUL!".  So that was that.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you are looking for two absolutely great-tasting vegetable broths (both of which my husband will drink up all by himself, right from the box, all 32-oz.!), try these:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029TJRE0">Wolfgang Puck All Natural Vegetable Cooking Stock, 32-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> -- fabulous for drinking and cooking -- use in place of beef or chicken broth, too (and just available again on subscribe-and-save).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTE08G">Pacific Natural Foods Mushroom, 32-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> -- extraordinary -- the broth par excellence for mushroom soup, but great for absolutely anything -- world class (though currently out of stock -- should be available again soon).<br /><br />Hope this helps.  So sorry to have to give a poor report about the 8-oz. organic vegetable product from Pacific Natural Foods, which makes the other product we love so much...  :(

review/text: I am surprised (NOT) that they will not list the ingredients of the spices on any of their products. Even after emailing their cust support folks, Pacific is not going to tell you what is in them, which makes me wonder if MSG in its myriads of forms sometimes called yeast extract, torula yeast or citric acid is part of their soups as a preservative. Why hide your ingredients Pacific?

review/summary: Gluten Free, Tasty and Good Size
review/text: We use a lot of broths in our 2 person family - no more huge boxes in the fridge wasting space.  These are a perfect size for 2 small servings of chicken soup or to make a sauce for just about anything.  Hubby finds the salt content low but I find it just fine so he gets to use a shaker on occasion.  I do add a splash of sherry or cognac, depending on what I am making, to add depth of flavor.  Also, for a sauce a 50% reduction is needed. I do admit that the final star is due to the fact that it is gluten free.  Finding quality gluten free products can be hard and this is one I have added to my glutenfreechefstore.

review/text: I stock up on these broths via subscribe and save and they're a huge convenience to have in my pantry.  It's so much easier to throw together a soup, make a casserole, or reduce a sauce with one or two of these pouches on hand.  I find myself cooking a healthy meal when I otherwise might've just run out and picked something up, because it's so much easier to put together something delicious fast!  I generally only buy or open larger cartons of broth if I'm cooking in large quantity or plan to use the remainder within a couple days.  Having these smaller cartons mean more impromptu or smaller soups and stews.

review/text: For the price you can get a much better tasting veggie broth/powder: Seitenbacher Vegetable Broth + Rapunzel Pure Organic Veggie Broth (higher salt content than  Seitenbacher but you need smaller amounts to acheive similar effect. So, it all balances out at the end?). Also, if you're cooking anything with mushrooms & you want to keep the mushroom theme, use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2B8">Savory Choice Liquid Reduced Sodium Vegetable Broth Concentrate, 4.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />I cooked with Pacific and size of pks are not convenient at all. It all depends on the portions you're cooking; which makes powder option (the above recommended ones) much more convenient.

review/text: I support this company, and this product is good. The little boxes are useful at exactly 8 oz... But it's a lot of garbage in the long run, when you could just make your own stock once every couple of months (look up recipe online) and freeze it in ice cube trays then toss them in a freezer bag and pull out what you need. I make super strong broth and just add cubes to plain water or mixed with a little Marigold Swiss Vegetable Bouillon. They're better than the big containers because I don't make soup or use stock *too* often and the big boxes would get opened and go bad before I could use the rest, so this was convenient in that sense, but after the first purchase I thought what the hell am I doing? and started making my own broth.

review/summary: Not for the face.
review/text: I wanted to try this instead of my regular face cleaner. Having a moisturizing bar of soap instead of a gel I pumped from a bottle sounded neater, cheaper, like less clutter in the shower, all around more appealing. Even better if it were an inexpensive, cleansing, moisturizing soap.<br />I thought an olive oil based soap was the way to go and I do feel cleansed after using it. However, I don't know about other people, but it is definitely not for my face.<br />I have normal skin, not already dry or anything, and after washing my face with this, it felt clean, but tight and stripped of all moisture. I looked in my mirror and smiled just to flex my face and saw my skin stretch and wrinkle in areas I'd never even had wrinkles before. I had to moisturize for quite a while to get rid of that look and feeling.<br />Not exactly what you want for your face if you're trying to keep wrinkles at bay and a soft youthful glow. This is not a soap you want to use if it's moisture you're seeking.<br /><br />I will keep using it as a body wash just because I have it and why not, but once it's gone, I won't be buying more.

review/summary: Horrible smell, even worse feeling
review/text: I purchased this soap because my skin is very dry and sensitive. So much so that my face and neck get blotches. This soap dries the skin even more. Your skin will feel tight and uncomfortable, and you'll need to use a lot of moisturizing lotion afterwards to make up for it. The only thing that works on my skin is Bag Balm. I highly recommend it. It may be sticky and smell strange, but it smells better than the olive oil stuff and it ALWAYS works. Go Bag Balm!

review/summary: Becoming difficult to find!
review/text: This blend of spices and extracts has suprisingly amount of flavor depth unlike many of other popular steak seasonings. Yet it's subtle enough that it enhances instead of overwhelming and covers up the meat's natural flavor. You will definitly tast the inviting aroma of the spices in your first chew, but immidiatly afterward the flavor of the meat sips out and takes over. This has absolutly become my favorite seasoning for steaks and meat in general. It even kinda works nicely on fish!<br /><br />The bad news is that for some reason, this paticular McCormick seasoning grinder has been disappearing from the shelfs of popular grocery chains all over. Yet when I went to McCormick's website it doesn't appear that they've stopped making these. So it's quite a mystery why it has gotten so hard to find these days. Currently the only somewhat reliable way to obtain these is through the internet and buy them in small packs of 6. And chance are, once you've gotten a tast of this, you WILL start buying them in packs!

review/summary: Not as pictured
review/text: I got this as a gift... and the products in the basket look nothing like what is in the picture. All the bath products and the basket I received were cheapo versions of what is in the actual picture. The labels are all cleverly printed with home-made "Art of Appreciation" logos, but once you read the original product labels on the back and you see that it says ingredients for "LOITOIN" instead of lotion, it makes you wonder where they got these from and if I should even be putting it on my body... And the body scrub and "loitoin" are the exact same pastel green goop but just in different bottles. I mean, if you're charging people $50 a basket, maybe you could afford to supply your materials from somewhere other than the dollar store... and the towel is not green. I guess since people who buy these things don't actually get them for themselves, its ok to rip them off and send knock-offs to their friends. I was so happy when I got this in the mail, until I found out how much you overcharged my lover for this basket of .99 cent bath "loitoin." I wish I could include a picture for others to see.

review/summary: Mio Makes Water Taste Delicious!
review/text: I love Mio and this was one of the very first flavors that I tried. I can no longer have sugar due to health issues and Mio makes it a lot easier for me to drink water. The container the Mio is in is leak-proof, so it is very portable and easy to take with you anywhere. You can also mix it in ANY amount of liquid and in any container. I have always hated that you have to have a plastic bottle to mix drink packets. With Mio you just have to briefly stir it in order to have the liquid completely mixed in.<br /><br />You choose how much Mio to add to your water. If you like it strong and sweet, just add more Mio. If you want your flavor faint, then add only a tiny bit. It is easy, delicious and it doesn't have calories, carbs or sugar. The only bad thing I can say about Mio is that there is a lot of coloring and it can stain your clothes or desk. I do wish that it had less coloring.<br /><br />The Fruit Punch flavor is one of my favorite. I always hated the heavy aftertaste of Koolaid and had to water it down to make it taste like an "adult" version. Mio tastes like the watered-down Koolaid only better. As I said previously, you can add more or less depending on your preferences. If you make it too strong, just add more water. It is completely customizable.<br /><br />The Fruit Punch is my Husband's favorite flavor and my second favorite. You can literally add this to anything and I prefer it in carbonated water. We have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYT6CS">Sodastream Fountain Jet Soda Maker Starter Kit</a> and we use it to carbonate Mio flavored water. It is delicious. I have also added some to store bought flavored drinks that I didn't like the taste of. The possibilities are endless. I highly recommend that you try Mio Fruit Punch.

review/summary: I like it!
review/text: I gave up diet Coke several years ago in favor of filtered water but sometimes I just wanted something--else.  I'm not an alcohol drinker or juice drinker.  Plus I can't handle citric acid in any quantity.  So, with summer s-l-o-w-l-y (for me at least) coming on, thought I'd try Mio.  Good, plus the fruit punch is red (always a good thing), reminds me of Hawaiian Punch and what we called back when I was a kid at summer campe, bug juice (yum yum).  I'm happily sitting here after playing outside toda in the hot sun, I'm all sweaty but have my shoes off and a large glass of this Mio slowly being sipped away.  Happiness is.....  I found the strawberry-watermelon too sweet as most artificial strawberry-flavored things are (wish they'd make just a watermelon).  And I'm hitting the stores tomorrow to try to find the purple one and that green one (don't know what flavor that could be).  Wish Mio would make an ice tea with lemon flavor, maybe even an iced coffee flavor because these little bottles are easy to carry around, and I don't make a whole quart of stuff since everyone else woul drink it, with the little bottles I can do a glass as I go.

review/summary: Great for Atkins, travel, backpacking and staying calorie, carb and sugar free!
review/text: I decided to do Atkins and needed to find a substitute for Soda. I wanted to avoid diet soda and anything sweetened by Aspartame too (as suggested in the Atkins book). MIO is just the ticket (it's sweetened by Splenda). This stuff is small, easy to use and tastes good to. It helps me to drink plenty of water and provides easy travel options. Now we can flavor water when camping, hiking, at work and on weekend trips. The bottle is so small and light there's really no negatives here.<br /><br />When you first start using this, you'll probably over flavor things. You'll learn about how much of a squeeze you need for the size of container you are using, it's really rather easy. The fluid is very concentrated so be careful not to splash or spray it on your clothes. 1 bottle lasts me several days and I drink it all day long. It dissolves quickly, just a little stir and your drink is ready. If you really crave the Soda fizz, you can add it to plain soda water too.<br /><br />Mango Peach is my favorite flavor, here's how I rank the flavors:<br />1. Mango Peach<br />2. Fruit Punch<br />3. Strawberry Watermelon<br />4. Orange Tangerine<br />5. Berry Pomegranate<br /><br />The price varies wildly, many stores carry this item locally for a better price than you'll find online. Give it a shot and you'll be happy you did.<br /><br />5 stars for a great product at a great price, and I'll take a drink now too~!

review/summary: Ughhh...BBQ flavor is NOT my favorite!
review/text: I'm not Muslim, but was interested in this jerky due to its low carb content compared to some other brands of sweet/BBQ jerky.  I tried the the BBQ flavor and the Sweet & Spicy flavor.  I love the Sweet & Spicy flavor, but the BBQ flavor did nothing for me.  I found it too sweet and very sticky (wash your hands sticky).  In my opinion the BBQ flavor is pretty bland...very few spices compared to other BBQ flavor brands on the market.  Although this was an easily chewable jerky (a plus in my book), the flavor and stickiness made this a one-time order for me.

review/summary: Great Taste and Value!!  Great gift idea for seniors, students or singles
review/text: Just got this and opened it tonight, and this merits my first review! Tastes homemade, lots of beef and potatoes, the gravy is wonderful and plentiful if you want to add vegetables or dip biscuits.  It was just what I wanted on a cold rainy winter night.  Got the 38oz so I could use it as dinners, and a half can is ample dinner for someone hungry.  (Beats the heck out of takeout, chinese, pizza or burgers for both price and taste: ca. $2/half can.)  In this recession, a practical gift like this will definitely be appreciated, so If you're looking to send a little something to someone living alone (elderly, students, singles, physically challenged) who work all the time or don't like to cook, this is it! I'm 50+ and have a back injury that makes standing/cooking difficult and painful especially in this weather; but this microwaves in minutes and hits the spot.  I didn't even have to haul it in from the car; delivered free to the doorstep by UPS! I was hesitant this time ordering canned food with the holiday this week, but I got it in 2 days!  You got a customer for life, the price was excellent and delivery faster than I expected!

Town House crackers aren't cheap, but the price offered by Amazon was suprisingly low (think $1 less per box than the sale price at my national grocery store.)  And while I expected there was a chance my crackers would arrive as cracker crumbs, that was not the case.  This is one time I appreciate the way Amazon over-packages everything.  No mroe crumbs and broken crackers than had I purchased it locally.  Yay for Amazon!<br /><br />We have enjoyed these crackers many times in the past and always enjoy the taste -- it's very unique.  And it's not necessary to have something ON the cracker to enjoy it.

review/summary: Five stars for homemade iced latter, 2 stars for hot coffee, 1 star off for pricing
review/text: I tried VIA when it first came out. I tried it the traditional route--as a hot cup o' java. I did not like it. Not this roast and not the Columbian (which was so weak, why bother).<br /><br />So, it's hot. It's summer. I normally hit Starbucks after the gym for my fave iced sugar free vanilla latte. I saw the ad for the iced coffee VIA, but it has sugar. I don't want sugar. So, it hit me, why not try making iced coffee from the regular VIA. (duh, should have thought of that sooner). I bought a 3-packer (like this one shown in image).<br /><br />It was amazing. 2% milk (about a cup), ice, Starbucks sugar free vanilla syrup (I buy it at my local Starbucks), in a blender bottle and shake, shake, shake. It comes out frothy and delicious. FOr me, I like it BETTER than my habitual 2 to 3x a week fix of it at the store. Because you add the VIA to the milk and the milk is cold and the instant coffee is not hot (like espresso), there is NO DILUTION. It makes for a much more flavorful, less watery, iced latte. OH MY GOSH SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.<br /><br />Now, my problem is not having three lattes a day, instead of three a week. Seriously. I'm a junkie now. (And I have coffee everyday, but my homebrew is so much better than Starbuck's that I don't get hot coffee there, I just used to like the convenience--still do--of grabbing a fast latte after exercising. I have a great coffee set-up at home with Paradise Roasters and Terroir gourmet single origins and a Technivorm and a Barratza burr grinder and filtered water pitcher, so really, now that I can make a fast latte at home and take it with me to the Pilates studio and put in the fridge there until I'm done, I may not be visiting the Starbucks as much, except to get my fave protein plate now and then and stock up on VIA.)<br /><br />The product is crazy overpriced. What...more than five bucks for what's 3 servings? How sick is that? Buy it at the store unless the price is dropped. That's crazy.<br /><br />But, nummy latte.<br /><br />So, if iced lattes are you vice of choice, might wanna consider this. And if you don't want sugar, skip the one they're pushing now in the blue packaging and buy the unsweetened.<br /><br />And I just slurped one after dinner (latte that is). Addictive. (Er, literally, I guess.) But at least I'm getting my calcim. :D

It's also great for those times when I'd love a cup, but brewing a whole pot would be a waste. This definitely beats the heck out of any other instant I have tried (even in England where the instant is typically pretty good) but I suspect in a side-by-side blind taste-test, I'd still pick a brewed cup over this.

review/summary: Works in a pinch and it's a good substitute
review/text: If I'm in a hurry and there's no time to make coffee I like Starbuck's VIA Instant Micro Grind coffee in hot water. -Of course, I can taste the difference -but in a flash it's nice to have, and tastes better than freeze dried crystals or other instant coffee. Also, this is nice to have on hand for cooking and baking. (Like making Tiramisu or even using in chili or steak marinade. (For some reason coffee gives meat a rich "MEATY" beef flavor?)

review/summary: Good Coffee. Not good here.
review/text: This costs $2.99 retail. The coffee tastes good but it doesn't taste good enough to pay double the price. Please stop trying to rip people off.

review/summary: expensive and horrible
review/text: With a promotional discount, I reluctantly decided to try Via.  It is still instant coffee and little better than any other instant coffee on the market, which is to say, it's disgusting.  Personally, I will just do without rather than subject myself to the inferior qualities of this product.  One still needs hot water to make instant coffee, and with hot water one can use a small french press or Coghlans One Cup Coffee Filters or Melitta U S A Inc 640007 Perfect Brew Filter Cone.  Don't lower your standards folks!

review/summary: ~*~*~My Girls LOVE these, PERFECT SIZE for Little Fingers~*~*~
review/text: When we first started giving these to our daughters we had to keep a very close eye on them(as with any solid food) because sometimes they would start choking and we would have to stick our fingers in their mouths and get these out.<br /><br />These do 'dissolve' pretty easily but your baby may take a little getting used to eating them like mine did. But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'.<br /><br />We have bought Walmart Store Brand & these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling.<br /><br />Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk.<br /><br />These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done. Even if I have just fed my girls, if they see us eating they will have a fit. We put some puffs on their walker or high chair trays and they are Happy again. We even pour these in their play pen & they don't even make a mess. At a restaurant if my girls are getting fussy, we'll keep giving them puffs and they are happy. We give them puffs while we are heating their food, if not they'll normally throw fits until we are feeding them.<br /><br />We've tried the Gerber flavors: Bananna, Strawberry/Apple, Apple Cinnamon & my girls love them all.

review/summary: Safe and Tasty
review/text: Our little grandson loves his Gerber Sweet Potato Puffs. Sprinkle some on the table before him and he'll immediately start grabbing for them and putting them in his mouth. I like that they dissolve so readily, making them a safe non-choking hazard. The taste is actually pretty good though to me they taste more like orange than sweet potato.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's not a major one, is that there is more sugar in the puffs than sweet potato. Yet, with only one gram of sugar in a half cup serving, this minor sin is forgivable.

review/summary: nice to have..
review/text: I hesitated to buy this item, becuase its Ingredients include a little bit sugar..<br />I don't like sugar products. If my baby get used to eating sugar, then he will try to eat sweet things.<br />Anyway.. He likes it. :)
