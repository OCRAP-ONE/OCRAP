review/summary: MUCH better than Keurig's My K-Cup!!!
review/text: My family had been using Keurig's (refillable) My K-Cups for over 2 years, when I found these little darlings at Amazon.  At first I was skeptical, but desperate; the Keurig K-cups, although ridiculously expensive, kept breaking and requiring replacement.  (We bought at least 12 of them in 2 years.) I LOVE the My-Kaps!!! They are much easier to use, and just as easy to clean as the Keurig K-cups.  Best of all, they are durable and don't break with normal use. I wish I'd found them sooner!

review/summary: My-Kap lives up to promise
review/text: These make a great cup of coffee.  Messy cleaning for reusing the original cup, but worth it.  For those on septic, rinse out cups in a sauce pan and throw the water outside.  If you're in the South, banana plants love it.  I use French Roast coffee from BJs, and am amazed at the flavor.<br /><br />You can also add a touch of flavor (i.e. cinnamon or vanilla) to the K-cup before brewing.  Well, well worth the initial cost. Will pay for itself very quickly.

review/summary: My-Kap It Works
review/text: I received a 3 pack just to try. They do work as advertised. I have to fill my K-cups very full to get a decent cup. After using K-Cups I may never use My-Kaps. These are great if you want a cheaper cup of coffee or you want your own brew, but I just find trying to re-use K-Cups with a My-Kap a bit troublesome. Also you will have to hold down the lever of your machine through the brewing process or you might have a mess.

review/text: Isn't this a rip-off? While it is a good idea, it doesn't eliminate the work and the mess cleaning an old k-cup and the value is ridiculous.<br /><br />$16.99?  Are you kidding me? If you spent $14.99 at Bed Bath and Beyond to buy the K-Cup filter, you won't have to hassle yourself removing the seal on the old k-cup and cleaning it with a cheap brush. You've defeated the purpose of the Keurig Coffee maker; that is to save time. There is a tiny hole created on all used k-cups and you'd have to make sure it's line up with the needle in the keurig. Even if there's an arrow, that's still another small thing you'd have to worry about when you're already in a hurry in the morning.

review/summary: First and worst option.
review/text: Respect to My-Kap for being the first ones to liberate the Keurig machine for non-Keurig use (I'm brewing Teeccino, woot woot!), but the technology is really dated now compared to the competition.  First of all, using old K-Cups is weak.  The whole point of this product is to brew your own favorite blend, so why would you want to have to buy K-Cups at all?  Second of all, the My-Kaps don't really do much to solve the biggest problem with One-Cup brewing: the trash.  Sure you reuse a K-Cup once or twice, but the filter only lasts so long, and the replaceable one's My-Kap sells are terrible.  Re-useable filter-cups like the Solofill or eKobrew make more sense and are easier to use.<br /><br />If you feel compelled to buy these things nonetheless, don't get swindled into buying an 18-pack, or even a three-pack.  They are selling these in massive quantities, but YOU ONLY NEED ONE.  The Kaps are hard plastic, and there is no reason to buy a bunch unless you want to play Pogs with them.

review/summary: Garbage - They leak no matter what
review/text: These k-Caps are garbage. I tried everything to not get them to leak and have had no luck. I tried grinding the coffee less, I tried putting less coffee in the cup. No matter what they still leak. I even took a uses kcup, removed the foil, and put the k-cap on it. Big surprise, it leaked!!<br /><br />The issue is that there is such a large hole in the top. The Keurig brews at a high pressure and water leaks from the top. I have not had water leak from the sides of the cup like other people, just the top. I end up getting clear water in my coffee cup.<br /><br />I am going to try a product that seals the top better.

review/text: I was consumed by guilt when it comes to the keurig and all the plastic I was depositing in the landfills.  This invention gives me the best of both worlds.  Any coffee I want any time... no waste in the landfills... yet I can use a k-cup if I am in a hurry or for guest who come over.  I use them 7-10 times on each k-cup.  I have seven of these 'kaps' and I love them and have not had any problems with them at all.

review/summary: They Leak, but...
review/text: They leak.  Regardless of what anyone else tells you, or how they tell you to make them not leak (make sure kap is on snuggly, hold the lever down, make sure the cup is not overfilled), they leak out the top of the cup most of the time.  You WILL have sediment (grounds) in your cup of coffee, and you WILL be wiping coffee out of the chamber housing.  That said, I've been using them for about six months and I continue to use them, because they do give you the opportunity to use your favorite coffee with your favorite coffee maker (The Keurig).  I've used both, and I prefer the My-Kap vs the Keurig My K-cup reusable filter because the coffee always seems to be weaker with the Keurig reusable filter.  It also leaves more sediment than the My-Kap.  There's my opinion.  That and 40 cents will buy you a K-cup.

review/summary: Great Way to Make What You Want
review/text: I bought these for a couple reasons.  First to have the option to use flavored coffees that I have been using for years; these let me do just that, even mixing to get what I want.  Second, I can reuse the K-Cups a few times rather than tossing them, saving money and helping a bit with the environment.  These are working well on most k-cups I've tried, although I've run across a couple that, due to the manufacturing process, make using these caps difficult or impossible.

review/summary: My-Kaps work
review/text: K cups can be expensive and you often have your very own favorite coffee anyway.  Why not reuse those K cups!  This product is easy to use and will enable you to get an even better brew in your Keurig brewer when you use your own coffee.  The refillable brewing accessory for the Keurig makes an acceptable cup of coffee, but not a great cup.  My-Kap makes a huge difference.  The product will be shipped from an independent vendor, but your My-Kaps will arrive within just a few days.  Be sure to place the print on the cap up when you insert it into the K cup so that it will fit easily into the cup.  You will choose the same brew size you normally use with the K cups.  The number  of times you can reuse the K cups varies from coffee company to coffee company, but you will still be able to reuse most of them at least 4 to 6 times.  I have reused several K cups 10 or more times before discarding them.

review/summary: It's True, they do leak, but no more back pressure!
review/text: It's true, the lids do leak some when making a coffee, but other than that this product will fit the bill. The lids fit snugly into the tops of used KCups. I do not yet know how many times you can reuse the cup, I am still on the first one.<br /><br />This product has a huge benefit over the mesh screen system sold by Kurig. The mesh screen severely restricts water flow forcing high back pressure on your Kurig coffee system pump. If you use the screen often this will shorten the life of your pot significantly. Back pressure is the slow death of any pump system, from the Kurig to your swimming pool. Reusing KCups solves this problem. Paper filters offer much less resistance to water flow.<br /><br />You also get a fuller, better tasting cup of coffee from the paper filter Kcup versus mesh.<br /><br />One negative, it is a slight pain to clean the Kcups for initial reuse, but not much more than cleaning the screen. After the initial cleaning, it is no harder than the mesh screen.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Extend the life of your pot and get a better cup of coffee. Dump the screen and get the lid!<br /><br />9/3/10 Update: If you want to prevent leakage around the top of your lid, stretch a small piece of Saran Wrap (household kitchen plastic wrap) over the lid, then place it into the filter. Your Keurig will pierce the wrap while the wrap seals the lid in place. No more leaks!

review/summary: Fantastic product but too pricey
review/text: I love my Keurig brewer but soon realized 3 significant problems; the high cost of K-cup coffee, wasteful packaging and limited selection. Enter the My-Kap which addresses all three. The only drawbacks I have found are the initial high cost for these plastic disks and the leakage that occurs while brewing with them. However, they will pay for themselves after a few uses and by solving the other problems, perhaps makes the cost worthwhile. As for the leakage, my experience has typically been a small dribble of water that runs down the side of the K-cup. Still, I get a very good cup of the coffee of MY chosing.<br />  Now there is a solution for the leakage problem too. On this same page, there is a post from "D.Dobson"five2one" who adds a small piece of "Glad Press-n-Seal" plastic wrap over the top of the My-Kap. Doing so forms a tight seal around the top rim of the K-cup. I tried this and have not had a leak since! It also keeps coffee grounds from spilling out of the top hole.<br />  There are other great alternatives to re-using K-cups, namely the EZ-Cup and the Solofill which are washable cup & lid assemblies. For me though, I prefer the My-Kaps. I can prepare multiple cups of various coffees ahead of time, place them in ziplock bags and label them. The different color My-Kaps come in handy here too.<br />  One final note on K-cups. If you are gentle with them you will get many re-uses before they fail. You can wash them in soap & water as long as you rinse them thoroughly and don't use a brush. A gentle puff of air through the bottom hole will push the filter out like a parachute aiding in cleaning. Some gentle suction will then draw it back in. Also when brewing, use the same bottom hole on the cup. Note it's 12 o'clock position and place the cup as such in your machine. You will feel it drop in when properly aligned.

review/summary: K-Kaps a great inexpensive little item
review/text: I have been using these caps constantly for the past 2 weeks and haven't experienced any problems with water leakage, poor fit, etc. The trick I found was to push the cap into the K-Cup so that the top rim of the Kap is even with the top rim of the K-Cup. I fill used K-Cups and Kap them days before I plan to use them and seal the hole in the top of the Kap and the hole in the bottom of the K-Cup with those "dot-type" stickers one can get in office supply stores and discount stores. This keeps the coffee/tea/hot chocolate, etc. from getting stale before brewing. To clean used K-Cups, I bought a cheap eyebrow brush to "sweep" the wet grounds out of the Cup and filter after use. I do keep numerous used, clean and dry K-Cups to fill and cap while recently used K-Cups are drying. I've found that the regular grind coffee that I buy in the grocery store works well for brewing as fine grind coffee tends to clog the needle in the brewer. To get the correct strength in tea, I fill the K-Cup with the equivalent of 2 teabags, then cap. For coffee, I fill the K-Cup to nearly the bottom edge of the K-Kap. So far my Kaps are working well and saving me money. Before discovering these, I was somewhat regretting having bought my Keurig brewer because of the high cost of the K-Cups and the number of people living in my house who drink multiple cups of coffee daily. The bill for buying K-Cups was starting to look like my mortgage payment! These saved my bank account.

review/summary: Makes Keurig use an affordable option
review/text: This is a fantastic invention.  If you save your old K cups, rinse and dry them, and refill them with your favorite coffee and top it with this little my Kap, you have a perfect K cup at a fraction of the price. We were spending over $50 a month on K cups,so you can save a lot of money with this gadget.  We use the old K cups at least 10 times.  If you line it up so the bottom hole pops into the puncher, it prolongs the life even more.  The only thing negative I can think of is that it is quite overpriced for a small piece of plastic, but since someone was smart enough to come up with this, I guess they deserve to make some money!

review/text: This item does exactly what it claims.  I just bought a 3-pack though and that matters as you'll read below.  After the 1)Fine-grinding (a little messy) 2)Filling the K-Cup (also a little messy) 3)Pressing in the K-Kap and brewing, I have an excellent cup of coffee, and I love that!<br />  Then, after popping off the K-Kap and disposing of the used grinds (Yes, definitely messy), time to set the empty K-cup somewhere to dry till next time.<br />The reason the price matters is that the only reasonable way to use K-Kaps is to pre-make several at a time...maybe 20 to 25. But that's $40 or $50 for that many K-Kaps. So how long will it take to recoup my money?  You can see my motivation is economic, and it would be great purchase if the K-Kaps were cheaper, because time is money and it takes time to use the K-Kaps.

review/summary: 3 reasons I choose My-Kap and  why I  love them so!
review/text: 3 reasons that I decided to purchase My-Kap now were: 1. Save the environment. ( I hate it whenever I throw out used K-Cups in such a good condition, one-time use) 2. Save money. ( Although K-Cups cost much less than a visit to Starbucks, it costs ~$0.43-$0.50  per Cup and it adds up.) 3. I get to choose to brew from any coffee of my choice. ( I can brew from beans purchased in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and etc.). Best of all, brew it right after I grind the beans. Fresh)<br /><br />After My-Kaps arrived, I can't wait to use it to brew the next day.<br />3 reasons that I love them:<br />  1. Thanks to the clear instructions sent with My-Kap, it's easy to get started, assemble and dissemble.<br />  2. The coffee brewed from reused K-Cups with My-Kap tastes great to the essence of your grinds, unlike bad reviews I've read for similar product. Even better,  I can change the strength of my coffee by adding less or more onto my reused K-cup.<br />  3. It does leak but not too much or too messy. I do not know exactly the reason or ways to prevent it from happening. I am still playing with it. But the leaks are not messy because they still go into the cup. I just have to remember to wipe the machine after brewing.  I do that as a routine regardless it leaks anyway, do it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />For the quality of the brewed I get, the money and wastes I saved, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommended to anyone who shares my desires to save environment, save $$ and has a freedom to brew different coffee each day. Not just different, but FRESH!! (if you recently grind the beans or grind right before you brew it)

review/summary: Save money, use your own coffee, easy cleanup
review/text: I bought these along with the DisposaKup filters, and I'm very satisfied. These allow you to reuse your spent k-cups and your own coffee. I love the convenience of the Keurig, but until I discovered this product (and the filters) I was disappointed with the high dollar and environmental cost of the k-cups. My first solution was to buy the My K-cup reusable filter. After purchasing it however, I learned what a hassle it is to clean out coffee grinds from the mesh screen. This defeated the whole purpose of the Keurig. There had to be a better solution, and there is! First, you use your k-cups like normal. Take the spent cups and remove the grinds and the filter lining. You will use the plastic shell of your k-cups along with the DisposaKup filters, your own coffee grinds, and the K-caps. When you're done brewing, you remove the K-cap and dump out the filter with the used grinds. It's that simple. No messy cleanup!<br /><br />Mine do not leak. Maybe that's because the filters I use make it fit more snugly.<br /><br />I would have given 5 stars, but for one problem: These caps are hard to remove from the k-cup. I use a paperclip and it works fine, but it would've been nice if, in addition to the brush accessory, this company had included a tool for this purpose.

review/summary: Better than My K-Cup
review/text: I've only used my K-Caps a few times, but so far they make a much better cup of coffee than the My K-Cup, which always made a watered down cup. The K-Caps are a bit messy to use, especially at first, but not really any worse than using the My K-Cup. I also like that I can reuse some of the plastic K-cups.<br /><br />Update: I've been using the K-caps for a couple of months now, and have had the time to sample several different Keurig K-cups. I drink mostly decaf coffee and there are not a lot of flavor choices available in K-cups. The decaf kinds that I HAVE tried all seem to be a dark roast or bold, which is not really my preferred coffee type apparently. I've gone back to mostly using the K-caps with my favorite decaf coffee - Harry and David's Moose Munch, and the coffee is perfectly brewed every time. Not too dark, not too bold, not too strong, not watered down, but just right! I love that I can have my favorite coffee and the K-caps are MUCH neater than the My K-cup that came with our Keurig.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: If you are like me and favor a particular brand of coffee but don't want to be strapped into buying the throw away kcups, BUY THIS ITEM.  Every piece of the set works perfectly.  The filters in the K-CUPS that you refill are very durable and can be used over and over using this Kaps.  The Kaps are very durable as well and fit perfectly in to the cups. I have not had any issues with grounds in my coffee and the remover tool works great to pull the Kaps off. I am very concerned of environmental waste the throw away K cups generate, so this product remedies that issue remarkably.  And I compost the grounds as well.  Now if the Keurig would just make a bigger mug of coffee, I would really be happy.

review/summary: Works perfectly.. Great alternative to "My K-Cup"
review/text: This past Christmas, I was given a Keurig machine as a gift. The quality of the coffee from official K-Cups is excellent, but there are non-coffee products (Teeccino mainly) I drink which aren't available in that format.<br /><br />In an attempt to find the best customizable alternative, I've tried the custom "My K-Cup" filter and now these K-Caps. Both work very well and require similar levels of effort with regard to cleaning. These K-caps however, let you prep multiple cups and have them ready to go. They also help reduce waste by letting you get several uses out of each K-cup.<br /><br />When I bought these, I expected them to fit over the edge of the cups like a plastic drink lid, but these actually fit inside the K-cups and fit tightly. It takes some practice and dexterity to make it work, but once you get the hang of it, it's quick and easy. I found the caps were a perfect fit and produced strong results with slightly less grounds than the My K-Cup. I had absolutely no problems with grounds getting into my drink or weak product. There was no need to hold the lever on the machine or go through any other extra effort that others describe. All I do is pack the grounds tightly into the cup (making sure none stay on the rim or in other places where they might get into your drink), press the K-Cap evenly into it, and make sure it sits flush with the edge of the cup. With the ground tightly compacted, you get a very rich flavorful drink.<br /><br />My only complaint with these (and the reason I give them 4 stars instead of five) is that I'd like to get more of them for the price. $4 each is a little steep for what it is - a thick plastic disk. If they can get a lower price (maybe $1 or $2 each) this would be a great way to load your own cups and have them ready to go. I intend to buy more, but will wait to see if the price gets a bit more competitive.

review/text: I used My-Kap for the first time today. It works great.  I read where people have asked about being worried that more holes would be punched in the bottom of the k-cup, but you can just place the k-cup back in the holder and gently turn it until it pops back into the original hole from the first use.  They are a bit over priced in my opinion.

review/summary: They work....
review/text: It took me a couple of tries to really figure these out.  Better directions would help.  First, when you empty out your K-cup, DON'T rip out the filter.  It needs to stay in the cup.  Second, make sure you line the K-cup up with the existing hole (that eliminates leaking).  Third, I use two scoops of coffee, then tap it down, put the lid on... delicious coffee.  either 8 oz or 10 oz of water works great.  I plan to purchase another set because someone threw out one of the cups and lids.  Darn it all.

review/summary: Work great if used correctly
review/text: With these caps I have had only a little spill over from the front, and having my cup to the front edge catches it. The trick, not stated in the instructions, is to make sure the bottom hole in the used k-cup is aligned with the arrow on the holder so as not to put additional holes in the bottom of the cup. I put amagic marker line on the side of the cup and it lines up well. After using one cup 6 times there is still only one hole in the bottom. Also just insert the cap flush with the top of the cup, if you push it down in then the upper needle/water dispenser may jet water on top of the cap and not just through the top hole. Haven't seen any differance in performance when using feal fine or coarser grind coffee. I reccommend these.

review/summary: Leaks!
review/text: I first purchased a "My KCup" Found it leaked though there were some fixes on the net. I next got one of those Solocups. It worked great for about a month, then the gasket broke, and leaked so I ordered these K-Caps. I'm not at all able to make these work at all without leaking.<br /><br />I've gone back to the My KCup. Of the two solutions I found, placing a washer above the gasket on the needle, or carving a small gasket out of a wine cork, I chose the latter.<br /><br />I used a cork (artificial) from a bottle of Ravenwood Red Zinfandel (Vinter select) I sliced off about 1/6 inch and drilled a hole in the middle slightly larger than the hole in the top of the K-Cup. I didn't need to glue it in as it fits perfectly and stays secure. I've been using this now for 3 weeks with no issues.<br /><br />I just wish the folks at Kuerig would have made sure their own product worked with their own product.

review/summary: Great idea, but have some aluminum foil ready to improve them
review/text: These leak.<br />You'll most likely have a bit of a mess in the machine, but not bad.  Some of the ground coffee will end up in your cup.<br />Still, I like the idea, and have found it to be a huge help to put a small square of aluminum foil between the cup and lid, to make a better seal.<br /><br />On caps' own merits, aluminum foil squares (folded once) actually worked better.  Together it's a pretty good solution.  It takes away from the whole point of k-cups, but sometimes it's nice to save money or use your own coffee.

OK THIS IS HOW THEY WORK...1st you need to use a pod...2nd cut the foil off with a knife(careful there's a filter inside of the pod)...3rd get the old coffee out...4th refill with your coffee(DO NOT PACK. Just fill to top then tap to settle)...5th place this cap inside the pod and brew. TIPS this top goes inside the pod its not a snap top. It does fit inside air tight. AND when you put the pod back in the Keurig make sure the hole on the bottom is lined up with the arrow or it will put another hole in the bottom of the pod. this give you weak coffee because it drains out so fast.

review/summary: As yet unhappy
review/text: Had this product for about 2 weeks now. Not particularly satisfied as of yet. Like others have stated the problem with leakage is annoying & makes a mess, not to mention a weaker brew. Tried pulling the rubber seal/grommet down to account for an apparent gap between the Keurig coffee maker and the K-cap. This seemed to help a little but not enough to keep me from having to place a dishcloth under my coffee mug to avoid a bigger, longer clean-up. Haven't tried the foil trick yet because I've discovered that trick works very well with the My K-cup device, without having to buy pre-packaged K-cups, use them once, clean them out, let them dry, use the K-cap, adjust the seal, clean the mess...<br /><br />I'm not sure whether to send the K-caps back or keep troubleshooting until I find a solution. Since placing the foil on the My K-cup filter prior to putting on the plastic lid works as well with my Keurig coffee maker as the pre-packaged K-cups I probably wont have a need for the K-caps.<br /><br />p.s. I still purchase the pre-packaged K-cups since some of them have outstanding flavor. I just don't discard them in my trash can. *HINT* They recycle nicely after removing the foil & filter.

review/summary: These made it ok for this coffee snob to switch to a Keurig...
review/text: My husband spent a lot of time pestering me to convert our coffee habit over to a Keurig machine. I fought the switch for months. I am an admitted coffee snob, and all of the coffee I had tried from the pre-packaged k-cups were too bland and blah for me. Also, the waste factor from using a new plastic k-cup for each cup of coffee just couldn't be justified. Then we found these k-kaps.<br /><br />I have been very pleased with my k-kaps, and the Keurig machine in general. I am still able to grind my own coffee beans in the morning, and pack them into rinsed empty k-kaps. The k-kaps are easy to clean, and with multiple kaps, I can pack enough cups in one go to provide multiple k-cups and have them ready to go when I need my second (and third) cup. I've been able to get 6-10 reuses for each k-cup while using the k-kaps. An additional bonus was that I use less coffee beans with the Keurig, so a pound of my favorite coffee lasts much longer (about 5 days longer, with 3-4 cups of coffee per day).<br /><br />These k-kaps resolved all of my concerns related to the Keurig machines. I will definitely continue to use them.

Over the past several years we've been fans of Gevalia coffee and thought we'd have to use our old coffee maker to enjoy our Gevalia.  The My-Kaps make it possible to use the Keurig and enjoy our favorite coffee.  It's a little bit of work but personally I feel it's worth the effort.  I just received our order of 3 caps yesterday, I am now ordering more for us and some for my brother and a friend to try.  The Kaps fit the cups perfectly and although I've only used them twice today I can tell that these are going to be one of my new favorite things.

review/summary: Custom K-Cups for my favorite coffee!
review/text: While Keurig makes a filter attachment that allows you to make custom coffee, it is not a true K-cup design.  You must remove the K-cup holder and insert the Keurig filter.  This is a bit of a pain when switching between standard K-cups and the Keurig custom filter.  In addition, the My-Kap provides a more economical means to make the custom cups (i.e., with multiple caps for about the same price as a single Keurig filter attachment).<br /><br />The My-Kap addresses this shortcoming by allowing you to keep the standard K-cup holder in your coffeemaker, while allowing you to create "custom" K-cups.  The method that My-Kap provides works as good as a K-cup, and so far, I have squeezed five cups of coffee with one reused K-cup pod.  As the My-Kap directions indicate, the adapter does not always fit flush on the first cup run, and as a result, I did have to hold down the coffee maker lever to ensure it was completely closed.  However, on subsequent cups, it worked without my intervention and I am enjoying my favorite coffee blend (that does not come in standard K-cups) as I type this message.<br /><br />The tools included with the My-Kap are a mixed bag.  The removal tool that assists you in removing the My-Kap works great but the cleaning brush is "OK".  On my first usage of the brush, the brush came apart from the handle.  I was able to push it back on, and it works OK, but any standard bottle cleaning brush would also work.<br /><br />This product works as advertised and gives me added flexibility with my Keurig.<br /><br />Update (2010-02-07): The reusage that you get from a single K-cup pod varies.  It is important to evaluate the cups after each use as they will show cracking around the lid from repetitive insertion of the My-Kap.  I have found the leaks noted in other comments will occur when these cracks are present.  I am still pleased with this product and recommend it for anyone wanting to brew their own brand of coffee in a K-Cup format.

review/summary: Never as good as the K-Cup
review/text: These are a pain in the rear, you need to take your used cup, empty it, make sure all the lid foil is off and then wash it good. Then fill it with coffee and then put lid on. It is like factory work and that is the last thing I want to do at 5am in the morning. The coffee never tastes as good as the K-cup. You can't reuse the K-cup too many times either as the filter inside rips or just wears out. There is one thing you must also remember...when you put your original k-cup in the first time unused, the machine punctured a hole in the bottom of cup, when you are going to put in your used cup with this lid you must line up the original hole else it will puncture a new one each time you use it. It does work OK but is it really worth the effort?....not to me.

review/summary: Works great...
review/text: I was a little hesitant thinking that coffee grounds would overflow into the coffee. I wash the filter out and than I take the bottom of the pod and blow into it and it puffs it out so it drys alot faster than in the kup. I than cut out circles of heavy duty tin foil and put the circle on top and push the lid down with the foil underneath. I than seal the foil under the edges. At that point you can remove the cap and I put the cup into a plastic bag to keep it fresher.  And when I am ready I put the cap back on the Kup and I don't have any leakage at all and you can make as many as you want with really one kap because the foil holds the coffee in.  Cutting the foil circles are kind of a pain but its alot cheaper. I read that you can really reuse these kups until the filter starts to tear.  Just make sure the filter is all the way dry.  And also you can use a childs toothbrush or makeup brush to clean the filter too, just can't scrub too hard. I have ekobrew too.  But I like this better.<br />Also if the coffee starts to go through slow it might be time to throw it away.

review/summary: k kap use
review/text: Thought this was a great idea, but like many reviewers I was experiencing leakage out the top regularly. Kept experimenting with the supplied washer and thicker washers to seal top better but leakage persisted. Read alot of the reviews to get information on solutions, thanks! Heres mine. I put a square of tin foil over the cup before putting the K Kap on, maybe helps freshness, maybe not, but is more like the original K cup. This is the most important finding to me: I DON'T orient the old pucture in the bottom of the cup. I always punch a new hole like a normal K cup. Believe this provides some upward pressure that helps seal the top puncture. You can still use the K cup a bunch of times. Leakers are very, very rare so far. Try it if you are experiencing problems. Most importantly don't give up, this K Kap is a really great idea.

That in itself is golden.<br /><br />So maybe some of the dis-satisfied customers received a possible manufacturing defect???<br /><br />Whatever the case, I may have been one of the lucky customers.  It has worked perfectly with several different k-cup brands of coffee.  I have managed to rinse them out, let them dry and re-use many,many, times.<br /><br />Hope the inventor makes a ton of money for this simple concept.  Has the potential to save a ton of money by not HAVING to buy a so many k-cups.

review/summary: I Sent Them Back
review/text: We have a B70. I tried 4 different kinds of k cups to refill and these leaked every time. I was using tea bag tea, and I had success with just a foil circle, so I don't think it was the "grind". I tried pulling down the rubber gasket like another reviewer suggested and that didn't help either. The brush came with the two pieces separated and wouldn't go back together. I think the suggestion I saw in another review to use a baby toothbrush would work better anyways. I'm glad they are working for some people, just wish I was one of them. Back to cutting out foil circles I guess.

review/summary: The benefits of K-Cups without the cost and waste.
review/text: I tried the highly-rated Ekobrew cup, but must be doing something terribly wrong, as I've yet to get a decent cup of coffee from it - - and, oddly, it delivers only about half the coffee of a regular K-Cup(?!) So I got the My-Kaps and have been thoroughly happy with them. My burr-grinder is set to grind just enough beans to fill the K-Cup, a My-Kap fits snugly into the cup, and I get absolutely no leaking, clogging, or grinds in the cup - - none of the things some people are complaining about. I keep a "carousel" of standard (overpriced)K-Cup varieties for guests, but use them myself only when I have to replace a "worn-out" cup (the fabric filters usually give out after about 5 or 6 refills).  Couldn't be happier.

review/summary: Worth the Savings
review/text: My Kaps are a great way to save extra money and have extra coffee on hand. It is a little time consuming cleaning each K-Cup out for reuse with your K-Kap, but it is definitely worth it. K-Kaps give me extra cups of coffee during the week without having to purchase more boxes of K-Cups, plus I can put a different flavored coffee in each one for a different treat every day.

review/summary: Leaky and messy
review/text: It's just a plastic cap that costs them $0.02 to make and they sell it for a big markup.  I've used it 4-5 times with different original k-cups.  It a bit of a pain to clean out the k-cups and then if these Kaps are used and not brewed right away, there is a hole at in the Kap that allows air into the coffee to ruin the taste if stored over time and also allows the coffee to spill out if you tip it over.  You can place a sticker over the hole or a piece of tape, but then that's another annoying step that detracts from the convenience of the k-cup.  I'm going back to the commercially available k-cups and when I want to grind my own cup of coffee, it's quicker and less mess to use my French press with instant hot water from the 3L electric thermal hot pot my wife keeps for her tea.<br /><br />Well, at least I can use these Kaps as poker chips.

review/summary: Making reuse possible
review/text: I got a Keurig for Christmas and it came with some K-cups.  All well and good. Nice cup of coffee from some not so good from others. But I love my own coffee from local roasters so thought a way to use my own coffee would be good.<br /><br />The Kaps for K-cups allow you to use your own coffee by re-using k-cups. You get 3 caps, a brush, and a plastic thing to pop the lids out of the K-cup after making your coffee.  The Kaps come with directions at so small a font size you (or at least I) can't read them or identify the details in the photos.<br /><br />To use.  You buy some K-cups for your coffee maker.  Once you use the k-cup, peel off the tops and rinse out the used grounds being careful not to poke holes in or dislodge the filter that is in the k-cups.  Note that some k-cups don't have a filter (you can buy more filters for k-cups but that adds expense).  You can still use these but they make a very gritty cup of coffee.  The filters in a used cup are going to be a bit tan and darken with each use.<br /><br />Now let dry and when you want to use your own coffee. Put coffee in the used k-cup leaving some room at the top and don't pack the grounds in. Then put the Kap on top with the smooth side up and push it into the k-cup.  It should fit snuggly and easily if the filter doesn't come all the way to the top edge if so just be careful to fit it in levelly.<br /><br />Place in the machine being careful to twist the used and Kapped cup until the hole that was made in the bottom of the cup when you first used it drops down over the point that pokes a hole into the bottom of the cup. This keeps the cup from getting a new hole every time you use it and thus weak watery coffee.<br /><br />Play with grinds until you get one that you like in the used cups -- I use a moderately fine grind and get pretty good coffee.  You may be able to reuse a k-cup several times before the filter gets a tear or hole in it.  Then it's time to toss it.  I've gotten between 5-8 uses out of one k-cup before the filter requires tossing.

review/text: I initially gave this product a 3 star review because I felt that it was too messy to deal with. However, after I have used it several more times it does as it describes. What pleased me most, is that after my initial complaint the seller contacted me personally to appologize for my unhappiness with the product. They have exceptional customer service and for that I am giving them a 5 star review. Using the filter paper inside the k-cup with the cap takes some getting used to, but once I figured it out it made a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Figured out how to fix the Kap for travel and made it work better...
review/text: Got 2 Keurigs for Christmas, one for home, one for the office.  Not a fan of .50/cup of coffee as a 3rd shift manager, so the Kaps appealed to me.  I followed the instructions to a T, but still had sputters and leaks.  Then there's the whole issue of the hole in the top of the Kap, so packing them into work was going to be a mess (have to fix it at my desk, so no mess is important).  Enter Glad Press 'n' Seal plastic wrap.  Snap on the Kap, cover with a square of the wrap and voila!  No more mess in transport or in the machine (and I don't have to hold the handle of the Keurig down).  I do think the Kaps are a little pricey at the outset, but in the long run, they will certainly pay for themselves.

review/text: I am so happy with this product i dont know where to begin.  I love the fact that i dont always "have to buy" k-cups. Reusing the cups is very economical and "green".  The basket and plastic piece that came with my machine worked ok in the beginning but the plastic cracked and left me with grounds in my cup and a spraying coffee stream.  So i looked for something else and this works perfectly.  I reuse k-cups about 6-8 times each, placing the cup in the machine so it will use the same puncture hole each time.  Cleaning out the cup is made easy with the brush supplied, and the caps are easily rinsed and reused.  For making one or two cups at a time this is perfect for me!

review/text: I wasn't sure what I had purchased, but I knew I needed to try something other than the gray filter basket you can buy in the stores. I really enjoy these. So many of the k-cup coffees are too strong for me, so I like to use my own coffee. You reuse  k-cups with the top and the coffee removed, I empty, wash rest of coffee out and let dry, then I can refill them and use the Kaps for the lid, there is a hole in the lid for water to go thru and holes in the bottom of the k-cups for water to come out. I get the same strength coffe every time. I did put my usual coffee thru a coffee grinder, the coffee in the k-cups is a little finer than regular store bought coffee.

review/summary: "kap" is great - cleaning is not
review/text: There's really nothing wrong with the caps, as long as you remember to face the flat side down into the cup. The "issue" I have is CLEANING the used k-cup (rising all the grinds out and letting the cup dry). Then there's having to keep track of how many times you've reused the same cup. If you want to go "greener" and save some money at the same time, go with the reusable plastic container with the wire mesh basket. In my opinion, the coffee tastes as good as refilling a k-cup. You still have to clean the unit, but at least you don't need to track how "old" it's getting through repeated use. Hope this helps :)

review/text: These My-Kap work better than any other product on the market.  I've purchased just about every alternative so don't waste your time and money on the other gadgets.  One exception is the Keurig single cup reusable filter.  That must be modified a little.  Take a used K-cup and cut the top shoulder off.  Place the plastic cup into the holder.  Then place the filter into the plastic cup.  This is a little tricky but you'll get the hang of it in a couple of tries.  I found it best to place a My-Kap in the top and score a line under the shoulder using something sharp like an ice pick.  The Kap will sturdy the top so it is easy to turn.  You may have to turn it about three times, each time with a little more pressure.  This slows down the water going through the coffee for a better brew.  I've also found that grinding the grounds finer works well.  A small electric grinder is worth the money.  For the My-Kap to work better, don't press it in very much.  Let the machine do that.  Just place it on top, making sure it isn't crooked.  Just set it in a little.  When you start to see little cracks around the top, it's usefulness is over.  This is the time to cut the K-Cup to modify the reusable filter  These aren't my ideas.  I found the info on the web somewhere.

review/summary: Stop leaking K-Caps!!
review/text: If you started experimenting first with the "Keurig My-K-Cup", as I did, but eventually moved on to" K Caps", here's a way to stop your K Caps from leaking. Remove the black plastic cup holder from your Keurig and replace it with the grey plastic base that came with the Keurig My-K-Cup (don't use the mesh basket or the grey lid, just the base portion). Now use your recycled cups with K cap lids. You don't have to worry about aligning the holes and the grey base will hold the K cup a little higher so that you get a better seal around the top.<br /><br />Also, after cleaning your k-cups, puff a little air through the bottom hole. The filter will invert, like a mushroom, and will dry much faster. This is also a good test of the filter...if it has a rip or tear in it, it will not fully form the mushroom shape...time to throw it away.

review/text: In January purchased these Kaps for use with the Keurig K-cup machine I got for Christmas.  The individual K-cups are expensive and seem quite wasteful.  Besides I like to use my own selection of coffee.  These caps are easy to use and I have not had any problems with them leaking.  Simply take the foil cover off of a used K-cup then rinse it out with warm water and clean the 'paper' filter using the brush provided.  Refill the K-cup with your own coffee and place the Kap on. (note: the Kap goes on with the lettering facing up) To use the refilled K-cup with the Kap simply line up the hole on the bottom of K-cup with the peg in the Keurig machine.  A K-Cup can be re-used many, many, many times.  I absolutely love these Kaps.  Now I don't feel guilty about using my Keurig every morning.

review/summary: Doesn't work with all models - no disclaimer in description
review/text: I have a B31 mini Keurig and these would not work with it because the entrance needle is off-center and does not go through the hole on these kaps. The description should have said that they will not work in all models, but there was no mention of this.<br /><br />I had been using the foil method and had been waiting for these to come back in stock and the price to go below $10 for 3 (I really only needed one but could only find packs of 3 or more, which gives me 2 spares which I guess is OK since the cat would be sure to play hockey with one and lose it under the stove). So finally I order and eagerly await these, only to be disappointed and have to return them and order something else.<br /><br />Have decided to try instead the DisposaCup Lids which are more expensive, but appear to allow for the machine to punch a hole where it wants to.

review/summary: Really Work!!
review/text: Like most people, I LOVE my Keurig. However, I hate the environmental waste of the K-cups AND I hate that I can't brew my favorite coffees in it. Thus, I have sought several solutions. First stop was the filter sold by Keurig itself. I have played with it for over a month (using paper filters inside of their filter, etc.), but can't get the quality of a K-cup out of it. Disappointing.<br /><br />Then I stumbled on this product. It's a simple concept and simple product. No filters, no contraptions, it's just a cap that fits snugly INSIDE a used K-cup. Simply remove the foil from a used K-cup, then dump the grounds. I rinsed the K-cup and let it dry. Then I used about a scoop and a half of my favorite coffee, pushed the cap into the cup and re-inserted it into my Keurig. (NOTE: It's important that you line up the puncture mark in the bottom of the cup with the needle in the machine, otherwise you will end up with multiple puncture marks and liquid draining out too quickly.) I brewed as usual, and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. They really do produce a K-cup quality cup of coffee! And, K-cups can be re-used several times.<br /><br />One additional note:  When brewing larger quantities of coffee (for travel mug, for example), the prolonged pressure of the water will cause a slight back up of water in the machine. It usually just pools on top of the cap, but one time it ran around the edge of the cup holder. This is a bit annoying, but in my opinion, not tragic since the water can easily be soaked up with a paper towel in a few seconds. At NO point did I have grounds backing up... that might have been a deal breaker because that would be a sloppy mess. A quick clean up is worth the quality of coffee this little product affords!<br /><br />Very happy with this product!

Load the pod about 3/4 full with my favorite coffee, then make sure to put the Kap on correctly (level with print side up).  Use the hole in the bottom of the pod to line up the cup so there are not any more holes drilled, and let 'er rip!  Thank you K-Kaps!!!!

I ground my coffee really fine, packed the KCup, popped on a lid, lined up the hole and ...VOILA!!! I had an excellent, strong cup of coffee, with no leaks, as some have said. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to save money, but don't count on the brush ...I'll go buy a make-up brush for that purpose! That is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: After reading the reviews, this sounded like a cool idea!  Sounded like, doesn't make it so.  They were sloppy and water/coffee dribbled out all over.  At first it was really bad, then after experimenting, I found it was only limitedly messy.  At least the removable cup stand caught all the excess rather than like at first where it spilled all over the counter.  I tried filling the k-cup full with coffee; filling it full and tamping it down; filling it partially - no way worked without a dribbly mess.  It was a lot of extra work, too, rinsing the cups out, letting them dry, filling them, etc.  Hassle!  I liked the idea of using my own coffee cuz we like Starbucks and their k-cups are really expensive.  Now we just buy our k-cups at Sam's Club.  Best price, even beats Costco.  They have several brands and I don't feel guilty throwing away the used cups.  Will save our Starbucks for our "regular" coffee maker when we want a treat.  Maybe someone else had better luck with these caps, but I sure didn't.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I have the mini Keurig. These do not work in that maker and they are such a hassle to get them on the K cup.  I bought some metal ones on amazon that just sit on the top of the K cup and they work like a charm and it takes 5 seconds to do it. I wasted $35 bucks on these plastic cumbersome ones.  Save your money or get the metal ones.

review/summary: Better then expected!!!
review/text: I have never written a product review before but after using this product I felt I had to write one. I had been researching different products so that I could use my own coffee with my Keurig coffee maker. I read so many reviews and narrowed it down to the ekobrew cup and these k kaps. I just got these this week and I have had no problem. Coffee tasted great, no leaking, no coffee grounds in my cup and they are so easy to use. The only thing is that I did not put enough coffee in on my first try and it was really weak so the next time I filled up the k cup almost to the top. I also cut a small square out of foil and put that on the k cup before I put the cap on.(I had read that little trick from another review) It really helps the cap fit snug. Well I hope this helps anyone that is on the fence like I was. They are great & very inexpensive. :)

review/summary: I Love These Kaps!!!!
review/text: I was skeptical in purchasing these in the first place based upon some of the not-so-good-feedback I read on this product.  However, I decided to take a chance and while once in a while they leak, it really is no big deal at all.  Move the cup closer to the front to catch the drip and clean it up when it is done brewing.  Simple.  I tried all the retrofit ideas posted in previous feed back....none of them worked.  I just deal with it and know that I am still spending less than relying on all these new cups all the time.  I originally ordered the three pack and love these so much, I am ordering another larger pack so that I can make more than three at a time.  Don't be afraid to take a chance on this product, unless, of course, you are going to whine about a little leaking periodically.  The only thing I can complain about is this:  does the manufacturing process really cost $10 for three of these little disks?  Probably not.  Could go down in price.  Or maybe I am just jealous that I didn't invent these things and aren't getting paid for it!  Either way, thank you so much for inventing them, dear inventor!!!!

I will limit purchasing K-Cups even though they are by far more convenient, but the ekobrew works without removing the insert on the machine.

review/text: This couldn't be any easier to use.  It works so much better than the Keurig My-Kcup (which doesn't really work well, IMHO)and makes excellent coffee.  A few tips: I use 1/8 cup coffee, ground to an espresso consistency. Don't overfill the cup.  I seem to be able to make the filters last longer if they completely dry between uses.  For those of you who are Dark Magic fans, I have found that Trader Joe's San Francisco Dark brand makes a great substitution.

review/summary: 3 MyKaps with brush
review/text: I bought the 3 My Kaps with the brush. Yes, it does leak<br />and it will leave grounds in the coffee. But they are<br />worth getting only if you wish to reuse the prefilled<br />kcups. I will go back to using my solofill cup which<br />works fine except it is a little hard to get the grounds<br />out of the bottom. I also have the Keurig My Kcup that<br />come with my Keurig. It works great but if you happen<br />to want to use a prefilled kcup it is rather hard to<br />remove. It does brew the coffee well though. If I could<br />do it over I would simply order another solofill or the<br />the Ecobrew cup that seems to be the rage right now.<br />Give the caps a 3 because they do not work as well as the<br />other ground cups.

review/summary: Great, low budget option
review/text: I have been testing this cap with four other cup styles so I can preload cups for the week and use them as I need. I have never figured out how to actually get these caps to stick to the cup. Once in a while one sticks but I am still not able to duplicate that on every cup. Mostly the cap just sits on top of the cup. However, that hasn't affected the performance that I can see. The machine works with them just fine. My coffee tastes great and I have not found grounds in my cup.<br /><br />In all, I think this is a great way to go if you don't have a big budget and don't mind sacrificing a little performance.

The 4 oz size is pretty large, like a large yogurt container.<br />Be careful about forgetting them in your pocket they can stink things up if left there for months.

review/summary: Bad Odor
review/text: In February of 2010 I ordered a 14 oz canister of Pro-Treat Freeze dried chicken liver dog treats.I had been giving another brand of freeze dried chicken liver treats to both my dog and cat. They both loved these treats. When I opened my new Pro-Treats freeze dried liver treats I smelled an odd odor. My cat would not eat these new treats. My dog did eat these treats  but every morning he started throwing up. I stopped giving these treats to my dog and he stopped getting sick. The liver treats may or may not have been responsible for my dog getting sick but I didn't want to take a chance of my dog getting sink again.

review/summary: Better shipped in smaller size container:
review/text: Our dogs and cat love these liver treats. They are solid enough to keep their shape in training pouches, yet soft enough to break into smaller pieces. Unfortunately, because of their softness, when shipped in the larger-size container, the pieces breakdown into dust before arrival, so you really don't get too many more actual pieces than you get with the smaller container.<br /><br />They are "real" rather than processed, and appeal more to the animals that way. They last a long time (at least 2 months). I heartily recommend them.

review/summary: My dogs love it!
review/text: I bought these as a healthier training treat for my dogs.  They absolutely love it!  In fact, they love it so much that I have to post a warning: Dogs love this stuff so much they'll do almost anything to get to it!<br /><br />When this product was delivered we did not hear the delivery van arrive.  As usual he put the box next to our side door.  When we came home later that day, I let the dogs out into the back yard to romp and do their business.  I heard a little growling going on so I went out to check on them to find that the dogs had found the delivered box of treats and proceeded to rip the box open and then they opened the bucket (It's a pretty weak lid but I believe they would have eaten the bucket if the lid didn't come off so easily) and they devoured about 1/3 of the bucket! Three days later, I had this bucket o'treats on top of my buffet where I dispensed it for dog training sessions in the house. (I leave dog treat bags in this spot regularly and they've never tried to take them before.) We were gone for the afternoon and the dogs decided to go counter surfing for it this time and ate a bunch more right out of the bucket.  Because this treat is so rich, they were not feeling well after it happened!  So do not leave this treat out where it can be reached!  It's too tempting for the dogs. And man, oh man, if you need a high value treat to work with your dog this one really does the trick for mine.

review/summary: GREAT INCENTIVE TO GET DOGS EATING DRY FOOD!
review/text: As you have probably read, these treats are not like most others.  You cannot overindulge your pup with them because of their richness.  They are very light, but need to be given SPARINGLY.  I use tiny pieces of these as special treats for my "Charly," who adores them. Want to know a trick?  For those of you trying to get your dogs to eat more dry than wet food, take a few of the liver treats and literally crush the suckers into a powder.  It takes a while to do it in your hands, but you can always use anything in the kitchen to help.  Anyhoo....sprinkle just the bit over the dry dog food and VOILA!  I bet your dog will eat up the bowl.  Again, most dogs ADORE these Stewart's liver treats, so the smallest amount sprinkled will do the trick.<br /><br />My friend is a dog/cat rescuer and turned me onto Stewart's - not only because they are really good, but also because they are made in the U.S.A.  That means a lot when it comes to our pet products.<br /><br />My treats came very fast, too!!!  It's much more economical to get the larger tub and it will last a long, long time.  Or consider sharing wwith another dog lover!
