review/text: No one seems to mention that this stuff isn't even made from any natural ingredients.  The stuff on Hawaii is natural, at least the Li Hing Mui powder I saw in some of the stores there.  This stuff here is about as good for you as MSG.

review/summary: Good knock-off but not the "real deal" Li Hing
review/text: As another member wrote, there's nothing really natural in this product. It's a "knock-off" of the true Li hing you get in Hawaii. This product has aspertame and licorice, two ingredients not in the original formula used all over Hawaii. However, they DO use this brand too in Hawaii, but not at the quality locations.

review/summary: My current favorite hot sauce.
review/text: The main flavor of this sauce is the aged, pickled, Scotch Bonnet peppers. It has a delicious, complex, fruity flavor from these peppers. Although there is some sugar in it (cane sugar, not corn syrup), I think most of the sweetness actually comes from the pepper. I don't know what the scofield rating is, but it's quite  a bit hotter than most readily available hot sauces in the U.S., such as Habanero Tobasco. Unlike a lot of the hotter hot sauces, there is no sacrifice of flavor for heat. It is delicious AND hot.

I've served this at home or when we have guests and it's a total hit every time.  I used to use it mainly as a salad dressing, but there are so many ways to cook with it.  Dip with sushi or veggies.  We've marinated chicken overnight or made Wafu burgers - major BBQ attraction!  They've got more flavors (GINGER CARROT and WASABI EDAMAME), and there is a Light version of ORIGINAL that has 43% less fat if you're counting calories (although the non-Light version is pretty healthy, too).

It is not as fluffy and light as my own recipe, but it is good.<br /><br />One complaint I have is with the packing method.  All three cans were put into one box, and when my package arrived, one of the cans had been crushed, the sealed lid was forced off, and the contents were spilled inside the box.  More packing was needed to prevent the cans from moving around during shipping.

Now, whenever I am outside of the United States, I specifically look for these candy bars (I have eaten it in Europe in a couple of places).  I found a Asian Food Store locally that surprisingly carries it (2 weeks ago).  I am surprised that this is not sold widely on the US Market.<br /><br />This is a chocolate covered honeycombed bar with toffee undertones.  The bar lives up to its name, Crunchy!  The taste is so good it's worth traveling outside of the country for!<br /><br />Cadbury, are your executives reading this?  You need to market this in the United States.  What are you guys waiting for?<br /><br />This is a great candy bar.  You have to try it!<br /><br />Highly recommend!

review/summary: Mmm... One of my all time favorite chocolate bars! :-P~
review/text: For those of you not familiar, "crunchie" bars are solid honeycomb coated with a relatively thin layer of milk chocolate. Personally, I love 'em! They're one of my all time favorite chocolate bars. They're popular both in England and here in Australia where I live.<br /><br />Not much more to say except that you can buy crunchies in a variety of pack sizes (size being determined by the number of bars included), and this 12-pack is kinda mid sized. The larger sized packs generally offer better value. Although prices on Amazon do fluctuate over time, as of the time of writing, this 12-pack will wind up costing you just a fraction of a cent over $1.66 a bar. Weirdly, despite the general "more is cheaper" principle, currently the 6-pack offers significantly better value at under $1.40 a bar. Freaky. So it pays to be a careful shopper!<br /><br />Just don't forget that it's not like these are a health food. So please... However many you buy, enjoy in moderation! ;-)<br /><br />Theo.

They have a mild honey taste, creamy chocolate, and the consistency of Lucky Charms marshmallows. They are very crunchy, like the name suggests, however they are not hard or ruff to the palate. I will have to stock up on these for sure, so I can avoid the trash candy we Americans are provided. I highly recommend this candy. I mean it.

Every review was glowing which sold me on these and made me willing to take a 37.00 chance on 24 candy bars (shipping).<br />Ripped into the box, ripped open a bar, oh man, let me tell you, well, just let me say, Brits, you can keep your health care system AND your Cadbury Crunchies.<br /><br />Serious man, I am only writing this to save some other poor sap of a Yank from thinking that you will like these. Bland bland bland, unless you like the flavor of a bitter burnt sugar center, which is all the flavor the crunchy center has. The chocolate outside is not a sweet chocolate at all, and the only word for it is bland.<br /><br />I am glad to take this rating down a notch or two, as it deserves to be. Keep looking, don't stop here if you want something good and interesting. Seriously, move along folks, there is nothing to see here.

review/summary: Tastes like Cracker Jacks
review/text: I prefer it dry as a snack although some pieces are hard and large enough to make one think it could break a tooth. A caution is one cup has 200 calories and trust me it would be easy to eat 2-3 times that amount while mindlessly watching a movie. This specific cereal does has quite a bit of sugar which could be reduced without any negative flavor effects. It also has 8 grams of fiber if you are trying to get 20-30 grams per day. This is my second favorite Kashi cereal with Kashi U Cereal, Black Currants & Walnuts being number one. I think Kashi in general makes wonderful products (okay some of their "bars" aren't so hot)and though most aren't organic, I think their brand is safer and healthier than most other non-organic brands.

review/summary: Heinz Genuine Dill pickles
review/text: Had hoped this pickle was the old "processed dill pickle ".  Kind we knew back in the 1940s and 1950s... until America fell in love with "kosher dill " and " Polish dill  " pickles that are overloaded with garlic. Processed dills would be roughly equivalent to the flavor of Heinz's sliced, hamburger pickles today.<br /><br />This Heinz, Pickle Genuine Dill is what we would have called a " SOUR DILL " pickle in the old days. Nothing wrong with that. BUT ! I WANTED REGULAR, PROCESSED DILL PICKLES. This was not it.<br /><br />Should note - the color and crispness and smaller size of these pickles was excellent. Just not the flavor that home pickling in the Depression and War years produced. Will keep searching .... or try to make my own ... if I only could find the old recipes.

I got two other chocolate varieties (Mint Chocolate Cookie and Chocolate Turtle), a Fudge Marble and a Caramel Capuccino.

However I might bump up the star rating once I've ate the ice cream.<br /><br />Update<br />Nothing special about the ice cream. Not bad, but no better than store-bought stuff and a heck of a lot more expensive.

I heard birds singing and violins playing.....a bread/cracker without added sugar....heaven.  Upon further inspection these little crackers also provided 5 g of protein and 4 grams of fiber and each cracker sheet is only 100 calories. Now were talking, plus they had cheese and I have yet to meet a cheese product I don't like.  I had one of these hefty crackers with my Cioppino for lunch and I was not disappointed.  It was hearty and tasty with just a tease of cheese.  Very satisfying and could see using them in place of bread with the some turkey or tuna salad.  And better yet they are less expensive in bulk purchased at Amazon.

review/summary: Not Sure About Energy, But Does Fix Hunger Fast
review/text: I fell for these bars when I was pregnant and was constantly hungry. The worst time for me was nighttime. Already awake for potty breaks, I didn't want to waste any more of my precious sleep time trying to fix and eat a filling, healthy, tasty snack. Snickers Marathon bars were ideal: high in protein, low enough on sugar (I didn't have gestational diabetes, but was cautious anyway), and super fast to prepare - just unwrap and open your mouth!<br /><br />As far as taste, I really loved these - even with the strange cravings and aversions of pregnancy. To me, they taste like your traditional Snickers (chocolate, caramel, peanut) met a typical granola bar (crispy crunchy texture), and they had a delicious affair, producing their love child, the Snickers Energy Marathon bar. Because they're so dense, I was able to snack on one for hours (of course, my squished stomach helped me feel fuller faster too). A few bites plus a small glass of milk was perfect.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these bars. It's hard to find a high-protein, low-sugar bar, and one that tastes good too? Almost impossible.  Now that I'm not pregnant, I still stash these in my diaper bag for fast fuel, and nibble on them when I'm up nursing at midnight.  I think anyone looking for a quick, filling snack should give these a try.

review/summary: Agave "Nectar" is a scam
review/text: from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word "Agave" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as "diabetic friendly". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing," said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. "Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses", she told me. "Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.

review/text: Agave is the best thing next to a slice of homemade bread. I use it in place of reg. white sugar. My mother is a type 2 diabetic and with agave she can have a full piece of her favorite Thanksgiving desert pumkin pie with no raise in her blood sugar. There is light and dark versions just like in maple syrup. I prefer the dark especially in baking and cooking I think it has more flavor. Try it in your oatmeal with cinnamon. You eat oatmeal because it is good for you so why not make it even better, trade brown sugar or yucky artificial sugar for a more healthy natural alternative.

review/text: Agave is very sweet and very mild, like corn syrup. If I have fruit that is a little bitter, I cut it up and put it in a bowl and then use 1/2 tbsp of agave for the whole bowl - stir well. The fruit loses the bitterness.<br /><br />The best about agave is that it will dissolve in cold liquids. So, if your iced tea is not sweet enough, a squirt of agave will dissolve in it. No stirring forever trying to get sugar or honey to dissolve.<br /><br />I use this instead of corn syrup in my cooking. I make sweet tea with it. It is very sweet and you don't need to use a lot. This is an excellent sweetener.

review/summary: Better than sugar or honey!
review/text: I have become a huge fan of agave nectar! It doesn't crystallize, like honey, and I use much less to sweeten my hot drinks. I also use it as a sweetener on cereal. I saw on TV that you can use it with sparkling water to create a healther soda, so I'll probably try that as well! Yum!

review/summary: Excellent Low Glycemic Sweetener
review/text: Agave is the best sweetener I have found.  There is no after taste and being low glycemic it helps avoid a "sugar rush".  It works great as "syrup" on pancakes or waffles.  It's perfect in tea.  And my wife uses it in baking.

review/summary: it's mostly fructose
review/text: I ordered a 6 pack of this and then started reading more indepth about what's in it.  Since then, five bottles have been sitting in my trunk, but I can't think of who to give it away to.  It's really kind of depressing because I had such high hopes for it because of the low glicemic index - and Madhava sounds like a great company.  So, I don't want to ding their product over other forms of agave nectar.<br /><br />It does taste GREAT and goes well in coffee.  And, since fructose is 1.4 times sweeter than sugar, yes, you can use less of it and consumer fewer calories than table sugar for the same amount of sweetness.  You might think that's good for weight loss.. and because of the high incidence of diabetes in my family, I thought the low glycemic index was good, too.<br /><br />Then I saw "Sugar: the bitter truth" on youtube.  Seriously, watch the whole thing.  You're looking at this because you want a healthy alternative to sugar and high-fructose corn syrup.  This isn't it.<br /><br />Table sugar is half fructose and half glucose.  Agave nectar is 95% fructose.  Refined fructose is about as toxic to your liver as alcohol.  Fructose can only be processed by the liver in a process that ends up creating uric acid (leads to gout), Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (cirrhosis similar to being an alcoholic), VLDL cholesterol (the worst kind), increase your Triglycerides, liver insulin resistance, blocks hormones (lectin) that tell you you're full, and cause hypertension due to it's diminishment of nitrous oxide in your blood (which is what lets you regulate your blood pressure). And, according to this film, 30% of the calories end up as fat.  So - you take in fewer calories because it's sweeter, but end up storing a larger percentage as fat.  And you end up hungrier in the long run, so - if it doesn't make you fat, the increase in appetite might.<br /><br />Their own FAQ does cover these topics, and as a counterpoint, they do mention FDA studies that go along with fructose being safe, etc.  [...]  Most of these are why I started looking into why people might be asking these questions of their products.<br /><br />At this point, I'm trying to use Stevia.  The first brand I bought was pretty nasty.  The second, based on recommendations was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevia Supreme - 50 pack</a>.  It's pretty good at about 1 packet per two cups of water.  Good in tea as it's more herb than sweet.  Sadly, I haven't been able to find a great ratio of Stevia to use in coffee and I'm a huge coffee drinker.<br /><br />Agave has been the best tasting sweetener in my coffee so far.

review/summary: Agave Nectar is better than sugar
review/text: I have been using Mudhava Agave Nectar for about a year and have eliminated my low blood sugar problem.  It tastes great as a syrup for pancakes, cooked in foods or in tea/coffee.  Since I have Celiac disease(gluten intolerance), I have to make everything I eat from scratch.  This nectar really works great in recipes. Also the low glycemic value is good for people on the low carb diet so I can use this for another member of my family.

review/summary: Excellent sweeterner at an excellent price!
review/text: Agave is a low glycemic sweetner so it doesn't affect your blood sugar the way that honey, sugar, or corn syrup affect blood sugar.  My wife and I use it almost exclusively now.  The amber is a little darker than the type we used to get from the "bulk-co" store, but we quite like the taste.  Madhava agave is certified organic as well.  The price for subscribe and save, is significantly cheaper than from a grocery store or club store.

review/summary: Love this!
review/text: I like the stronger flavor of the amber Madhava Organic Agave Nectar.  My son-in-law likes the lighter, with its milder taste, but whichever you prefer, Madhava is the leader.  Because I use it a lot, and find the 23.5 bottles easier to handle than larger bottles, the 6-pack suits me just fine.  The flip top makes it even more convenient.  An odd benefit of using Agave Nectar is that while it is sweeter than sugar and has slightly more calories than sugar per tsp. it is lower on the GI Scale!  You can use it just as you would use honey, but I like the flavor better, and there's no aftertaste.  I like to use it on pancakes as well as in tea or cooking/baking.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone who has a sweet tooth!

Try it in vanilla or hazelnut iced coffee -- awesome! It's also great on hot cereal.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great way to get off the diet soft drink.
review/text: I have been addicted to Coke Zero for as long as it has been available. I just had to have my Coke (3-6 12 ounce) bottles per day. That is a lot of chemicals! I started adding the light Agave Nector to my coffee on 12/21/10 and have not had another diet soda. It doesn't taste the same. Now when I feel a need for for a soda, I have hot tea with the Agave Nector or plain water. I now drink a lot more water as I feel I need it. I am a type 2 diabetic and have had no fluctuations with my blood sugars since adding the Agave. I can find it at my local grocery store in the organic foods section for a fair price. I am so excited my craving for sugar and diet sodas are gone. I share this with all who will listen.

Even more amazing, my three teens and husband agree! My personal experience has been that I desire sweets a lot less.  I'm not a scientist but I think it's because it has a low glycemic level so I make less insulin. I really feel better.

I like the lower glycemic index, the fact it's sweet as any sugar or honey and it's safe for babies compared to honey.  It's a better "sugar" and does have health benefits as well as being organic.  You can't go wrong if you use agave nectar.  I prefer the dark because it has a richer flavor.  Also Madhava is my preferred brand.  I've tried others and they just don't seem to have the fullness of flavor.

review/summary: Easier to use than honey
review/text: If you like something that dissolves more quickly than hard sugars in your teas or coffees but are tired of spraining your wrists trying to get that honey bear to cooperate, agave is a good choice.<br /><br />The consistency of this agave nectar is much more liquid than honey, so it dissolves quickly and is easy to dispense.  However, it's easy to add too much if you're used to honey!<br /><br />Overall, I thought the agave was best in red teas compared to black teas.  It has its own flavor and, much like different varieties of honey, I don't find it compatible with everything.  Still, if you have a substantial tea or coffee collection you're likely to find several that are agave's soulmate.<br /><br />Amazon's price is incredibly reasonable compared to what this exact brand of agave nectar costs at my local Whole Foods.

review/text: This is a great sweetener!  Amber agave nectar, when tasted directly, has a flavor similar to honey.  In my coffee, it only sweetens; it does not change the coffee flavor.  The nectar flows more freely than honey, but not as easily as maple syrup.  As others have noted, it does not crystalize, so, you will not have to 'melt' it in the microwave.  Worth repeating: this is a great sweetener!

review/summary: Sweet but certainly not healthy
review/text: I was disappointed to find that Agave Nectar is not the healthy product I envisioned when purchased.  Apparently their claim of not spiking blood sugar is inaccurate.  There is more high fructose corn syrup in Agave Nectar than in honey.  Buy it because you like the taste, not for the claims.<br /><br />However, I will say that it is much easier to use than honey, doesn't crystalize like honey, and gives your baking a darker sweet taste.  Use sparingly, it is very sweet.  Made chocolate chip cookies with it and they were yummy.  Did spike blood sugar though.<br /><br />Don't believe everything a manufacturer claims until you try it for yourself.

review/summary: Would not use any other sweetener
review/text: I have been using the Fat To Skinny Zero sweetener for almost a year now.  It is the only sweetener I ever use in my morning coffee, and I would never use anything else.  I used to use Sweet N Low, but there were too many stories about side effects.  Some of the others don't taste that bad, but have higher carb counts.  ZERO is the only one I have found that tastes great, is safe to use, AND has zero carbs.  With that combination of benefits, it's the only one I ever use.  And even though I use it literally every day, a single bottle lasts me about 4 months.  I lost 80 pounds using the "Fat To Skinny" way of eating, and this product is a great way to stay on that track.  Highly recommended.
