review/summary: Yummy on the go!
review/text: I bought these smoothies for my 22 month old daughter.  I was looking for something that would be great to take along for car trip or outing away from home.  These are great!  The strawberry banana is delicious.  I tried them too, and I think they're really good.  No mess, convenient and yummy.  Best of all they are great in the fridge or at room temp.  No refrigeration required until they're opened, which I haven't had to do because she gobbles it all up in one sitting!  Good job Earths Best!

review/text: My little boy loves these who will be 2 next month!  They are great for trips because they don't have to be refridgerated.  But if we are home I keep them in the fridge for him.  Also they are $1.99 each at the grocery store and with subscribe and save these are only about $1.40 a piece.  Great value!

review/summary: More good stuff for kids
review/text: Keep your toddlers hydrated and happy in the car or while waiting with these smoothies. The pouch style combines the ability to drink the juice the way a bottle would be used without resorting to the actual bottle. It is ready to go, so pack a few in strategic spots. If it didn't have Ernie on it screaming "I am a drink for kids!" I would drink them myself!

review/summary: Kids liked these
review/text: Although it comes down to a matter of taste, I suppose, my kids (all four of them) didn't like these as much as the apple blueberry ones. They still ate them, but weren't as big of fans on our trips to the beach in recent 90 degree weather. I definitely recommend refrigerating them before serving, as they liked them better cold than room temperature, but I think they would still have eaten them. They are great for a clean, healthy-ish snack for field trips and I will surely buy them again for lunches and such, as they are a nice pantry staple when we are out of fresh fruits.

review/text: I originally bought a couple of these from babies-R-us for my 16month old daughter to have as a snack when we went to sea world. I figured it was healthy and something she can hold onto and feed herself, since ya know at this age they are getting oh so independent and want to do everything for themselves!! She loves them! We now buy them by the case from amazon because buying them individually from babies-r-us is just a little expensive, and here you get a pack of 12 for $17! Being a first time mom I have tried and failed with a lot of things for her snacks so now I actually taste everything that I give her and hey even I would eat these as a snack!!

review/text: My 17 month old loves each and every flavor of the Earth's Best Organic Fruit Yogurt Smoothie.  I nursed her for 15 months, and since weaning, she has never really liked to drink milk.  I love how this is a wholesome ORGANIC milk product that contains 25% of the daily recommended amount of Calcium. She would literally eat 12 of these a day if I let her!  These are a staple in our pantry and have a fantastic shelf life.  The price on Amazon with subscribe and save is decent if you can't find it on sale anywhere else.  Highly recommend ALL of the flavors as a quick breakfast or a healthy snack!

review/summary: Awesome "to-go" snack for toddlers
review/text: This is a perfectly healthy, portable and vitamin packed snack for toddlers.  My one year old loves them.  I wish the cap was just a tad bigger because the first thing he wants to do is play with it, however (much like the warning on the product says) it is too small and poses a chocking hazzard.  I love that he can either squeeze it himself or just suck the yogurt out of the opening.  The size is appropriate, for a snack, and the ease of just tossing into the diaper bag can't be beat.  It's a better deal to order on Amazon (especially subscribe and save) than purchasing in the grocery store, but still a slightly high priced snack.

She crawled all over me reaching for it, and wanted to drink the whole thing instantly. At one point she snatched it out of my hand! I've decided to reserve it for special occasions, because I really think she might lose the taste for her other food if I give her too much of this stuff!

It was so bad I had to get my husband and older kids to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't just off. We all agreed - this gnarly concoction tastes like yogurt perfume!

The rocks are bigger than I expected but they were in pretty bad shape. Most of the rocks were fused together and you cannot even see the strings on most of them. I cannot even tell if they all have strings in them. Most of the strings were broken into small pieces. Besides the size of the individual rocks themselves I was not very happy with this product.

review/text: I grew up eating octopus, both fresh and canned. Finding it is difficult to impossible in Minnesota. I enjoyed this product although I wish Amazon had the one marinated in its own ink. Certainly an acquired taste, but one that seafood lovers should try. You can try it in an omelet with vegetables and topped with sour cream and marjoram or for a very fast meal, add to leftover rice, along with other sea foods, vegetables and a bit of liquid-a lazy person's Paella.

review/summary: Delicious, alone or cooked in a dish
review/text: I love Vigo's canned octopus and both the marinade or oil packed is wonderful alone as an exotic snack or cooked in a dish.  Here is how I cook it, I empty the can into a medium heated sauce pan and when the marinade/oil is hot add drained canned garbonzo beans and saute till the garbanzo beans are soft and tender and have absorbed the yummy liquids flavoring them like the octopus, during the process I add either fresh sliced green onions, or onion powder, a little garlic, mushrooms and you can add chopped green or red bell peppers or fresh chopped tomatos or both for color.  Makes a nice large meal full of protein and flavor.  The tender octopus goes so well with the garbanzo beans, which really extend the flavor and the meal.  Serve with rice or noodles and for veggies steam or stir fry the ones you like best as a side.<br /><br />I always tell my friends this is a can't lose gift if they want to send me something for my birthday or the holidays.  I love it so and can't get it locally at all.  Yum!

review/text: On my personal scale of 0(worst) to 5 (best), I have tasted this octopus and rated it as follows IMHO: presentation-visual appeal 3/5; Odor 2/5; Quantity of meat/fullness in can 3/5; Taste 3/5 and Texture 5/5.<br />I'd rather recommend the Vigo marinated mussels (not the octopus) as they are much superior taste-wise with rice. I kind of agree with the 'ammonia taste' comment of another reviewer regarding the Vigo marinated Octopus, unfortunately. More wine/vinegar in the octopus marinade would have been needed.<br />ADDENDUM January 2012:<br />Suggested recipe: marinate drained content in balsamic vinegar and lemon juice: delicious! Ammonia taste vanishes and makes this octopus a luxury treat for connoisseurs!

review/text: Picked up a case of this to see how it compares to the Goya brand octopus I can get locally. It doesn't! It tastes of ammonia - as if the cannery stuffed rotting octopus in here. The only other time I've tasted ammonia in seafood was when I was in a cheap seafood buffet in a Biloxi casino.

review/summary: refreshing clean flavor
review/text: I've been on a diet that involves drinking a lot of tea for about the past month. -14 pounds :)  English number one is is my most popular black Ahmad tea flavor. The other teas I've been drinking are green Jasmine tea very good flavor, and my most popular, blackcurrant fruity and fun, original green, green mint two thumbs up, green lemon I like this because it's convenient, but I'd rather use fresh lemon juice and put it in plain green tea.have also been drinking Earl Grey. I find Ahmad flavors are consistent and without an overpowering bitter taste that I find in some other brands. I use word bitter in describing some other teas, because I cannot describe the flavor. That's why I say Ahmad has a clean flavor, a smooth flavor, not a contort your face flavor. I think any tea would work on my diet. My diet has consisted of no white flour, no hydrogenated oils, no sugar. Pretty easy to follow.

review/summary: Best English Tea You Can Find
review/text: I have been searching for a good brand of English tea here in the US for some time.  I have tried just about every brand available here, PG Tips, Lipton, Twinngs etc. but nothing really satisfied me.  I found Ahmad Tea in the convenience store during a trip to Italy and was really impressed with the taste.  When I returned I was thrilled to see that Amazon had it available, and my search for tea was over!<br /><br />What I like Ahmad tea is that it has a stronger flavor which goes very well with milk.  It's the perfect tea for breakfast.  The other teas I mentioned are very bland compared to Ahmad.  If you like bold, rich flavor, give this a try.  It also goes well with desserts after dinner.  It balances out the sweetness of the dessert perfectly.  I will be stocking boxes of this tea in my house.

review/text: My cousin in Texas recommended this tea, and she was right.  She said, "This is the best tea you have ever tasted."  I'm not much of a tea drinker, but there are times when a pot of tea is an excellent idea, and that's how I first tasted it.  I add nothing to my tea, and the Ahmad was delicious.  Really delicious!<br />But this is where it became excellent:  I used it for iced tea.  Clear, wonderful and mellow tea taste, it is now my only iced tea ingredient!  If you're an Earl Grey lover, turn your head away--this stuff is better than English Breakfast Tea.

review/summary: Rudy Greens Chicken and Veggie ROCKS!!
review/text: Our canine family is definitely on the RGDC kick at mealtime!!  We have three "kids," Sturgis-the-Wonder-Peke, Bobette (aka Alien-Love-Child), and Ellie Mae Dobby Diana (our little rescue mix), who tolerated their dry food, but we could tell it wasn't something they got uber-excited about.  Yes, they'd eat it, but no one seemed to be doing the happy dance prior to meal-time.  Well, except for EMDD, who spent her first year being horribly neglected.  She does the happy dance for just about anything now that her life has turned around.  Anyway, the first time I put just a small spoonful of RGDC's over their dry food, our trio made it perfectly clear that this was absolutely the BEST food they've ever had!  Noses buried in their bowls, tails wagging while they ate, and not a drop or morsel left behind!!  Now, I am notified early every morning by Sturgis that it's time to get up and make breakfast.  And in the afternoon, he does the same thing.  EMDD makes us dizzy with her spinning happy dance.  And Bobette simply hops around (which, for her very low-key self is almost as strenuous as kick-boxing).  Meals vanish in record time!  I've realized that if we ever stop adding RGDC to mealtime, I will have a canine hunger strike staged in my kitchen.  There simply is no going back!!  Bravo to RGDC for bringing "delicious" back to dog bowls!!

review/summary: Very pleased with Chinese Elm Bonsai - Looks beautiful !
review/text: Since the last review here is over 2 years old and since just 2 weeks ago (March 2010)I received a Brussel's Nursery Chinese Elm, I thought it timely to add my $.02 worth. I received my Brussel's Chinese Elm and it was packed very, very well. In fact it was a bit of a task to extract it from the tight fitting packing box. The tree and pot were undamaged and beautiful. One reviewer complained the tree did not look like the picture...well..of course not. Such living products are represented with a typical sample. My Brussel's Bonsai was a gift so I cannot truly say what the other reviewer saw beforehand or in their mind felt they would receive. I have spoken to Brussel's on the phone and IMHO they are a first rate Bonsai nursery (in Olive Branch,Mississippi) and are very dedicated to the Bonsai art form. My Chinese Elm is now 2 weeks old (even though it is a 10 yr old tree)and is doing well..no complaints here. I plan to grow it indoors under T5 bulbs...

review/text: My husband enjoyed his Brussels Chinese Elm bonsai.  He immediately went out to show it to his friends and family, in which a lot of people told him to stop trying to imitate Mr. Miyagi from the Karate Kid movies! They just hate the fact that he was given one as a gift for Valentines, but no one has ever seen one up close and personal.  The only issue with the plant was during shipping the beautiful pot that it came in was broken and he had to quickly tansfer the tree into a regular looking flower pot.  Other than that, we give the entire experience with our Elm a 10!

We got it 6 years ago, and in the interim we've had several times where we've lapsed on the care to the point of causing it to lose all its leaves - but each time, it bounced back and was just gorgeous.  We've had a lot of joy from it, and it's been, frankly, really hard to kill.

review/summary: Not just for kids...
review/text: These little balls of crunchy fruitiness are a nice contrast to the dull flavored Fruit Loops that kids gobble up like candy.  I had those a few weeks ago (after years of passing them in the supermarket) and was completely underwhelmed.  My daughters asked for these new Trix and I gave in rather begrudgingly.  I'm a Fruity Pebbles kind of guy, and so I often regard other fruity cereals as inferior.  These guys are really good though.  They actually taste very similar to Fruity Pebbles except they are firmer and don't get all soggy in your milk (although I've never had a problem with soggy pebbles).  With the right amount of fruity flavor and a nice crunch on the teeth, not to mention a surprisingly low calorie count, these Trix are not just for your kids; adults can enjoy these as well!

review/text: I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!

When my oldest (male) was younger, he would sit down, stand up, go down, roll over, etc. and do every trick in his repertoire before I even gave him a command whenever I pulled out a bag of the liver biscotti.  My female also loves this but she's a little less silly.  Also, this has never upset their stomachs nor caused allergic reactions.  I finally had to find a place that sold this in bulk (i.e., 5 lbs. bags) since I was going to the store ALL the time to buy more of these.  I also stuff their Kongs with a combo of these and their regular kibble and some pumpkin and freeze it. I highly recommend this treat.

They last longer than most snacks and because our bullies don't often chew their food, these are the perfect size.  I don't feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers.

I like them for 2 reasons..my dog can't just "woof them down", she has to chew them, so they last..and I like that the cruchiness may be good for her teeth. The treats are small, but again, are crunchy...I'm glad I found these. She loves them and I like giving them to her.

review/summary: Excellent dog treats.
review/text: I have two dogs that absolutely love these treats!  The 5lb bag size that I purchased is very convenient and long lasting.  The vendor that I purchased them from is very thorough; several emails were sent updating me on the status of my order and it's upcoming delivery. The price was extremely reasonable.  The best part is the fact that my pups adore these treats and they are good for them to nibble on throughout the day.  A guilt free doggie reward!

THERE IS NO WAY THAT IT COST THEM $10 TO SHIP A 5LB BAG OF TREATS TO ME.  $6 DOLLARS WOULD BE FAIR AND ACCURATE, THIS IS THE REASON I GAVE IT ONLY 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5

review/summary: Liver Biscotti rules in our house
review/text: The ultimate treat for dogs of all sizes.  Our dogs are absolutely crazy for Liver Biscotti.  We love the size of this treat, it makes it very easy to use them as daily treats and not worry that you are over feeding.  The size is also great for using as bait for conformation showing.<br /><br />We love the fact that all natural ingredients with no preservatives are used.  All you have to do is open the bag and smell what's inside.  It smells so good, you might be tempted to try one too.<br /><br />We love the 5 pound bag.  Having multiple dogs, this bag really is a cost saver.  You'll see significant savings over buying the small 8oz bags.<br /><br />It also makes a great gift for your dog loving/owning friends, spread the joy of Liver Biscotti!

review/text: This was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbs.<br />Maybe my dog is just spoiled, but she treats these like third class treats- it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat hierarchy.  More often than not, she will simply walk away from these.  Glad other people like them, but I will not be buying them again.

review/summary: English Afternoon Tea by Ahmad
review/text: A few years ago we travelled to Bermuda.  I like to try different teas so I bought 2 small boxed of Ahmad English Afternoon Tea.  I enjoyed the flavor so much I started searching for it in local stores to no avail.  Friends then travelled to Bermuda and brough me back 10 boxed. They did not last long.  English Breakfast teas are easy to find but the flavor of the Afternoon tea is wonderful.  Worth a try for any tea lover.  I am happy to have found it available from Amazon.com.

review/text: I first bought Ahmad tea in London in 2005.  I have been searching for some ever since.  Who knew you could buy this on Amazon.com?  Anyway, when I searched the internet, I found a couple of sources.  I think they must have run out during the time I was placing my order.  At any rate, I love the taste of this particular tea.  It keeps me going after a long day when I get home around 4:30 PM.  Try it!  It is quite refreshing!

review/summary: Whole Family Enjoys, Just like Twinings English Afternoon
review/text: We all enjoy this robust, slightly fragrant English Afternoon tea. It doesn't get bitter like some teas do. It actually tastes quite similiar to Twinings English Afternoon with a lower cost. I wish that I had noticed this can be purchased in a 150 bag quantity encased in a pretty airtight tin container before I had purchased this. We like this Ahmad tea enough that we are going to try the other Ahmad flavors next. I actually like Twinings English Breakfast better than English Afternoon, so I'm looking forward to trying English tea number 1 this week when it arrives. Amazon ships the teas quickly.

Couldn't wait to buy more, was so glad Amazon had it.<br /><br />The fragrance of the tea is wonderful, like a lush garden after a rain shower.<br />The taste is just as wonderful and smooth. Just make sure to follow the steeping recommendations on the box, as it does become quite strong and slightly bitter if left to steep more than 4 minutes.<br /><br />This tea is especially tasty with cream and sweetener--if that's your preferance.

Wonderful aroma, flavor. I cannot wait for my order to be delivered, this tea is so yummy. Would make a great gift for the tea lover in your life, add to a gift basket, etc.<br /><br />Discovering teas I have never had before is a delightful experience.  I stopped drinking coffee years ago because of the acid reflux and teas, wonderful teas are there.<br /><br />Try some, you won't be sorry..Now that the summer is over, give yourself the luxury of relaxing with a mug of it. I drink tea without adding anything to it. This is one of those teas...<br /><br />ENJOY EVERYONE...

review/text: When I bought these soups initially (several months ago), I saw the one review. But what that reviewer said about not needing to doctor the soups up for them to be good, really struck a cord with me as that is what I have always needed to do with any soup mixes I had used prior. I also really liked that they only take 20 minutes to make. You can let them stew if you want, but 20 minutes makes a wonderful tasting soup. They have chunky vegis and are very flavorful. I totally love these soups. I have now bought them several times & when ordering again today I thought I needed to also review this great find. I have tried several soup mixes on amazon.com & the Leonard Mountain soups are my favorite by far! 5+ stars :)

review/summary: Not So Souper After All
review/text: For all the hype these Leonard Mountain dry soups have gotten, they sure did disappoint. I have made 6 varieties now (sitting here with a bowl of the Chicken Pasta as I type), and they were consistently bad...even though I followed the package directions EXACTLY. Maybe that was the problem - I followed the package directions. None were done in 20 minutes. ("edible" in 20 minutes - yes; worth paying xx dollars for it - no; worth calling it "gourmet" - no.) And one reviewer called the veggies "chunky" - really? Wonder what kind of soup they're used to if they think these soups are chunky.<br /><br />My advice: Lipton instant soup will give you just about the same salty, overseasoned experience as these Leonard Mountain mixes, but for a lot cheaper. Of course, Liption instant soup doesn't purport to call itself "gourmet" like LM does.<br /><br />My real advice: Want a "real" soup that REALLY only takes 20 minutes? Throw some stock (canned broth will work too) in a pot and let it boil, then toss in some fresh veggies (frozen if you want), pre-cooked meat (or raw shrimp), pasta if you want it, canned beans if you want them, and cook until the veggies are the way you like them. Season to taste with just salt and pepper, or add garlic and/or onion powder. Green herbs are great too if you know how to use them.<br /><br />If you're using a crockpot (which I do all the time), do the same thing except wait until the last 30 minutes to toss in the pre-cooked meat. You could also get away with dried beans in a crockpot.<br /><br />In any case, fresh soup only takes 20 minutes to begin with, so these LM soups aren't saving anyone any time.<br /><br />I will NEVER buy these again. EVER. If I need convenience, I'd rather buy canned soup than these.

review/summary: Need a little doctoring, but still great!
review/text: My family uses these all the time.  We buy a rotisserie chicken and after removing the wings and drumsticks, we shred it and throw it in the crock pot with these soups.  We use chicken broth instead of water.  Some of them do need some extra spice, but I still feel like they are much easier than other prepared soup.  The big difference between Leonard Mt soups and other packaged soups is the sodium content.  I cannot find anything out there with such low sodium.  So, I add a little chili powder, cumin, bacon, etc and they are delish.  We use the potato chive the most and sub half milk half chicken broth and add bacon bits.

review/summary: Love chocolate and pretzels, but not as good as I hoped.
review/text: When I saw the new Pretzel M&M's in my local store, I had to try a pack because I love chocolate coated pretzels, and generally M&M's come out with great special flavors.<br /><br />Overall, these where just okay, the biggest problem to me was the chocolate layer seemed thinner than on similar products (such as the almond, peanut, or peanut butter M&M's). Why is that a problem? Less chocolate means you taste the sweet, sugary shell more, so the over-all taste of this candy was sweeter than I would have liked.<br /><br />The bit was very good, the ball of pretzel in the middle was very crunchy but not too hard and had a nice touch of saltiness.<br /><br />In the end, its worth trying a pack if you like chocolate pretzels, but I found it too sugary tasting, which overpowered the flavor of the chocolate. I am sure kids would really love this one though, I know part of the reason I love M&M's is all the childhood memories of this candy line (I miss the old color palette!)<br /><br />I am  not sure I would buy them again, but I don't regret trying them!
