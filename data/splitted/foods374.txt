review/summary: Terrific treats!
review/text: I have 2 dogs, and they love these. One of my dogs is choicy and he barks when he wants a treat. If I give him the wrong one, he ups the barking. When I give him this, he gets down to chewing. He chews the coating off first and eats that.

review/text: Margarita, my 15 year old Scottish Fold, has always been a picky eater, but it's gotten much worse in the last couple years. She's practically skin and bones now. I've tried every kind of natural cat food on the market (I won't feed my animals the major brands) and this is her absolute favorite.

review/text: This comes with the water it was boiled on.  I drained the water immediately after opening it.  The peanuts are soaked and saturated in brown water, the same natural color when you boil your own peanuts.  It is not a re-closeable pouch so you would need to transfer the content if you cannot finish it in one sitting.<br /><br />Too salty.  I don't know if it is as a preservative, but it is a bit much.<br /><br />The big W store sells this for three bucks a pouch.

review/summary: Dog with Allergies
review/text: These are the best rawhide chews for dogs with allergies. My westie is always chewing his feet and I've tried everything to ease his discomfort. It is especially bad when he chews on a treat because after he finishes, he can still smell the scent on his paws and continues to lick! It used to drive us crazy, until we tried these natural rawhide chews. My husband purchased these at a local drugstore when we got our new westie puppy and needed to give her something for teething. Needless to say our older male dog wanted to join in the fun! We gave him one and we were so relieved that when it was gone, he was done, no licking or chewing after the fact. I can't find them anywhere anymore except on Amazon. This is my second order of multiple packs. Whoops, I shouldn't have shared the secret, now all of you will buy them all up!

review/summary: Picky cat loved this!
review/text: I've spent years trying to figure out what my cat likes.  I thought I had narrowed it down to chicken, but he eventually got sick of that too.  Based on previous purchases I was sure he hated all seafood except for tuna water.  Being that Tiki has a lot of tuna mixes, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Amazingly, he loved it!  I was really surprised since the brand of chicken he likes also makes quite a few seafood varieties that he did not like.  For whatever reason, he seems to enjoy every seafood variety in this pack (but not so much the chicken, as it's a lot drier in comparison to his usual chicken in gravy). He's still insanely picky and doesn't like the same food several days in a row, but I can combine even a little bit of this with his other foods and he'll eat it.  Very happy with this find!!

I switched brands, this, that, the other and no food seemed to help. This is the only brand that keeps him in good trim, with no dry heaves. It's basically fish or chicken, fish oil and that's about it. There are a few varieties with a bit of rice.<br /><br />The food looks like tuna or chicken salad and the cat LOVES it. I am sure I gave him extra years of life by putting him on this food.

review/summary: My Cat loves this stuff...
review/text: My 13-year old male cat has been a non-fish eater his whole life. I decided to upgrade the quality of his food and bought a sample pack of Tiki Cat. He went wild. There is quite a variety and he favored some much more than others. But the best way to find out is get a sample pack and see what he/she likes.<br />Theres a variety of tuna combinations, calimari, sardines, mackeral, lobster and crab. The fish is very fresh and apparently fished in low mercury oceans so you can relax about the amount you feed your kitty.<br />Our cat now demands fish nearly every day. We still feed him other high-quality cat foods, but most of the time...it's Tiki.

review/summary: Too much fish for a variety pack, but....
review/text: I bought this variety pack so my cats could try the chicken flavors without fish, but they hated it. However, they did like a couple of flavors...so I will order those (if I can remember which ones! argh)<br /><br />My BIG questions/concern: the fine print on the bottom of each can says "feed one can for every 3 lbs of bodyweight daily"...<br /><br />One of our cats weights 16 lbs (Maine Coon) and the other, 12 lbs, so I will need to feed a total of 9 cans/day. (who can afford that?) This MUST be wrong info?<br /><br />What cat would eat that much food in one day?<br /><br />Makes me question the company. (they also included one flavor that had menadione sodium bisulfate - a known carcinigen - listed on the can, but when I called I was assured they eliminated that from all flavors last year, and that they just haven't "caught up" with new labels yet.  hmmmmm.<br /><br />If you are feeding this food, do YOU feed according to the label instructions?<br /><br />I've been feeding/offering 1-2 cans of Fancy Feast Classic/day to my 2 cats, but they never finish it.<br /><br />Why do I need to almost triple that amount of Tiki Cat?  (I do put out high quality (40% protein) kibble 24/7.  A good quality, high protein kibble fills up cats in all the right ways, so one expects them to eat less. My cats only eat 1/2 cup of kibble/day (that's total for both, not each cat!)  Seems way too little, but they maintain their weight just fine on it and the FF. So, I have to wonder about how TikiCat came up with the huge amount needed to feed?<br /><br />I'd love to hear what others do. If cats "need" that many cans of TIKI CAT, then each can must be very low on nutrients, as I assume to get the proper nutrients, they need all those cans as per the label?  I hope someone can make sense out of this.  I emailed the company just now as I totally missed that last line until placing an order for Hookena Luau, Hana Luau & Napili Luau. (some of their cans have better (safer) ingredients than others; and those are the more expensive ones & of course those are the ones I will feed IF I find out I don't need to follow the feeding guidelines.....)

review/summary: Better and cheaper than 5-Hour Energy
review/text: I'm not an "energy-shot" kind of person generally. You won't find me rappelling down mountainsides, kayaking over rapids, or hang-gliding over Death Valley. I have an office job, and my stimulant of choice is coffee or tea.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />There are times when I really need heightened concentration and I'm already exhausted. I can't just drink coffee indefinitely, because it makes me irritable and makes my heart race if I overindulge. That's when I use energy shots. I've been in the habit of using 5-hour Energy. But 5-hour Energy is... well, how shall I say this... yucky. I've tried every flavor, and they all taste metallic and leave an aftertaste reminiscent of boiled-down Diet Dr Pepper.<br /><br />Thankfully, Red Rain has the exact same effect on me as 5-hour Energy (the regular strength, not the extra strength), but tastes far better. What is the effect, you ask? For me, it's a very gentle lift. It's not so much a caffeine jolt as an improved ability to focus on creative or technically-demanding tasks. And it's a lot cheaper than 5-Hour Energy, too, even if you get your 5-Hour Energy at a warehouse store.<br /><br />If you're looking for a kick in the pants that helps you party all night long, I can't recommend Red Rain. If you're looking for a subtle pick-me-up that will help you get through the tasks at hand, this could be the one.

These you can buy at walmart or any dollar store for MUCH CHEAPER!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and compare the labels! A red rain shot is the EXACT same thing as the normal 5hr shot, but at less than half the cost and quite frankly...the 5hr shots taste bad. So save yourself some money, safe your tastebuds the chemical aftertaste and BUY THIS! You can have almost 3 of these for the price of ONE 5hr shot!

review/summary: great substitute for 5 hr energy
review/text: I echo what the other reviewers said.  This is an excellent alternative for 5 hr energy, and by buying from amazon, you save a ton of money.  I take them every morning and it really helps me get through lunch (I'm fine after then anyways).  The only downside was that when I first started taking it, I felt a weird tingling in my legs, which I never got from 5 hour energy.  However, this went away after a few days.

review/summary: No effect for either me or my husband
review/text: My husband is an energy drink addict on the weekends in his attempts to stay up all night. I thought maybe if these worked for him, he could cut down on his energy drink intake and therefore cut down on all the calories and sugar that comes with it. Unfortunately, these did absolutely nothing for him.<br /><br />I tried them as well, thinking that it might just be him. I don't really drink anything with caffeine besides a coffee every few days sometimes and do not ever drink energy drinks or anything of the sort. I tried drinking one of these an hour before I would normally start getting tired at night for four nights in a row. And all four nights, I was asleep before my usual bedtime. These might work great for some people (as shown by how many good reviews these have) but they didn't have any effect on either me or my husband. Looks like my husband will be making due with his energy drinks for a while longer.

review/summary: Already opened, items missing
review/text: I have ordered this exact item from Amazon a few times before. It is basically two 12 packs in one box. One of the 12 packs was already opened and was missing four of the mini bottles. This is the first time I have had this happen. It's not worth sending back, but it's extremely annoying.<br /><br />I will say that the product is great otherwise. It's virtually identical to 5 hour energy, but it costs half as much. The berry flavor isn't great, but it's not terrible either.

review/text: I've taken to drinking one black red rain in the morning and one red - red rain in the afternoon as my caffiene intake for the day. Replacing the much more expensive original 5-hour energy (less than the cost of one) through this subscription program. I think it tastes better, and it has no apartame which is the reason I stopped my addiction to Diet Coke. This is good and as advertised.

review/summary: Overall good product, cost effective
review/text: This works, tastes better than other similar products (though I don't think any energy shot product can really taste GOOD) and was much less expensive than others. It's really sweet and tart but doesn't leave the bad taste in your mouth I've experienced with stuff like 5 hr energy. I've gone through about half of them, and I don't take the whole thing at once usually half in the morning and half around lunchtime. "Cons" might include that the part of the plastic that provides the bottle's seal is not always easy to remove cleanly (doesn't follow perforation, and it can be kind of annoying) and that on a couple bottles (so far 2 of 11) have dried up dirty brownish looking product in the threaded part of the cap (another reviewer may have mentioned this as well). It's nothing that's going to kill you and I usually can just wipe it off, but it's a little bit unappetizing.<br />Overall this is a good alternative to drinking coffee or soda and I'd buy it again if I need more when they're all gone.

review/summary: Not so much energy....
review/text: I was only recently introduced to energy shots, and before now I have only tried 5-Hour Energy. I was hoping to save a bit of money by buying these instead. Sadly, I have to take two of them to feel anything, and even that does not give me the amount of energy and concentration provided by the more popular brand. I've noted that the energy I do get from these doesn't last very long; about two hours after I take them, my energy levels drops to normal. I've also noticed that they tend to make me feel slightly lightheaded; and a friend that tried one had the same effect.<br /><br />I'll finish off the remainder of my box anyway, because the lightheaded effect isn't bad, but I will not buy these again. They aren't really saving me any money since I have to take two of them, and the fact that the energy doesn't last long is the real deal breaker for me.

review/summary: Meh..Not for people that use energy shots/drinks often
review/text: Pros:  The taste is fantastic, a sweet berry.  Although I admit I kinda like the acerbic taste of some drinks/shots so that's not that important to me.<br /><br />Cons:  I simply don't get any energy from them.  Admittedly, for my job and as the father of 21 month old I drink more than my fair share of energy drinks.  So if you don't drink a ton, maybe these will be fine for you.  For me though, they simply don't cut it, which is a shame considering the great price.  Compare the back labels of these versus five hr though and these have about half the amount on most ingredients. I might try the red rain extra strength and see if they have more of a kick.  Otherwise its back to Power Horse drinks, also sold here on Amazon, and at a great price.

review/text: I picked up a case of these, hoping to find a cheaper alternative to 5-Hour Energy (at less than 1/3 the price, this is definitely cheaper).  Red Rain tastes fine (berry flavor) and provides a similar pick me up that you'd find from 5-Hour Energy, although it seems to last somewhere around 3-4 hours rather than 5-6 like 5-Hour Energy.  Overall, I'd say the price tradeoff is worth it.

review/summary: Waking with Red Rain
review/text: Having fought the battle to remain awake for most of my adult life, I was always seeking an elixir to prop open my heavy eyelids. I have no taste for coffee, therefore I have searched extensively for something with a similar effect, easy on the stomach, and palatable. None of the various stimulant tablets suffice, though some will wake me, even shake me; alas there is no pleasure in swallowing a pill. One day, I tried -- Red Rain -- tasty, stimulating, no stomach pain! I drink it without haste for I love the taste and it keeps my sleepies away. Every month Amazon.com sends seventy-two bottles to my lair at a discounted price that is quite fair. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007WTU430">Red Rain Energy Shot, Berry, 2 oz, 12 ct</a> I used Red Rain to wake enough to finish my novel "Nepenthes" also available on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1467943274">Nepenthes</a>. "Nepenthes" is a fantasy steeped in dreams and love and libertarianism, and yes, there is a bit of violence. My wife and I highly recommend reading it while slowly sipping Red Rain; seems an excellent thing to do!

review/summary: Leaky Bottles?
review/text: I don't use energy shots often but wanted to have some around just in case.  So I've bought a pack of this stuff and two months later the results have usually been hit or miss. Sometimes I feel it, sometimes I forget I've taken it and go about my business.  So I won't be going into details on the performance.<br /><br />The price was great and flavor was good with no strong after taste or anything.<br /><br />My issue with this product is that 90% of the time I open a bottle it, it has brown residue around the rim of the bottle. I see this after peeling off perforated cap band and unscrewing the cap.  I think that if the band were not there the caps would eventually come loose and all of the liquid would spill out.  I do not fear that the bottles have been tampered with but it's a bit unsettling.  Before anyone says it's due to how long I've had it, it's only been two months and I store them in my kitchen cabinets and my desk drawer at work.<br /><br />I believe Red Rain competitors have a small foil seal under the caps which prevent leakage.  Perhaps the lack of this enables them to cut the cost of the product?  At the moment, i will not be buying this item again, if however this issue was corrected I may consider buying Red Rain again.

I think if you put them out and didn't say anything, no one would notice and might even prefer these cookies.<br />I plan on ordering soon.  Dr. Schar products are usually very good and the cookies live up to their reputation.<br /><br />Update: I ordered a box (6 pkgs) of these from Amazon and they were as good as the sample I tried.  I would love to try some of the other cookies.<br />I wish Amazon had more Schar products in the bulk packages - this product is hard to get in our area.  Some of the other sellers are offering single packages at a very high price and then adding shipping to it.

They were not packed very well when shipped and arrived somewhat damaged, I had to glue two of the boxes back together.The salt is of medium coarseness, the salt to herb ratio is 3/4 to 1/4 respectably. It's not a great deal initially but the boxes are reusable and it is quite easy to make more using the ingredient list on the side of each box!

This sauce is terrible out of the bottle --  sure, it's mild -  not tangy at all, and so salty that it's just disgusting.  I ended up more than doubling the volume just to reduce the sodium content to a reasonable level -  added some apple cider vinegar, water, brown sugar, a couple tablespoons of honey - a little cornstarch as a thickener and cooked it up on the stove.  They should be selling the sauce I made because it's three times better than this stuff.

review/summary: DEMON BLOOD
review/text: I drink all kinds of energy drinks and shots, and when I found this on my store shelf I knew I had to try it.<br /><br />I love the packaging and name of this stuff, referring to it affectionately as DEMON BLOOD. I can imagine using this stuff for my demonic practices and rituals.<br /><br />The drink has a blood red color, and actually doesn't taste half bad. Beware, though, it tastes somewhat like cherry cough syrup, and has a similar consistancy as well. I like the taste of cough syrup, so this didn't really bother me much.<br /><br />I have a few gripes with this drink, however. Keep in mind that these are 4 oz bottles, so they are twice the size of normal energy shots or 1/4 the size of regular energy drinks. The 666 energy drinks use REAL SUGAR, which I applaud, but unfortunately they have about half the calories of a 16 oz can of NOS or Monster. Drinking one of these is like drinking a can of soda, there is just A LOT of sugar in this stuff.<br /><br />So for about a soda's worth of sugar, what energy are you getting?<br /><br />200 mg of caffeine<br />20 mg of vitamin B3  100%<br />20 mg of B6  1000%<br />250 mg of B12  4166%<br /><br />Drinking one of the cheap $1 energy shots at the dollar store will probably give you a better boost than this. And they are sugar free.<br />I'm at the point now where I would have to drink at least 2 of these to get going, but at that point, why not just buy a can of NOS?<br />The 666 energy drink company does have a sugar free version, a decent fake lemonade flavor with the same nutritional value.<br /><br />I found them at a discount retailer (Ollie's) with a few misprints. They originally were selling them for .89 cents a piece, but clearanced most of them out for $2.00 per case (there are a lot of older and religious people where I live, haha). I wouldn't pay anymore than $1.00 per bottle.<br /><br />In summary, these are alright tasting and will give energy-drink junkies a mild boost. The main draw of these is the name and look of the drink. No other energy drink out there can rightfully be called DEMON BLOOD.

Yes, it is most definitely less expensive to just buy a bag of rice and steam it yourself, but, speaking as one of the subset of the population who can't cook to save their lives - yes, you can burn water; don't ask - this is the perfect solution for rice lovers. No worry about making too much or too little or having it too mushy or not steamed enough, all the hard work is already done for you. So long as you have m@d skillz with the microwave - you know, pushing those buttons like a pro - you'll have the right portion of perfectly cooked rice in a minute or so. Doesn't get much better than that.

Although I have dozens of ground peppers in my cabinet, Chipotle, along with Cayenne and Ancho, are the hardest working spices in my kitchen.<br /><br />There are times when I prefer a pepper paste instead of a dried pepper.  I can make my own, but having it pre-made is a great convenience.  I have recently started using the Roland brand of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V76YOS">Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce</a> instead of my usual brand and I like them better.  I am now using this paste and I couldn't be happier with it.  I add it to soups, stews, chilies, anything that is thick and rich.  The paste blends with these types of dishes better than powders and imparts an unmistakable Chipotle flavor to everything that it touches.  The heat is just about right and a little goes a long way.  I plan on keeping several cans on hand at all times.

review/text: I selected these chips while purchasing too much food because I was hungry, even though i know that's bad grocery store juju. However, these chips were just absolutely delicious. Thinner than I expected, the average thickness of a regular chip. Made with just a touch of oil and other than that, they are an embodiment about all of the good parts of eating apples. I would continue eating them even if they were terrible for me, they are so good.

review/text: Not the merchant who was fine and prompt. The item well packed. But it lacks the grace and texture of Paddle-fish and of course is nothing like even Israeli or french farmed Sturgeon. Tight well formed eggs, but much too small and characterless. If you are looking for a Sturgeon substitute I would go with the Paddle-fish

review/text: My brother's family has several food allergies. Gluten...dairy...nuts...etc. Sometimes you can find stuff that doesn't contain these things, but they are produced on the same equipment as foods that do. Cherrybrook Kitchen has "dedicated" equipment, so there is no fear of cross-contamination.<br /><br />After I got the okay from my brother, I made a this cake for the holidays. What a treat. I was excited to make something that my brother's family could eat. My brother's family got to eat a dessert without fear of allergic reactions. Amazing!<br /><br />When time came for dessert, my niece and nephew's eyes rolled back into their head with delight. If allowed, they probably would have eaten the whole thing by themselves ... in one sitting. Oh, and the rest of us enjoyed it too. It was moist, and the flavor was excellent. I think I like the flavor of it better than the regular, non allergy-friendly varieties. I may just become my go-to cake mix.<br /><br />Just a warning...it only makes one 9-inch round. If you have a large group, you'll need to make more than one.

It was simply a melange of the indistinguishable.<br /><br />  It was given a 3 because it did spread easily, the color is pretty and it moistened toast.  Others at the table felt the same way  - not at all sure what we were eating.  It was quite sweet, which didn't particularly encourage me because I was looking for a "fruity" flavor - maybe raspberry,  maybe peach?<br /><br />  A disappointment.

review/summary: My favorite blend from Celestial Seasonings in K-Cups for convenience
review/text: I love this blend of tea--I've been drinking it since it came on the market (back in the old days when the packages were psychedelic and quirky, and Red Zinger had almost 20 different herbal ingredients--now sadly reduced to a much less complex blend.) However, Sleepytime may have changed its package but the blend is the same--lime blossom (linden flowers or tilia, same thing), chamomile and spearmint. This is a brilliant mix, the linden and chamomile floral, sweet and soporific, the spearmint adding just enough of a hit to make it interesting. It's good as an after-dinner digestif, or as a before-bed soothing drink.<br /><br />Each ingredient has a purpose; linden is a relaxer and is said to restore the liver (hence, it's used as a tisane in France, where livers are always suspected of being upset), chamomile is a tension-tamer and soothes the stomach, and spearmint is a digestive (unless you have GERD--mints can be irritating, sad to say.) After a heavy meal, this tea can soothe a stomach. As a before-bed potion, it's unparalleled. I drink this almost every evening. You can serve it to children with a bit of milk and sugar to make "cambric tea" which is an old recipe for a posset to serve to children, too young for caffeine. (Cambric is a white, sheer fabric, so "cambric tea" is white and thin, no color.)<br /><br />You actually don't need to have K-cups--just brew a cup of hot water from the Keurig and dip in a Sleepytime tea bag. But if you are serving guests at table or in your office, a dripping tea bag is a nuisance and I for one am not a person who drinks her tea with the bag sitting in the mug. I just can't do it, though I know many people do. Call me a fussbudget but I don't like sipping past a steeping bag. The K-Cup makes a perfectly steeped cup immediately and no messy bag to clean up. So if you drink this on the way to work in a travel mug or don't want to deal with a tea bag, the K-Cup is very  nice indeed.
