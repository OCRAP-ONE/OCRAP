review/text: This product is advertised as smoked salt.  It is, indeed, smoked salt.<br /><br />What the seller fails to tell us is that curry, onion, and black pepper are also ingredients.<br /><br />It is more like onion salt and may be good for a rub, but it is definitely not what I thought I was purchasing.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and their response was "The ingredients are indeed salt, curry, onion, and pepper, which is not an indication that this product is not smoked salt."<br /><br />I cannot recommend this seller.

review/summary: Nature's Miracle Oil
review/text: There is a quiet epidemic in America caused by excessive sugar in our diet and overuse of antibiotics.  The epidemic is Yeast (fungus) overgrowth, and it has been estimated that upwards of 85% of Americans suffer from it, many without even knowing.  Fungal overgrowth has been linked to cancer and other diseases.  There is a simple test called the "SPIT TEST".  Do a search on these subjects and take this test.  If you have the symptoms, purchase this product, Nature's Alchemy Essential Oil of Oregano.  Take as directed (usually 1 drop in water or juice 3 times daily).  Oregano is one of the most potent anti-fungal agents in existence, and it is completely natural with virtually no side effects.  Make sure it is wild oregano.  Don't take my word for it, do some research.  This product worked great for me, and cleared up a stubborn yeast overgrowth problem in just weeks.

review/summary: Basic salad dressing
review/text: We are very disappointed with this "dipping oil".  I've been using separate ingredients, including high end olive oils, vinegars, etc and decided to give this pre-mix a try for dipping various freshly baked breads.  Visually, it looks congealed and cloudy, with more than 12 months left on the "best before" date.  The taste and aroma from this product is very close to a low end Italian salad dressing.  This is being sold as more than that and that's where my rating comes from.  We can't use it, can't donate it or return it.  Lesson learned.

review/summary: This may be the very best guacamole mix ever - if you like your guacamole SPICY!
review/text: I really like this guacamole mix. It's very, very spicy.<br /><br />I got two different brands. Actually I assumed that the other brand would be spicier, probably because of the rather bland name of t this product, &lt;grin>, but Produce Partners Great Guacamole Mix Spicy was take-your-breath-away spicy. Both were delicious. I would feel good about recommending Produce Partners Great Guacamole Mix Spicy to anyone. Maybe it should come with a warning though, because it is SPICY!  I love it.<br /><br />I'll be using both in the future, depending on my mood. Price will have a lot to do with it as well. This one was a very reasonable price, at least at the time I bought. I know these things can change.

review/summary: Don't be fooled, this is not what you get in the supermarket
review/text: Like so many things in Italy, the Italians have elevated this vinegar-making to high art.<br /><br />This product, "Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia", is made from cooked grape "must" that is aged over many years while it is transfered into ever smaller barrels of different woods. Through this aging and evaporation process, this product matures into a very unique "condimento".<br />After a minimum of 12 years, a sample of this product is given to a consortium where it is evaluated against the standard for "Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia". If approved, this product can be given a "silver label" = 12 years old, a "red label" = 25 years old and then there is this current product, a "gold label" 50 to 75 to 100 years old. The consortium places the product in their unique bottle and then, and only then, can the product carry the name "Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale."<br /><br />There is not a simple way to describe the taste other that to say "if you have ever tasted vinegar, it is NOTHING like that." This is a product that used in drops on fine cheese or over perfectly ripe strawberries or just drizzled over a perfectly cooked porterhouse steak.<br />You do not make salad dressing from this product!<br />The Italians categorize this product as a "digestivo" (after dinner drink to aid digestion) or a "condimento", used as I described above.<br /><br />All you have to do is have a nice person put 2 drops on your tongue, then you will understand everything I've written above.

Goes well with a slice of lemon (optional).<br /><br />The box says to use boiling water, but I achieve better results with water that's a bit cooler with shorter steeping times:  Large coffee cup with fresh water 1.5 min in new microwave on high with steeping 2.5 min (you can also reuse the tea bag for your second cup that way, too)...and considering the expense of this tea, you don't want to waste any.  The large tea package can easily be used to store your tea bag for a second cup.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: I've tried most of the Korean BBQ sauce out there and this one is the BEST by far!<br />This is my recipe using this sauce on some chicken thighs & drumsticks.<br />Starting out with 5 lbs of chicken, wash and let dry. Add 2 teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of black pepper and mix them up thoroughly with the chicken. Then add 1 tablespoon of Tony Chachere's creole seasoning and 1 tablespoon of Paprika. Mix them all up. Then add a moderate amount of this BBQ sauce in. Let the whole thing sit for about 5 hours or so and throw them in the oven. Add some oil on the pan to prevent burning. Cook for about 45-50 minutes at 450F. Try this and your family will love it!<br />Pro tip: This BBQ sauce can be found at Asian supermarkets for about $7.

review/summary: Wonderful cheese; blows Parmesan out of the water!
review/text: I purchased this cheese because a recipe called for it and, because I'd never heard of it, I did a little research and found many Italians won't use anything else for grated cheese of the Parmesan/Romano type. I decided to give it a try and it was wonderful! A full, nutty flavor, so much more robust than any Parmesan or Romano I'd ever had.<br /><br />I used it in the recipe I had found, and it was the only cheese in the recipe. The rest of the sauce consisted only of butter and cream. The flavor of the cheese really stood out. I've only once made a sauce based on Parmesan as the sole cheese, and never have again because of the lackluster flavor of the dish. However, Locatelli Pecorino Romano has no such problem!<br /><br />I also later purchased another brand of Pecorino Romano, and, while it was far better than Parmesan, it still did not have the wonderful flavor of this cheese.<br /><br />The cheese arrived within 24 hours of shipment, very well packed with refrigerant and protective packaging.

review/text: Although I have a few recipes that I go to for making my own"chicken" style dry broth mix without the bird, I haven't found a go-to recipe for a "beef" style broth mix yet. Frontier fills the void and buying it on Amazon is the most cost-effective way that I've found so far. I like the results in recipes more than some other cheaper brands tried to date. My only caveat is to be aware that it includes salt (as almost all broth powders do), so taste as you go when cooking, and add additional salt to your recipe only after tasting the broth first.

I get low sodium but this should be titled low flavor.  It's more sweet than anything and I have to add a ton PLUS salt and other seasonings to make a decent broth.  I won't buy this again.

review/summary: Powerfully strong but healthy buckwheat honey
review/text: I have been doing extensive online research to lower my LDL ("bad") cholesterol with diet, and one of the recommended foods is buckwheat honey.  It has the most antioxidants of any other honey, and though the taste is super-strong (a cross between molasses and a strong herbal cough syrup such as Buckley's) and not pleasant to eat by the spoonful, it does very well blended in a hot drink like coffee or milk, or in cooking such as part of a marinade.  For total taste elimination, try putting a tsp in strong tea such as herbal peppermint.  Dr. Oz has recommended using it to sweeten coffee instead of sugar because you need less with the powerful buckwheat honey taste.  This brand Dutch Gold is reliable, I have always used their honeys because there is never an allergic reaction (i.e.hives) which I have had from other brands, even expensive ones.  I really like the plastic squeeze bottle which is easy-pour and dripless, and usually only found with the plastic honey bears.

review/text: I was intrigued with how dark the honey was, sitting there on the grocer's shelf - I've never seen honey like that before, so I was curious.  I was really pleased when I got it home and took a taste!<br /><br />This honey has a slight hint of molasses to it, mainly as an after-taste that lingers just a bit.  I like it very much.  If you don't, then buckwheat blossom honey isn't for you.  Otherwise ... enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent salt / Price issue
review/text: I love this salt but the price, here, is way out of line. You can buy a case of 12 at buythecase.com for $30.00something dollars...works out to $3.09 per box. A case is a lot, but it just goes to show that this salt can be found for a much lower price. Publix used to carry it, although today, my hubby says he could not find it there. Men!<br />A humidity issue was mentioned in another review...I live in Florida at the beach and I have never had a problem with this salt. I have probs. with regular salt but not this. I keep salt in a small, open dish on the counter and when the humidity reaches about 90-100% I can still grab a pinch...it may stick together a tiny bit, but nothing to fret about. This salt also has recommendations from various culinary associations and institutes, and Alton Brown.

review/summary: LOL at the Star of David on the box!
review/text: Its koshering salt, not really "Kosher" and it has not been blessed by a<br />Rabbi in a clean room in Haifa or somewhere, this is the salt used in the<br />koshering process to extract the last drops of blood from cured meats.<br /><br />Whats different between Diamond Crystal and Morton's? Well for one thing<br />there are no fillers or caking agents, and Morton's is ground rock salt,<br />much coarser and less willing to dissolve than the fine flakes you find<br />with Diamond Crystal. Also DC is distinct from other kosher salts because<br />of its extraordinary texture that easily crumbles between fingertips, its<br />smooth blendability and its exceptional adherence. Diamond Crystal is pure<br />salt and has no additives.<br /><br />Ask any chef why they use kosher salt and they will tell you it tends to<br />have a clean, natural flavor and sprinkles more evenly than other salts.<br />Also, this DC is half as saline as table salt by volume, while Morton's is<br />2/3 as saline as table salt by volume. That means there is less probability<br />of over-salting. The general usage table looks like this: 2 parts table salt<br />= 3 parts Morton kosher = 4 parts Diamond Crystal kosher.<br /><br />Anyway, if you go to diamondcrystalsalt(dot)com under the Culinary tab you will<br />find the store locator for your area. Also on the website is a highly entertaining<br />and informative "Salt 101" by Food Network's Alton Brown that will explain to you<br />why you should be using Diamond Crystal Kosher, and how. Never understood why<br />DC is generally found in the kosher foods section of the grocery stores, while the<br />Morton salt is in the spice aisle?<br /><br />This DC product was also awarded the American Culinary Federation Seal of Approval,<br />which basically means this is the #1 choice of gourmets everywhere. Great stuff!<br /><br />And despite any silly claims in the comments section, there is no such thing as<br />"Kosher" salt, its ridiculous. Sorry. LOL

review/summary: Plain, Boring Salt; This one really is better
review/text: Have you ever flown into the SF/Bay Area, and seen those colorful pools of liquid in the bay? Ever wondered what these are? Well, these are salt evaporation ponds owned by Cargill. This is where they harvest salt for their Diamond Crystal brand of kosher salt.<br /><br />Pity, this salt is usually dismissed as suitable only for pickling or making ice cream. I can buy this salt in smaller, 500 gram cardboard shakers like ordinary salt. I cannot honestly say that it tastes better than that other brand with a girl with umbrella, but Diamond Crystal is the one I always use for everything. Due to the rather large and bulky size of the crystals, you have to measure out twice the volume of this salt compared to ordinary, granulated, table salt.<br /><br />I saw a local PBS TV show about these salt ponds, and it sure seemed like a top drawer gourmet product commensurate with the other, gourmet food products that the Bay Area regularly produces. If you want this gourmet, SF salt,you will have to buy this Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt, as Cargill does not sell it to anyone. I am glad the ridiculous craze for 'gourmet' salt has faded, and that twenty dollar containers of 4 oz. of salt are sitting on grocers' shelves gathering dust. This brand is the only one you need.

The one on my last box completely broke off, and my new box's spout is already showing signs of it's mortality.  3lbs of salt requires a lot of opening an closing of that spout, and I wish they'd reinforce it a little better.

review/text: My two border collies can eat through 10-inch "rawhide rolls" in one evening (that's one bone per dog). That gets expensive! These 24-inch bones with knotted ends are a better deal. I give one to each of my two dogs and the bones last 3 weeks. I ordered these at the end of September. Noticed the Amazon price went up by $1.72 per bone in October. Not happy with the price jump, but it's still a better deal than the 10-inch bones.

review/text: I bought this 24" rawhide because several reviewers said their dogs worked on it for a very long time.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my 100 lb. Labrodane.  He was pulling off large shreds within 2 minutes, had it broken in half within 10 minutes and chewed one half down to the knot in less than an hour.  While I don't think this is a bad quality bone, the rawhide is not as thick as other bones I have purchased, which I am assuming is why he was able to tear it apart so fast.

review/text: My 45 lb lab mix loves these 24" rawhide bones but they only last 48 hours at best. She's like a wood chipper when she gets going. So according to her it is a 5 star product based on how much she loves it. But in my judgement it is sort of expensive for 2 days of chewing. I will buy this product occasionally but will seek a more economical alternative. My guess is that most dogs will not chew it up as quickly.

review/summary: These are excellent!
review/text: I'll definitely buy them again!<br /><br />I only have one complaint: the product is shrink-wrapped, which means that, once I opened it, I had to find a container to put it in. Any container. Anything that is reasonably air tight ("ordinary" rice cakes come in a recloseable bag).<br /><br />TO THE MANUFACTURER: Packaging is good advertising! Why not give me something I can reclose?  Just a thought....

review/summary: not your average rice cake!
review/text: These extra thin multigrain puffed "cakes" are not like ordinary, air-filled puffed rice cakes. They are quite thin and more solid, which means you don't end up with a mouthful of air. They have a nice, balanced multigrain taste - not overbearing or "grainy". They are good plain, with peanut butter, or my favorite - with a drizzle of dark amber agave syrup.

review/text: I received 2 bunches of these Dendrobiums from Just Orchids and what a lovely surprise (Thank you Steve G). The flowers are brightly colored and so visually stunning.<br />Every time I look at them I am pleased by their beauty.<br />It is now 15 days later and most of it still looks good. They looked perfectly fresh for 2 weeks and in just the last day a few of the blooms are drying up. I am removing the very few blooms that are dried and I'll see how long these stunning flowers continue. You would never know that it's been 2 weeks since they were delivered.

However it's so hard to find in stores, that I resorted to looking it up online to order -- that is how much we love it.  I typically mix it with mayo to slather on bread for sandwiches with the fixings...  takes care of the desire for a "hot fix"  and condiments at the same time without having to resort to throwing on hot sauce and/or jalapeno (or other) peppers.

Right then and there, I knew I had to try it (damn my impulse buying habit). Well, you can only get them in a case of 6 on Amazon. So I gave a few away and kept three for myself. OMG, was that a mistake! I blew through those three within a month's time. I would put it on anything I could. Many times just on a piece of bread with nothing else, just for a snack. I'd even use it as a dip. It's awesome.

review/text: While I can find some flavors of the Beaver brand here in Vegas, I have never saw this Jalapeno flavor mustard. I ordered a case of 6 jars of this, and WOW, I love it. It has the heat, and it has the flavor, and it balances out well. My brother says it's too hot, but he is a wimp, lol. I think it is perfect. So much so that I continually look for more things to use it with. First thing I noticed when I spread it on a slice of bread was the colors. Very colorful with the red and green peppers in it. Looked like a xmas spread of some sort. I use it on samiches, fresh sausage, hot dogs, burgers. I am thinking of using an entire jar and mixing some oil with it to make a salad dressing out of it. This stuff is THAT good. You will find yourself like me, wondering what else you can use it for.

review/text: I was looking for a jarred version of regular tomato paste for when a dish just needs the richness of a spoonful or two.  This paste is very delicious, but not what I had expected.  It contains sundried tomatoes, sunflower oil, vinegar and salt.  I haven't tried it yet, but it would probably be scrumptious on bruschetta, or as a layer in Italian sausage bread, etc.  Just not a substitute for Hunt's or Contadina.

I though I had found a suitable replacement at a reasonable price but was very disappointed.  This spread is MUCH to oily.  Even after stirring and refrigeration, the oil still sits on top of the spread!  So I now have most of one jar in the fridge and 3 jars in the pantry.  Haven't decided what to do with them yet.  Oh well, my quest continues.

review/text: Have you ever just approached a vending machine and realized that everything inside of it isn't worthy of your hard earned dollar? Sunflower seeds? Please. Cheese Doodles?! Get a life.<br /><br />THEN!......there were Oreo Cakesters. Not only will you buy them every single time you are within 50 feet of such a vending machine, you will become irritated and Hulk-like when certain machines do not carry them. In rare cases, people have been known to resort to cannibalism in order to fuel their Cakester hunger.<br /><br />I'm sure you'd like to know details about the Cakester's composition, its preferred habitat, and its breeding habits, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned.<br /><br />To put it simply, I have never met a real life person that does not enjoy Oreo Cakesters. Do not be fooled by the posers posting reviews about this lovely product. They are spies sent by Keebler to take down the competition. I wouldn't trust those elves. Would YOU?....<br /><br />Now, you may be wondering about the texture of this bite sized dyno-mite snack. Well, I assure you they are made from only the finest ingredients from only the most elegant factories across the planet. If you treat your Cakesters with love and respect, and keep them in proper temperatures, I promise you will be pleased with the outcome.<br /><br />Honestly, Oreo Cakesters transform my mouth into a wonderful world where everything is safe and delicious. The people of this world don't commit crimes or act unjustly. They only care about making your taste buds the happiest they can be. Let Oreo Cakesters into your mouth and into your heart. You owe it to yourself to at least give them a chance. Disappointment is not an option.

review/text: I am not sure why I had such a craving for hostess products a month ago, but I did.  So my wife returns from the grocery store with Oreo Cakesters and claims she could not find any hostess items (my guess is she had a coupon).  So anyways I tried one and it was not bad.  It was like a soft extra creamy oreo.  Since I have always liked the white cream of the oreo best I was happy with the cakester.  To me it is not as good as a hostess cupcake but it comes close.  My wife really likes them as she has bought several boxes over the last few weeks and packs them as a mid day snack at work.

review/text: I found these snack cakes to be extremely dense and unfilling. They also fall apart pretty easily. The moist, dense, unflavorful chocolate cake also sticks to everything including your fingers, so beware. Not even my kids liked these, and well, they like just about everything including brussels sprouts.<br /><br />What makes Oreo so great is the crunchy cookie and sweet white icing, but neither of those qualities have been replicated very well in this cake. If you truly want a snack cake stick to Hostess for the best quality, or Little Debbie for the best value.<br /><br />I hope Oreo can revise this snack, because Oreos are a great, timeless product that sell themselves. I don't think many people will be repeat buyers of this particular product, however.

I was addicted to these things while they lasted, but after about 2 weeks, I just finished the last package. Definitely delicious but crumbly and I was always left wanting more. The cream in the middle is soo good. As a kid I always thought it would be awesome to eat oreo cream like they do in the movie "Honey I shrunk the kids" and FINALLY my dream came true! Honestly, I will probably never buy these again, and I wouldn't pay full price for them because I am a cheapo, but they were scrumptious while they lasted.

review/text: I can guarantee every reader of this review that not a single taste test was conducted for this horribly inferior snack cake. Maybe it was my epectation for something delicious that would satisfy my hunger for something cakey and chocolatey. It has its share of chocolate but it takes like spoonfuls of flour flavored with an inferior chocolate powder. And it looks nothing like its picture on the package. There's barely a thin layer of cream, so that doesn't help at all.  Don't think for a moment that its a filled pastry. Its a brown ball of chalky flour and that's about it. A momentous, calamitous failure of epic porportions.

review/text: this coffee comes in bags, not containers. very annoying. also it looks different than regular maxwell house, the coffee crystals look like tasters choice, and it says freeze dried coffee on the bag, which it doesnt say on regular maxwell house
