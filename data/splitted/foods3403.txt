review/summary: So Good!
review/text: We discovered FibreGourmet pastas recently.  We have tried the Fettuccine, Rotini, Penne so far.  We love all of them.  You MUST cook them a little longer than directions say to. I'm not sure you can overcook them.  They seem to stay Al Dente, which we enjoy!  Love the high fiber, low calories.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie High Fiber Product
review/text: The Pros:<br />1. GREAT Taste (my husband can't tell the difference between this and regular pasta)<br />2. Very high in fiber<br />3. Low in calories<br />4. More filling than ordinary pasta<br /><br />The Cons:<br />1. Takes longer to cook than regular pasta<br />2. Slightly different texture than regular pasta<br /><br />The extra cook time is more than worth it for me. This item is very low calorie and it tastes as good as regular pasta (to us at least). It makes pasta a food which can be a regular part of our rotation. It takes far less of this pasta to fill us up than it did with regular pasta.

review/summary: OK for an alternative snack
review/text: Purchased this variety pack and although I was VERY impressed with Amazon Prime shipping (I literally received it in less than 24 hours!), the snack itself is average tasting.  Mostly like flavorless cardboard.  The best flavor is the jalapeno one, pretty spicy.  It satisfies the crunch and salt factor, but no way is this a replacement for real chips.  I recommend PopChips original flavor which reminds me of Munchos, or PopChips BBQ flavor; both are satisfying and taste very good.  I would NOT purchase these Gourmet Basics Smart Fries again.  I even joked with my co-workers when they asked me what I was eating.."They're Smart Fries, but they're not so smart since they don't taste that good!"  They tasted for themselves and they all pretty much agreed with me.

review/summary: Too Salty for Me!
review/text: I'm really disappointed in these, unless for some reason I got a bad box of them!  I've been buying the plain Pop Chips for over a year now, very happy with them but was looking for something new.  Well, these are too salty for me,,,,,I can't eat them.  So I'm giving the entire box away tomorrow to get them out of here.  What a bummer!  That's the problem when you try something new with Amazon in the food category, you have to buy a boatload,,,and if it doesn't work out, you've wasted $20.00.  I don't  see what the point is in air popping something so it's low in fat but then making it way too salty,,,,sure defeats the purpose in my viewpoint.  Not good,,,,I'm really not pleased.

review/summary: Healthy and delicious, wish they were cheap.
review/text: For the cost this is not a good snack but if you don't mind how expensive they are then these can't be beat for calorie counters. A single bag offers tremendous taste and fulfillment for such low levels of calories and fat. My wife loves Popchips and I don't count calories but we both love these fries (mostly). Brief flavour rundown:<br /><br />Jalapeno is very hot. Tastes good. If you like jalapeno, you'll love these.<br /><br />Honey Mustard is the best flavour. Rich, bold, strong taste, very flavourful and high quality.<br /><br />Sea Salt is good but bare and basic.<br /><br />Honey BBQ is great. Weak BBQ flavour compared to most potato chips but still quality.<br /><br />Vinegar is decent, pretty good vinegar taste, again weak compared to most potato chips.<br /><br />Vintage Cheddar is the poorest of the lot, with a dry and musty white cheddar taste, which though real, tastes fake.

review/summary: A great low calorie snack!
review/text: These smart fries are a great alternative to the usual chips, pretzels, and tortilla chips. You get a heap of pieces for 110 cals (I think about 60), and it definitely does satisfy that salty snack craving I get from time to time. As for the flavors, we got the 6 variety mix. Some were definitely good (the BBQ and japapeno ones were best in my opinion) but others were a bit rough to get through (like the vinegar/salt). Regardless, I definitely plan to get some more in the future.

review/text: If you want to eat a lot for only a few calories these are great. However the sea salt flavor is very bland and has essentially no flavor. They also stick to your tongue in a weird way because they're so porous. I think maybe the cheddar flavor could be ok but the three in this variety pack didn't impress me. I much prefer PopChips (especially the Sour Cream & Onion flavor) and recommend going with their variety pack instead. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>

review/text: I personally did not like these, but I gave the rest of the box to my mother and she had me order two more cases.  These are probably a good item for dieting because you think you are getting a lot for the calorie amount, but the flavor to me (and my husband) was sort of gummy and styrofoamy.  I could not finish a whole bag.  That didnt mean I was full, that meant I had gotten tired of them and wanted something more satisfying.  It is like eating a pound of celery when you really wanted a grilled cheese.<br /><br />By the way, I love the Pop Chips.  Much more flavor.<br />And my review was up for no less than a minute when I got a "not helpful" so I am not sure how this is not helpful, but the company requested that I write a review. If they are not happy that I didnt like the product, that is too bad.

review/text: Love Pop Chips and thought I'd give these a try.  First of all, I should say that the flavors are really, really good.  However, something in the manufacturing process ensures that very little flavor actually "sticks" to the fries.  I wish they could somehow infuse the flavor INTO the fries themselves.  As they are, they are like eating little pieces of styrofoam with a tiny bit of flavored powder on them.  As soon as the enter your mouth, the flavor comes off and you're left to chew and swallow the tasteless piece of styrofoam.  They use plenty of seasoning...it's just that most of it ends up in the bottom of the bag.  Dry powder just doesn't stay on a dry fry very well.  These have the potential of being very good.  And it's a good sized snack for the calories.  I just wish the actual fries had some flavor, instead of just the powder that falls right off.

review/summary: great product and great vendor!
review/text: This was the first time I had any issues with an order from Amazon - and the vendor handled it quickly and generously!  My order came in from the shipping company in a rather squashed box and I thought it was okay at first, but once I got a better look, the bags inside the box all had been pushed on hard enough to have small holes, so I emailed the vendor through Amazon and they responded the same afternoon that they would ship out a new box with the product I had ordered!  I think these smart fries are the best snacks and my two year old loves them too, so we were very excited about the quick resolution!  Thank you!

review/summary: Salted Styrofoam - But Low-Cal!
review/text: Gourmet Basics indeed! I think the basics are to keep it simple and let the natural flavor of the food shine through. I am blown away that they have actually managed to make a "natural food" taste faker than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00346J90Y">Andy Capp Hot Fries, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>. Rice cakes have a luxurious mouth-feel compared to these. I couldn't get past the fake flavor and horrible texture.<br /><br />I just can't imagine what type of odd palate people must have to think that these abominations are tasty. Perhaps people who are on a restricted diet might find these a convenient snack food. Or parents tricking their kids into eating healthy. I can almost promise the parents that these snacks will go uneaten. I would have been more likely to eat the unsweetened Baker's Chocolate in the pantry before I'd eat these.<br /><br />Though this product might be suggested by Amazon if you purchase Popcorners or Popchips, do not buy it. These are nothing like Popcorners or Popchips, these "Smart Fries" are nothing but awful.

review/summary: You eat potato snacks for potato flavor
review/text: I really like potato snacks and have not tried many that I did not like. This one however, I felt I had to report my experience. These are the worst potato snacks I have ever tried. not only do they not taste like potatoes, but they are also very bland as well. Put it this way, I received a case of 12 3oz bags and I opened one bag and ate about half the bag. The rest I had to throw out and I won't even inflict coworkers with this product by leaving them in the break room for free. Instead, I plan on using the bags as shipping protection to fill empty space inside a few boxes I have outgoing. That's right folks, packing material. That's what these excess bags of smart fries are good for.

However, the flavoring was too weak for my taste, especially when compared to the other varieties in the assortment.

review/text: After reading all the raving reviews I decide to order the 6-Flavor variety pack.  I tried the Honey Mustard & Onion as well as the Sea Salt.  The Honey Mustard & Onion has a decent flavor but it fades almost as soon as you start crunching.  The Sea Salt had almost no flavor at all.  The texture is great, a bit like a skinnier, more crunchy (yet light) Cheese puff.  I love the texture, I love the idea but the flavor needs to be amped up CONSIDERABLY.  I wish I hadn't purchase so much since I don't want to eat them.

I probably won't buy them again because  I have  tried Pop Chips and they are more flavorful,although more expensive. They(smart fries) are a filling snack in the evening without the guilt. Other flavors might be ok....cheddar cheese seem like they might be interesting. Again, not up to Pop Chip quality in my opinion.

I tried 2 other flavors and they had little to no flavor.<br /><br />Popchips are amazing and so much flavor with each chip compared to these.

review/summary: Very very tasty snack
review/text: Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'.  At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag)  BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag!  They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag.  I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties.<br /><br />One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving.  (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person)<br /><br />Favorites so far are:<br />Honey Mustard & Onion<br />Vintage Cheese<br />Classic Sea Salt<br /><br />I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities.  I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases.<br /><br />But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected.

And I can have a late-night, TV-watching, salty-crunchy-yummy snack without feeling guilty. Can't beat that! They are very tasty and so light that the single portion bags actually give you A LOT.

review/summary: Best, Healthy and Low-Fat Alternative for Cheetos Puffs!!
review/text: I purchased the variety pack and have been able to try out all the flavors. This Vintage Cheddar variety is one of my faves. If you're a Cheetos Puffs fan and want to cut back on calories and fat, this is the product for you.<br /><br />The texture in both are similar -- light and airy. So is the taste. Of course, it's not an exact match, but nothing else on the market this low in fat content comes close. (And I've tried several alternatives.)<br /><br />To compare nutritional info on a 1-oz. bag, Cheetos Puffs contains 160 calories compared to Gourmet Basics' 110. As for fat grams, Cheetos Puffs has 9 grams and 1 gram saturated versus GB's 2 grams of fat and 0 saturated. On the flip side, the sodium content on the GB is higher at 340mg compared to Cheetos' 250mg. Carb count is also higher in the GB at 22 grams as compared to Cheetos' 16.<br /><br />I'm sold on this product and my next order will be for a carton of this flavor alone.

I've also tried the popchips and I do prefer these.  the serving size is actually very large!  When I saw the size of the bag I figured it had to be all air, or that there were multiple servings in the bag.  Nope!  Granted it is 110 calories vs the popchip's 100 calories.  But honestly, I get way more satisfaction out of these.

review/text: After being on a very strict diet for over two years, the same foods, day in and day out, become repetitious, and it becomes very difficult to maintain the will-power to continue.  However, Smart Fries are an excellent product that offers a bit of a variety to a healthful diet.  As another customer wrote, I, too, was skeptical of purchasing this product, but, at 110 calories per bag, I was very impressed and have become a loyal customer after the first try.  Additionally, I find that I can not eat an entire bag.  My fiancee and I shared a bag of the Smart Fries, and I had some left over for another meal.  A great product for those looking for healthy alternatives, while maintaining a great taste.

review/text: I purchased a bag at a local gourmet deli in NYC because they had about 1/3 the calories of all the kettle fried chips.  First, I was shocked that there was only 1 serving in the bag (even though the measurement says 1 once the bag is bigger than you think).  After calculating the points I decided to give them a try.  Boy am I glad I did!  I almost felt guilty for having soo much to crunch on (there are a lot of these fries in that there bag).  I must reiterate 1 bag (1 oz) is 3 points!!! This is major.  The flavor is great and you will not feel hungry.  I am ordering a bunch of these right away.

review/text: I love these !<br /> I always crave salty/ crunchy snacks.. and I want to eat them without expanding. These are great.. they fix the craving without costing me a lot of calories. In the stores by me I can only get the original flavor. I can't wait to try the rest of them!

review/summary: Yum! Smart Fries, a tasty low cal snack - finally!
review/text: I first found out about Smart Fries from a co-worker.  The local 7/11 in Ft Worth Tx carries them in a variety of flavors.  I LOVE the BBQ flavor!  I was surprised by the low calories and that the whole bag was one serving, not 3 servings like so many other "low calorie" snacks.  I have not found them in any stores, so buy them bulk from Amazon.  My mom loves them too!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AZ2ECY">Gourmet Basics Smart Fries 6-Flavor Variety Pak, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: A great guilt-free snack.  Much better than chips
review/text: These SmartFries are so awsome!  With regular chips and bagged snacks you get maybe 10 - 15 per serving, but with SmartFries you get 65 per serving and only 110 calories.  I never even get close to that many though as I usually get my fix in around 20.  If any of you love the Trader Joe's Skinny Fries, then you're in luck because these are the same thing and the same price if purchased in multiple bag packs.  I am a frequent buyer of this product.

I don't like mustard - and I'm not a big fan of too much onion flavor in chips. Was I ever surprised when these turned out to be my favorite flavor!! They are fantastic (and pleasantly addicting)! They also included the Vinegar Splash flavor which I was leery of - but they turned out to be very good as well!

review/summary: Good for Low Cal Snack
review/text: I am always dieting and ordered the multi flavor package of these.  I admit I like some flavors more than others.  At first I wasn't sure I liked them because they are so light and airy but they are filling and only 110 calories, 2grams fat, 1g fiber. A filling, crunchy snack bagb you can keep in a desk or in the car that won't wreck a diet but is emotionally satisfying if you need a saltry crunch.  I didn't think I would like the vinegar ones, but I really do.  The sligtly salty ones are the least flavorful in my opinion but sometimes I use dip with them. I will definitely order again.  The bagsv are big and sometimes I only need to eat half to feel satisfied, honestly. (Not like the PopC**ps where I can eat a whole ig bag) Wish I could get them in stores. They grow on you and for me they were worth the money to stay on my diet.

review/summary: love love but take out some salt please!
review/text: I was so excited about receiving these and wow the crunch and flavor is great! 1 ounce for only 110 calories is awesome. At the bottom of the bags though I found a lot of salt so I re-checked the nutritional info and found one bag has 11% of daily intake of salt! That is just too much for me with my BP issues etc. The pop chips are yummy too and only have 6% daily salt.. for a little less than one ounce and the pop tortilla chips are also 6% per 1 oz. bag. With the great taste of the fries you just don't need all that salt anyhow! So to people not worried about their salt intake ( everything else is very healthy) go for it.. but for people like me just be a bit cautious. This was to be my newest best healthy snack but guess I will have to enjoy sparingly and keep on looking. My score would def. been a 5 if not for the extra, in my view, unnecessary salt. Hope this helps!

review/summary: Large portion for 110 calories.
review/text: I purchased the 1.1 oz.-24 bag variety pack.  I actually didn't care for 2 of the 6 flavors though I realize this is just personal preference.  I thought the other flavors were tasty.  You get a lot of snack for the calorie content.  I think they are very comparable to PopChips but you get a much bigger portion(1.1 oz. of Smart Fries for 110 cal vs. popchips - 100cal for 0.8 oz.). I like PopChips but I'd rather be able to have more snack for the same calories. The Honey Mustard & BBQ flavors are delicious & were my favorite.  If you're a chip addict like I am, this is a good deal.  It was a big enough serving to satisfy my craving without completely blowing my daily calorie intake.  I will definately purchase again.

review/summary: Healthy, delicious but not cheetos!
review/text: Looking at the shape of this snack you will think you are eating Cheetos. But rest easy there's no grease here. This is the perfect snack if you're trying to diet. There should be something fun if you're fighting the calories, and this was perfect! For 110 calories, you get 65 smart fries, and I actually felt full after eating a bag. They're light and crispy and very flavorful. Here's what I thought about the flavors:<br /><br />Honey Mustard and Onion: My fav by far! I can taste the honey dijon and the sweet onions. Delicious!<br />Vinegar Splash: Lots of vinegar flavor!<br />Honey BBQ: More subtle in flavor, but very tasty.<br />Vintage Cheddar: Classic Cheese Curl flavor, light and salty.<br />Sea Salt: allows the potato flavor to shine through. Yum!<br />Jalapeno Trio: I liked this one the least, if I'm going to eat a flavor like this I would want something greasy with it, which would defeat the purpose of a healthy snack!

Nonetheless, I must say that they are enjoyable.  However, I still prefer BBQ and plain potato chips or fries.  They are not my favorite, but would make a good from time to time.  They have a strong tart vinegar flavor with a touch of salt.  The acid of vinegar may pair well with the bland or complement something less intense.

review/summary: Smart Fries taste great!
review/text: I purchased these for my kids. I am always purchasing alternatives for chips (that they love so much) and I stumbled upon these. I ordered the variety pack so the kids could experience different flavors and they were so happy when they ate them. I usually purchase Pop chips and Pop corners, but I thought these would be a fun change for my kids and I was right. After they each tried their own bag, they immediately told me how much they liked them and almost everyday during the Christmas break they wanted a bag for their afternoon snack. They have tried all the flavors in the variety pack and I have not heard any objections yet. I tried the sea salt, cheddar and salt and vinegar varieties and enjoyed the flavors of each. If you like Pop chips, then chances are you will like these too. Although the seasoning on the fries are not as intense as the flavoring on Pop chips, I still think these are an enjoyable snack for kids and adults.
