review/summary: Doesn't work
review/text: Lasted maybe 5 minutes before my 10 pound poodle puppy popped the cap off and tried to swallow the thing whole.  I put the cap back in and let it "dry" as someone on here suggested for a tigher seal.  But that did no good and in like 30 seconds he managed to pop it out again.  What a waste, sticking with my Kongs.

review/summary: great toy!
review/text: My dog needs attention almost 24-7... her favorite thing is to play fetch non stop.  I've been looking for toys that can keep her interest without me...I picked up the everlasting treat ball the last time I was in the pet stop... for the past two and a half days, she has played with this.  At first she spent 5 hours straight trying to lick the treat to death... it's still in there, a donut of a treat now... but since then, periodically she goes to town playing with it-- she throws it around the room like a kong, she carries it in her mouth (and she's only a 5lb chihuahua mix, so it's definitely a light toy), and she puts it between her paws and licks/chews it to death.  I've only had it for a few days, but I'm impressed with how long the treat part has lasted... I got one filler pack and I am going to get more!  These things are great... and I am imagining that on our next plane ride, this will come in handy.

review/summary: Everlasting Treat Does Not Last!
review/text: So we got this toy for our dog who gets bored easily, but loves treats. Unfortunately we left this "everlasting" treat ball with him for 15 minutes unsupervised and he managed to crack the large treat disc and gobbled it all up. We use the rubber toy now to fill it with kibble, a milkbone or jerky when we leave him in the apt by himself. It keeps him occupied for maybe 5-10 minutes because he knows he has to bite down in the center to crunch up the treats. It makes a huge mess so be warned. However, the pro to this toy is that it withstands his powerful chewing.

review/summary: Very Entertaining and Everlasting !
review/text: This treat ball lives up to it's name - Everlasting! !  My dog has destroyed many "indestructible" toys within 10-15mins of opening the package.  With everlasting treat ball, he has failed to destroy it (not for lack of trying though!).  This treat ball keeps him VERY entertained and engaged.  For many nights after we gave him his treat ball, we had to take it away from him to force him to sleep; otherwise he would have stayed awake all night chewing, playing, and licking on it.<br /><br />Certainly worth the investment!  Highly recommend this for "chewers" and dogs with an abundance of energy!

review/summary: My Dog Loves It but It's Not Perfect
review/text: I have a very smart, often bored Australian Shepherd. She's about 40 pounds and I'd consider her a moderate chewer. She's not really destructive, but if she wants something bad enough, she makes it hers. We affectionately call this her "puppy crack dispenser". She brings it to us to fill up when she's finished the discs and she's PUSHY about it. To say she's addicted is putting it mildly. It keeps her attention for an hour or so at a time, which is a godsend. Right there, it makes this purchase worth it for us. As a matter of fact, we've just bought our second one. Which brings me to the bad...<br /><br />In no way is this an everlasting sort of toy, not in the ball part and not in the disc part. The first one we got her lasted for about 3 months of HARD use which really isn't bad considering the abuse it's gone through. We've replaced it now that little bits of blue plastic have started coming off and now that she can pry the discs out way too easily. Just as it started to get easier to put them in, due to use, it meant it took her WAY less time to get them out. The refills are just too expensive for three hours of entertainment when it would take her a couple of days to pry them free when the ball is new.<br /><br />Also, the slits in the middle to insert smaller treats open too wide to make it much of a challenge for my girl to empty it, so we skip that part.<br /><br />Overall, the fact we've replaced this toy when it started to wear speaks volumes. She loves it and we love anything that keeps her happy and distracted from her velcro-like tendency to stick to us when we're trying to cook or putter around the house.

review/summary: A toy my puppy can't destroy!
review/text: I originally ordered a package of everlasting treats to see if my puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting, so I had my doubts if I'd buy many more seeing as they are expensive for an hour of chewing. The second one lasted her a couple of days, so I did purchase another pack. The next ones lasted her about 3 days each, so next I purchased the treat ball. She likes to play with it, but can't gobble up the treats. I've got 2 treats in the ball now, she's had it for several days, and everything is intact. She likes to play with it, it seems tough enough to withstand her chewing (4-1/2 mo. old, 45#, husky/g.shepherd). This is a toy we like with treats she enjoys. I wish the treats were made of something more nutritious, but I'm okay with her having them especially since she doesn't eat them in one sitting anymore. My puppy, Akiak, gives this product two paws up!

review/summary: Non-everlasting treat ball
review/text: I bought this for my daughter's dog. He is a hybrid, probably Australian cattle dog and Jack Russell and weighs less than 40 lbs. It took him all of 2 minutes to figure out that he could get the large treat out of the ball by getting one canine tooth under the edge and pulling. The second one came out even faster! The treats themselves did take him about 5-10 minutes to eat. As far as entertainment value and boredom relief while in his kennel? I couldn't even give it to him in the kennel because the ball itself was too easy to chew up once the treats were out of it.<br /><br />Not impressed, not worth the money, doesn't do what it's advertised to do, won't bother ordering more of the treats to fit it as they are quite expensive and I can keep him entertained longer with a Kong or Nyla Bone. Modification in design so the treat doesn't pop out so easily might fix it, but at this point, for the price, don't bother.  Waste of 20 bucks.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: This is a great product and virtually indestructible.  Our lab enjoys it and will chew it for hours and if I fill both sides it can last from a few hours to a few days depending on her mood.  However, our golden retriever does nothing more than sniff it and walk away.  She has very little interest in this toy. So it will depend on the dog but is definitely one of the few chew treats that isn't gone in less than 15 minutes.

review/text: I bought 2 of these balls for my black lab mixed mutts. They had the treats popped out of the balls in less than 5 mins, we kept putting them back in but 30 seconds later they had them out again. Finally gave up and just let them eat the treat but had to watch them since they were somewhat small and I was worried they might choke on them. It took them about 10 mins to finish off the treat. My dogs aren't even serious chewers and at $20 a pop for the ball and $7 for the treats this is a total rip off. I would rather just give them a rawhide chew for 3 bucks. Good concept, wish KONG would make one. I'm taking these back to the store tomorrow!

review/summary: Gone in 20 min
review/text: I have a 2 year old small rottweiler mix. When i bought this toy she was just shy of 1 1/2  and was chewing through everything so after chewing through our third red kong in the matter of a month I was getting desperate and decided to try the everlasting treat ball. I bought the large size to slow her down. In five min she plucked out the treat and devoured it. Since the toy itself must of still had the smell of the treat she proceeded to rip the ball itself apart. In the 20 min I left her alone with this toy it was in about 30 little pieces, and then i had the pleasure of finding more pieces as they came out the other end. Overall the only thing that can actually withstand her if a large black kong (she cracks them in about 2 months) and the nylabone (those last four months) but this treat ball is anything but everlasting.

review/summary: This thing is a Godsend
review/text: I own a 3 year old pemmy corgi and this thing is just the best thing since wet dogfood to him. If I put the ball with 2 treats in it in front of him, I know he is going to be busy for the next 2-3 hours just licking it. And if the ball is empty, he constantly drags the empty ball around the house to chew on...I think he's subtly hinting at me to get him more treats for it. He's not exactly mister super powerchew, but he can tear a wayward shoe up if one gets left of the floor. So having something to redirect his attention without the noise/danger of a nylabone (or the weird gross chips off an antler chew) is just fantastic.<br /><br />So far the vanilla mint and BBQ flavored treats are his all-time faves. The vanilla mint especially. I tried the liver treats and they smelled awful and he didn't seem as interested in them.<br /><br />There has been minimal staining. But we have mostly hardwood and he can't get on the large furniture fixtures 'cause of those little corgi legs. The few times there has been anything left over from the treat on a blanket/comforter, it's washed right out. And even then it was less of a stain and more of a smell.<br /><br />My friend has an older cocker spaniel who constantly futzes around the house. I told her to try these treats, and she was like, "No, nothing ever works and they're pretty expensive." So one day I brought her an everlasting treat to try. (My dog was obviously mad at me for dipping into his stash, but oh well.) Now, her dog is missing most of its teeth due to age, so I figured just the treat would be enough to occupy her. Aaaand sure enough, I was right. Dogs go crazy for these things if they're food motivated! My friend is totally going to buy a stock of these treats as well.<br /><br />The only, ONLY real downside to this is that one day my dog managed to pop the vanilla treat out and with his chewing it was gone in like 20 seconds. He's also got a sensitive stomach so his stomach was upset for a couple of days afterward. However! It's totally not the treat's fault my dog has stomach issues. I just think the ball could do with more suction to hold the treats in a little better. But that's the only time it happened. Like everyone else says, BUY A SIZE LARGER. I read the reviews here FIRST and then bought the large size for my corgi and it's worked out great.<br /><br />I see a lot of complaints here but the thing about buying ANYTHING for your dog, whether it be a treat, a brush, shampoo, etc. You have to KNOW your dog. If you know your dog can chew through a table-leg, it's probably going to be able to tear up the foam of this ball. If you KNOW your dog is NOT food motivated, then it's probably not going to be interested in what is essentially a giant flavored treat for more than 5 minutes.<br /><br />As for me? I'm 100% satisfied. I just wish the treats cost a little less so I could keep them around the house more.

review/summary: Just what the doctor ordered!
review/text: We have a 15lb, soon to be 9 year old, chihuahua, dachshund mix who is by no means a chewer but he is an OCD licker. He primarily licks his paws and he also has a slightly elongated soft palette so he often just licks the air if you will. He has a history of stress colitis and overall a very sensitive digestive system. So, I was given the task of trying to find him enrichment that was food incentivized (as he loves food/treats) but wouldn't hurt his digestive track.<br /><br />So, I ordered this ball and it arrived today. He's totally into it! We're hoping that because he can't really break down the treat inside the ball he'll just sit and lick and keep him pre-occupied. He's been at it an hour and so far hasn't made a dent, he's growling at it which is kind of entertaining. The ball came with two chicken treats included which I didn't realize so I ordered the digestive sensitive ones too. I am going to try the chicken to see how he reacts to it.<br /><br />I'll update my review in a few days ending overnight results. So far, it's a total hit! Also, I ordered the medium, when I opened the package I was kind of scared because it seemed large but watching him try and eat it makes me realize that it's the perfect size. Anything bigger or smaller wouldn't work. I hope this review helps, I think it's a great toy!<br /><br />UPDATE: We had no problems overnight or this morning. He's still working on the one from yesterday. His stomach doesn't seem upset and we slept through the night without constant licking! I think this will be my new gift for the holidays to family! A definite buy!

review/summary: Best Toy Ever!
review/text: We have a 50lb lab mix that needs to stay occupied or else she's constantly whining and barking. We go through tons of raw hide and bull sticks, but really needed something that could occupy her time for longer. This toy is it! We had a beautiful 3 hours of peace and quiet while she went at the treat. Because of the domed shape, there's no way for her to bite the treat out, so it stays put! After two hours she gnawed the treat down to a flat level and within another hour she'd managed to wear down the middle of the treat (so it looked like a donut)...but it was still securely held in the toy. I'd imagine it'll last another hour or so...ultimately she'll get 4 hours of enjoyment (and so will we) out this one treat. I can only imagine what would happen if we put a treat on each end!

So, just 4 days ago we got him the "HURLEY" made by WEST PAW DESIGN, and there is already chunks coming off of it. However, this was the very first toy we ever bought him, he chews on it everyday, and it has no marks on it. We used to buy the refills, but now we just put random treats in it and he loves it...If you are a dog owner, and you cannot find a toy to last, this is the toy you want, lasted longer than a KONG, its versatile and very enjoyable for the our boy. You will not be disappointed in this toy.

The large puck shaped things are too easy for my dog to remove so I load one of those and some dog biscuits into the ball once he gets the puck out I take that away.  Too much treat at one time for him.  He doesn't mind cause I think he likes his biscuits better anyway.  After tonight's 4 mile hike he is still into his everlasting... stuffing it with his normal biscuits keeps him entertained and preoccupied. He has brought it to me tonight about three times.  Each time I say Yep there is more... and toss it back to him...

review/summary: Everlasting depends on the dog!
review/text: I have two dogs that both like this toy. I'd rate it a 3 for one and a 5 for the other, so I've given it a 4 overall.  For one of my dogs, it's quite the challenge to get treats out of the center and he'll spend hours licking the outside "caps" if I put them on. And, even when he's done with the caps, he'll still lick the ball part getting every last scent of food off of it. For him, it is the perfct toy that amuses him for hours. For my other dog, she can literally pop the caps off and eat them in minutes. Inside treats take her a few more minutes to pop out. She's 15 lbs of pure chewing power with jaws of steel. Of the two of these balls that I own, one is starting to tear a bit in the center from her biting down to allow the treats to fall out.  Even though she can get the treats out and eat them quickly, I'm still rating it a 3 because she likes to play with the ball even when it's empty. Because it has flat sides, she can bounce it and it will roll, but usually stops before it goes under couches etc that will cause me to have to climb under the furniture to retrieve the toy for her. (That's always a plus!)The treats that the manufacturer sells to accompany this toy are rather pricey, so I will often substitute my own, more cost-efficient treats or dog-safe veggies/fruits. In short, I'd recommend this, but it's not a miracle toy that will stimulate every dog and dogs that do chew it a lot should be supervised for safety.

review/summary: Gives me some time out!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>We adopted a six year-old retired husky stud from a farm.  Tock came to our suburban DC home like a 60lb ball of energy and always wanted to run, run, run.  When at home he either slept or chewed our furniture.  We sprayed our furniture with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EI1BRO">NaturVet Bitter Yuck No Chew Spray</a> to make it taste bad and redirected his chewing tendencies towards this toy.  As you can see, he loves the toy and although he is NOT a food-motivated dog, it combined with the Bitter Yuck to stop him from destroying property.<br /><br />As per other reviews, the treat is indeed difficult for my hands to stuff into the toy (my fiance did it in the end). Tock has been trying to get the treat out for about a week and not yet succeeded.  The way he manipulates the toy simulates how he would gnaw marrow out of a bone, engaging his paws as well as his jaws.  As an additional benefit, he is also less obsessed with running now, as you can see from the video.  The product does not smell or become sticky.  It is an outstanding product.

Unfortunately, she had the treat portion out of the rubber holder in less than 5 minutes and our other dog (who, incedentally is food motivated) was eating it, and she was soon looking for something else to chew on as a puppy. The rubber "holder" makes a great throw toy, and is a good food pacer in the bowl of the other dog. It's also good to put a greenie through so they don't eat them too quickly. It is not an everlasting treat at all.

review/summary: Great for my lab mix!
review/text: I have a 2 year old black lab mix who is very destructive to most toys that she encounters.  Kongs are very well made, but do not hold her interest for long.  I tried the Everlasting treat ball after checking reviews, because it is a bit of an investment, especially if it is something my dog would get bored with easily or be able to destroy.<br />She loves this toy!  The first day, she was at it for 2 hours, enjoying the everlasting treat stuck inside.  We had to take it away from her so she would go outside!  The material is very tough and she seems to be able to not penetrate it.  She is able to carry it in her mouth (she tries to drop it to make the treat pop out, but it has stayed intact).  I highly recommend this toy to keep a large, strong dog happily occupied.

review/summary: Really depends on the dog
review/text: I bought this after seeing my greyhound going crazy for it at the vet's office. But now that he has one, he couldn't care less about trying to eat the treat disk that came with the product. However, he does like the dry kibble that I stuff in the bottom. But for that purpose alone, I suggest getting a large gatorade bottle and using a knife to make a small hole on the side.

review/summary: Medium is too small for my 37 pound dog!
review/text: I was very disappointed when my dog had the everlasting treat out within 5 minutes.  And when I put it back in and let it dry, he had already figured it out and popped it out in seconds.<br /><br />I think this is because it was too small for him.  It says for dogs "under 40 lbs", and my dog is a little shy of that mark.  The large looked really big and the product says that medium is good for under 40lbs... Apparently not though.  Since he could get his mouth around the edge of the toy, he could pop out the everlasting treat.<br /><br />Not sure it's a bad product, just maybe the wrong size.  But now I'm too scared of wasting $20 on the large in case that's a dud too.

review/summary: Wonderful product
review/text: I have 2 black lab mix dogs (littermates).  They are now 2 years old.  They didn't tell me when I got them that part of the mix was beaver.  These dogs can chew anything.  If it squeaks, it takes on average 10 seconds from being new to being destroyed.  Don't even get me started on toys that have stuffing.  Within the last two weeks, I've started allowing them to be uncrated in my house without me there.  Previously, they were completely untrustworthy, but I feel really guilty crating them while I'm at work.  And I thought they were acting more grown up.  Not chewing my stuff, just theirs.  So, I came home one day to find a highlighter destroyed (on carpeting, of course).  The next day the victim was one of their dog beds that they'd always left alone.  So, out of desperation I tried this product (and paid way more than the price at Amazon at a local pet store).  These things are AWESOME.  They keep their attention for hours and a treat lasts for about 2 days.  My one dog loves hers so much that she's like obsessed with it.  And the material it's made of seems to be unchewable to them (which I initially worried about, having not found anything in nature or manmade that they couldn't destroy).  I love these things.

review/summary: Victory is mine! (and Everlasting Treat Ball)
review/text: I have 2 retrievers (7 months and 1 year) and they are basically 60 pounds of raging teeth.  They destroy virtually every dog toy (not to mention legos, briefcases, shoes, ethernet cables, small trees, socks, ... you get the picture)  that comes through the house in about 10 minutes.  They have never been interested in Kongs and rawhides just only hold their attention for so long.<br /><br />I found these at the store last week and bought a couple.  My dogs won't leave them alone.  They love the "snack balls" that come in them and they withstand hours and hours of chewing.  Even my 13-year-old sheltie who doesn't even like chew toys likes these things... My only complaint?  The petsmarts in my area can't keep them in stock so I have to order online.<br /><br />If your dog/puppy is a chewing machine... get these toys... lots of them... keep them in the crate, the living room, anywhere your dog hangs out.  The shoes you save may be your own!<br /><br />BTW, to get them interested, you want to find something soooooooo doggie delicious for the inside... give your dog a taste and smell of that before you stuff it in the middle.  Then stuff it in the middle and put the "caps" on. also, be sure to let the caps "dry" before giving them to your dog or the caps pop right off (you have to moisten them to make the pop in easier)

She plucked that treat plug right out of the treat ball ball in less than 10 minutes and devoured the treat within 15.  Not good.<br /><br />HOWEVER! I placed an apple slice within the middle compartment of the ball and she was challenged for a little less than an hour to get all the apple pieces out.  If anything entertains her for more than a half an hour, it's amazing!

review/summary: My dog is obsessed with this ball
review/text: I went on Amazon looking for some type of dog chew or hard food that would take a long time for my dog to get through, but not so hard that she would give up.  She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes.  I wanted to find something to cut into her boredom and downtime, but not add a lot of calories.<br /><br />The first day I put it together (took about one minute) and rolled it across the floor.  She slowly took after it, investigated, and I went to make dinner.  I enjoyed my first dinner at home in about a year that didn't involve my dog staring at me hoping for a handout.  She just obsessed over the ball, licking it, and grinding at it with her teeth.  After dinner I checked it, and she had made what appeared to be almost negligible progress on the treat.  We watched a movie in peace (other than this constant weird panting/slurping noise from the other room).  At some point, we realized she had been working on this thing for about three hours.  My wife checked her mouth, she was afraid her gums would be bleeding or that her teeth would be ground down to the gums.  But no sign of damage.  We took it away from her and put it on top of the fridge, and she sat there staring up at the fridge for about half an hour.<br /><br />I'm now on my third day, about three hours a day, still working on the first two discs that fit on opposite sides of the ball.  I think maybe she's gotten through about half of it.  She's actually penetrated one of the discs with a hole that goes all the way through.  She's obsessed.  While she has it, she doesn't want to do anything else.  If I go to pet her (which she normally loves) she treats me as an irritant keeping her from her ball.  Want to walk (normally her favorite thing)?  Nope.  Maybe after I'm done with this ball in another 16 hours I'll walk.  I wonder how long she would be on this ball if I let her?  Her jaws must be cramping up.  I get the feeling I could give it to her, go to bed, and wake up to see her with bloodshot eyes still working on the ball.  It's like crystal meth for dogs.<br /><br />Oh my god, while I'm writing this my dog accidentally rolled the ball under a table and she can't get to it.  She looks like an alcoholic staring at a drink they can't reach.  I actually feel sorry for her.  It's almost 9pm and she's been on this thing since 6pm.<br /><br />Anyway, for my dog, this was exactly what I was looking for.  I give it 5 stars.

review/summary: FINALLY a treat for my dog that lasts!
review/text: I am so glad that I purchased this item for my dog.  I have a golden retriever that is a very aggressive chewer. I cannot begin to count the number of toys, chews and/or treats I've bought for him that claim to be for aggressive chewers, only to be devoured or torn into shreds in less than an hour.  I hesitated in purchasing this item because of the price (I'm obviously tired of brands not living up to their description) but I am very happy to say that my dog worked well over 4 hours before the treats were gone.  He loved the taste of them and due to the design, they were challenging for him to get out so he really had to work on it.  Another thing I liked was the fact that the ball itself isn't hard, but feels gel-like and that is appealing to him.  This is by far one of the best things I've bought for him and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog that loves to chew!<br />UPDATE: Still a challenge for my dog after many months...he has figured out how to pop out the treat but I now insert it upside down so that the treat is concave instead of convex and that has worked very well.

review/summary: Be sure to order appropriate size
review/text: I am obsessed with researching stuff and I was nervous about ordering such a spendy dog toy.  I am very happy I did!  I originally purchased a small for my 10 lb wire fox terrier puppy (chews on EVERYTHING-he's teething), after getting it home I realized how some folks would have problems w/their dog popping out the treats too fast.  IMO, order the largest size your dog can have fun with.  I exchanged the small for a medium and it's worked out great. This way, he can't get his jaws around it and he can't pop the treats out-he just licks it to death, rolls it everywhere and growls at it b/c he can't get to the treats-which is the whole point of the toy. Like the reviewers before-know your dog and order bigger.  I have also read that you can put the refill treats in upside down to make it more difficult.  Hope this helps!

review/summary: Chew-Zilla was denied destruction
review/text: I have a year and a half old chocolate Labrador retriever, Loki, that chews and chews hard. I bought this toy because a neighbor who has a yellow lab has had the same toy for over a year.  I can buy a toy and Loki will have it broken or severely damaged within minutes.  It's easy to kiss 10 dollar toys good bye in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br /> I have had the product for about a month and it is by far Loki's favorite toy, even without treats.  I have played tug of war, fetch, and other dog favorite games; the ball-like object is in perfect condition still.  He will carry the toy about the house in his mouth, very regal and proud looking, as if he's King In The Castle.<br /><br />Some dog toys over time will gain a very bad odor.  After a month of constant use, this thing does not give off an odor that I can tell.  I won't put my nose or mouth near it, but from a couple of feet away, it still seems to smell like new.  If this ever gains an odor of some sort, I will probably resort to washing it and then adding some vanilla extract to the water to give it a humanly pleasant flavor.  I have done this for other toys and Loki seems to have a renewed interest in them.<br /><br />I have not allowed him to take the toy outside as we have several feet of snow and that would just be begging to be lost.  Based on the design, this thing will be a dirt magnet on the inside, especially since my backyard is in quasi-woods with zero grass.<br /><br />The treats that came with it seemed to be enjoyable for Loki.  It took him about an hour and a half to eat.  He didn't figure out how to pop them out as some people have stated.  He just gnawed and licked it the whole time.  The treats are a bit expensive, as I can buy raw hides or real bones for less.<br /><br />Peanut butter is your friend.  Smear some on the inside and Loki goes crazy trying to lick and clear it.  You can break up dog treats or put dog food in it and it will slow them down.  Loki has become an expert at getting them out, removing them in less than a minute.<br /><br />With all of that said and done, I would highly recommend this treat to anyone who has a dog that can truly chew.  It has held up over a month, which is very rare for a dog toy, and it has done so with not a scratch or gouge to the toy which has never been done.  I put these on the same level as the dog toys from Old Navy!

review/text: The Everlasting Treat Ball is a great concept but poorly executed. The Everlasting Treat end caps come off very easily with a minimum amount of slobber. My puppy would lick them (because I'm sure they taste great) and within 5 minutes, the caps were off of the ball. The soft rubber makes it very easy to get them out this way. And they're a little too expensive to be made so poorly.<br /><br />My puppy loves to chew the ball to get any inner treats and food out, but there are better products on the market for that. Very disappointing product.

review/summary: Love the ball, treats not so much
review/text: I bought this for my Boston Terrier, Cookie, who can destroy most toys in less than an hour.  I thought the idea of a treat inside would slow her down a little.  Unfortunately, the treat did not suit her finicky palate, and she simply worked it out of the ball and left it on the floor.  The ball itself, however, has turned out to be Cookie-proof.  Months after the purchase, she still plays with it.  It bounces nicely, and doesn't roll under the furniture as much as other balls.  I've also found that if I stuff it with her regular treats (small bits of chicken jerky) or her kibble, it does keep her occupied for a while.  Although she chews on it, I can find very little evidence of toothmarks, so whatever this is made of is pretty strong.  I would give this more stars if it was easier to load, but then it would probably be easier for her to un-load.  Overall, a tough little toy, and one of Cookie's favorites.  A little pricey, but hey, she's worth it!

The other dog in the house, a border collie mix, has it gone in maybe twenty minutes.<br /><br />I bought it thinking it would be worth the price if it lasted a couple days, but if you have a dog that can consume a medium sized rawhide bone in one sitting, you are probably going to find that these are not "everlasting".<br /><br />Aside from wishing the treats would last longer / be cheaper, it is a good product, and the dogs love it.  But at a cost of $4 per treat there are other options out that last longer.

review/summary: Everlasting ball, but not everlasting fun
review/text: I bought the medium ball for my 5 year old lab mix as a Christmas gift. She's a hard core chewer so I was looking for something that would not be destroyed in one day... or in 10 minutes. She was happy to get it and plopped herself on the floor and starting chewing on the treats. It took her only 5 minutes to pop one treat out and start going to town on it. Dang, so much for the challenge. Maybe she was just lucky is what I thought, so I put the treat back in the ball and went to the bathroom to wash my hands and came back in under a minute or two and the treat was out yet again. So now I'm just letting her gnaw at the one treat which she's been at for over 15 minutes. I'm going to try buying the everlocking treats for the ball next to see if they're more of a challenge. But if that doesn't prove to last longer than 30 minutes or longer I'm not sure the whole product is worth it. For how easy the treats pop out and how expensive they are to purchase it might not be worth it in the long run. Oh well, I guess what matters the most is that my dog is happy with the ball treats or no treats.

For $20 I bought this, took it home and had hope for about 7 minutes.  She got the treat out, and I messed up by pushing it in too hard, and getting it stuck in between the 2 sides.  (In theory, this was the most amount of time the toy went without having the treat popped out.)  After she licked at that for a while, I was able to push the treat out and get it back to the place that it belonged.  Pop. Pop. Pop.  She is now a pro treat grabber, who can get these everlasting discs out within 3 seconds flat. 2 if you don't count the time she sniffed at it.  Now I have a $20 ball to play fetch with.

review/summary: Hooray for the Treat Ball!
review/text: My sister's youngest son had a pacifier which was nicknamed "Pluggy", which would keep him content for long stretches of time - and this is the doggy equivalent.<br /><br />I have a 17 pound Bedlington Terrier, for whom I purchased a Medium sized Everlasting Treat Ball, and we _both_ love it.  The "everlasting" treats that come with the ball were okay, but when they were in the ball she would lose interest because they were just too difficult to make any headway on, and when they were outside the ball she'd just chew them up in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />The real fun is putting small treats inside it (I use Charlee Bear brand turkey liver and cranberry treats which are about the size of a lima bean) and watching her go.<br /><br />There are several ways to get at them, she's discovered - rolling by poking it with her nose will sometimes yield results - smacking it with her paw is also sometimes lucky - and squeezing it with her jaws, which she can _barely_ do.  I think this is the secret - if she had a small she would be _too_ successful, and that would take the challenge out of it.<br /><br />I've had this for over a year, and it has sustained pretty much no damage, although shoes, electronics, socks and other items around our house had been completely destroyed before its arrival.  She can carry it sideways by biting on the flat part - the only problem is that we spend a lot of time looking for it when it gets hidden under things.  She knows the phrase Treat Ball by heart - and will usually go find it when asked - in order to get a refill - except when it has gotten into somewhere she is afraid or unable to go.  I'm buying another one so hopefully we can cut our hunting time in half.<br /><br />TREAT BALL RULES!

review/text: Bought this at big box store and spent mega for it, but my Mal loves it. She chews on the treat until she gets a hole in the end of it, then slams it to empty the treats inside. Only down side is when she throws it, look out!She is a heavy duty chewer with powerful jaws, but can't get her jaws  completely around the large size toy. If she could, she would probably destroy it to get treats. She loves it and will go get it when it is empty so I can refill it.  I don't know if they are all the same, but it is hard to get the treat top onto her toy (I leveraged it with a screwdriver) this may be why she doesn't simply pry the treat "lid" out. It sure isn't because she isn't clever enough to do so. I more think she just can't get the right leverage because of the size of the toy. She can spend hours with it. Great toy.

review/summary: long lasting
review/text: I have owned this product for about 6 years now.(have never bought replacement still the original) and It is still going strong.  This is the only toy that has lasted!  My 7yr old (70lb)hound mix uses it everyday.  My only compliant is the "plugs" don't last more than 1 1/2 days and are pricy for something so short lived. I love the fact that I can still use the product without the "plugs" and can fill it with anything I want(you don't have to buy specialty treats)from apples to chicken jerky to dog bisquits, dog food..... We simply stuff the inside every nite for her bedtime snack and she loves it! I would highly recommend this product if you have an avid chewer!

review/summary: My dogs LOVE these treats!
review/text: The first time I purchased these, my older dog just took right to it. So, I purchased a smaller one for my puppies. They go crazy over these. I thought perhaps they would chew the crud out of the rubber, but no! They shred any other toy within seconds. They could lick on these for hours! Only problem is, I wasn't able to reload them?? I was having a heck of a time but finally go the small one reloaded, forget about the large one. I just ended up giving them the treat not in the ball!! And that is an expensive treat to get demolished in a matter of minutes. It lasts longer if I can get it in the ball of course. I wish I could find another treat that they could chew on, that lasted and was less expensive. If anyone has an idea on an easy way to load the ball-post-it. Maybe I just got an extra stiff one. lol

review/summary: Fantastic Product
review/text: When I got my miniature Labradoodle puppy, the breeder recommended getting one of these.  I am so glad I did.  This will entertain your dog for hours.  The inserts are a little expensive but well worth the price for the amount of time your dog will enjoy this product.  So far she has not been able to damage the ball itself, after 8 months.  For me that means it should last about two years or more before I have to replace it.  For a puppy/dog toy that is "everlasting".  I love it and highly recommend it.  Just a note: my dog is small and the medium size ball seems perfect.

review/summary: If you can only buy one dog toy, make it this one!
review/text: We have a two year old miniature pinscher and a one year old papillion. During the first four months that we had them, these two literally chewed holes in my kitchen walls (yes,walls!!!) and rounded the corners of all of my cabinets. That's the thanks I got for penning them in the kitchen while we were in bed or at work. No toy had ever survived more than an hour, especially with the minpin. The Everlasting Treat Ball helped to turn that all that around. We bought all three sizes and they play with them all. They both love the treats that are marketed to go with the toy, but the minpin pops them out way too easily (even the large ones), so I usually just stick with filling the inside with carrot pieces, dog cookies, or even just a handful of their regular food. It keeps them busy for hours of destruction-free chewing. If I really need them to be good for a while, I smear a little peanut butter in it. I pop the toys in the dishwasher once a week with no ill effects. The only real negative that I can say is that they are pretty expensive and hard to find in the pet stores.  Also, I don't bother with the (expensive) plug-in cookies that they sell unless I know that the papillion is the only one that will be working on it (she's a much lighter chewer than the minpin). If it were just the papillion, the "cookie" would last several days.  Over all, great product for destructive chewers!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I found this at my local petstore and bought it on impulse.  One of my boxers figured out how to pop the treat out and instead focused her attention on devouring the treat (takes a good 15 minutes).  The other boxer was content to chew the toy with the treat still in it.  Both of them like to nose it around and wait for treats to fall out.  I'm still finding the balance between a treat small enough to fall out and a treat that stays in and keeps their interest for longer.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: I bought this toy for  my 1 1/2 year old corgi, I bought the medium sized. The "everlasting treat" lasted about 2 minutes, but the blue portion is GREAT. I have been stuffing dried chicken chews in there or even a medium sized soft treat and it takes my dog at least an hour to get it all out. He love the toy and it keeps him busy for a long time. Skip buying the treat refills because they are too easy for the dog to pop out and gobble down, just buy a fairly large, hard treat and wedge it in there and then it becomes "everlasting". I bought mine at Pet Club and it was MUCH cheaper than amazon and petsmart. The medium size was I think $14.99 and the treat refills were something like $3.00. This is my favorite "interactive" toy so far and it keeps my dog busy the longest with the smallest amount of treats.

review/text: Neat concept...but disappointing results.  Our dog figured this toy out very quickly.  I agree with the other poster, it is hard to load the treats, so I do not know how a dog can get them out so quickly.  The fun only lasted for at most 2 minutes.  She still plays with the blue part of the toy every now and then, just with no treats.

review/text: I have a lab/hound mix (9 months old) that eats everything and destroys everything within a matter of minutes.  I have bought many other toys advertised as "almost indestructible" to have them chewed up and ruined.  I was not expecting much from this toy.  Well it has been over two hours and my pup is still going strong.  Not only that but when it was time for his walk he ran out, did his business and wanted to return right away to his new toy!  I would definitely recommend it and I plan on buying refills tomorrow!

review/text: Got this for my 9-yr-old Australian shepherd.  I also bought the orange one for the younger dog.  Both dogs were able to remove the treats from the balls in under 10 minutes. (It took me at least 5 minutes to put the treat in.) I'm glad I tried it, but won't get any more.  Neither of my dogs is a very aggressive chewer...just very clever.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I purchased this to give my dog something to do while he is in his crate while we are away at work. Just to see if he liked it I gave it to him earlier today, he's chewed on it nonstop for hours. I actually took it away from him a few times because he seemed to get a crazied addiction to it and probably should have breaks.  He's never shown any sign of toy or food aggression before but boy he did not like when we took it away.<br /><br /> I would say that after about 4hrs of a 6 month lab chewing on it, it probably has a few more days before we need more of the discs. There is not a single tooth mark on the blue rubber piece. Overall I think this is a really quality product that he has a blast playing with and hopefully will never get bored of and we can use for years to come. Most of all I enjoy the freedom of having something that holds his attention longer than 5 minutes, I like that he is now able to be out of his crate while we watch a movie or do chores and not worry about him wandering off and getting into stuff.

review/summary: NOT for heavy chewers!!!
review/text: I bought the Everlasting Treat Ball (Large sized) for my 45 lb mixed breed dog, who is an aggressive chewer. This is the same dog that went through a red Kong in a day, and a Kong Extreme in a few months, and will liquefy any tennis ball in seconds. I heard great reviews on this and read about it in a book as well, and after MONTHS of debate decided to pick this up at my local pet store when it was on sale. I just gave it to her less than 20 minutes ago and she already has several chunks out of it.<br /><br />It did "challenge" her for a few minutes, as I put kibble and treats inside. She got the disk out in a few minutes and enjoyed that (chicken flavor) then went crazy getting at the food inside. So crazy, that she has taken several chunks out of the plastic already. And eaten them. Great. She did seem to have fun rolling it around getting the food out, but then went to chewing on the plastic.<br /><br />For a replacement, I got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YHTYC">Everlasting Fun Ball Large</a> in large from the same company- and its been over a week so far and she loves that toy!!! Its basically the same thing as this instead it is actually a green ball with more room for treats inside, and made of more durable material. Also, unlike the treat ball, it does not have any ridges for my dog to bite into and rip pieces off. And, its a bit cheaper. I'm writing this after I've had that ball for at least 6 months, and she plays with it EVERY DAY and there isn't even a mark in the thing.<br /><br />So, all in all, skip this and go for the FUN BALL instead!!!

review/summary: Lucy Loves It
review/text: Yup, the title says it all.  My pup loves her new toy and will work on it for an hour or so then fall asleep with it.<br /><br />To avoid inserting a new treat disc from becoming a frustrating challenge, work one side of the treat into the groove and then push to "pop" in the other side.  There is also an interior cavity where you can hide additional treats or kibble for more play or if you decide not to buy additional discs.<br /><br />Even though the price point of this toy is a bit steep the item is very durable.  My pup, Lucy, is a chewer and will rip apart fire-hose toys in no time.  After a week of chewing and playing with the Everlasting Treat Ball it's still looking as good as new.  This makes it a winner in my book.

review/text: My 5 month old mini-doxie looooves this ball/treat! The name is a misnomer - this isn't an everlasting treat, but it is long lasting (the treat part lasted about a month of on-and-off playing). Even though the treat is gone, the blue toy-part rolls and bounces well and the size and shape of it is perfect for fetch with my puppy. This toy must be popular in my town, the treat refills for the small size are sold out at my local PetSmart! Ordering some refills (for a cheaper price, yay) from Amazon now.

review/summary: Choking Hazard?
review/text: I have a 60lb Boxer/Cane Corso mix who is a pretty aggressive chewer. The only toys he hasn't torn to pieces are Kong and Nylabone toys. Aside from that, I bought him an Everlasting Treat Ball and was disappointed, especially for as much as it cost. He was able to start tearing the rubber apart, but that's not what concerned me at all. I was concerned about the treats that go in them. He was able to pop those treats out with one good bite, even if I put them in upside down, which is not fun since the treats get so slimy. I was concerned about him choking and the treats themselves are hard as rocks. I tried to break them up with a hammer, but they wouldn't break! I even tried to soak them in water and then break them up so he could at least eat the treats, but they still wouldn't break.<br /><br />If you have a dog who is not an aggressive chewer, then I think these toys would be great entertainment, just beware of a choking hazard if they can pop the treats out! For owners who have aggressive chewers, I would surpass this toy completely.

review/summary: Not Quite Everlasting...
review/text: My two Siberian Huskies were able to remove the Everlasting Treat Refill from the ball within about 15 minutes and devour the treat in short order.  I won't bother buying additional "Not-So-Everlasting" refills, but I was able to place different types of treats in the ball - including Iams dog biscuits, Trader Joe's beef rolls (broken into smaller pieces), and freeze dried liver training treats.  The treat balls are a softer texture than a Kong toy, but still quite durable.

review/text: I love this toy it keeps my dog busy for a long while.  He has not been able to get the top off without help.  He's a year old Gordon Setter who has broken beef bones open!  When I am out of the refills I use turkey hot dogs and place them inside.  It keeps him busy for quite a while.  He's VERY food motivated and hotdogs are a favorite. He is able to get his tongue inside for a taste and nibble pieces of it, but cannot get the whole piece out easily. We have a large one and I think it will help him through the rest of puppyhood and for a long while to come.

review/summary: Horrible business model.
review/text: I don't know how StarMark makes any money.  Other dog toy manufacturers make weak, flimsy things that my 75 lbs. pit bull chews to shreds in seconds - so I have to constantly buy new ones.  However, my friend (another pitty owner) gave us the large Everlasting Treat Ball and even after three years, its the only toy my dog hasn't destroyed - it's his favorite.  The inner cavity is pretty roomy, and the material is strong enough to withstand some pretty determined gnawing.  If you have a really smart breed, they'll managed to figure out how to free treats after some pretty intense studying, but even after that this toy is useful for many more play activities.

review/text: I got this toy hoping for something that would last longer than 10 minutes which was the max it took our German Shepherd to chew up any bone ever given to him.  It does!!  It wouldn't last all day if I just let him chew on it as much as he wants but it lasts so much longer than anything else we've ever given to him.  I also have a smaller dog who could chew on it for hours and hours.  Totally worth it.  If you have a major chewer don't expect it to last and last and last but expect it to last a lot longer than any other chew.

However, when the treat ball arrived, they fought over it so I had to buy another one!  Unfortunately, they still bicker over them, which is odd because my dogs NEVER fight with each other so we'll see.  It may be a toy that only gets put down when I am home to watch them.  But judging by their behavior, this treat ball is the greatest thing ever!

She got the insert that comes with this ball out pretty quickly, but I've found that a Snausage or other large treat in the center will entertain her for an hour easily. The ball shows no sign of wear and tear yet, and my heavy chewer uses it at least 3 or 4 hours a day every day. Best treat/toy I've gotten for her yet, I'd defiantly buy it again.

review/summary: Good stimulation but has its flaws...
review/text: We have both a medium and a large version of this toy.  We initially bought the medium for our Presa Canario (Bella) when she was a puppy. She had a great time nibbling and trying to get the treat out but was unable to. We lost the toy and a couple months.  Later when we found it, our puppy had grown considerably and could easily pop the treats out and attempt to swallow them whole.  As a result, we decided the toy was too small for her and gave it to our Norwegian Elkhound (Nikki) who also loved it.  It took her several hours but she was also able to pop the treats out but being a mature dog knew better than to try to swallow them whole.<br /><br />Later, we decided to buy the large one for Bella and she absolutely had a blast with it.  After hours she would be able to pop the treat out but we pop it back in and she would have to work at it some more.<br /><br />I would say this is a great toy for dogs that need stimulation and like to chew and rip things up.  Although the treat can be popped out by both of our dogs the ball itself has survived several refills and weeks of play.  This is not a toy i would leave the dog unattended with.  If you do leave them unattended they will probably pop the treat out and eat it the first day you get it.  Keep an eye on them and be there to grab the treat and pop it back in and they will get hours of focused play with this toy.<br /><br />It is much more difficult to get the treats out of the large toy so even if you have a smaller dog it is a good idea to go ahead and get the larger version. Bella and Nikki definitely would recommend this toy. They both love it.<br /><br />One small downside other than the treats popping out, the dogs do quite a bit of drooling with this toy.  In the case of Bella, we had to establish that it was a toy she could only have while in the kitchen so that she wouldn't drool all over the living room carpet.<br /><br />In addition, the replacement treats are a bit expensive considering the amount of time they take the dog to consume. In short, i gave this 4 stars because although your dog is virtually guaranteed to have a great time with it, it's not every day toy.

review/summary: Great product, even better customer service!
review/text: I did think this was a little pricey for a dog toy that might be destroyed within minutes, but I took a chance anyway.  I am glad I did...my dog loves this thing.  He was able to get the caps that came with it out quickly, but when I bought replacements they looked to be a little different texture and he has not popped these out yet.  He also loves it when I put treats inside for him to chew out which I do without using the caps.<br /><br />I did have an issue after about a month when I purchased the new caps.  Since he was not able to pop the caps out (which he shouldn't be able to do), he was chewing constantly and did cause a couple of scissor like cuts in the rubber with his teeth.  It's not bad, but it could result in rubber chunks coming off.  I wasn't sure if anything could be done, but I contacted the customer service of the company that makes this and they were extremely helpful.  They replied to my email same day (that never happens!) and they did say that they have had a few cases where this has occured in the rounded edge of the ball.  They also said they were sending me their everlasting fun ball free of charge as that type of toy might work better.  Wow!  That's customer service.

review/text: I got this toys for my pom/corgi mix, thinking it would be a nice alternative to her Kong which doesn't really hold onto treats (she's really good at getting dry treats out in 2 minutes flat).  She was able to pop the treats out very quickly, and unlike one of the other reviewers, they don't really last. She chewed them up very quickly.  I wish I would have gotten a bigger size, one so the little everlasting treat would last longer, and two so that I could put more loose treats inside, and three in the hopes that she has a harder time biting down on the treat (which pops the sides out).<br /><br />All in all, I think the rubber is high quality grade, but nothing beats a Kong when it comes to price and the number of ways you can stuff it to make a treat last!

review/summary: Great to keep busy
review/text: All three of my dogs love this toy. I have used other treat toys (i.e. Kong, tricky treat ball, buster food cube, canine genius) but this is their favorite and last the longest. My Mini Aussie is a tough chewer and she has not been able to destroy this. (Wish I could say the same for our furniture, base boards and several toys!) I put disks in both side and fill the middle with kibble or other treats. It takes them a couple of days until all the treats are gone. Great for when we have guests or want to sit down and watch a movie. I love it, love it, love it!!! It is important to get the right size. I use the small on my 8lb dog and the medium on my 14 lb terrier and 17 lb mini aussie. I agree it is not the best for crate training, for that I would stick to the Kong because you don't need space to roll it around to get the treats out. But for everything else, this is the best treat toy!

review/summary: Good, but get the right size
review/text: We got the smallest size for our maltese/bichon mix who is about 13 lbs, and he was able to pop out the 'cap' within minutes... and we are pretty sure he ate the whole cap.  So then we went out and got the large size, and he is IN LOVE.  He's actually so addicted to it, I worry a bit! Moral to the story is, make sure you get a size large enough that your dog cannot squeeze the entire thing to pop out the cap!<br /><br />My other little dog (6 lb yorkiepoo) likes the smallest size just fine, but doesn't seem to care a whole lot for the 'caps' themselves; instead he likes it when I stuff Bil Jac treats into the ball.<br /><br />Both are pretty destructive chewers, but so far so good.  Personally I find the caps stinky and it smells up the room... but if it makes my boyz happy, then I'm willing to tolerate the smell.

review/summary: Lasts a long time
review/text: Got these for my two papillon pups who are always looking for something to get into/destroy.  They love their Ziggies and Lobos but they fly through them so fast - they're gone in under 5 minutes!  I wanted something that would keep them busy for a while.<br /><br />They definitely love the taste of these treats, and they have a fun time playing with the toy.  The only complaint I had was that they were able to pop the treats out with ease, which is why I gave this 4 stars rather than 5. It isn't a big deal, I'll just pop them back in, but I find myself having to do so pretty often.  Even when they do pop the treats out, they chew on them, and they still last!  They finally started destroying the toy itself after a couple of weeks (and a few treat refills).  The inside of the plastic is beginning to rip, but given that many other toys/treats they have last no more than 5 or so minutes, I was pleased with this.

review/summary: Not everlasting - caution leaving dogs without supervision
review/text: I have a Lab who is a moderate chewer (toys only). I gave her the treat ball one day for about 45 minutes and then took it away for bedtime.  The second time I gave her the ball with the same treat, she had the treat out in about a half hour and ate the whole treat in minutes. I would not recommend leaving your pooch with this without supervision - once she removed it, the treat was big enough that my dog could have choked on it while eating it.

review/summary: Looked neat, but disappointing
review/text: I thought this looked like a pretty neat toy, so I bought one.  Like the above reviewer, my dogs couldn't deal with the treat that covers one end of the ball.  They licked it a few times, pushed the ball around a few times, and that was it.  They could not figure out how to get out the little treats inside, because there are flaps covering the opening, which you bend to pop in the little treats.  These flaps keep the little treats from falling out when the ball moves, but they were just thick enough so that my dogs couldn't figure out how to push them aside to get at the treats.<br /><br />In all fairness, my dogs are chihuahuas--the biggest is about 7 pounds -- and a larger dog may very well have more fun with this.  Sadly, my dogs just seem to be too small for the small size.

review/summary: Everlasting Treat Ball - My Dog Destroyed It On The Ride Home
review/text: I bought an everlasting treat ball because everyone told me how wonderful they are, and I have a Jack Russell Terrier who is fairly calm for the breed, but does tend to have a bit of a seperation anxiety problem as soon as I leave.  I got it yesterday, popped the caps on either end of the ball, and gave it to him on the five mile ride back to my apartment.  By the time I had gotten home, he had already popped one of the caps off and chewed it up, so I took that one away and popped the third cap on, and gave it back to him, and both caps were off and eaten within probably fifteen minutes of being at home.  I am completely unimpressed, I spent over $16 on these treats and the ball, and the Everlasting Treat ball was useless in a matter of minutes.  I still really like the idea of this product, but the ball itself needs to be manufactured in a way that would really grip the treats a lot better.

review/summary: My dog is just way too smart...
review/text: So I got this for my Belgian Malinois who is ball-crazy and always destroys both plushy toys and kongs alike. A friend of mine who has a large shepherd said her dog loved to toss it around the house, chew on the treat on the inside, repeat. He absolutely loved it. In hopes mine would love it the same, I got it. BOTH treats were out of the ball in about five minutes(not exaggerating!) but lucky me my dog loved the bounce the ball had and continued to play with it. I put some rolled cooked bacon mixed with raw beef in the very center of it, and he is hard at work right now trying to pry it out of the center. Overall it was a good buy, but not because of the "challenge". Only because my dog loves the ball itself. I wouldn't purchase the treat inserts again, thats for sure!

review/summary: Not So Everlasting
review/text: I bought two of these treat balls for two large breed dogs.  One, (my power chewer) is a German Shepherd/Wolf mix, the other is a Vizsla/lab mix who isn't easily impressed by chew toys.  I filled the inside of the ball with small treats, and capped both ends with the round treats provided.  On the upside when they were actively chewing on the treat balls, they were fully absorbed, and were extremely happy with them.  In about an hour and a half both dogs had chewed the everlasting out of at least one side of each of their treat balls.  By three hours there were no treats left in either of them.  Since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy I then took the balls away so they wouldn't destroy those too.  The treats give off a nauseating smell as the dogs are chewing them as well, to the point I had to turn on a fan, and even left the room.  I wouldn't recommend this product due to the high price tag, and the fact that it just doesn't deliver on it's name.

She loves the ball so I will probably put her biscuits in the very inside and let her play with it that way. I regret spending so much on this toy.

review/text: I have a shep/akita mix, but I bought this more for my coonhound, who will eat ANYTHING.  Anything!  Especially if it's made out of food.  :)  I put the treats in the ball thing and she licked it a couple times and lost interest.  The problem with this toy is that it's hard for the dogs to get a grip on the thing.  The shape is putting them off.  She later tried to knaw on it with the side of her jaw, but got so little out of it (a taste but nothing to chew on or savor or act like a reward) that she lost interest - which is saying a lot, since again she will go to great lengths for the smallest crumb.<br /><br />Finally, I took the treats out of the ball and offered them to the dogs - instand results.  They are working away at them right now.  I think the lesson here is that this toy will only work well for dogs that enjoy chewing on hard objects that don't break into pieces easily if they do at all.  Some dogs love this!  Not mine, apparently.<br /><br />So if anyone wants to try it with their dogs, email me.  I have one, never been chewed!  Maybe your dog will like it more than mine.  Five bucks!  ;)

review/summary: Dogsitter extraordinaire!
review/text: I paid way more for this than the current sale price at my local pet store ($26).  My bull terrier puppy had surgery yesterday and we were struggling to find something to turn his attention away from the stitches.  I put treats through the other side and only put one of the treat balls on the one end, saving the second for later.  He did manage to finally dislodge the treat, but even eating that took longer than his Booda Bimples.  So overall I'm very happy.  After he finished the treat on the outside, he had to find a way to get the other treats on the inside.  He's a 50# bull terrier puppy, and the large suited him well.  I did not notice any issues with him being able to handle it.  The material is durable and dishwasher safe, so it will provide plenty of hours of fun and the quick convenience of the dishwasher.  Highly recommended!

review/text: My two Papillons went crazy over these treat balls.  The Everlasting Treats that pop into the ball are extremely long lasting; unfortunately the ball itself wasn't as durable as I had hoped it would be.  It took only three times of playing with the ball for about a half hour each time for one of my dogs to chew a few chunks off of the ball.  Remember, this is a six pound dog; I don't know how long these balls would last with a larger breed.  I think the concept is great and the treat portion of the toy is terrific, but I wish that the ball would be made of a more durable material.

Since the Lab found a home (yay!) the Lab mix has been absolutely LOVING this toy.<br /><br />If you have a dog who can pull the treat out, try putting the treat in upside down - the concave bottom of the plug makes it at least a little harder for them to get their teeth into.

review/summary: Entertains my dog and distracts him from chewing on something valuable
review/text: I bought this toy in medium for my Cockapoo puppy because he is a big chewer and had been destroying blankets and comforters during the night.  Thanks to this toy I haven't found anything else destroyed.  He gladly chews on it for hours and is challenged enough that he still hasn't been able to get out all of the treats I put inside and it's been several days.  Despite this he persists on and is happy to continually knaw.  I also haven't had any issues with him getting the everlasting treat off.  It is still 100% intact.  This toy does a great job of standing up to his chewing and shaking.  While many other toys (including a stuffed bunny) have been distroyed this one is still intact without the smallest sign of a bite mark.  He doesn't seem to tire of playing with it and is as happy to be left alone chewing on it as he is to playing fetch with it.<br /><br />Overall this is a great toy and easily one of his favorites along with his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8">KONG Classic Kong, Large Red</a>.  He loves both of them equally and they have done a great job distracting him from his distructive behavior.

review/text: This toy was highly recommended by my trainer, so I thought I'd give it a try, desperate to find anything to keep my "little" guy (70+ lb Lab mix puppy) and my adult German Shepherd busy for more than a couple minutes.  The first time, the treats stayed in for about an hour but were devoured 5 minutes later.  I then tried the caps with the screw rod in the middle, my puppy had it disassembled and devoured in under 10 minutes (far less time than it took me to assemble).  Went back to the original caps and this time around they too only lasted about 10 minutes before they were completely devoured as well.  Soon after, my puppy had one side torn completely off and reduced to little blue plastic bits.  While both of my dogs really loved it while it lasted, for the price of the toy and the price of the refills (which sell out from my local store so quickly I have a hard time getting them), for my guys, it just wasn't worth it, but for less aggressive chewers, this would be great.

review/text: The ball arrives with an Everlasting Treat covering one end (side) of the treat ball and the other side open. My puppy was not able to get the treats out until I removed the end piece (which is a treat in itself) and now I can throw it to him and he'll play with it for hours! He isn't crazy about the little flavor treats that are made to go inside the ball, and I found that they crumble and get all over everything or get wet and stick inside, so I started filling the ball with cream cheese or little pieces of bologna or chicken and he'll work forever to get them out. His little teeth are needle sharp, but this ball has amazingly withstood the abuse of his constant chewing! Now that he has figured out how to get the treats out, I am going to replace one of the treat ends to present a new challenge. My only complaint is that the ball is hard to clean because there is a groove inside that makes it difficult to clean thoroughly. Regardless, it's well worth that minor problem!

review/summary: Good toy but could be better.
review/text: I gave my black Lab puppy a large Everlasting Treat Ball as a surprise treat today. He has been enjoying playing with the teething friendly rubbery treat ball a lot, and so far has not been able to chewed it up into pieces that could pose a choking or swallowing health concern, but he made short work removing and eating the two hard chicken flavor treat caps that seal into the rubber ball. The Foster and Smith brand beef and barley meat ball treats I put inside the treat opening in the rubber ball middle for added play fun and enticement have proved more difficult and entertaining for him to remove so far than the hard treat caps I had hoped would last longer as they where designed to do ideally. I think the Everlasting Treat Ball has value for doggie chew needs and entertainment, but so do many other less expensive doggie toy/treat options that don't require special refills, or pricey initial investments in.

review/summary: Didn't Pass The Test
review/text: I bought this Treat Ball with my Aussie puppy in mind; I wanted something that would keep her busy while in her crate AND something that she couldn't destroy within a few minutes. She had the actual chicken treat out of the ball within minutes; I replaced it. My other Aussie mix had it out of the ball within less than a minute. After the treat was consumed, they got to work on the ball itself...it's a great item for my dachshunds, but for the Aussies and the German Shepherd, it's hardly "Everlasting". Darn it! I was hoping I finally found something that the little herders couldn't immediately destroy!

review/summary: Doggon GREAT!  - Entertainment for your dogs
review/text: The Everlasting Treat Ball is a great way to keep your pet entertained all day long.  Fill the center with normal kibble or treats, insert an Everlasting Treat in each side and let the fun start.  Even my large, heavy chewer dogs take 2 days to get past even one of the treats.  This helps keep them busy, and allows them to work for the food in the center.  Overall, my dogs give this product 4 paws up!  (Laying on their backs of course)
