review/summary: the best ginger candies
review/text: these are the best ginger candies. And I have tried them all. I think. Very gingery and not overpoweringly sweet. Ginger Chimes taste like they grind up real fresh ginger, add sugar and form the candy-which is what the side of the package says they do. Imagine that-a product that really is what the package label claims. If you like the barely gingery very sweet candies these may overpower you. But if you find most ginger candy unsatisfactory Chimes may be your candy.<br /><br />So far one can only buy the smaller bags from vendors who make shipping a profit point, not from Amazon where one could fill out every order with Ginger Chimes to get to the free shipping minimum. I am having buyers remorse about clicking on that buy now button for the 5 lb box! Now I am carrying Ginger Chimes around and giving generous baggies full to ginger loving friends everywhere I go. And occasionally binging myself. At least one can have a Ginger Chimes binge for under 100 calories!

review/summary: Ginger Chew Heaven
review/text: When I ordered a 5-lb box of Ginger Chews, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. It is like a never-ending box of happiness. These chews are a little spicy and very chewy. I carry them with me everywhere and share them with all of my friends. I would definitely purchase this product again, if I ever run out.

review/summary: Very happy with these
review/text: I usually buy The Ginger People chews but this was much cheaper so I tried this and I'm very happy.  The Chimes are a little bit more gummier and I like it.  They are very similar in taste and gingery-ness.  But the price for the 5 lbs of Chimes was same as 2 lbs of The Ginger People's chews.  So I'm a very happy buyer.<br /><br />One thing to consider is that the 5 lbs bag comes in one big bag so there's no smaller bags of it.  Not a big deal for me.  They are individually wrapped and in perfect commercial grade wrapping.  But that's something to know and consider.  The Ginger People's chews come individually wrapped but inside wax paper which sometimes gets stuck.  They also come 20 or so to a smaller bag.<br /><br />Anyhow, I'll be sticking with these for the future.

review/text: The Book Club I belong to was reading a book in which one of the main characters was in the beginning of a pregnancy, suffering from severe nausea and one of the other characters recommended ginger chews to settle her stomach because they had brought relief to his wife when she was in the same situation. Ginger chews are an acquired taste, very tricky as they start off sweet in your mouth and then leave with a "hot" aftertaste.

review/summary: Ginger Goodness
review/text: I bought these to give some to a vegan, ginger-loving co-worker. As a ginger lover myself, I was looking for something with strong ginger flavor, not too sweet, and with natural, limited ingrediants. After reading the reviews, these seemed to fit the bill and they did not disappoint.  After I gave them to the one co-worker, several others clammored for them, and with 5 lbs., there was more than enough to go around! Though full flavored, I do not find them too strong, but that's a matter of personal preference.  They do not stick to the wrapper, like other similar treats I've had.  I have not had them long enough (and may not!) to know how long they will stay chewy and not harden, if they do.  At under $30 including shipping, it's a great deal if you have ginger-loving friends to share them with!

review/text: I discovered ginger chews when I was pregnant with my son a few years ago.  What a God send!  My co-worker bought me a few ginger items that I could not tolerate and then she brought me the ginger chews.  The first couple of months I was extremely nauscious and nothing helped until I ate these!  I have continued to find them every once in a while at Marshall's and I keep them in my desk at work and at home just incase I get an upset stomach.  They definitely have a spicy kick to them, but I think they are the easiest to get down if you are not a ginger lover.  Get them!!

It's spicy and sooooo gingery.  Way too much and doesn't even help with naseau.  The nausea stops only because you are grossed out by the taste.  It's so strong.  Really, only buy this if you love to chew on a raw gingeroot.  Try that first before buying this chew.  Blah!!!

Compares well with California Natural, Canidae and Chicken Soup for the dogs Lover's Soul but has better ingredients than these quality foods. Feed your dog properly and avoid having to visit the vet often with problems and your dog will have a longer and healthier life. To our dogs we are the most important beings on the planet and they devote their lives to us so give it back and treat them like the devoted friends they are. Husbands, wives and children may desert you but your dogs never will.

review/text: I love my sheltie puppy and I want to feed him a superior dog food. The breeder had him on Puppy Science Diet and he was doing alright, but the ingredient list was alarming: corn and chicken by products.  I did a lot of research and narrowed my choices down to just a few. Living in Hawaii, availability is also a consideration so I followed my friend's recommedation (a former pet store owner)and purchased the Merrick Whole Earth Farms Puppy Dry food.<br />Merrick Whole Earth Farms is made with a variety of quality ingredients and meets my own personal standards for a healthy, wholesome food.<br /><br />I mix one cup of Whole Earth Farms Puppy Dry Food with three tablespoons of canned Merrick Puppy Platter.<br />The canned food is a bit pricey but I only use a couple of tablespoons, and my puppy licks his bowl clean!!<br /><br />See what I meant about availability? I usually buy the 8 pound bag but is was out of stock, so I purchased the 35# bag.

We tried a few other brands when we couldn't find these in the store but she hated them, and I don't blame her, again very gummy, too gummy for a toddler. We reordered these off amazon and daughter and mommy are quite happy. The packs make it easy to grab one on the go with you. The different flavors are nice letting her taste a variety of flavors. They aren't cheap but at the same time, what baby food is cheap in price? Least I know she eats them and doesn't waste them and don't have to worry about her choking since they are not gummy like other brands.

It causes temper tantrums, severe anger, and problems sleeping, just to name a few things that last 7-10 days after consumption.

I was shocked when I read the ingredient list and realized corn syrup was included in an *all-natural* snack for toddlers.

review/text: This is a VERY delicate green tea, but that is exactly what I wanted in a Sencha. As the other reviewer said, there are no bitter or harsh tannin-y flavors, even if you steep for quite a while and brew it strong. I mostly use this to make iced teas, maybe with a little honey or a splash of lemon. I'm sure it is great hot too. I would say the caffeine level is low and this doesn't have the same diuretic effect that some stronger green teas have (sorry if that's too much information). Tasty, very smooth green tea at a really good price.

review/text: I have tried many peanut butter cracker snacks and they have been ok, but they just never seem to hit the spot.  I found these in a local CVS one day and I decide to get one because they were only 40 cents and I love ritz crackers to begin with.  I took one bite of these PB crackers and I was hooked.  It is my to go to PB cracker fix from now on.  They are the perfect snack and they have such a wonderful combination of flavor.  The PB is not too sweet and the cracker is buttery and salty, just perfect.  I reccomend these for sure if you have kids and need to have some after school snacks for them.  They are also perfect to just throw in your bag when you are on the go.  I prefer this as a snack then a gronola bar which tend to just be too sweet.  So you will not be dissapointed in these crackers.  YUMMY!!!

So finally a kid friendly snack that an adult can enjoy as well.

review/summary: Jelly Babies:  The Fourth Doctor's Favorite
review/text: We tried these because of my daughters interest in all things Doctor Who , and as most fans of the show know, the Fourth Doctor always had them. Living in the states, you can't buy them here, so when I found them on Amazon, I jumped at getting them. We weren't disappointed, they are different from any jelly type candy we've eaten.  They are a little grainy in texture but softer than any gum candy, and the flavors are natural.  This is the only brand (Bassett's) we have tried, and they are supposed to be the best.  The shipping is a bit pricey because they're imported, so if you order, order several bags while your at it.

(They're very filling.)<br />(If you like these why not try Bassett's "Liquorice Allsort's" the Doctors sweet of choice in "The Sunmakers".)

review/text: I absolutely am in love with these Jelly Babies. Do not hesitate at all to buy these Jelly Babies. I purchased them just like everyone else, I am a fan of Doctor Who and I was curious. Now I know why the fourth doctor was obsessed with them. I have been ordering them one bag at a time now for a little bit. The most recent time I decided to buy two bags. It would have been a brilliant decision if it wasn't 95 degrees out the day they were delivered. Needless to say my Jelly Babies were basically just....Jelly. It was a complete disaster and I wanted to blame the shipper but I can't. I ordered candy online in the middle of August, I should have known they were going to melt. So as much as I hate to have to wait I am going to hold off until it gets a little cooler out so I don't have to suffer the pain of seeing a Jelly Baby massacre again. Buy Buy Buy you will not regret the decision they are awesome.

review/summary: A must for Dr. Who fans that like their sweets!
review/text: I'm a recently converted "Whovian" harboring an immense curiosity regarding the Fourth Doctor's favorite snack/conversation starter/peace offering of choice (although Beatles George Harrison and Ringo Starr reportedly liked them, which often resulted in fans throwing them at the both of them mid-concert), so I ordered a bag at a decent price.  It took its sweet time getting here, but I'd say it's worth it.<br /><br />First off: I don't know what other people were complaining about with respect to the portion size: the bag may not be huge, but you're actually are getting a rather large portion, particularly because of the size of each individual candy.  Each "Jelly Baby" is about an inch long (the same length of a Sour Patch Kid) but about 3/4 of an inch thick (more than twice as thick as a Sour Patch Kid, and about twice the size overall as an average gummy bear).  In other words, these things are pretty big as far as soft/gelatin based candy goes: so for the size you actually get a lot even with the fairly small bag.  To put it in perspective: a whole bag of Haribo Gummy Bears is about 450 calories.  A bag of Jelly Babies is about 720.  If you're watching your figure, keep that in mind!<br /><br />Jelly Babies are nothing like gummy bears, contrary to appearance or rumor.  Their texture and flavor is more akin to an American Jelly bean.  They have a soft outer shell of gelatin and starch and a softer "jelly" (gelatin) center where most of the flavor is concentrated.  Basically, imagine a jelly bean with a really, really, really, really soft outer shell in the shape of a person, and that's the closest approximation you can get.  The flavors will taste a bit off or peculiar to Americans, because most of the flavor is derived from actual fruit juice and real sugar (in contrast to most American gummy candies, which use artificial flavors and high fructose corn syrup).  The flavors are also based around British sensibilities, so flavors like blackcurrant might be a little peculiar tasting as well. There also is a slightly grainy texture to them: this is from the starch coating used to break the candies from the molds.<br /><br />All and all, I enjoyed them, but not enough to say I could eat them every day (like the Doctor did).  I'd say they're sweets best suited for a particular mood.

review/text: I searched for these after watching some Tom Baker Doctor Who streaming on Netflix. When purchasing them please understand that these are made with animal products (bovine gelatin). This does not bother me, but could cause others to go into a tizzy.<br /><br />In regards to texture, think more like a Circus Peanut crossed with a jelly bean. It is not a gummi bear, do not expect a smooth texture. The flavors are good and these are not overly sweet.

review/text: I purchased these as Dr. Who always eats them so I thought Dr. Stew should give them a try.  At first I didn't care too much for them.  The outside is close to a gummy bear but softer and the inside is like a thick sugar/jelly substance.  They do not taste bad and are made with natural fruit juices and colorants.  One thing about them is that I found I ate far less of these per snacking session than I did gummy bears so it might be a good choice for parents.  My next try will be wine gums...

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/text: My dog loves the chicken, steak, and peanut butter booda bones, but he's not as fond of the spearmint/peppermint variety.  My dog will eat it if offered, but my dad's dog who I often sit for will not even touch these.  I wouldn't recommend for a dog who prefers meat.

review/summary: NOT long lasting
review/text: I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.  I was going to buy Chewlotta's which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1, but I thought it was too pricey at $3 a pop.  My dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours.  He does enjoy them though.

review/summary: My dog goes crazy for these!
review/text: My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/summary: Watch out for this tea
review/text: Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!

review/summary: Absolutely vile
review/text: I love mincemeat.  My grandmother made mincemeat.  I make it now myself.  This is not mincemeat.  This is disgusting.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients in Crosse & Blackwell's "mincement," in order of volume, according to the label:  apples, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, raisins, water, vinegar, corn starch, and then trace elements of orange peel, salt, spices, caramel color, orange juice, and preservatives.  (As an aside, what on earth is the purpose of that orange juice, which exists in less quantity than the caramel color. )<br /><br />In other words, this concoction is apples, drenched in high-fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup, with a few raisins.  Lord knows what the "spices" were, because they could scarcely be distinguished under the sickly aftertaste of corn syrup.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients from a recipe for real mincemeat, again in order of volume:  apples, raisins, beef (for those who like it), sultanas, currents, sour cherries, citrons, sugar, strawberry preserves, apricot preserves, orange peel, lemon peel, spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, allspice), salt.  This mixture is marinated in liquor - rum, brandy, sherry, apple jack, or whatever additional or alternative liquor you may enjoy.  Our family's recipe calls for these things; other people use different fruits, most omit the meat, some use juice and vinegar instead of liquor.  But the result, in any case, is rich, spicy, complex and delicious.<br /><br />Or, if you prefer, you may have Crosse & Blackwell's canned apples with high-fructose corn syrup.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: This is one of the last of the Original mincemeats available suitable for Tarts, and real pies. The U.S. Brands have gone to half mincemeat, half apples, which is O. K. for Apple Pies, but lousy for Mincemeat Tarts. Due scarcity, it is expensive, but necessary for real English Tarts. The Tart Pans are also extremely difficult to find since Williams-Sonoma discontinued them 15 years ago, They are available on a very few sites in England. The 29 oz. Jars go a long way.

Many people don't think they like mincemeat, probably because they didn't try the Cross & Blackwell brand.  Everyone I've introduced it to has been quite pleased!<br /><br />It's great in pies, of course, but it's awesome spooning onto shortbread cookies (a rich treat indeed!), putting on vanilla icecream, or eating out of the jar (my private jar, of course!)

review/text: I know it's controversial, but high fructose corn syrup is something I have chosen to eliminate from my diet. It's a cheap substitute for sugar and some experts feel that there are unhealthy aspects connected to it's consumption.<br /><br />My point is, the second ingredient in the Crosse & Blackwell Mincemeat is, you guessed it, HFCS.<br /><br />For my Christmas pie, I went with the Borden's Nonesuch Mincemeat, containing sugar and brown sugar.
