review/summary: Be sure your dog is a strong chewer
review/text: I purchased 2 - one for each of our dogs. Unfortunately, I didn't realize how large/hard these chews are. Our dogs are chihuahua mix, and showed no interest in the dino-chews. They were too big and too "strong" of a chew for them. Luckily, my sister has a lab-mix, who seems to enjoy it thoroughly. These are really best for dogs that normally destroy their chewies within minutes. Otherwise, they are durable and cute.

review/summary: Great option for strong chewers!
review/text: I have a Pit Bull Terrier and a Bulldog - both are very strong chewers.  There are very few toys on the market that they cannot destroy in minutes.  These chew toys are one of the rare exceptions and best of all, my dogs go bonkers when they get these toys.  Hours and hours of chewing enjoyment and they pick the dinosaur shaped bones over their regular Nylabones every time!  I think they especially love the unique shape and the bumps must be soothing on their gums.<br /><br />The only downside is that little tiny particles can break off - so you'll want to watch for that.  I suspect this wouldn't happen if you have a mild/medium strength chewer.  However, if you do have destructo-chewers like mine, know that the little specks that break off are no where big enough to be choking hazards - they just make a little mess on the carpet after a hour chewing session - so that means vaccumming after they're done chewing and removing the toy after it becomes unrecognizable as a dinosaur.

review/summary: VET WARNING!!!  DO NOT BUY!
review/text: I bought these for years for my little guys and they loved it.  Unbeknownst to me, it turns out these things will break and crack your dogs teeth!!!<br /><br />After a routine visit to the vet, he found one of my dogs had infected and broken back molars.  I guess it's a common occurrence judging by other reviewers on here.  And my vet also said he's had 8 dogs come in with the same problem in the last 2 years, all with Nylabone dental chew toys.<br />Had to get dental work done on my baby and her teeth were extracted.  Poor gal was crying all night long after surgery.  The vet says this happens w/ large dogs too!!!  So NYLABONE needs to stop selling this item as a dental chew!  I'm going to report this directly to Amazon corporate.

review/summary: Best dog toy on the market!
review/text: These dental dinosaurs are the best dog toy that I've found.  My lab is an aggressive chewer and a dinosaur can last about 30 days as a full fledged looking dinosaur.  She continues to chew the toy until all you can see is a small unidentifiable circle for a few years.  Both of my dogs prefer the T-Rex the best.  Second choice of theirs is the Stegosaurus.  I wholeheartedly recommend this toy for any aggressive chewer.

review/summary: DINOBONE!!!
review/text: On that warm July day when I first opened the recently arrived cardboard box of mystery, I was deeply saddened and upset when the dinobone I purchased was in fact a Stegasaurus and not the advertised T-Rex.<br /><br />What would my dog think? Surely ALL HUMANS AND ANIMALS are well aware that the Stegasaurus comes nowhere near the badassness of a T-Rex. Would my dog like it? Would it chew on its nylony stega-carcus?<br /><br />Yes.

review/summary: large dental bill
review/text: I purchased these because I thought they were safe for my dog.  I was horribly mistaken.  My dog cracked two of his teeth, chewing on this.  I heard the crack and saw the blood on the bone.  I took him to the vet and he had to have two cracked teeth removed.  This product should not even be on the market.  Had we not caught this, the vet told me, that there is no warning for a tooth infection and dogs can easily die.  Do not buy this product.  I cannot believe that the company continues to market this.  This product is hurting the dogs.  It was a very hefty dental bill and I haven't even addressed what my dog went through having to be put under and not have a major molar to chew his regular dog food.

review/summary: Dogs love it
review/text: My dogs have a variety of Nylabones and one from Hartz as well and they all get chewed on depending on what my boys are in the mood for.  They regularly compete to be the one to get dinosaur, so I would rank that as this one being a favorite.  Both my dogs are heavy chewers, but the nylabones seem to last a good long while and they never get tired of them.  One other thing, the dinosaur (with all the little nubs) is probably the most horrible thing to step on when making a trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night!

review/text: My two dogs looove this thing. The only wierd thing was that I was expecting a T-rex and got a Stegasaurus. This isn't really a complaint, but just a heads up. If you want the T-rex, you might need to specify. It doesn't look like the same material as other Nylabone products I've bought. It seems a little harder than other bones we've bought. Doesn't make a difference to the dogs. They never get tired of it.

review/summary: WOW! Best Pit Toy EVER!
review/text: I am one of those people that spoil their dogs. I have 5. lol. I hated that my chihuahuas had all these favorite toys and that my pit bull would tear them without trying. I started the search for a toy that he'd enjoy and not be able to totally destroy. He is almost 3 years old now and this is the ONLY toy that I can give him that doesn't get destroyed or choked on. He loves it. I leave it in his kennel (where he sleeps and stays while I'm at work) and you can only see one or two teeth marks on the thing. It's been in his kennel for over two months and he chews it all the time. He falls asleep chewing and is soooo cute. But yeah. Pit owners, no lie, BEST toy ever. And CHEAP compared to the other things that I've gotten him over the years. I've spent way more on dollar tree plushies that he's gone through in a matter of hours. (AND he is a big headed, big mouthed boy, but the way the dino is shaped he cannot swallow it like he has done with whole bones. I would never leave it with him if there were ANY danger so, no worries.)

review/summary: Our "Go-To"
review/text: My border collie is an aggressive chewer (although not aggressive with anything else!). These dinos are the only toys that will keep him occupied that he can't destroy in hours. The dinos last for a couple months for him, but he grinds them down so they become a bit of a hazard if you step on them. His teeth are healthy and clean with seldom brushing. He hasn't had any issues with them- we give him 2 at a time so if he's bored with one he can play with another. They shouldn't replace dental care, but they really do help with plaque.

review/summary: Hours of chewing fun
review/text: These chews are great. My dachshund-mix 3-month-old puppies were not too interested in the classic nylabone so I got these, and they just LOOOVE them. It's their #1 chew-toy. They can sit in their beds and chew on it forever. I also recommend the Nylabone fish. For some reason the funky shapes and textures are just much more enticing than the regular bone shape. One more note: to get them really hooked on Nylabones I've found that I have to hold the toy for them to chew on at first (so they build really positive associations with it: bone='mom'), at the beginning of a chewing session, and then they're hooked. Don't necessarily expect your dog to just chew it without any of your involvement. The more you're involved, the more he'll enjoy it!

review/summary: Best for my dog
review/text: We could never give my dog anything cloth like or soft because she would chew on it or take out the stuffing of her bed or blanket. With toys it was the same. We bought her a Kong(r) but she didn't take to it even with several treats stuffed on the inside. Then I bought this hoping it would be a good toy for her. She didn't take to it right away but eventually it became her favorite. Anytime she's bored or just need to chew we'll give her this and she'll be busy for about ten minutes. The toy itself is very tough not flexible at all which is what we needed. Its easy to clean too, we just run it under some hot water for a couple of seconds or so. Great for bored dogs or some really aggressive chewers. The only thing is I didn't get to pick the dinosaur...darn!... but that's not going to affect it's rating it's still a great chew toy overall.

Unfortunately, he had the head off of the t-rex within 10 minutes, and he swallowed it before i could get it away from him.  From now on, it's all about durability, and nothing about looks.

review/text: I have a 3 year old english/american bulldog mix that loves chewing on nylabones/dingos. I bought this product selfishly, because I like dinosaurs. Unfortunately, the littel nubs tore into her gums like nobody's business and left sharp shards sticking out. She only had it for a short time under (sort of laxed) supervison, but when i looked down the thing's entire tail was covered in blood. Into the trash it went. Moving forward, I will stick to the non-nubby nylabones.

review/text: Bought this because it said durable and my dog uses other nylabones and I've had luck with them lasting me a short while. This wasn't the case she had the head and tail chewed off before I knew it. In less than an hour it was missing both ends. I'll have to go back to the wishbone because she takes longer to wear those down. Keep in mine my dog is a very strong chewer she can destroy things quickly so if your dog isn't a hard core chewer it might be ok for you but otherwise try something without small ends.<br /><br />EDIT- Just got worse had to call the vet due to bloody stool and this is the only thing I can think of that caused it

review/text: My dog Cotton is an aggressive chewer she could chew her way through anything within seconds & then she's looking for something else to chew. She's a 3yr old Coton de Tulear a rare breed which are in the bichon family My dog is very hyper & has nervous energy she doesn't know what to do with, I thought getting her a chew toy would keep her busy for a while, but they didn't even last for a day. I went on line and read reviews from other's reviews on different chew toys, when I read the reviews for this dinosaur chew and read their had the same issues my dog had and their dogs were a lot bigger & weighed more then my dog is small& weighs 15 lbs. I thought this chew would be a perfect chew toy & it would last for a longer period it has lasted & she is still chewing on it after 4 months. This is going to be a second dinosaur chew I am buying for her as a backup. She loves this toy and I would recommend this for those pet owners who have dogs who are heavy aggressive chewers this will last a long  time. I love it and I save money& no longer need to buy any other chew toy but this dinosaur chew.<br />Suzan Mesquite NV

review/summary: Stegosaurus or Brontosaurus are the best for strong chewers
review/text: I am a long-time dog trainer and rescuer. I've owned all the versions of this indispensible toy! The Stegosaurus version held up - for years! - through Australian Cattle Dog, Border Collie, English Staffordshire Terrier, and Irish Wolfhound puppies. They even chewed on them as they got older.  I wouldn't recommend Tyrannosaurus (too many gaps to crunch on) and Brontosaurus (the tail eventually breaks off) if you have dogs like mine who have huge jaws and teeth the size of my thumb. If a toy lasts at my house it truly is almost undestructible.<br /><br />As with any toy, don't leave your pup alone with it until you've watched to see they can safely chew it. Do examine it regularly to make sure there are no cracks. Unlike most Nylabone bone-shaped toys, my dogs prefered the shape and texture of these. I usually start them off by rubbing a bit of peanut butter into the nubs the first time. After that the dogs carry them around while teething.  Best of all, they wash up great in the dishwasher!

review/text: With two pit-mix dogs, finding durable chew toys has been a challenge.  They can demolish most toys marked as durable in a matter of minutes.  They LOVE these dino toys.  I think it may be the odd shape that makes these some of their favorites, but they seem to like gnawing down the various angles to these.  These last several months before they become too small and are discarded.  Any time we find one of these from under the couch that was long forgotten, they eye each other and run to steal the toy the second the other leaves it alone.  These have become a regular purchase for us to keep our dogs happy, entertained, and chewing on the right things!

review/text: Okay, I had to speak up. Hello, common sense and directions on toys. ONE) choose a toy that is large enough to encourage dogs to chew using their side/back teeth. You DO NOT want a toy that is small enough for dogs to use their front teeth or likely they will crack their front teeth, ect. So even if the toy says is is meant for large dogs, pay attention to how your dog chews on it. If they're chewing with their front teeth, take it away and try the next size up. TWO) Yes, toys sometimes do say for powerful chewers. If your dog is tearing off large chunks of the toy, TAKE IT AWAY. DO NOT LET YOUR DOG KEEP IT THEN ACT SURPRISED THAT YOUR DOG IS HAVING DIGESTION PROBLEMS. Nylabone toys are meant for dogs to take off tiny slivers at a time, no bigger than a grain of rice. I don't care what "strength the chew toy is", if it's not strong enough for you dog, take it away and try a larger/tougher toy.<br /><br />All of this is common sense, but in case that escaped you, it's also on the directions.

review/summary: Good for chewers
review/text: This is a great toy for dogs that chew up everything else.  I have a little Cheagle (Chihuahua and Beagle mix) and she literally eats all her other toys.  This is one of the only toys that she's yet to destroy and she loves it!  She carries it around everywhere with her.  I got the T-Rex and it's the cutest thing :)

review/summary: Can't choose the dino... sad!
review/text: I have a beagle/jack russel mix. Needless to say, he is very high-energy and does best when given a job to do that involves chewing.<br />He LOVES his Novabone and Nylabone- but tears thru the larger sizes in a single afternoon- so when I saw this I was very happy, because it is an unusual shape and durable! Amazon's iphone app let you scan in an item and find it cheaper on Amazon- so instead of the higher pet shop price, I scored a savings deal on Amazon! Nice!<br /><br />My big, fat, sad complaint is that you cannot CHOOSE the dinosaur! I knew this when ordering and the stegosaurus arrived- honestly I was hoping for the T-Rex or the Brontosaurus but I guess you get what you get. Still, a beagle gnawing on a T-Rex would be pretty funny...

review/summary: Not Indestructible, but decent enough...
review/text: I have a Boston Terrier, who likes to chew, but won't just chew on anything.  After a bad experience with a tennis ball (that he got hold to) and his intestinal tract, I've been very selective about the toys I give him. A lot of the other pet owners that reviewed here had pets on the upper end of that 50lb scale and my Boston (at adult development) is only around 20lbs, if that. So, I thought I'd give this a try and watch out for complete destruction of the toy. Well, from day 1 when we received this he took to it immediately. I don't know if this has a flavor, but he didn't touch any of the other toys we received the same day... only this one. And, he's chewed on it every day now for about 4 months.  Only recently did I begin to notice that he'd finally broken through a corner and I tossed the toy. That white plastic can kill his intestinal organs if it gets in there.  So, for the price vs. the length of time it lasted and he enjoyed it without cause, it's an "ok" toy. I'm going to buy him another one, but I think the key is to stay vigilant and be sure that once your pet seems to start puncturing through this, it needs to be thrown out immediately. Since he is quite literally never alone, this is not as big an issue as it may be for other pet owners.  Please keep this in mind before buying!

review/summary: Jack Russell loves it
review/text: My dog is a pretty intense chewer - and is about 19 lbs.  He has the T. Rex and loves it.  (It's pretty funny to see him stand it up just to bite it on the head.) This toy is only for chewing though - it's pretty dense, so it can't be involved in any "play."  We haven't had any health issues and he's chewed for 6 months now (our T. Rex no longer has a head or tail) so I think he's probably in the clear.

review/summary: My dog's favorite bone!
review/text: I purchased this bone for my dog last Christmas and it is still one of her favorites! I believe we got the 'brontosaurus' model. She is an Australian Shepherd (about 35 lbs) and is extremely rough on her toys. We are lucky if a toy lasts more than 1 day, but this one is still going strong. I think its tail is just about gone by now, but other than that, it is still in tact. We call it her "dino" and she knows it by name. If we tell her to go get her dino, she brings it to us every time without fail. I think I only paid about $4 for it at the time, but I would still buy it at $7.50. It's still much cheaper than nylabones at the store! It is the perfect size for my dog, but I wouldn't recommend it for a dog much larger than her.

review/summary: Dog loves it and it's very durable, but not indestructible
review/text: I have a dog with very strong jaws. She's only thirty-five pounds but she goes through most toys like they're bubblegum. Even as a small puppy, she would destroy anything and everything. By the age of five or six months we had to give up on soft and rope toys altogether, and at a year old, she is limited to only hard chews like Kong, Nylabone, etc. Even then, she destroys most of these with relative ease. She's gone through chews others have recommended as long-lasting in literally ten minutes. The only toy she has that has lasted more than a month or so is her original red Kong, which she mostly licks instead of chews.<br /><br />I initially bought the dinosaur for my other, less toy-murderous dog, but the power chewer quickly stole it from him. She was in love. She carried it everywhere and chewed on it constantly. I'm not sure if it's the shape or the texture she likes, or some combination thereof, but whatever the case, it instantly became her favorite. Even the most durable hard toys normally only last a few weeks with her, but her dino is going on two or three months now. It's chewed beyond recognition, all the nubs worn down, and it's very rapidly nearing the end of its life because little bits of plastic are falling off, but it still lasted far longer than most toys do. A few weeks ago I bought her a second one, in a different shape, and she's equally as enamored with it. All in all, it's not going to be indestructible if you have a power chewer, but it certainly lasts a heck of a lot longer than most!

review/summary: Another great Nylabone chew
review/text: I have a 15 month old puppy who is a powerful and destructive chewer.  I discovered Nylabone toys a few years ago when my cocker spaniel, who was an anxious chewer, had to have intestinal surgery to remove parts of a rubber toy.  When I got this puppy I gave her a stuffed animal and 5 minutes later I had to throw its remains away.  She has been a Nylabone girl ever since. She loves her dinosaur; she carries it everywhere with her and even sleeps with it.  It no longer has a recognizable head but she did not manage to chew off any large chunks, just little bits.  The downfall is that I find a lot of little rice sized bits of dinosaur in the furniture and her blankets; the up side is I know there are no big chunks of toy ending up in her intestines.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and other Nylabone "for powerful chewers" type toys to anyone whose dog is a little chew crazy. I also recommend buying from Amazon because the price is about half of what it is in the pet store and the selection is much better than discount stores have. At the price for these dinosaurs I am getting ready to order a few more so that when the one we have is worn out I have another readily on hand.<br /><br />For reference my dog is an oversized Jack Russell Terrier (around 30lbs) and this toy is the perfect size for her.

review/summary: Best toy so far for our lab mix puppy
review/text: Oh dino...what would we do without you!! Our lab puppy absolutely loves this toy and it has been one of her favorites. I was so excited to find this toy on Amazon because our poor dino has taken a beating. This is one of the first toys we purchased for our beloved pup when we adopted her in March and haven't been able to find it in the local stores. This doy has survived her teething phase and we thought it was time to get a 2nd in case dino decides to hide under the couch again.

review/text: My two American bulldogs love Nylabones. I originally purchased one of these at a local pet store, but the stronger chewer of the two ate the stegosaurus tail. My other do did love this so much that i ordered another to stay with her when shes in her crate.  Definitely not their most durable, but still enjoyed by my dogs.

review/text: I have two dogs, one is a heavy chewer.  Both dogs love this toy and will take turns stealing it from each other.  It has held up well, even when my heavy chewer gets ahold of it.  I wasn't sure it would hold up well because it is a bit thin and has pieces that stick out, like the foot and head, but it has held up surprisingly well.

review/text: We received the Brontosaurus for our 20 lb. 4 month old chow/retriver/coonhound/corgi mix pup.  It is by and large her favorite toy. She spends a good amount of time chewing on it and is a moderate chewer. She hasn't gotten any pieces off of it and there hasn't been any damage to her teeth. The only thing is that it's so hard, I don't think it gives her a lot of relief for her teething.

review/summary: Great item!
review/text: I like many others who've written in, have tried many different "indestructible" chew toys only to find that our little beast will gnaw through them in minutes.  I must say, this Dinosaur Chew Toy has outlasted any previous toy by miles.  He's been at it every day for 3 weeks for an hour or two at a time and it's probably reduced in size by 20%.  It's not going to last forever, but it's certainly better than anything else out there that we've found.  Great item!

review/summary: Great for my Australian Cattle Dog!
review/text: My husband and I foster Australian Cattle Dogs and own one ourselves. With our most recent litter of puppies they were unable to do any damage to this toy! (That's a huge improvement over some of the other toys we bought them). Once the puppies were gone, I gave it to my destroyer-of-all-toys. After about a month of carrying it around and chewing on it, he has only managed to sever the head of the T-rex, which makes this the champion of toys in our household!<br /><br />I give this toy four stars just because I wouldn't recommend it for every dog-- it's rock hard and can definitely do some damage. If, however, you have a power chewer and are desperate for a toy that won't easily fall apart, I would definitely suggest this product.

review/summary: One of my dog's favorite toys!!!
review/text: My sister bought this for her 2 weims who are both aggressive chewers. I've never seen toys destroyed so fast! They both LOVE this toy and it lasts quite awhile.  I decided to buy one for my husky. It's one of his favorites often played with. It is a hard thick plastic toy with some weight to it. My dog and my sister's dogs, they all have chewed the crap out of it to the point it doesn't look like a dinosaur anymore! Oh and they constantly carry it around with them and drop it on your toes. Ummm yeah OUCH!<br /><br />The one drawback (and warning) of this toy is that the teeth marks left in it can cause sharp or rough edges. Some fragments are chewed off and left on the floor.  However, I still give it 5 stars or should I say 5 paws!!! I already bought a 2nd one to keep on hand once I'm ready to throw the old one in the trash.

She loves her little Dino and takes it with her everywhere.  It's a great alternative to her pigs foot that had a horrible smell.  Also, she can chew on this 24/7 and I don't have to worry about her getting sick from over feeding her on rawhides.  My only regret: My husband bought it in the store for $11.00.  Our next one will be purchased on Amazon.

review/text: My dogs absolutely love these dinosaurs! Initially I thought they liked them only because they were knew, but the excitement lasts! I have two 40 lb dogs, average chewers I would say, and two of these dinos will last them a 3-4 months. They are super durable, just beware of sharp edges as they begin to wear down, but that is with all dog chews. I have looked into buying these in the store instead of online, but they seemed to be priced more in the store, around $12 where I live, so Amazon's price is pretty good!

My dog loves it, pulls it out of his toy bin and just lays and bites non-stop. However, this isn't super durable. The first day he had it, within maybe an hour it had visible signs of being chewed on, so be careful if your dog is an aggressive chewer.

review/summary: Dogs who chew will love this!
review/text: I have a puggle who chews all of the time, and she has been through a variety of Nylabone products, all of which she absolutely loved.  I am a huge fan of anything Nylabone, and when I saw this one, I immediately had to get it for her because not only did it look like something she would love, but the design promotes good dental health.  She has had it for a month now, and she is constantly chewing on it.  Not only has it helped to keep her teeth clean, but it is much more durable than other Nylabone toys.  She chews it every day, carries it around and drops it all over the place, and it has barely worn at all. I highly recommend this toy for dogs who love to chew!<br /><br />I do have to share one negative to this toy though.... if your dog likes you to "tug" with them for their toys, this one isn't for you.  It hurts to grab and pull on it.  Not much of a negative, but I want to give a fair review, so if you are looking for a strong tug toy, go with a smooth surfaced large Nylabone and save your hands some pain :)

It's funny how they'll go after one spot.  On this one it's the tail.  With the regular shaped bones they'll make one end look like it went through a wood chipper and the other end looks like you just opened it.

review/summary: Love this product!
review/text: I've always had good luck with Nylabone products.  My dogs absolutely LOVE this one, though.  I think breaking away from the bone shape that they are used to really stirred their interest.  Can't beat the price you get online, either.  I'm sure this would be twice as much at a pet store.

review/summary: Better To Buy Local
review/text: 4 Stars for wheat and corn free product. However, I agree with the other August comment.  Better to buy local, since product tends to get damaged easily.  ALSO, prices on Amazon are very high.  $6.50 in local stores versus product price and shipping on line.  Whole Food carries the cookies, and you can ask your local health food store to try and stock it.  Good luck!

review/summary: OLD BROKEN AND STALE
review/text: These cookies were stale. At least half the foil packets were slightly open and broken in a million small pieces. I love this brand of cookie but the orange essence flavor isn't available where I buy them so decided to order these online. My advice is stick to buying them from local source.

review/summary: Best peanut sauce I have found in a long time...
review/text: We recently moved to an area and there are no good Thai restaurants.  Everywhere I have gone, I always ask for peanut sauce and have gotten everything from a spicy red oily sauce to a sweet oily (chunky) kind of sauce. This can is just like what we used to get in our favorite Thai places.  I highly recommend this product!

review/text: Just received these flavoring oils, had to immediately try them out! They smell and taste wonderful. They seem much stronger than most kinds you find at the store so a little goes a long way! The bottles are good quality and clearly labeled. None of flavors taste or smell artificial like some types normally do. I really recommend these. There are many unique and hard to find flavors listed, I haven't tried them all yet but I plan to!

review/summary: Good Deal For D.I.Y. Vaping Fun
review/text: This is a great deal for Vapers that want to try DIY for the first time. I have been mixing about 1 dram per 25ml of vegetable glycerin (no nicotine) just for fun to see what flavors I like and if it tastes as good as some basic e-liquid flavors I have tried. I must point out that this review is for people 18 years or older who have switched to vaping from smoking and want to try DIY liquid without committing a lot of money. This 10 pack plus a 5 dollar bottle of VG from wally mart is a great way to get your feet wet and if you make a mistake it's no big deal because of how inexpensive all the materials are. But be careful as not all the flavors are water soluble. Do some research and try to get flavors that are mostly made up of propylene glycol....Apple, Cherry and Blueberry are all good examples of this. Avoid Almond and Wintergreen. Vaping forums have complete lists for the flavors that are ok to vape.

review/text: We started this protein powder diet called almased, and while the flavor wasn't horrible, it needed a boost.  I chose this listing because they let you choose your flavors.  The peanut butter is FANTASTIC.  I do approx 5-7 drops in my shake.  All the flavors are exactly what you'd expect from a candy oil.  The watermelon is just like the watermelon jolly rancher and so on.  Great sellers.  Thank you!  Will order again.

review/summary: Recieved my order in 2 days!
review/text: I had hiatal hernia surgery August 27 and could not eat solid food so I ordered these flavorings to add to my unflavored protien powder. I didn't want to add calories or sugar to my drinks. The peanut butter is so good! It smells just like a peanut butter cookie! Banana Creame is really BANANA(Y)! I didn't need to add a banana to the shake! Blueberry is delicious! I added it to unflavored greek yogurt and milk with a sprinkle of sugar alternative and I had a blueberry shake! I would recommend these flavorings to any person who really doesn't know if they would like the flavor of some already prepared protien powders. I really didn't like the super sweet taste of NECTAR so I use unflavored protein and the LoAnn oils. I much happier now and I drink my protein shakes the way I want them to taste!Plus, I've lost weight on the high protein diet!

review/summary: Great Product and Excellent Service
review/text: I discovered LorAnn candy oils years ago when I got into making hard candies. Recently I have started making xylitol hard candies and needed more flavorants and these oils are still wonderful and they arrived in just 2 days with free shipping and that's without the Amazon Super Savers!<br /><br />Unlike sucrose {table sugar} hard candies, xylitol candies {atleast the ones I make} need to crystallize with the proper crystal structure so as not to be crumbly or a syrupy goo. This means not all flavorings will work AND you cannot add very much so what you use needs to be very strong and LorAnn oils are AWESOME!!!<br /><br />Right now my only regret is I should have gone with the 24pack but there will definitely be a next time!

review/text: I used these in my hard candy. As the recipe called for 1 bottle (dram) I poured it in. No one could taste the flavor I used! You could smell it but not taste it. I could taste a slight hint of it. Not sure why these claim to be so strong flavored but they are not. Maybe I am spoiled by Jolly Ranchers but that is the taste I expect from hard candy.

review/text: What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the "worst" of "simple sugars", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little). This brand's other bars, Acai and "Caramel", are similar, but "Maca" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing.

review/text: At first we thought the bar was damaged by heat... or was too old (despite exp. date saying otherwise). A few months later we bought it again (from a different store) - same problem. And now (especially since another reviewer had the same problem) I think this MACA bar is designed to be like that. It's NOT chocolaty. It tastes and looks like something else. It may satisfy a sweet tooth, but it's not worth the price. Their other 3 flavors taste fabulous (Acai, Goji, "Caramel"). Not the healthiest though, due to some added sugar.

review/summary: Beware!
review/text: This was an impulse buy while standing in line at an organic foods market. First off, I have to say that I've had raw chocolate before, and I really like dark chocolate. So after a surprising cost of $5 I was hoping for the best tasting sweet to ever hit me in the mouth. Wow, I just have to say that this was so awful that I feel like I have to warn the world. I was a little disappointed in the small size of it at first, but now I understand that no one could stand to eat one of these if they were full sized. For one, the "caramel" is an unflavored paste-like substance  , and the only way I can describe the whole eating experience is by likening it to having a pill get stuck in the back of your throat and being stuck with that rancid flavor until you manage to eat something less horrible. As I sit here in my buyers remorse stupor, I can't stop thinking about the many more pleasing things I could have done with my $5. For instance, I could go bowling, tip a stripper, wash my car, or buy 2 or 3 less disgusting chocolate bars. I'm only righting this review in the hopes that I may keep some other poor unsuspecting shopper from being duped as I was.

review/summary: Eye opening chocolate collection
review/text: We prize individuality in wines and coffees, we seek the individual flavors of favored Chateaus, the hand picked beans of particular farms, so why not in chocolate too? It was a revelation to me, these individual chocolates. The variety and distinct tastes! It's another culinary world to explore. If only these would become available again, or another similar package.

review/summary: My favorite coffee in the world
review/text: Breakfast Blend is my favorite coffee ever.  I'm so glad it is on Amazon now.  It makes it easy to send to my family and friends before I come visit them.  That way I can get the best cup of coffee any where I go.

review/text: The package was wrapped properly. The cookies were not fresh. They were broken into small pieces. Considering shipping charge, overall the price wasn't worth for these cookies. I wish I had purchased more at the Disneyland.

review/summary: Very addicting!!
review/text: I received a package from a friend that lives in Japan and some of these were in the box. They are so good I couldn't stop eating them. I looked them up on the net and found them here. I was so excited when I found out I could order them and have them on hand all the time. Don't hesitate to buy them because you'll love them! I also like the ones that have banana flavor in them.
