review/summary: THE BEST GLUTEN FREE PASTA BY FAR!
review/text: I have yet to taste anything that is comparable to real pasta besides the Ancient Harvest Line. My GF who is NOT GLuten Free, enjoys them with me everytime we make a meal with pasta, and agrees, they are as close to "The Real Thing" as you can get! Great job...Now I just wish they would make Lasagna Noodles!!!

review/summary: Best gluten free pasta we've tried!
review/text: My 13 year old daughter was diagnosed as celiac in January. We live in a rural area and finding gluten free food at all much less food that tastes good is difficult. After trying several different products and becoming convinced that commercial gluten free pasta universally sucked, in desperation we tried Ancient Harvest. Tada! Success! It actually has a flavor and it's structure and texture is comparable to wheat pasta.  My daughter loves mac and cheese made with this product. It's also comparable in price to wheat products, a bonus when trying to do gluten free on a limited budget.

review/text: The elbows of this brand are spectacular, the best of the Ancient Harvest brand.  I made macaroni and cheese with them and like the flavor profile better than regular noodles.  I think the quinoa/corn mix is much better than either element separately as either I think falls apart and makes a mushy noodle.

review/summary: Couldn't tell it wasn't regular pasta!
review/text: I bought this product on a whim and decided to try it, since I like quinoa. I was pleasantly surprised with it...I couldn't tell it wasn't regular semolina wheat pasta! Tasted, looked, and felt like the real thing (and I'm very picky with taste...I hate whole-wheat pasta because it's different than regular pasta). Perfect for someone who needs a gluten-free diet but loves regular pasta. It's also less fat and more fiber than traditional pasta.

review/text: Try this pasta, you will be pleased. If you have tried the spaghetti, don't hold it against the spirals or elbows. The spaghetti is not good! But these are great. When reheating extra liquid or sauce is needed and using a pan is best. But other than that, these are wonderful. Do not boil longer than stated

review/text: For some reason, my kiddo's stomach just doesn't like this pasta. It's a shame because it's a decent replacement. Stomach aches happen pretty soon after eating and last until bedtime. Sometimes it carries over to the next day. Tried it a few times hoping it was something else, but I'm finally giving up on it, especially after reading that others have had problems with it.

review/text: This pasta tasted good but both people in my family who have to eat gluten free had digestive problems after eating this.  They can eat corn so it must be the quinoa.  Since we bought a case I cooked it several times thinking that it must not be the pasta that was causing the problem.  It's the pasta.  We're sticking with Mrs. Leepers for our gluten free pasta dishes from now on.

review/summary: I do not need a gluten free diet, but . . .
review/text: Although I do not need a gluten free diet, I decided to try this pasta for its nutritional value.  I had no trouble cooking the pasta, and with the leftovers (which I stored in a plastic container in the refrigerator) I was able to rehydrate the little shells with boiling water several days later.  Turned out just as good as the first time.  I would buy this brand again.  The texture and flavor were excellent---like it better than whole grain pasta.  Found it at Whole Foods since I don't have room to store products in bulk.  Give it a try.

review/summary: Best I have found so far
review/text: I've recently had to go Gluten free as well as Rice free.  Prior to finding out about the rice I tried a few rice pastas and they were all gluey and gummy, no matter how I tried to cook them.  I have recently tried this product and find it to be tasteful and easy to use in dishes.  I cook it on the al dente side (6 min) if I am using it in soups, stews, etc.  If it is for a dish with sauces or salads I cook a little longer (7-8 min).  If you overcook it will fall apart.  Excellent alternative to Wheat, Rice and even Corn pasta (sweeter & falls apart).

review/summary: Favorite gluten free brand so far
review/text: I needed a gluten free elbow macaroni to make my husband's favorite macaroni & cheese, and had previously purchased another brand.  After trying this one, it has definitely become our new favorite--the taste is great, the texture is good.  You do need to watch the cooking time carefully, because it can go from "al dente" to "too soft" rather quickly, and it doesn't heat up with as nice a texture as the first time it's cooked.  Since it's hard to find, I don't mind stocking up from Amazon, and with free shipping it's a no-brainer.

review/summary: Yummy stuff
review/text: If you can't eat gluten or want something more nutritious than white flour pasta, this is a great choice. I don't add any oil as someone suggested here (that makes sauces not stick so well later), just make sure the water is fully boiling and then stir periodically while it comes back up to a boil and it won't stick together at all. Make sure you salt the water, not just for flavor but because it raises the boiling temperature of the water. Don't overcook and if you're going to toss it into a skillet with veggies, undercook just slightly. It's pretty easy to make the adjustment, and it's good to keep in mind that this is a different kind of pasta so it does cook differently - that isn't a flaw. It doesn't have any strong taste and works perfectly in every dish I've tried so far, and I've been cooking with it for about a year now. Love this stuff!

review/summary: Don't bother unless you like eating pasta particles
review/text: I bought this thinking it would be a great alternative to straight corn pasta.  As it was cooking I was stirring it and it just started falling apart.  By the time I actually got done assembling the meal I was left with a pile of pasta particles.  Unfortunately it was also more expensive as well.  If you're looking for GF pasta I would recommend Millers Finest.  Haven't had this same issue with that brand, it is less expensive and it tastes better.

We try others but always come back to this one.  With the extra bold, I can use the largest cup size and still get a good cuppa coffee.  The Sumatran has the best flavor, better than French or Italian roast Extra Bolds.

review/summary: Heavily tweaked the kit !!!
review/text: I used this kit to make 4 gallons of port. It came out very well. It certainly took longer than the 4 weeks claimed by the kit, but then I made my own directions. I will recount my method in case anyone wants to try their hand at it. Here's what i did:<br /><br />I chose this kit because it had made five gallons of decent wine for me in the past. The blend had a good balance, but even at 5 gallons was a bit thin.<br /><br />I reserved one and one-half cups of concentrate and froze it. I used the remaining to make 4 gallons of must and fermented it with the yeast provided.<br /><br />About a month in, I added 1/4 gallon of simple syrup and some yeast nutrient.<br /><br />Two months in, I racked to a three gallon glass carboy and a one gallon jug, topped with simple syrup and air-locked them for another 2 months.<br /><br />I racked them back into a 5 gallon carboy and added the correct amount of cognac, using Pearson's square. I let it sit until I was certain fermentation was done.<br /><br />I stabilized the wine and degassed it and added in the thawed, room temp concentrate that I kept from the first and added medium toast french oak chips and rested the wine for another two months.<br /><br />At bottling I racked the wine from the sediment, but did not filter it as I usually do with regular wine. I wanted any oak residue to remain in the bottle and settle out over time.<br /><br />I was rewarded with a very good port that I expect to age very well. I will do this again in about 3 years.<br /><br />I saved money over using a port kit and got four gallons instead of three which port kits usually yield. It did take a very long time to make compared to a port kit, but with port, there is no need to hurry. I won't even open the first bottle for at least a year.What would I do different? I would splurge and buy a higher end cognac. I could afford it for what I saved. I would probably also use a higher quality cork, only because I plan to still be drinking this 6 or 7 years out. The included corks would have been just fine if i used the kit for basic table wine, as I doubt it would remain in the cellar more than a year. I will also like use a port yeast since I know this experiment worked out very well. I'm still money ahead.<br /><br />I make about 75 gallons of wine a year. Some from kits, some from fresh grapes and some from stuff you wouldn't think would make a good wine (cucumbers, beets, rhubarb, all make good wine, but take about 12 months from must to bottle. Most of my wine is given to friends and those people who have been kind enough to supply me with fresh grapes, cucumbers, rhubarb and beets.<br /><br />Ports, ice wines and sherries stay with me and cellar.<br /><br />Have fun. This is a great hobby. The price of these kits makes them attractive to do odd things with, for instance I blended a Moscato kit with some of the cucumber wine and it was really tasty. I don't think I would have played around like that with a hundred dollar kit.

review/text: I used to love these crackers.  They were a staple item.  A few months ago Sesmark changed the recipe and added flax seeds.  I like flax seeds as a rule, but the new crackers taste very different - very bland with little sesame flavor.  Big mistake Sesmark.  Bring back the original!  Since I couldn't find the originals on the store shelves (or private labeled at Trader Joes) I turned to the Web in desperation.  My pleasure at finding them on Amazon (which I didn't even know sold groceries) and at a great price with auto-shipping lasted only as long as it took for the first shipment to arrive.  It was a case (dozen boxes) of the new recipe.  Argh!  Amazon doesn't take groceries back so I didn't bother fighting them.  They do need to update the listing though.

review/summary: Sesmark Sesame Thins
review/text: I ordered these crackers because I cannot find them in our local grocery store.  I had thought I was ordering the Rice Thins, but, when they arrived, they were not what I had originally thought I was ordering.  When you order, it got a bit confusing because I did not know Sesmark had so many varieties of Sesame thins.  I should have specified Rice thins.  I had not.  When I received my order, the ones I received were the Sesame thins Original with Flaxseed.  They were more cracker like and dryer than the rice thins.  When ordering, make sure you are ordering carefully. If it is the rice thins you want, with the description, check to see it says rice thins.  Also, I don't know why it is that so many of the crackers were cracked during transportation.  They were Shipped in the original carton the crackers were packed in and then another box.  Somehow, these do not arrive well and need a new way of being packaged so they arrive in better condition. These small crackers are flavorful and I would recommend them.

review/summary: Wish they were packaged smaller
review/text: After ordering a Bubble Tea in CT restaurant, I was anxious to try this at home.  They were just as good. The only drawback is making them is a bit time-consuming, since they must be heated/boiled, then allowed time to cool before adding to the tea. They also come in large bags and I feel like a lot of them go to waste unless you use them often or try placing them in smaller bags and storing (unsure if they would retain freshness). They tasts great and have that addictive chewy texture. Will try storing them differently, perhaps in freezer to extend life of extra.

review/summary: Great Bubbles!
review/text: I bought these to make bubble tea for a kid's party and had no idea what I was doing.  They arrived within just a few days, in good condition.  You do need to cook them, which took me a few tries to figure out how. What I found best was to first sift any residual powder out so you cook only the bubbles.  Bring a pot of water to a rapid boil and stir while adding the bubbles.  Don't let them settle on the bottom.  Boil and occasionally stir for 25 minutes, cover and let sit for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Don't just dump them in the pot or you'll get a big blob.  This is a large package of bubbles, much more than I needed for a party of 15 kids.  The kids loved them and they even tasted good - a brown sugar taste.  We served them with 7Up.  I've stored the extra uncooked bubbles in a Ziploc bag in the refrigerator and they have kept well.  Overall, this is an excellent product, just like at the bubble tea caf&eacute;.

review/summary: These are just Okay
review/text: I bought a really big bag of these tapioca pearls, not realizing the weight was in kilograms, not pounds.  The tapioca pearls are quick to cook, but I found them to be a bit gooey in texture.  I prefer the firmer texture of the "pre-cooked" tapioca pearls, as opposed to these, but not too bad.

review/summary: Great tapioca balls, but rather expensive
review/text: Very easy to make, but takes about an hour before you can eat it.  This is how I make it. Place in after a strong boil, then cook on a slow boil for 25 min. Stir often so boba doesnt stick. Then turn off the heat and cover for another 25 mins.  Strain and add brown sugar (I usually add 1/3 cup to a cup of pre boiled boba) and let it sit for about 30 mins. Then add to your favorite drink hot or cold.  Love the consistency.  If you find them too mushy, run it in cold water to 'firm' it up a bit.<br /><br />FYI - you can find 2.2lb bags at an Asian grocery store for $3. This is ridiculously overpriced.  Also these tapioca balls are way better than the 5 minute cook ones -- those get hard when you add it to cold drinks.

review/summary: Great for bubble tea!
review/text: Comes in a large air-tight bag and was not damaged during shipping. After opening, be sure to seal as tightly as possible to minimize moisture exposure and store in a dry place.<br /><br />As for taste and texture, the tapioca is perfectly suited for making bubble tea. When making them, don't boil them for too long if you want a chewier texture. Furthermore, make a sugar syrup by boiling 2 cups water with 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. This can be used to make tapioca sweet and keep the texture soft before mixing it with the bubble tea. It can also be added to the bubble tea instead of using fructose or other flavors.

review/text: We love boba balls! (bubble tea) It is awesome. We first saw it on an episode of "unwrapped" on the food network channel. So we looked it up online and found it here! Go amazon! These are so good in smoothies! I would not recommend getting the kits because the tea mixes that come with it are really gross. The mixes are basically flavored milk. But if you buy the jamba juice or yoplait smoothie mixes at the grocery stores in the freezer aisles then these taste amazing!

review/summary: Good DIY Pearl for Bubble Tea
review/text: I've been looking for a pearl that doesn't turn out horrible at home. These were not the best I've had, but not the worst by far. They turned out to have a good texture- not super chewy/ not hard and pealing. They cooked for only about 17 minutes and were fine. They tasted much better than the minute pearls and not as slow as some other brands.<br /><br />The bag is HUGE! I wasn't sure what to expect, but these should last us for some time. If you can't find the large pearls locally and need to order online these have a lot of bang for your buck. When I calculated the size to shipping ratio for my area it was equal to purchasing the smaller box at the store (if I could ever find them).  Not a mind-blowing amazingly delicious pearl (what tapioca pearl is though), but they hit the spot and I don't regret buying the larger package.

review/summary: Great Tasting Boba! Some were turned to powder though...
review/text: Not sure if it was the shipping that caused it but when I received the bag, about 1/4 of it was completely powdered. The boba itself was much dryer and more crumbly than I expected, but when it was boiled it turned delicious! I wish that I could have used the last quarter of the bag for boba, but right now I can make a big layer of jelly with it but not much else.<br /><br />Would order (and am about to) again, but hopefully won't get too much powder this time.

review/text: Perhaps I just 'got lucky', but I am delighted with this product and how it turned out.<br /><br />I received my order of the black pearls today and promptly cooked up a batch. I boiled them for twenty minutes, stirring constantly. I let them cool for about ten minutes )still stirring frequently), drained them, rinsed with cold water, and then let them sit in cold water for a short time.<br /><br />We then made our first batch of tea, using decaf herbal tea, coconut milk, and liquid stevia. Oh yum! The pearls are a perfect chewy texture and the tea was sweet and smooth.<br /><br />Great product, even if it did come in a giant quantity. I think my daughter and I will have no trouble consuming them!

review/text: I had to write something here after reading all of bad reviews. These are obviously reviews from people who's tastebuds have been ruined in regards to what tea is actually supposed to taste like. I can see how this stuff would taste bad if you are used to the majority of tea drinks out there, which are ridiculously high in sugar and added flavor (even the "healthy" and "natural" varieties)<br /><br />I was very pleased when I found this tea because it's the only bottled variety I've found that tastes like the green tea I'm served when I eat at a japanese restaurant. It's very refreshing and if your tastebuds arent totally ruined then you'll find it has a very distinct and pleasant leafy flavor. It tastes like, you know, TEA LEAVES!

review/summary: Wonderfully Refreshing
review/text: I love this tea. I tried it initially at P.F changs restaurant and ordered it immediately after I found out what brand and flavor it was. It truly needs no sugar added just the wedge of a lemon. Trust me I'm a 24 year old who loves soda and sugar and I'm telling you this tea is perfect with just a wedge of lemon. Not only is it delicious but I've found that I lost a couple pounds because I'm drinking much less soda.<br /><br />Since the product description is lacking here is mine:::<br />Be aware that this tea is lose leaf and doesn't come in tea bags. After doing some research on the web I found that the best way to brew the tea is as follows. Each plastic bag inside the box has 3/4 ounce of tea. This should make 3/4 gallon or 96 ounces. So all you need to do is bring to a boil half the amount or 48 ounces in a pot. Then let it sit off the burner for 2 minutes. Then add the pouch of loose leaf tea [3/4 ounce in total] and let it steep or brew for 7 minutes.... 10 minutes is too long and 5 minutes is too short. So set a timer it's important.<br />After 7 minutes strain the water through a strainer with a paper towel layed in it. *** Make sure the bowl is beneath the strainer ***. Then put the strained liquid into a pitcher and add the remaining 48 ounces of tap water. Refridgerate and in an hour so should be good to go.<br /><br />In each of these boxes there are 24 3/4 ounces packages which will make a total of 18 gallons of iced tea.

Definitely stick to brewing it, then icing if you're hoping to match what is served in restaurants.<br /><br />The packaging kind of stinks: This product literally is a cardboard shipping box filled with plastic baggies of the tea, so you will need a storage solution unless you don't mind having a shipping box in your kitchen.

review/summary: THE BEST ICE TEA EVER!!!!!!!!
review/text: Have been searching for that awesome passion fruit tea you get at all the major restaurants.  This is it!!!!!!!!  After reading the reviews I made the purchase and am so happy I did.  My search is over!  I am telling everyone I know that they should forget that passion fruit ice tea you find at the supermarket (Yuck!), or the specialty tea/coffee shops, this is the one you want.  I make it in my ice tea maker and use 2 coffee filters to hold the loose tea (one in the base of the section where you place the tea and one up over the side where the water pumps in.  I find this keeps the first filter from folding over and letting the loose tea escape into my pitcher).  Two bags divides up to make 5 pitchers.  I use no sweetener (but then I never do).  It is so refreshing and considering those restaurant chains charge you almost $3 for a glass (can anyone say rip off?!?!?) this is a steal!  Ditch that soda for summer and switch to China Mist!

review/summary: Horrible taste and texture
review/text: Going gluten free isn't easy.  However, there are plenty of options that will get you close to eating traditional bread.<br /><br />This is not one of them.<br /><br />The cooking process is pretty accurate on the box.  The dough mix is almost pure liquid so you'll need a pizza pan.  In my case, I used a cookie sheet which was deep enough to not slosh over.<br /><br />You cook the liquid mixture for 10 minutes or so, pull it out, puncture the air holes and then cook some more.  Toppings go on last and just long enough to melt.<br /><br />The final product was almost inedible.  The dough is tough and chewy.  It doesn't cut without a knife.  Because of the cookie sheet, a pizza cutter wouldn't get the edges and we had to push so hard to get through the fake bread leather that I dented the cookie sheet and destroyed it.<br /><br />However, the taste is worse than the texture.  The herbs and the mix itself make an almost bitter tasting dough.  The taste is just awful.<br /><br />The crust crisped a little around the edges but was still tough.<br /><br />There are better options out there.  Try Udi's, Rudi's or Glutino products either as already prepared pizza or already prepared crust.  If you have a Mellow Mushroom in town, try their pizza.  They are careful about cross contamination.<br /><br />Just don't get this one.

review/text: Everyone raved about these chocolates for Super Bowl Sunday.  They are packed well, prompt delivery.  Plentiful supply to share, and a fun accent on the coffee table for football season.  Tasty and wrapped in seasonal cellophane.  We have also purchased chocolate cars for Nascar Sundays.  The chocolate cigars we sent a friend were so realistic, he saved them for a "smoke"....Thanks for a fun product!

review/summary: These taste awfull!!
review/text: Don't let them mislead you. First they'll call you their 'buddy' but its all a ruse. They are not your buddy. I served these as Hor d'ourves at a recent party I threw in lieu of more exotic fare (pigs in a blanket, PRE-shelled peanuts or chex party mix) thinking I would really knock my guests socks off with these pre-made bacon and cheese delights. To be prepared for the demand I bought forty cases.<br />Well let me tell you what a surprise I was in for. After my tenth 'buddy biscuit' I discovered these appetizers are disgusting. There is way to much cheese (cheese madness indeed! It's all one can do to maintain their sanity against this lactose lunacy!) to bacon going on. They're a bit drier then I prefer my dehydrated cheeses as well.<br />Needless to say my party was a complete failure. several guest vomited on the spot, another said she would never come to another one of my parties again and somebody else said they were immediately going to my mothers house to horse whip her for bearing such a stupid baby into the world. That strikes me as a bit extreme but in fairness they were disgusting.<br />I only gave them 2 stars because my dog seemed to enjoy them enough.

review/summary: Can't Stop Eating This Stuff
review/text: This product is a very crispy chocolate chocolate chip cookie.  It is described on the bag as the crispy part of a brownie, but it really reminds me more of a well done cookie.  The pieces are not uniform in size, so you can reach in the bag and retrieve a small piece or one as large as your hand.  But each piece is very crispy and the flavor is fantastic.  It is difficult to stop eating these.  We bought one bag and it was gone in a day, which led me to look on Amazon to see if I could buy more of it and have it conveniently delivered, hopefully in bulk supply, to my home.  Just back the truck up to my garage and unload the boxes ... that would be fine with me.  So, if you contemplate ordering this product, do not buy just one bag.  You will be sorry.  Instead, buy many bags, keep your family happy, and enjoy one of the best snacks ever invented.

review/summary: Brownie taste, edge crispiness, no boring soft middle pieces!
review/text: I absolutely adore the crunchy edge gits of a pan of brownies...unfortunately, so does the rest of my family. Whenever we bake a pan, the edge pieces (especially the corners) vanish in an instant, leaving the soft middle to be picked away at.<br /><br />Then...we discovered brownie brittle. This stuff is fantastic! The chocolate level is very rich, so I can rarely handle more than one or two of the bigger pieces...which is fantastic, because I get my crunchy brownie edge fix without feeling guilty that I just scarfed down a 200-calorie brownie.

review/text: I actually order these and give them to give my grandmother who lives abroad.  She's a diabetic and is always wanting more sugar-free candy.  She has them everyday as a treat between meals.  I've already ordered the pack of 12 twice which is a good sign because she still hasn't gotten sick of them!!  She likes that they are sour and that it includes two different flavors.  She's not super picky, but there are definately a bunch of sugar-free options that she does not like at all, so I guess they are pretty good and the price here is great.

review/summary: Really easy to make and really tasty
review/text: I wouldn't say this tastes like rum at all. But it was very tasty. I used a little bit of a larger pan than it called for. I would definitely use an 8" pan next time, which is really very small. I was only able to have enough extra crust to spot the top. The cheesecake itself is good. The crust is where the so called "rum" taste is supposed to be. It tastes more like a caramel cinnamon crust. In fact, it tastes like coffee cake. Really tasty. Will definitely be getting some more and making it again!

review/summary: The worst of the ones I've tried but famikly loved it
review/text: I made the cheesebake recipe on the back and had two problems...first of all, I used an 8" pan and with the thinnest crust, there's was barely anything left for the top.  It absolutely cannot be made in an 8" pan and look like the cover picture. When I made the bottom the thickness like the cover, there was maybe three tablespoons left for topping.  I started over and made the bottom really super thin and basically had to just drop teaspoons on the top because there still wasn't even enough for the crust to come up over the edge and go all the way around the edge.  Also, very little caramel in the packet.  It could make a decent 6" maybe but nothing like the cover photo for an 8".  That is ridiculous...if the cover is a double recipe, you need to say it on the box that an 8" pan requires a double batch.  The other problem is, the cream cheese portion was absolutely an 8" pan portion - so you could make it 6" and have a decent crust with decent caramel topping but you would have to waste half the cream chees mix because it wouldn't fit.<br /><br />Taste....<br /><br />Everyone ate it and asked to take some home (it was a multiple desert party where I always send take home of each dessert).  I gave it all away, I didn't enjoy it - almost didn't serve it at all after testing it. Besides the lack of topping and caramel, I am highly sensitive to chemical/phony tasting food and the rum taste was like low-grade faux extract to me.  YUK....but it gets three stars because only one other person didn't pick it as a favorite, and several people actually said "WOW, what's that? I loved it!" I was shocked.

review/summary: Tastes a bit like cardboard
review/text: These people who are picky about chocolate cake actually LIKED this? For me a really good chocolate cake needs to be moist and tasty on its own without relying on frosting. This does not fit the bill. I give it three stars because it is reasonably moist, and the consistency is not bad. It actually rises a good amount while baking. There's no graininess that I often get from gluten free products. However there is very little flavor. I am not a sugar fiend at all. I find most commercial cookies and chocolates to be way too sweet. I eat 70% cocoa mass dark chocolate with very little sugar in it. This cake does not have enough sugar or chocolate in it for me to rate it any higher. On its own, it tastes like cardboard. However, when I poured some chocolate sauce and caramel onto it, it was great! I guess this cake will be pretty good if you add frosting, but I'm not in the habit of putting frosting on everything. A good cake should be tasty on its own.

review/summary: Not Bad, Not Bad at All
review/text: It's actually pretty good particularly if you are comparing it to the cheap ramen found in most groceries. After reading reviews on all the Nong Shim varieties I was careful to add only half the flavor packet as I expected a full packet to produce something akin to liquid Habaneros. After the first taste I tossed the rest of the packet in and enjoyed a fairly tasty bowl of soup. Make no mistake, even if you're used to hot Asian or Southern foods your sinuses are likely to be fully cleared by the time you finish the last drop but it's nowhere near as bad as it's been made out to be. There are several sauces and peppers used in Asian cooking that can drop a careless user in their tracks. This is not even close to that level of spicy. It DOES have plenty of salt. A little much even for my taste and I'm a confirmed saltaholic.<br />Overall a very tasty and quick meal that should be even more enjoyable during the cold months. I am going to try adding ingredients to make it a little heartier. A few small frozen already cooked shrimp and a couple of spoonfuls of corn and peas ought to really flesh this soup out. One suggestion I would make is to follow the instructions for preparation exactly, at least the first couple of times you make it. Once you have a feel for how it's supposed to taste you can alter to suit your own preferences but at least you'll know whether or not you've made an improvement.

review/text: These noodles aren't special... go to your local korean grocery store to see some good bowls of noodles.  These are basically just cheap ramen (with the ubiquitous single flavor packet) in a cheap styrofoam bowl, marked up 600% over what you'd normally pay for ramen without the bowl.  Save yourself the disappointment, buy the cheap ramen in your local grocery store, and provide your own bowl.  If you want good ramen, however, do what I said and go to a korean store, but expect to pay at least $2/bowl for it.  That is what I thought these were going to be, and that is why I bought them.  Unfortunately, they are not, and I am disappointed in this purchase.

review/summary: Goos Noodles
review/text: Great noodles, but a little spicy. If you like spicy then put the whole flavor packet in bowl but if I like mine a little less spicy so only put half or 3/4 of packet and it comes out tasty.

review/summary: Not as tasty as the lobster
review/text: The lobster flavor beats this by far. Every time I made the lobster, my mouth would water just smelling it and it was full of flavor.  This shrimp one is a big let down after that, it is just lacking flavor.

review/summary: lackluster
review/text: Stick with the standard Shin Ramyun which is spicier.  I didn't notice any shrimp flavor.  The local Chinese supermarket sold this for $10 a case but happily also had loose ones for a dollar each.  I couldn't finish it.

review/summary: A little salty, but ok
review/text: This noodle is a little salty, so you should just put a half bag of the spicy bag. You can see shrimps, even they are only pieces and tiny. It's an ok choice if you are very busy and have no time to cook.<br /><br />One thing you must take care: if you want to microwave it, please open the lid, it burned to fire if you close the lid. I got a fire within the microwoven  and the alarm is ringing. I knew there is no instruction said it can be microwaved, but just remind the lid must be opened and 3-4 miu is enough if you want to microwave it.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious
review/text: These lentils (are they beans or lentils?) cook fast (20 minutes) and are truly delicious and smooth. I often add them to hearty vegetable soups, and also to vegetable stews (I sautee onions, sweet potatoes, leeks--or other veggies,the combinations are endless--for a few minutes, then add water and the Chana Dal lentils. I add spices and then let this cook for 20 to 30 minutes on medium/low. It is very healthy, nourishing, and above all, incredibly tasty.

review/summary: Delicious Chili & Lime Peanuts
review/text: These peanuts are crisp, fresh and not too salty.  They are a perfect balance of chili-lime without either flavor being overwhelming.  We went through the 4-pack in two weeks.  Highly recommend.
