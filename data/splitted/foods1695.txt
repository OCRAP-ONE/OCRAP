review/summary: Excellent English Breakfast Tea
review/text: I have been searching for the 'right' balanced English Breakfast Tea for a few years now. Other than actual English Teas from London, England, it was very difficult to find a rich and aromatic English Breakfast.<br /><br />After trying out at least 20 different varieties, including some very expensive brands, I've found this to be the perfect cuppa in the morning. Personally, loose leaf seems to taste a lot better to me, and I've not tried the tea-bag variety on this one.<br /><br />Hope others enjoy this tea as much as I have.

review/summary: the best green tea
review/text: We lived in Japan for 3 years and I leaned to love green tea.  Upon our return to the U.S. I started a hunt for green tea in a price range suitable for daily use - e.g. breakfast.  Stash Premium Green Tea, whether loose or in bags, is really excellent. Most other green teas taste like the lawn, this green teas is really delicious.

review/text: We've been drinking this tea for 3 years now.  My whole family really enjoys it.  We drink it plain (no sugar, milk , etc).  One reviewer says it is sweet or has other ingredients; I disagree.  From what we can tell, it is just tea and bergamont.<br />The tea is very high quality whole leaves and it is packed and shipped very well.

review/summary: I always come back to this tea
review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.

review/text: Stash is a decent brand of tea. We've got a number of their varieties in the house. We only use loose leaf and this doesn't have that tendency you sometimes get in loose leaf to be teeny tiny powder bits. You can actually tell that this was, at one time, a plant.<br /><br />It's got a good mild flavour that is just right near bedtime.

review/text: This is a quality tea that requires you to follow the directions.  My first attempt was by using my old method that works well with a different brand of tea.  In my opinion, when I did the job my old way the result was powerful (too strong).  After two more failed attempts I finally decided to read and follow the brief directions on the package. What have been enjoying for a few years is a strong tea with milk.  Now I have discovered a tea that can be enjoyed straight.

I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!

review/summary: Doesn't taste like English Breakfast to me.
review/text: I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect.

review/text: The Izze Clementine flavour is a blend of orange juice (from concentrate) with sparkling water. Not too tangy, it has a pleasantly mild and modified orange flavour. It's not too fizzy, but it does have a tendency to go flat fast, so it's not something you want to sip over a long period of time.<br /><br />At 80 calories in this small 8.4 ounce can, it's not for those who are watching their weight, but it's certainly a viable alternative to nasty sugary sweet drinks.

review/text: Not that I ever have from any product. Really, if you're looking for information on nutritional value, evaluations of health benefits/liabilities, or praise for the corporate responsibility of the owners, check one of the other reviews.  All I can tell you is the taste of the Clementine variety is acceptable but I will not be searching the Net or employing any conventional methodologies to find more of it.<br /><br />Maybe it's my recalcitrance in being browbeat at every turn over potential health concerns related to dietary habits; maybe as I age I'm turning into some transmogrified reconstitution of Andy Rooney, Jack Cafferty and Bill Cosby, or it may simply have been the suggestiveness of the container color.  Reading Fast Food Nation didn't reduce my over the counter greasy bag calorie intake and this beverage is not going to compel me to pour my Orange Crush down the drain. My delusional state anticipated an ostensibly less imposing version of Sunkist orange and what my salivary glands sensed was some rather bitter orange flavored sparkling water.  In spite of all evidence to the contrary, I will continue to ingest beverages with high fructose sugar levels right up to the point the disposition of my remains is decided by my health conscious progeny. My dentist has a couple of kids with Ivy League pretensions and he enthusiastically concurs.<br /><br />Izze Clementine isn't bad. It just isn't all that much to write about... so why...nevermind. When I feel intimidated by my octogenarian neighbor mowing his quarter acre plot with a push mower, whilst  I try to decide if I really need to get on the riding mower or if it can wait another couple of days,  the thirst I develop in contemplation  will not be quenched by merely one of these 8.4 oz cans.<br /><br />In essence, if other options are not available, I have no reservations in drinking it but by personal volition you can expect to see me continue to enjoy higher octane competition.

review/text: I was happily surprised by Izze sparkling Clementine juice beverage.  Why? First, the main ingredient is actually juice (70%), which is fantastic and amazing.  The beverage tastes good and I do like carbonated juice.  I also like that it is in 8oz cans, a practical juice size rather then a 12 oz soda  size.  So, a reasonably good for you good tasting juice drink, can't go wrong with that.  The Izze company also appears to do some good humanitarian and earth friendly practices, which is another plus.

I tried it and felt a sugar shock coming on, with not much taste.  Hansen's Mandarin Lime is much tastier.  My husband, said "Ugh it's horrible, why did I try it?" and poured it down the sink.  Warning:  19 grams of sugar reminds me of the horrible orange drinks they give you for glucose tolerance test.  And what's with the rosin?  I thought that is for violin bows.  Some people might be extremely allergic to it.  Finally the label says no refined sugar, but concentrating fruit juices is refining sugar, just a matter of technicality.

review/summary: Can you say "generic orange soda"?
review/text: One of the flavor memories of my 1960s childhood that evinces the least nostalgia is that of stale orange "tonic" (as we called it in New England) bought from the local Bradlees or Ferretti's discount super markets. The only more heinous flavor was grape soda -- a chemical brew so noxious that it burned going down (we thought this was normal) and left an acid-stripped sheen on the teeth.<br /><br />But now, this taste sensation is back, in the form of Izze's "all natural" sparkling juice. "All natural" is the sort of 21st century newspeak terms that hides more than it reveals. To my hippy-dippy mind, all natural means orange juice (even if from a concentrate) plus some pure spring water gently infused with natural CO2 and bottled by hand by pure, cotton sundressed nymphs. It does not have (as does this concoction) *fourteen* ingredients, including "natural flavor" (what, sulfuric acid?), glycerol ester of rosin, or pyridoxine hydrochloride, even if this is supposedly vitamin B12.<br /><br />I now have a case of this stuff in my house. Thanks for the memories, Amazon Vine!

review/summary: Refreshing, unusual, and natural
review/text: Until recently, I had never heard of the brand `Izze', much less their line of Sparkling Juice beverages.  When Amazon Vine posted a request to review them, however, my interest was most certainly piqued, being a sucker for anything fruit-flavored.  My only dilemma revolved around what flavor to order.  They all look so interesting to me, but I deliberated between the three flavors I found most intriguing:  Blackberry, Pomegranate, and Clementine.<br /><br />I finally decided on the Clementine.  When a case of twenty-four arrived at my office, I had plenty to share with a couple of friends, and after chilling a few cans, we enjoyed our first taste of this unusual libation together.<br /><br />We all enjoyed it, although I think I liked it more than the other two.  However, I've been to wine tastings with this pair of friends, and I notice they don't usually care for sparkling wine either, which leaves me to wonder if it was the effervescence that they didn't like rather than the flavor.  As for me, I adore sparkling beverages, so this is right up my alley.<br /><br />The Clementine flavor tastes just like the fruit, although I admit I had expected a slightly sweeter drink than the Izze turned out to be.  The label on the can states it is "naturally flavored", and that is exactly what I got.  My belief that it would be sweeter is probably borne of the fact that most commercial beverages do have more sugar added.  Because of this, the slightly tart taste was a bit startling, but after the first few sips I truly appreciated the freshness of it.<br /><br />In fact, I enjoyed the Clementine flavor so much that I went looking for the Izze beverages in the local stores, and succeeded in finding both of the other flavors I wanted to try: Pomegranate and Blackberry.  Of all of them, I think the Blackberry is probably my favorite, although the Clementine is a close second.  I think the Blackberry wins by a nose strictly because it is such an uncommon flavor for a beverage, and that appeals to me as much as the flavor itself does.  It helps that I adore blackberries, though.<br /><br />The Pomegranate was my least favorite of the three, and I don't believe I'll buy it again, although I did drink all four cans in the pack that I purchased.  The flavor was slightly bitter, although it does grow on you after a few swallows.  But once again, it does taste very close to eating the pomegranate fruit.<br /><br />I definitely recommend the Izze drinks.  I will most certainly be purchasing both the Clementine and Blackberry flavors in the future.

review/text: Everyone loved this product at my house! The taste is nice and refreshing. My teen son loves it and I feel good about him drinking something that is mostly juice, sugar and caffine free. The serving is a great size and easy to pack into lunches and even your bag for work. My husband is taking his to the office and likes the smaller size as well. I tried Izze when a friend came over as a mixer and it was a hit. I'll be looking for this at the grocery store and want to try other flavors as well. YUM!

review/summary: A crisp tasty beverage made from all natural juice.
review/text: Izze all natural sparkling juice (Clementine) is a very delicious drink.  They come in real nifty 8 ounce cans (for the conscious calorie watcher) that are great for those who want a quick treat without feeling guilty.  Unlike other juice drinks, this one is refreshing, tasty and not to syrupy sweet.  The drink reminded me of an Italian soda.  I would strongly recommend this beverage.  You can't go wrong with picking up a case of this good stuff.<br />I'm hooked and a future customer.  The juice is lightly fortified with a few vitamins for your good health.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Fine -- But Not Clementine
review/text: I was pretty psyched to be able to try a case of this "sparkling juice" out, since during the summer I drink a fair amount of juice mixed with soda water. Also, I grew up in North Africa, where the clementine grows in abundance, and I was looking forward to revisiting a taste of childhood. On the pro side, the packaging is attractive, the 8.4oz can is a really handy size, and there's no added high fructose corn syrup. On the con side, the much-touted "fortified" aspect consists of 10% of your daily Vitamin C, B6, and Niacin, so great big deal there. Also, the carbonation isn't as strong as I prefer, although I will grant that this is a very subjective personal thing. Straight out of the can, it feels a touch flat to me. Finally, the biggest con of all -- there's no clementine juice in it! When I cracked the first can open and tried it over ice, at the end of the glass I thought, "Hmm, kind of like clementine, but not quite." Then I looked at the label and saw that 's a blend of white grape, apple, lemon, and orange juice concentrates! Well, nice try Izze...but no cigar. Ultimately, it's something I'll keep around to use as a mixer with vodka, but not that tasty to me on its own. And frankly, I find the labeling of it as "clementine" totally shameless and off-putting.

review/summary: Oh My Darlin' Clementine?  But a tasty treat.
review/text: This vitamin enriched fruit-based (70%), carbonated (30% water) drink is obviously healthier than soda for which it is an estimable replacement.  It  has no refined sugar--a big plus, but it also lacks any Clementine.  I guess they call it that because the taste is, more or less, like these small oranges (which taste something like a cross between a tangerine and a naval orange).  Most of it is grape & apple juices.  As with pure juices vs. juice "drinks" or "cocktails" it costs considerably more per can--and the cans are small.  Convenient size, but you might need to have more than one (would probably go well with potato chips!).  I like drinking them with microwave popcorn myself.  Enjoy!

review/summary: The Entire Family Loves Izze
review/text: My daughter gets Izze when we stop at Starbucks but I never tried one myself. Izze is an all natural soda. I tried it and was surprised how much I liked it. It's not as sweet as diet soda and I like that. Based on the ingredients I don't feel bad letting the kids have it now and then. I'll also be getting them again myself. The size of the can makes them very nice for packing in lunches and in coolers.<br /><br />We got a case of Clementine Izze and the family helped me drink them. They wanted to help with the review as well.<br /><br />Mom: As good as Izze tastes, what I like even more is the ingredient list. I've stopped drinking diet soda because I won't drink aspartame, and sucralose (Splenda) makes me ill. Izze is sweetened by natural fruit juices (70%) and not refined sugar, corn syrup, etc. The rest of the ingredients are sparkling water and vitamins. I feel good giving this drink to my 11-year-old daughter for a treat, and she loves it. We've tried all the flavors and like each one, but Clementine is the family favorite.<br /><br />Daughter: Izzie is a great thirst quencher. And not only that, but it's healthy, too! I love anything fruity of fizzy and Izzie was the perfect fit.

review/summary: pop and tart
review/text: In the crowded field of orange soda pop beverages, a relatively new product needs a niche to succeed.  Izze's schtick is 70% fruit juice, no sugar added.<br /><br />In this formulation "Sparkling Clementine" is actually a blend of grape, apple, lemon and orange juice concentrates.  I was disappointed to find that it didn't seem to contain clementine or even mandarin orange.<br /><br />The can is very attractively slender shaped and looks good enough to serve to guests out of the can.<br /><br />The taste is tart and fizzy along the lines of european citrus drinks (think Orangina), but with a slightly sweeter finish.  It does grow on you.<br /><br />All in all, a recommendable product, but somebody should probably get some clementine juice in there, or change the name.<br /><br />Disclosure: This review was written for the Amazon Vine Volunteer Review Program.  The product was provided for the purposes of the review.

review/summary: Izze Good
review/text: I wasn't sure exactly what a Clementine was going into this product. All I knew was that Huckleberry Hound used to sing about his Darlin' Clementine back in those old Hannah Barberra cartoons. I still am not sure what fruit the clementine actually is but it's definatly an offshoot of the citrus family, sort of orangy and not at all bitter.<br />The Izze product comes neatly packages in a slim can and swallows easily with no poor aftertaste. It is not over carbonanted so no unlightly belches afterwards, always a bonus amongst polite company. The product was sent in a case of 24 so it lasted quite some time and I think now that I shoulkd have requested some of the additional flavors whilst they were available. Drink Izze, be happy.

review/text: At first taste, a strange orange carbonated drink, but with each followup swig, the taste seems to get better and better!<br /><br />  * An all-natural blend of pure fruit juice and sparkling water<br />  * 70% Fruit Juice 30% Sparkling Water<br /><br />I love that this is a drink that's got a punch of fruit juice and the sparkling water just makes it even more enjoyable. Clementine tastes just like fresh oranges, so it's a good flavor for anytime of day or night.<br /><br />  * Simple, stylish packaging great for entertaining or everyday refreshment<br />  * Pairs perfectly with fine food and is a stylish non-alcoholic beverage option<br /><br />Refridgerating Izze does wonders for the cool refreshing taste on your tongue, and is a great drink to quench one's taste or partner up with a snack. The 8.4 ounce cans are a perfect size for a quick thirt-buster and very handy and portable/on-the-go. Love the design too!<br /><br />  * Made with natural ingredients and fortified with vitamins (vitamin C, B6 and Niacin)<br /><br />Only 80 calories a drink, so I can drink one after the other! The taste is quite addictive, again, gets better with each swig! Highly recommended! Cannot wait to try the other flavors.

review/summary: If you like Orangina, give Izze "Sparkling Clementine" a shot...
review/text: Another fine addition to the currently popular trend of so-called "natural" alternatives to traditional soda and other soft drinks, Izze "Sparkling Clementine" represents the designer soft drink genre at its best.<br /><br />At 80 calories per an 8.oz can, this juice beverage does contain less calories than real juice and normal soda, but can hardly be considered diet food. Still, vitamins C, B6 and niacin are added in low doses, it's low in salt and no corn syrup or sugar is added, relying instead on juice concentrates of grape, apple, lemon and orange to naturally sweeten... all good things.<br /><br />The taste of the particular flavor of Izze that I sampled, "sparkling clementine", is clean, fruity, refreshing, yet not overly sweet.<br /><br />In fact, for those familiar, Izze "Sparkling Clementine" is strongly reminiscent of the "Orangina" brand of soft drink, minus the pulp... a personal favorite of mine.<br /><br />All in all, recommended.

review/summary: Tart and refreshing if...
review/text: I've had time to go through most of the case of this product, and I give it a slightly positive overall review.  The pros: small size can holds just the right amount of this different beveridge, and fits easily in the hand; when consumed while nice and cold, it offers a tart and refreshing taste, without a bit of sweetness.  The cons: the warmer the product gets, the harder it is to get down; the tartness begins to be more like bitterness, and it leaves a somewhat disagreeable aftertaste.  The small can helps keep this to a minimum.<br />If your taste runs more towards non-sweet, highly sparkling drinks, this is for you. If you prefer more conventional types of soft drinks or juices, this may seem too 'adult'.

The eight ounce size gave it a light 80 calories of fresh, crisp flavor with just enough fizz to whet the appetite of anyone who enjoys just a bit of carbonation in a healthy drink.  I will definitely be purchasing other flavors of the Izze Sparkling Juice and am particularly looking forward to trying their pomegranate flavor.  I even like the size of the can and the way it feels in my hand.  Highly recommended.

review/text: If you are sick of the overly-sweet taste of regular or diet sodas, this is the product for you.<br /><br />As a sparkling juice drink, Izze offers the best of both worlds -- there's fruit juice for health and fizz for fun. The taste is excellent, and the packaging size is just enough to refresh you.<br /><br />Of course, you can always mix any fruit juice with seltzer at home for a healthy spritzer, but Izze can't be beat for refreshment on the go! It's a great item to take along with you to work or school, and will save you from the feast of chemicals usually available from vending machines or fast fast food places.<br /><br />The clementine flavor has the wonderful sweet/tart taste of a fizzy fresh fruit! The pomegranite is a mix of apple, grape, pineapple, lemon and pomegranite and packs quite a tart and sweet punch!

review/text: So I got a case of this stuff because I was curious as to what clementine juice might taste like. I got it, took a swig...and found it to be OK, if a little odd...I then looked at the side of the can to see how much clementine juice is in the can. Here is, verbatim, the ingredients list:<br /><br />"Pure juice made from white grape, apple, lemon and orange juice concentrates, sparkling water, natural flavor, citric acid, sodium citrate, gum arabic, beta carbotene (color), ascorbic acid (vitamic C),  glycerol ester or rosin, niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitimin B6)."<br /><br />See anything odd about that ingredients list? Look carefully...What's missing? How about clementine juice?!!? Not a spec of it. Talk about smoke and mirrors. "All natural"? Maybe. But lots of cheap juice and none of the namesake? Give me a break. I've been had. Don't make the same mistake.

review/summary: IZZE made a hit with my entire family with this flavor!
review/text: We have been drinking various forms of flavored carbonated natural drinks for many years. From Knudsens to After the Fall, to Flavored Vitamin Waters without the carbonation, my family has tried all kinds of different flavors and types of carbonated and non-carbonated drinks with no refined sugars added.<br /><br />IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is made of 70% fruit juice with added vitamins such as B6, Beta Carotene, Niacinimide, and vitamin C.  I am not sure what the *natural flavors* added are, as this is often a hiding place for ingredients with some companies that do not want you to know little things they sneak in.<br /><br />Flavorwise, IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is very good.  It is made from concentrate so there is not the fresh flavor that you would get from fresh juice, but I find that this juice only has a tiny bit of bitter edge to it- nothing like most orange flavored juice beverages we have had.<br /><br />What impresses us about this is that it is not overly syrupy like some juices are.  It takes very light, yet filling.<br /><br />Another feature of this drink is that the bubbles are not heavy and the carbonation is not overly strong.  Sometimes drinks have so much carbonation in them that they are annoying.  This one has light to medium carbonation in it.<br /><br />One additional thing I like about this is that the cans are relatively small (8.4oz/248ml).  I have never liked the huge can sizes because I feel that you should only drink small amounts of cooked juice products at a time anyway.<br /><br />There are 24 in the case, which is a good number.  We drank this warm without ice, but chilled it is also delicious.  It tends to go down a bit easier when it is chilled.<br /><br />With ice, it is an even lighter drink and bit more refreshing as the ice dilutes it leaving just a hint of orange flavor.<br /><br />All in all, IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is a hit in our house.  Great flavor, just enough in a can for a snack, and all without added refined sugars or caffeine! My daughter keeps saying- "Mom, I just LOVE this stuff."

Is this bad?  Not at all--it's still refreshing and a perfect companion for a cookout.  And with its vitamins and such, might stick with you a little longer.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Good size, not too sweet
review/text: I received a case of these, and my family finished this in less than two weeks.  Maybe not the quickest turnaround with a soft drink, but the biggest complaint I received (from my 8-year-old) was that it wasn't sweet enough.  Considering the kinds of soft drinks she usually likes- and only rarely gets- I'm pleased.<br /><br />I found this to be just sweet enough- no added sugar, only the juices- and just the right size.  This felt like an appropriate serving of a sweet/non-water beverage- the usual sizes usually feel like two servings.  And, while I'm not sure that this was intentional, when my children knocked over the cans (this happened twice), nothing spilled out even though they were more than half-way full each time.  Bonus- if you're klutzy.<br /><br />I knocked off a star because of the slight mis-marketing- clementine juice is not the first juice on the list of ingredients, and that irritated me a little bit.  Otherwise, this would be something I would reach for on the rare occasion I wanted a carbonated beverage.

review/summary: Tart, tart, tart
review/text: I don't usually drink carbonated orange beverages, mainly because most of them have two distinct characteristics:<br />1) a very artificial flavor, and<br />2) enough sugar to eat through the side of an armored tank.<br /><br />But I will admit that the clementine-flavoured sparkling juice from Izze tastes quite different, primarily because it has more juice than sugar. You can actually taste the fruit juice in there, which is given a little extra zing courtesy of mild carbonation -- the sort of thing that you get in sparkling cider. And if there was artificial flavour in there, I couldn't really taste it.<br /><br />In fact, it's unlike orange soda pop in one other way: it's tart. Very tart. Almost sour if drunk with something sweet, and I found that it tasted best when simply drunk on its own. And it's worth noting that the tartness means that it isn't something you want to drink large quantities of all at once, the way Coke is.<br /><br />The sparkling clementine juice from Izze is a good, healthier alternative to soda pop, but the tart flavor keeps it from being a contender for replacing it. Pleasant in small doses.

review/summary: it's all a matter of taste
review/text: Drinks and food are hard to rate because everyone has their own taste.  So here's my take - I thought this drink tasted more like a fruit soda without being overly sweet.<br /><br />I am a big fan of drinking sparkling mineral water.  My favorites are San Pellegrino and Perrier.  Sometimes I add a twist of an orange or lemon slice to add some flavor and I thought this drink might be a great alternative.  It's similar to Orangina but much cheaper, a little sweeter and more fruity.  I deducted a point because although the orange taste was there, there was an undefinable fruity taste as well.  When I took a gander at the can, I noted that it is made up of several fruit juices (from concentrates) such as apples, lemons, white grapes and oranges.  What happened to the clementine?<br /><br />It's advertised as an all natural healthy drink. Hmmm.  There are 80 calories to a can which is only 8.4 ozs.  There are 19 grams of sugar in each can (compared to a 12 oz. can of soda which has around 39 grams).  It does contain 10% of recommended daily doses of Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Niacin.  My kids seem to like it and since they are not allowed to drink soda, this does the trick for a special treat.

review/text: I tried the clementine version of the Izze drinks, and like several other reviewers found the nearest comparison to be the classic orange drink Orangina. I think I prefer Izze to Orangina now, though obviously tastes are personal and your opinion may vary. The Izze has a tart finish at the end that makes the taste a little more interesting. I bet it'd be pretty good with vodka or rum (are you allowed to say that in an Amazon review?).<br /><br />I also like the 8.4 ounce cans. That seems to be a good volume for a fast pick-me-up -- not too little like a tiny can of apple juice, or too filling like a giant bottle of soda.<br /><br />Speaking of soda, that's of course what this drink is, so don't expect pulp or, necessarily, a lot of natural flavors. It isn't orange juice, but a sparkling drink. If you are bored with colas, not interested in "energy drinks," and it's too late in the day for coffee, you might find this worth checking out.

review/summary: Very Good!
review/text: Not sure why this is called Clementine, as there is no Clementine juice in it! It is a very strong citrus flavor, but I like that. Kind of like a strong orangina. Tasty stuff! 70% fruit juice, some vitamin fortification too.<br /><br />I like the pomegranate flavor as well, though it tastes more cranberry to me. If you are expecting the antioxidant rich benefit of the pomegranate, I would look elsewhere as that fruit is the last juice listed. In other words, I doubt there is much POM in there!

review/summary: tasty, healthy, convenient, surprisingly practical
review/text: I was skeptical, but I'm convinced now this is an excellent product. Izze produces a delicious soda-like drink that is actually good for you.  I would not hesitate giving this to my soda-deprived kids.  With 70 percent juice and 30 percent sparkling water, what's not to like? In particular, the Sparkling Clementine is a refreshing drink.  Moreover, the small size (8.4 oz) is actually a virtue, as it fits handily in the old lunchbox.<br /><br />Most of my skepticism concerned the economics. I worked out that, disregarding s/h, if you get a case of this stuff it works out to about 10 1/2 cents per ounce.  Surely it's much cheaper, I thought, just to buy good juice and sparkling water at the store and mix it yourself.  Well, after doing the numbers I found it is cheaper, but not much--by about two cents per ounce, and that doesn't include the cost of gas to get to the store.  So you pay a little bit--at most a quarter per can--for the added convenience of a handy little can of delicious drink.  I recommend this highly, even though I'm frankly not sure how Izze does it.

review/summary: Nice flavorful alternative to soda--this review is for the Clementine and Apple Sparkling juice
review/text: Made up of a 70% mix of various fruit juices, the Izze Clementine drink is tasty (I disagree with some folks here...don't know what they were expecting it is, after all, a sparkling juice NOT a soda)with a nice tangy taste. Clementine had a nice smooth citrus taste and my entire family enjoyed it so much that we took it to the baseball game with us as an alternate to having soda (although water would have been the best best this is at least a good compromise with the mix of juice and carbonated water).<br /><br />The Apple flavored version smells almost like a sour apple Jolly Rancher but isn't quite as sweet as either the Clementine or a Jolly Rancher. That's not a bad thing just an observation. The Apple flavored variety is good as well not quite as sweet tasting as the Clementine to me and with just the right amount of fizz. It tastes like it is less carbonated than Martinelli's Apple juice and less sweet. Again, it's a nice alternate to sodas particularly if you are trying to ween kids from sodas (or yourself) but be aware there isn't anything diet about this if you are concerned about calories.<br /><br />The cans are relatively easy to recycle and small enough to carry in backpacks. There is approximately 90 calories in each container so it can be deceptive--it feels like you've only had a little but from a calorie perspective you need to be aware of how much you are really consuming. I'd recommend bringing a cup and pouring it over ice as it seemed to "stretch" out the container and we went through it a lot less quickly.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nicely flavored beverage with just the right amount of fizz and a tangy citrus taste and the apple is less sweet than most carbonated apple juices (a good thing to me). I'd give four stars to the Clementine and three stars to the Apple Flavor.

review/text: IZZE All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine is tasty. It has 80 calories and 20 carbs in a cute 8.4 oz (248 mL) can with a stylized Clementine on the front. It is not too sweet and contains no added sugar. The main ingredients in order are grape, apple, lemon, then orange juice. It is 70% juice and also has sparkling water. If the calorie/carb content is a little high for you, I think this would mix great with sparkling water. IZZE donates to Global Education Fund. It is a refreshing treat with 10% of the RCA for Vitamin C, B6, and Niacin.

review/summary: Good, but just a touch on the bitter side
review/text: First, I have to say that I really like drinking the sparking flavored sweetened zero calorie water drinks that I've only seen as store brands -- even though they don't have a "name", you know which ones I mean: Wal-Mart and most grocery stores have their own brand of the same thing.  Like flavored seltzer water, but diet-sweetened.<br /><br />Given that, you can probably tell that I was excited to try Izze.  It's sparkling juice, all natural, no sweeteners.  What's not to like?  Well it tastes like exactly that -- 30% seltzer water with 70% juice.  And it's good!  In the can, though, it tastes a little bit -- my wife called it "metallic" -- so I poured in a cup, but she said it didn't really help.  I think it's just missing the extra sweeteners -- either aspartame or HFCS -- that we all have gotten SO used to.  She gave it 3 stars.  The  college boy also gave it 3 stars, without elaboration.<br /><br />I expected that 8.4 ounce cans would be more of a "why bother" size, but they are a surprisingly good serving size for this kind of thing.  On the other hand, the "vitamin fortified" is 10% of C, B6, and Niacin.  That really is more of a "why bother".<br /><br />Personally, before those store brand "cherry water" (that's what we call them) drinks came out, I used to mix OJ and tonic water all the time.  I think Izze tastes a lot like that.  I like it, but I do think the clementine flavor (which I tried) is just a touch on the bitter side -- maybe that's what my wife called "metallic".  I would give it 4.5 stars.  Since they were at 3, I'll round down to 4 stars.

review/summary: Refreshing, natural and tasty, but not low calorie
review/text: The Clementine flavor of Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice is refreshing and not overly sweet like a lot of the orange flavored sodas. It has a tangy flavor that is reminiscent of the Clementines I love, but the taste is not as strong as the straight fruit or juice from the fruit.<br /><br />One 8.4oz can is just the right size to quench your thirst. The fact that it is naturally sweetened without a lot of artificial ingredients makes it a good drink for those looking for a healthier alternative to sodas. It does, however, have a fairly high amount of sugar so it is not a good alternative for dieters. In addition, the juice's flavor comes from a blend of juices, and it would be wise to check the contents if you have reactions to some fruits or take medication that you need to be cautious about food interactions with.

review/summary: Great Tasting!
review/text: This is a very good drink.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Sparkling Clementine.  It is funny when I tasted the drink I thought, yup, that tastes like a Clementine.  Then I looked at the back for the ingredients.  There are juices (from concentrate) from White Grape, Apple, Lemon and Orange Juice.  No Clementine.  Funny enough it really is a nice flavor.<br /><br />At just over 8 oz. a can this is not a drink to hydrate in quantity so much as a tasty pick me up.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />I do find it funny that we seem to be turning into a Red Bull world.  When did little 8 oz. cans of beverages become so cool?  I always thought more was good.  With that being said 8.4 oz's is just right for this drink.<br /><br />A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book

review/summary: Great Clementine, OK Apple
review/text: The Sparkling Clementine Flavor is my favorite of the three I tired with the Blackberry coming in close. They all have a similar mix of ingredients as the apple below. All have White Grape as the first ingredient listed and Lemon juice.<br /><br />The apple for my taste was only a 3 star drink, the above rating of 5 stars is for the Tangerine Flavor when these were all combined. An Average Apple Flavored Drink: This sparkling fruit juice has a slightly sweet-sour soda taste of fruit juice. It is like Lemon-Apple juice mixed with sparkling water and a touch of sugar. The first three ingredients listed White Grape, Apple and Lemon Juice that gives it its taste. I did not find this to have a refreshing apple taste. I do like that the cans are small, they contain only 8.4oz and 90 calorie sparkling the sparkling juice. But if I were to buy one it would not be the Sparkling Apple.<br /><br />Note: The three flavors combined would be a 4 star rating. Also I had a much longer review describing the Clementine, but when I saw the flavors split up into their own reviews I went to the apple and deleted the other flavors and save. It deleted the written review on all three drinks! So that is why this is now missing so much, I hope amazon can replace the original review.

review/text: I originally rated this product with only one star because I didn't like it at all when I drank it.  However, I have come back to revise my review after sharing it with other members of my family.  They absolutely loved it and were fighting not to drink all the cans at one sitting!  After one adult and three children (aged 9-15) said it tasted very good, I decided it was just me who didn't like the taste.  Unfortunately I can't seem to change the number of stars I gave it, but if I could, I would give it five because I was definitely over-ruled in my opinion of the flavor.  Don't go by what I say; go by what my family says. :-)

review/summary: Grape + Apple + Lemon + Orange =
review/text: I love all kinds of citrus soft drinks, from diet Mountain Dew to Lemonade to mixing OJ with diet sprite.  Which is kinda the taste of the clementine Izze -- think OJ cut with a little sparkling soda.<br /><br />The Good:  It ain't soda, with no corn 1-2-di-ethybol-whatever in the list of ingredients. The taste is still sweet.  Lower calories than just juice.  Healthful (small) serving size. Great to throw into a kids lunch bag.<br /><br />The Bad: The clementine does taste somewhat like processed canned concentrated OJ, and that is not a good thing for most adults.  The taste falls short of (my self-declared gold standard) Orangina. I prefer tarter or fresher lemon/lime notes in a fizzy citrus drink, but your mileage may vary here.<br /><br />The Ugly: Are there really any clementine's in this drink?  In order of amount used, the juices listed are white grape, then apple, then lemon, then orange.  So it's a real mix, one that comes out quite bland tinned OJ tasting for all the variety.  There are also other ingredients like gum arabic and sodium citrate.<br /><br />So five stars for kids, but for me I'll mix fresh OJ with diet sprite or some other sparkling water.

review/summary: Wonderful Orange Taste!!
review/text: Izze Clementine gives you that sweet, delicious orange taste without all the high fructose corn syrup or added nasties in all the sodas you will find on the supermarket shelves.  Being an addicted soda drinker my whole life looking for alternatives (I wish I always drank water but that's another story in itself) to have liquid with taste, I loved the idea of an all natural alternative.  Izze only uses natural ingredients, mixes them up, carbonates it, and the result is a much cleaner, healthier, and tastier drink that is simply the bomb.<br /><br />I love all the flavors of Izze and Clementine is no exception.  If you like orange soda or orange juice you HAVE to give this a try as it will definitely make you a believer that you can have a natural soda that is actually pretty good for you!!<br /><br />Drink up!!<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

review/summary: Absolutely Delicious!
review/text: IZZE is soooooo good!<br /><br />It's a delicious beverage, with subtle genuine fruit flavor, just enough natural sweetness, and moderate carbonation.  Sipped from the can, or poured over ice, it's very refreshing, and not at all cloying.<br /><br />On the afternoon that my order of IZZE arrived from Amazon, a 16-year old family friend stopped by.  I offered him a can, and he said, "I've had it before, and it's great!"<br /><br />I'd quite happily serve this at summer parties as an alternative to traditional sodas, wine, or even lemonade.  Since it doesn't contain refined sugars, stimulants such as caffeine, or artificial sweeteners, it should appeal to my guests who are avoiding those ingredients.<br /><br />ETA: I've since tried the Sparkling Blackberry, and it is even more delicious, and a gorgeous rosy shade that looks beautiful in a glass of ice.

review/summary: Wonderful alternative to soda pop
review/text: This is a wonderful alternative to soda pop.  It's carbonated for those like me that just enjoy fizzy drinks way too much for their own good, yet it also contains 70 percent total juice.  I'm not going to say it should be a substitute to drinking normal fruit juice, but if again you're like me, and both are almost addicted to fizzy drinks and can't stand the taste of any artificial sweetner to even try to gag down a "diet" soda, then this is very much the way to go.  I also do suggest this flavor, most or all of the Izze line uses some of the flavor of juice listed on the can, but also some grape and/or apple juice as a "filler".  They do the same here, but it tastes first like clementine or at least orange juice, and then a hint of the others come through.  I've found with most other flavors of Izze it will taste more like the "filler" first, and then the flavor listed on the can or bottle.<br /><br />Price may seem high, but compared to what a 4 pack costs here it's actually not horrid considering.  And if one has an amazon prime account, then shipping costs aren't a major issue.

review/summary: Who loves orange spritzer? I Do..I Do.I DO I DO I DO!
review/text: Orange spritzer definitely takes me back to my childhood, going to the local expensive healthy food store ran by some pretty hip hipsters.Something about bubbly orange juice just makes me smile and fills my liver with nostalgia.<br /><br />I was fortunate to buy a 24 case of IZZE fortified sparkling juice for about $19, with an amazon coupon that took an additional 10% off after the S&S took 15% off. Couldn't walk away from that much saving.<br /><br />After receiving the heavy amazon box in the mail i decided to pop a can of Izze, and boy it takes me back. This is really a refreshing drink, this comes from a reformed soda junkie who now drinks seltzer water in his days of purity.The can is really small and compact, i can see mom's throwing these into their kids lunch or even calorie cutters sipping a can during break or with dinner.<br /><br />Everything about this drink is pretty amazing except for one thing, it's 8.4 oz. I like to take pretty big gulps when i drink so one can is consumed in about 3 gulps. Good for quenching thirst but to get through a savory meal i would need to drink about 2 of these, which isn't that bad. I feel it's just a hassle cracking open a can in the middle of dinner.<br /><br />All in all, definitely would be good for someone who wants to cut back from soda but maintain that fizz that izze is. Also it's a good treat for people trying to lose weight or kids as a alternative to soda.

review/text: I should have noticed the size of the cans when I was ordering, but I was assuming they were at least 12 oz. So I was a surprised by the small amount you get in each can. I should have been more careful. Other than my carelessness, I'm happy with this product. But I wish I could find this in a larger per unit size.

review/summary: No sugar, love it !
review/text: Orange IZZE is quite good.  It is much less sweet than regular carbonated orange drinks, but very, very refreshing.  I am a dedicated daily water drinker, but an occasional Orange IZZE is very satisfying and I feel good after drinking it b/c there is no added sugar.  I recommend it.  I will continue to buy it from Amazon.

review/summary: Great Citrus Taste & Very Refreshing!
review/text: IZZE has seemed to find the balance between healthy fruit taste and the sensation of carbonated soft drinks with their sparkling juice line.  I haven't had a soft drink in over a year since discovering these wonderfully refreshing, healthy alternatives to carbonated soft drinks.  Since it's pure fruit juice, it's also naturally weet (but not too sweet) so it also satisfies that "sweet tooth" as well.  Although not a substitute for plain ol' H2O, this beverage definitely satisfies and quenches my thirst.  Can't get enough of these beverages.......

review/summary: Tastes great! Try pairing it with food!
review/text: The first time I tasted Izze was at a local restaurant who offered a tasting menu of 9 courses. There was an option to pair each course with wine, but I'm not a big wine drinker, so I declined. To my surprise, our server offered a "soda pairing" with dinner, and several of the drinks we were served were Izze. They were great! We were served Apple Izze to start off with our appetizer and salad, followed by several other types of sodas - primarily DRY soda and Gus soda. The other Izze I got to try there was the Pomegranate with our steak course. After tasting them at the restaurant, I sought out more flavors to try and was pleasantly surprised with all of them. My favorite by far is this Clementine one. Not too sweet, not too tart - tastes really refreshing.<br /><br />I know everyone's tastes are different, but just in case anyone needs some suggestions on which flavors to try, I would have to rank them in this order: Clementine, Apple, Grapefruit, Blackberry, Pomegranate, Blueberry.

review/summary: Izze is great!
review/text: Dear Amazonians,<br /><br />I first was introduced to Izze during a fundraiser for HIV/AIDS research in New York City.  I loved it!  The drink was so new at the time, that I was unable to find it at my local stores.  After some time, Starbucks started carrying this, and I bought it quite often.  After yet some more time, I noticed that Amazon.com was carrying it.  YAY!  Now I can use subscribe & save, and buy lots of Izze, a healthful and tasty drink that I enjoy very much.  There is no added sugar or artificial preservatives here, only filtered sparkling water and 100% fruit juice.  A fantastic find.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!<br /><br />--Daniel

review/summary: Not as good as I expected
review/text: Please not that this review is for the Clementine Flavor.<br /><br />I really like orange sodas, so when I had the chance to try the Izzy Sparkling Juice with Clementine flavor I did not hesitate. Sadly, even though the product is flavored by natural juice, it reminded me of Redoxon when I drank it. I could not get out of my mind the feeling that it was powered mixed with water.<br /><br />The flavor was not bad, and the level of gasification was adequate, but I did expect a much better experience from this "high end" soda-type product. Maybe this just happens with this flavor, so I will probably try the pomegranate version in the near future to confirm or revert my opinion.

review/summary: Like a Refreshing Mimosa Without the Alcohol
review/text: I remember those refreshing Mimosa's I used to have during Sunday brunches in cafes on the upper west side of Manhattan. The IZZE Sparkling Clementine flavor drink reminds me of those Mimosas, but without the accompanying lightheadedness of the champagne. Sparking water substitutes for the alcohol in this drink, and it is truly a satisfying and thirst quenching beverage on a hot summer afternoon or any time of the year, for that matter.<br /><br />The IZZE Sparkling Clemntine flavor is a combination of orange, white grape, apple and lemon juices combined with seltzer. If you have never tasted a Mimosa, the spakling water might fool you into thinking that you are drinking some brand of soft drink, but this is an all natural beverage with only 20g of carbs, and is fortified with Vitamin C and two B vitamins.<br /><br />Close your eyes, and take a sip. You will, indeed, believe you are drinking some high priced Mimosa at an expensive cafe. When you open them again, the realization will come to you that you have, instead, enjoyed a healthy, refreshing juice drink that actually comes from a can. Savor it!

review/summary: Great product, not too sweet.
review/text: Not too long ago in a company lunch, several of us were comparing a "fruit" drink being consumed by a health-conscious colleague and the Coke that the rest of us were drinking.  The "fruit" drink had almost no juice, had more calories, had more toxic preservatives, and had more tri-glycerides in the form of corn syrup.  Coke was actually healthier!<br /><br />So I received this product with some trepidation and was pleasantly surprised.  Not only was it what it claimed to be (a carbonated fruit beverage with some vitamins but no sweeteners or corn syrup), it actually tasted good.  The carbonation was not too heavy, there was no caffeine or pseudo-caffeine (guarana, ma huang and the like), it wasn't too sweet and was light and refreshing.  I opened up the case I got and the staff enjoyed it immensely.  An overall excellent product.  I haven't tried the other flavors.  The only down-side would be that the "Clementine" flavor came from mixed citrus juices other than clementines.

review/summary: Great flavor, no after taste
review/text: This a good drink. It is not heavily carbonated so you don't get a strong aftertaste. While it only has 90 calories, I wouldn't call it a healthy drink per se primarily because of the 10% vitamin content. It is neither an energy drink and is not comparable to Monster or Red Bull.<br /><br />It is a good alternative to soda and stands on its own in that merit.

review/summary: My Family is Addicted
review/text: Okay, I didn't know what I was getting into when I picked Izze soda to review. My whole family has gone crazy for it.  My first grader will pretty much do anything for a can, even clean his room or do the dishes. Which is great because it is a pretty much guilt-free product, since it is just natural fruit juice with sparkling water.  After apple juice was implicated in some childhood obesity, my wife has always limited our children's juice intake and waters it down with about 50% water.  Izzes come pre-watered down with the sparkling water without loss of flavor.  Also, the cans are 8 ounce servings which are more friendly serving sizes than sodas.  It is great having a treat that you can feel good about.<br /><br />Initially we got Clementine and it was an immediate hit.  All the flavors taste more like the actual fruits then their juices.  Clementine has an aftertaste that tastes more like eating a fresh orange than it does drinking orange juice. We quickly picked up Blackberry and Apple.  The apple especially tastes like the fruit. It really tastes more like biting into an apple rather than the syrupy heavy flavor of apple juice. They just taste crisp.<br /><br />Now we have gone through several cases of the stuff and I foresee an Izze summer. You should see our six-year-old son go around to house guests taking their Izze orders then carefully bringing in a tray full of iced Izze's for everyone. He loves to share his newly discovered joy with everyone. It's been a great discovery and my family is hooked.

review/summary: Clementine: Better than most sugary orange sodas, but still a little bit of a gimmick
review/text: For some reason there are two kinds of each Izze flavor - regular and fortified.  Why they did this makes no sense to me.  This is the fortified version which means it has small amounts of a handful of vitamins.<br /><br />Izze Clementine is thankfully less sweet than most other orange sodas. (That doesn't mean it has less sugar, however.) Compared to Fanta and Sunkist it tastes lighter and fresher.  I'd compare it somewhat Orangina in terms of flavor - but not consistency as Orangina has pulp in it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say Izze Clementine is one of the best orange sodas I've tasted.  At the other extreme you can still find orange creme style sodas on the market which are also great, but those are definitely sweeter and might not quench your thirst.<br /><br />I call the Izze approach a bit gimmicky because the 8oz. cans are a bit ridiculous and I don't know what gives on the fortified vitamins combined with a soda that says it's from "real juice."  Real juice has vitamin C in it - but they had to add it because, apparently, there's somehow no C in the juice they're using.  So I take the whole "real juice" thing with a grain of salt.  Sort of like the juice companies who say "no sugar added" when all they've done is fudged the terms by using sugar from grape juice instead of corn or cane sugar.  Still, it's a good tasting soda - just don't think of it as health food.  And you will likely find the serving size inconvenient.<br /><br />Besides here you can find Fortified Izze at Target.

review/summary: Very refreshing sparklers
review/text: The Clementine (orange) flavor of Izze is my favorite among the three I have tried, the other two being apple and grapefruit. This is a very crisp, refreshing beverage that has just the right balance of fruit to carbonation, and a slight tartness that keeps it from being cloying or flabby. Some reviewers have commented and even complained about this sparkling juice having only the barest amount of carbonation.  Not so with the ones I have tried, so perhaps these other reviewers left the top open and allowed it to go flat or something. Believe me, this had lively carbonation, and a good, natural tasting tart orange flavor.  The size of the can is convenient, too - takes up hardly any space in the fridge or in the lunch sack.<br /><br />As part of the "Vine" program, I received and tasted three different flavors but Amazon will not allow me to publish a separate review of each flavor.  So I am combining them all into one.<br /><br />Apple flavor: like biting into a crisp, green apple and savoring the peel and the fruit/meat at the same time. It has nice, clean and refreshing flavors with an excellent balance of carbonation. Normally I am not a fan of apple juice or sparkling cider but this one I liked.  It is not cloying or flabby-tasting as I find most apple beverages to be, probably because this is green and not red apple-flavored.<br /><br />Grapefruit flavor: this was my least favorite of the bunch, but if you prefer a very tart flavor, this fits the bill nicely. Again, a good balance of carbonation, crisp, and refreshing, this had good pink grapefruit taste but I also detected a plastic-tasting element.  The aftertaste was pure grapefruit so I don't know where that plastic came from or where it went, but it did mar an otherwise nice drinking experience.<br /><br />Overall I rate these Izze beverages very high.  They taste good, they are refreshing, and come in convenient-sized cans that easily fit in the fridge or a lunch sack or back pack. Good products!

review/summary: Izze Clementine Sparking Juice, Grapefruit Sparkling Juice
review/text: In a "Supersize Me" world Izze should be applauded for bucking the trend and marketing an 8 oz. drink product, which is a much more sensible size than the quart size or larger products crowding the shelves. I gave a can of this drink to a friend of mine who commented that they enjoyed the sparkling water mixed with the juice. On the other hand, I prefer a sweeter orange juice. This, to me, had a dull taste that reminded me of eating a frost burned orange.<br /><br />I thought the grapefruit juice was very tasty. It is on the sweet side and reminded most of Ruby Red grapefruit. I think if I was at home mixing this juice from concentrate instead of buying the concentrate premixed in a can, I would use less water.

review/summary: Nice, light, and full of flavor
review/text: My wife and I have been very pleased with both the clementine and pomegranate flavors of he Izze sparkling soda. The drinks are refreshing, but with a natural flavor - unlike many of the sports drinks.<br /><br />Other tidbits of information-<br /><br />- Each can has 80 calories- which is very similar to a can of soda of the same size.<br /><br />- While the "clementine" and the "pomegranate" flavors only contain real fruit juice- it may not be the juices you have in mind. Both are sweetened by a combination of grape and apple juices. The grape and pomegranate juice comes a little further down on the list.<br /><br />- While each drink contains vitamins - I wouldn't count on them as being a significant source of anything.<br /><br />Final score- we really enjoy the taste and serving size. In fact, Izze makes a great ice cold drink for a warm summer day!

review/text: Initially was surprised by the slightly tart taste but quickly adjusted. I guess I was expecting it to be sweeter.  The clementine flavor is strong.  The fact that it does not contain high fructose corn syrup is a wonderful bonus.<br />The cost per can is about one dollar for 8.4 ounces which may not fit into many peoples budget; but, for a healthy alternative to soda it is worth considering.  A wonderful guilt free drink.  Recommend serving chilled.

review/text: I tried the Clementine flavor, which is white grapefruit and comes in an orange can.  The drink tasted a lot like orange juice at first, but had the aftertaste of grapefruit, which was not very enjoyable. I liked the natural ingredients, but could never finish an entire can of this stuff just because it was too sweet and just didn't taste very good.<br /><br />Also, Amazon shipped a case of this in a big box, with only about 4 of those little plastic bubbles for padding.  Several of the drinks had exploded and the whole thing was a sticky mess.  I didn't factor that into my rating for the product however.

review/summary: A better option than soda
review/text: Received a full case of Izze Clementine for review.  Very generous, Izze!  When I reviewed the Gatorade Protein Shakes they broke up the original 6-packs to send reviewers individual cans . . . but I digress.<br /><br />This was a good product.  Not overly sweet, and only lightly carbonated, with no added sweetener and 70% mixed juices from concentrate.  The vitamin fortification is negligible at a mere 10%.  Was concerned at first about the addition of "glycerol ester of rosin" but after some quick research discovered that this necessary ingredient is a healthful alternative to the carcinogenic brominated oil used in inferior products (like Gatorade, Mountain Dew, and generic fruit sodas).<br /><br />The Clementine beverage had a pleasant flavour with no aftertaste or coating.  Comes in an 8 oz size, which is perfect for a quick refreshment without the worry of spillage or waste.  The can is better than a bottle for packing in lunches -- especially for backpacking, or if you're giving it to kids.<br /><br />This was a good quality product, and I recommend it.

review/summary: Excellent substitute for regular orange soda!
review/text: My husband, who is not too fond of orange soda in general, tried the Clementine soda with me. I liked it right away, but he had to drink almost a whole can before he said it started to grow on him. He put a little soy milk in it and said that tasted really good, like an Orange Julius.<br /><br />I was glad to see so many natural ingredients - no artificial colours or flavours - although I can't seem to find out exactly what the "ester of rosin" is. That concerns me a tad. I was also glad to find that "sugar-free" did NOT mean that it had aspartame or saccharin in it.<br /><br />I did find it very comparable to Hansen's sodas, which I also really enjoy. I sampled some of the Izze chilled as well as at room temperature. It is good both ways, but has MUCH less of the acidic, generic orange soda taste when at room temperature.<br /><br />We did find it had a very strong grapefruity flavour, which we think might come from the white grape juice that heads the list of fruit juices (orange is the fourth - !)<br /><br />I enjoyed it and would recommend people to try it, although I'm not really planning to make a habit of buying it all the time either.

review/summary: Da Izze Code Decoded: Pomegranate=Apple, Apple= White Grape, ...
review/text: First there were two cases of IZZE: one each of Apple and Pomegranate.  I quickly cleaned out half of my refrigerator to make room for the 48 cans of IZZE.  Then a case of IZZE Clementine arrived. Finally, I received the sought-after Blackberry. The IZZEs were multiplying out of control.  The two new ones took up the rest of my refrigerator. There was no room for anything but IZZE. At my house, it has become all IZZE all the time.<br /><br />To the credit of IZZE, the ingredients of all their products are posted on the IZZE web site. The IZZEs have all natural ingredients, although the labeling indicates that the citrus varieties. e.g. Clementine and Grapefruit, contain Gum Arabic and Ester Gum. According to sources on the web, Gum Arabic is a purified natural vegetable gum obtained from the acacia tree that is used as a stabilizer/emulsifier.  Ester Gum is purified natural rosin from pine trees.  I suppose trees are natural.<br /><br />An interesting fact about the IZZEs is that for every type of IZZE, the fruit named on the front of the can does not correspond to the first-listed ingredient. Here is the IZZE code decoded: for Apple the main ingredient is White Grape, for Pomegranate it is Apple, for Clementine it is White Grape, for Grapefruit it is White Grape and for Blackberry it is White Grape.<br /><br />There is no caffeine in IZZE. The IZZE web site says that IZZE employees ride bikes to the local coffee shop. So you cannot live on IZZE alone! All of the IZZEs are fortified with vitamins, e.g., Vitamin B6, C, and Niacin. I am sure that the IZZE people anticipated the need for vitamins for people surviving on a diet consisting of IZZE and coffee.<br /><br />All of the IZZE flavors have their own character.  Some are weaker, others stronger.  In order of weak to strong for the four that I tried, I would arrange them as Apple, Clementine, Blackberry, and Pomegranate.  I prefer the more subtle flavors of Apple and Clementine. However, when I brought an assortment to a gathering of friends, all of the Pomegranate cans disappeared while the Apples remained untouched.  It is a matter of personal taste. People who are used to soda, which includes most people,  prefer the stronger Blackberry and Pomegranate. Juice people may like Apple or Clementine better. I give the Clementine 5 stars, the others 4 stars. All of the flavors are good. Which one you prefer is up to you.
