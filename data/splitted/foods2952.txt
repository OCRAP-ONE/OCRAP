review/summary: Great alternative
review/text: So me and my husband are on this health food kick, and we're finding out how bad aspartame (among other things) is for you. Unfortunately, I love gum, just to have something help keep my mouth moist through the day.<br /><br />I've been chewing Eclipse gum, mostly because it lasts a long time and freshens my breath. The bad thing is that most, if not all, gums have aspartame in them, even the normal "sugar" ones!<br /><br />I thought switching to an all natural gum would be hard, but I've been very surprised and happy with the Spry gum. It's actually very close in taste, texture, and longevity to the Eclipse gum, except that it's natural and not bad for you. I couldn't be happier, and I'd highly recommend trying this if you are looking for a great alternative to the chemically-laced gum found at your local super market.

review/summary: Flavor gone in one minute.
review/text: Spry Peppermint appears to be a healthy alternative to other chewing gums.  Peppermint oil is used in the manufacture of this product; raw materials come from China and the USA.  Each chiclet is small.  Two pieces might be considered one serving.<br /><br />I like the peppermint taste, which lasts for one minute -- yes, one minute as timed by my stopwatch.  After that minute most of the taste is gone.  It seems like much of any benefit the gum might provide will be lost if it is thrown away by minute two of chewing.  Recommended with noted reservations.

review/summary: Great at first, now below average
review/text: Started buying this about two years ago if not earlier. Really liked it even though the flavor was gone fast. With the most recent batch that I bought the flavor is gone even faster than before, and I couldn't help but noticing that they are partially sourced from China now. Enough reason for me stop buying them. Switching to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A40M1M">Orahealth Xylimelts Mints, 80-Count Boxes</a> instead. No gum, but at least much better and higher Xylitol content. The Spry gum has very little Xylitol anyway. If I don't like the melts I'll have to search for something else, but the Spry gum from China isn't cutting it at this price and quality level.

review/summary: Loses flavor too fast
review/text: I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Of the five, peppermint is my least favorite. It loses its flavor within two minutes. That's not an exaggeration - you get literally two minutes of chewing pleasure. After that, the gum starts to turn strangely bitter.<br /><br />On the bright side, the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. At least I can chew this without having intestinal problems, which makes it worth two stars despite the lack of flavor.

I much prefer stick gum, so the search continues for something that more closely resembles stick without the aspartame.

review/text: I usually chew Orbit Peppermint gum.  I needed something for Free Super Saver Shipping filler.  I thought this might be a good value and have heard about the dental benefits of Xylitol.<br /><br />I received the gum yesterday and I am very disappointed that the taste disappears within a minute.  I know Trident has a decent peppermint gum with Xylitol and the taste doesn't disappear fast.  If you want a peppermint gum with Xylitol, I suggest you try Trident's version.  Xylitol isn't something I require in a chewing gum and I prefer Orbit's peppermint taste.  I do chew Trident's version sometimes though and it is pretty good.

review/summary: Worry free, solid gum
review/text: I purchased spry gum while pregnant as Ive always been a big gum chewer, but have always been leery of aspartame. Now that I'm pregnant, not only am I more aware of what goes in my body, but psychological or not, I was gagging on name brand gums. So I googled aspartame free gums and came across spry gum. I was hesitant as previous aspartame free/natural gums purchased at Whole Foods had dissolved in my mouth- not a pleasant experience, nor worth the extra money for such a short chew time. Somehow, the makers of Spry figured out how to make a gum aspartame free and have it hold together for hours at a time. The pieces are small- and I'm too stingy to chew 2 at a time given the extra cost- but they literally last at least 4-5 hours at a time- I've never tried for longer/don't know exactly how long they could last. They're not good for blowing bubbles though, if that's an issue =) Overall, I highly recommend this gum and will be buying more of it when the original batch runs out.

Yes the intense peppermint rush seems to go away fast, but two hours later when I was kissed by someone, they grinned and said, "ooo, peppermint!". I was still chewing the same piece (I'm absentminded that way). I thought it had no flavor left, but I guess I was wrong.<br /><br />One time I chewed a piece for over 6 hours (absentminded, remember) before I spit it out. Other gums would have disintegrated by then, but this was still intact and 'springy'.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors. (I'm still working on that same 'jar')

review/summary: Great gum.
review/text: It's the Xylitol stupid.  No brainer gum! - chew great tasting gum that naturally helps to reduce cavities without any synthetic sweetener.  This is the most economical way to purchase this gum.  You will find that it dissolves and reduces in size pretty fast (much more than other gum). Therefore, like me, you will probably chew 3-4 pieces at a time. The sweet taste of the Xylitol does fade away within about 10 minutes, so your not going to chew this for an hour.  If your looking for a hunk of gum to chomp on for hours, this is not it.  If your looking for an all natural non-toxic great tasting gum to chew after meals to reduce plaque and help reduce the chance of cavities, this gum is a no-brainer.

review/summary: And it's a wonderful gum for seniors, too!
review/text: My wife and I, both seniors, love this gum. We are now on our third 100-piece container. When my wife's dental hygienist recommended she use a product containing Xylitol to remedy dry-mouth syndrome caused by some of her medications, my wife decided that a gum with Xylitol would serve her best. I researched products on the Web and found Spry at a good price on Amazon.<br /><br />My wife[s dental hygienist was right: it was a perfect solution for her dry-mouth problem. As a bonus benefit, my research revealed that Xylitol was also broadly supportive of good dental health.<br /><br />Although I had not chewed gum for many years after I lost some tooth fillings due to the adhesiveness of many gums when I was a much younger man, I gave Spry a try and liked it -- it did not stick to my fillings.<br /><br />Of course, with Xylitol being a sugar-substitute, we don't have to worry about the possibility of promoting dental decay. We both like the peppermint flavor and have bought that exclusively. We find that one piece of Spry is insufficient for a pleasant chewing experience, so I use three pieces at a time and my wife uses two<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00124VQ06">Xlear - Spry Gum Peppermint, 100 gum</a>.

review/summary: better in bulk
review/text: My naturopath just suggested I try this, and while I was hesitant to buy gum in bulk like this (I'm not normally a gum chewer), it's worked out very well economically. It tastes good, just like a regular gum, and I'm sure it used to just be sold by the checkout stand in packs but I haven't seen it for a long time. It's supposed to actually be good for getting rid of bacteria in your mouth and believe it or not, your sinus' as well. I remain doubtful, but it's worth a try and a pleasant fix. Due to the recommendation I received from someone who really seems to know what they are talking about, I would in turn recommend this for anyone who chews gum, or for anyone with breath or sinus problems. it won't hurt, and it might even help.

Some studies indicate the Xylitol may have dental health benefits. Other gums with Xylitol, such as Trident, also contain other sweeteners such as aspartame. This is sweetened with only Xylitol and so has more Xylitol in it.<br /><br />However, the sweeteners don't last nearly as long as Trident and the gum is stiffer to chew. Also, the pieces are small so I usually end up chewing two pieces at once. When I chew Trident, I chew one piece or even half a piece. Also it is significantly more expensive per ounce than Trident.<br /><br />It has been a nice to try and it is not an unpleasant gum, but I will go back to Trident. For me, the additional Xyitol content doesn't justify the lower quality and higher cost.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, let me know with your vote.

review/summary: Move over Figis
review/text: For the last 15+ years, Figis.com has provided our family with what I've always thought was the best summer sausage available today.<br /><br />This Christmas, I was given a 20 ounce package of Old Wisconsin Original Summer Garlic Sausage. Without even opening it, I already made up my mind that if it's not a Figis product, it won't measure up.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong! I can't believe the quality of this summer sausage. The taste is one that cannot be described, you'll just have to try it yourself.<br /><br />Off to order more...

review/summary: Really wanted to like this, but sadly disappointed.
review/text: I have a regular monthly subscription to another brand of summer sausage available on Amazon. It's very popular with friends and family for snacking, and when the regular brand wasn't available, I purchased this one for a temporary replacement. I read through the reviews and felt this would do the trick until the regular stuff was available again.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only thing the two seem to have in common is general shape and color. While the flavor isn't unpleasant, the texture leaves a lot to be desired. It's both fibrous and greasy, with globs/pockets of fat and strings of what I can only imagine to be muscle or gristle of some kind. They're like white threads, and the mouthfeel of the sliced product is very unappetizing.<br /><br />In reading through the reviews again, I saw one where the reviewer mentioned this summer sausage had potential when heated/cooked, so I sliced it thinly and tried both panfrying and microwaving it. This does improve the texture and allows the extra fat to render out (if you're microwaving, be sure to sit the pieces on top of paper towels, and don't let it go too long without checking ... LOTS of fat drains out of the meat!). After it's been heated/cooked, the product can be enjoyed for its flavor without the unpleasant texture.<br /><br />If our regular choice becomes unavailable again at some point, we'll just do without or look for something in a local grocery store. We won't be purchasing this product again.

review/text: For summer sausage that doesn't have to be refridgerated, this is a good choice. The rolls tend to be a little on the fatty side and the salt content is hard to miss, but the overall flavor is good and in a sandwhich or paired with cheese or crackers, it makes a good snack or meal.

review/text: This summer sausage was not that great.  Had a very "tangy" taste, with very little other flavor.  If it were not for the price, this would have been returned.  My dog enjoys it.<br />For real summer sausage I'll stick with the small, specialty companies.  Try Woody's Smokehouse or try the venison summer sausage from the Vermont Country Store.  Heck, even Hickory Farms is better.

review/text: I bought several of these as Christmas gifts.  They were outstanding in taste and leaness of the product.  Sometimes summer sausage can leave a very oily residue on your tongue as you eat it.  This product does not do that and is one of the best I have ever eaten.  They easily excel over Hickory Farms Beef stick which is a good product in my estimation.

I personally like the beef version of old wisconsin summer sausage because i think it taste better than the others when broiled.  The original flavor is also good, and i would say that one is the best if you're just going to slice and eat with no broiling.  I havent tried the Garlic one yet but im sure i would love it as well.  This summer sausage easily gets 5 stars from me.

Just a small piece is good for a snack but it really stands out when cut up into little pieces and sauteed with some onions and boiled cauliflower. That way you get a very tasty, high protein, low carb meal which will sustain you for a long time. We ordered this for our camping trip but ate all of the 3 sausages already ha..ha...so good, now I need to place another order.

review/summary: Better than Hickory Farms
review/text: I ordered my Beef Summer Sausage from Old Wisconsin because my previously favorite Hickory Farms website only sold their stuff in packages and charged $9.99 for shipping making my order of two small sausages come to $30!  I had previously ordered the pickled eggs from Old Wisconsin and I knew their products were of the highest quality; so I tried their sausage and now I like it even better than Hickory Farms version.  The most important thing to note was that it has the same flavor and taste as what I was used to at Hickory Farms but it tasted fresher and better.  I'm not into new flavors and changing the basics of this sausage and I was actually surprised that I liked it better. I've tried many other brands and just threw them away after the first bite.  To top is off, they sent me three 1 lb packages for $20 and on Amazon the shipping was free.  So I ended up with one extra beef sausage for $10 less and it tastes even better (although the same in many ways).

review/summary: Very Fatty With Bone Chips
review/text: The flavoring in this was just not very good but tolerable. I ordered the 3 pack from Amazon so we had three to get through. We were really put off that it seemed like each slice we had was half fat. We ended up cooking it off before we ate it. There just is no excuse for it to be so full of grease. Also we were very turned off in the fact that we would occasionally hit a bone chip and one got stuck between two of my teeth and I thought there was a dental trip in my future but I was able to work it out.<br />We gave up on it and I would say they are careless in what they grind in the sausage. I really wanted to like this sausage but just couldn't get around all the issues with it. We will be going back to our old brand which is a little more expensive but I guess with sausage you get what you pay for.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: My daughter started on Sprout at 5.5 months and she has loved all Stage 1 foods, especially the peas and bananas. I recently ran out of peas and gave her some organic Gerber peas while waiting to get more Sprout vegetables in the mail. She refused to eat them-literally gagged and fussed. I switched to a Sprout fruit, and she couldn't get it down fast enough. So...there is a taste difference.<br /><br />I ordered cases of all and the expiration dates ranged from 1 year to 1 month from date I received them which was quite annoying. Hoping for a decent shelf life with my entire next order as I have a hard time finding a variety of flavors in our local grocery stores. I also love that I am introducing her to high quality, organic ingredients with no DHA added. Engineered supplemental DHA is not organic and doesn't seem like a healthy choice when looking at how it is made.<br /><br />Packaging tip: If your baby eats a whole package-cut the corner off the top and squeeze it out that way-no resealable lip to go over.

With it being a resealable pouch I am able to split the pouch into two portions and store the second portion in the fridge; or when making food for daycare in the mornings I can mix the rice cereal with the baby food right in the pouch and then pour it into her two food containers for the day.  The sweet potato and white bean, and the roasted pears are also exceptional products that she loves.

review/text: I'm not much of a water drinker, although I certainly know the necessity. I needed to find something to drink that was palatable--regular water from the tap in a glass makes me choke. HINT is perfect:I tried a few of the flavors, and I must say that MANGO-RED GRAPEFRUIT is one of the 3 I have ordered from Amazon to be delivered monthly.<br />I get my water down! And no sugar! And I notice a difference! And the flavor of this beverage leaves a nice feeling in my nose and mouth!

review/text: I love hint water. I was glad to discover this flavor but due to medications I am on cannot drink it. All the flavors are great. I am very limited to what I can drink due to it destroying the enamel on my teeth so this works out great for me. Just the right amount of flavor.

review/summary: Hint Grapefruit-Mango water
review/text: It's a good idea, water with flavor but no sugar or artificial flavors.  But I didn't like this water at all.  It's too sweet for my taste and the water itself did not have a "clean" taste.  (I actually thought I tasted chlorine.) I was hoping for something like the now discontinued "Ice" Water, but this didn't do it for me, in spite of the premium price.  I personally would not recommend this product.  If you're looking for a nice refreshing flavored unsweetened water, try MetroMint.

review/summary: Made my stomach hurt.
review/text: I noted as soon as I bought this water that it is "purified", which means it can come from Slug-a-Bug Lake and still become potable.  I can drink most of the varieties, which I do without any illusions of virgin water; but the grapefruit/mango upsets my stomach.  My daughter has had the same reaction to the watermelon flavor.  I'll try other flavors, because I like the idea; but I wonder what is the difference between Premium and other Hint waters?

review/summary: Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. It is rather weak, but a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little weak and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful for me, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker or less annoying.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Flavored Commercial Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry--Lovely!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, and that's great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

Stash Earl Grey started me into experiencing tea beyond iced and typical restaurant fare. Today I have 20 varieties of teas, both in bags and loose and Stash Earl Grey is still one of my favorites to this day. (The flavor for Stash Earl Grey loose tea is different from the bagged. The bagged is better IMO.)<br /><br />Some other flavors and brands you might like if you like Stash Earl Grey.<br /><br />Stash Vanilla Nut Decaf. A perfect desert or night time tea.

It's perfect as an after-lunch pick-me-up and as simple as boiling water, just the right amount of caffeine.  The teabags are foil-sealed, so they stay fresh a long time.  I buy in quantity to save money.  Can't go wrong with this choice.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: The best of the energy chews!
review/text: I'm a runner doing 30-50 miles a week and am currently (9/10) training for the Chicago Marathon.  I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite.  I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex.  Plus you always need water with them.  I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think); Sharkies (good but sticky and not very tasty), Clif Shot Bloks (nice package, very sticky on the fingers), GU Chomps (super sticky and caused some nausea), PowerBar Gel Blasts (very good but tough to chew if cold).  The Honey Stinger chews are very easy to chew and you don't need water.  They don't stick to your teeth either.  The main selling point for me is that they taste good and don't cause nausea no matter what.  I'm sticking with these ones.

Like a lot of folks, I hadn't<br />heard of these before Backpacker Magazine<br />raved about them in April of '09.<br />I gave 'em a try and was blown away.<br /><br />Over the years I've found that I find food<br />--on long hikes--less and less appetizing...<br />especially when the temperature is over 90.<br />The thought of chewing and swallowing is<br />not appealing.<br /><br />Obviously SOME nourishment is still necessary,<br />but I came to dread PowerBars, and then next, the<br />tastier bars they spawned. So I switched to gels,<br />but after awhile, I came to dread those, as well.<br />But these little chews are delicious--I'll eat them<br />even when nothing else sounds good.<br />Between hikes, I keep them out of sight, because<br />otherwise I'd snack on them at home.<br />I'm on here now ordering another dozen for a big hike.

Kinda like gum drops and there's lots of them in a bag so you dont feel like you got cheated.  I think I like these more than any other sports chews I have tried.  They also dont leave your fingers sticky after handling them.  I hope they come out with new flavors.

I really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough (organic tapioca, cane sugar, fruit juice, etc.).<br /><br />However, I don't see how they're any different from organic fruit snacks (like Annie's bunnies), which I can get much cheaper in a multi-pack from my local wholesale club.

review/summary: Good substitute for candy but Sharkies are healthier
review/text: These are a good alternative to candy, but still a lot of sugar in a better form.<br />Sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet BUT are Healthier becasue the man ingredient is brown rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index. Being very hypogylcemic brown rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that don't cause a "sugar crash". So for this reason the stingers only get 3 stars and sharkies get 5! If you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version, but they are like stingers- no brown rice syrup. Oh, the brown rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and don't cause blood sugar fluctuations.
