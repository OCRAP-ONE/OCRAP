review/summary: Only the finest cinnamon
review/text: I love fine cinnamon, and have no patience with second best.  John M.  Macy's Java Cinnamon sticks more than meet my exacting standards!<br />Wonderful cinnamon flavor, just sweet enough, but not too sweet.  Wonderful with your favorite coffee or hot chocolate, but stand on their own as a delicious snack.

review/summary: Delicious and Fulfilling Snack
review/text: I recently purchased a box of the Orchard Blend snacks from Amazon hoping that they would taste as good as they sounded.  I was happily surprised to find this better tasting than I expected.  There is great natural fruity flavor and crunch, and each bag is so full that I'm always amazed it's only 70 calories.  I love what it says under Ingredients: "Apples, Peaches, Apricots, and Nothing Else."  It's a fantastic all natural snack that really hits the spot.

review/summary: convenient, delicious, and healthy
review/text: I picked these up at Publix to try because I remembered eating dehydrated apples as a kid and loving them.  I have been on a "diet" for the last 11 months (eating healthier, counting my calories) and am always looking for new healthy snack alternatives.  I love these!  I miss the crunch of eating potato chips, so these are great when I just feel like I need to eat something crunchy.  The taste of the fruits together is well balanced and complimentary.  I haven't encountered the mostly-apples problem that others have mentioned.  The price here on Amazon is better than buying them individually in the local store for me.

review/summary: Great snack for the fruit-averse
review/text: I'm not a big fan of fresh fruit (I'd much rather eat veggies), but these little bags of "crunch-dried" fruit are kind of like the astronaut ice cream of the fruit world. Very satisfying for 70 calories, and at least now I get some of the benefits of eating fruit. I really like mixing some of this into 2% Fage yogurt and topping with a bit of agave nectar for breakfast!<br /><br />I docked this a star for this blend being mostly apples - there have been bags that I have gotten with only 4-5 pieces of peaches and apricots. Really wish there was a more even balance between the 3 fruits...

review/summary: Easy Snack That's Full of Flavor
review/text: I ordered these snacks for my husband who's a resident and is in the hospitals at all hours of the day and night. He doesn't like to carry things between home and the hospital so I'm always on the look out for decent food that is packaged for him to stick into his coat pockets. This product fit all of our requirements and has the added bonus of actually tasting good! I ended up swiping a few from his stash to take to my evening classes and loved the fruit combination! IMO this is the best flavor choice out of the Sensible Food options. We ordered another flavor and while they were good, they weren't as good as this one. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the price of all freeze dried fruit options are slightly ridiculous.

review/text: These snacks are sooooo good! I got them for my daughter, but I end up eating them all the time too. I love how good they are for you, and how versatile they are. It's an easy to serve, take anywhere, nutricious snack. If I could change anything about them, I wish that there were less apples and more of the other fruits. They're thin slices that end up hard after drying so my daughter still can't eat them. The other pieces melt in your mouth and are perfect for her. I still give it 5 stars though because I like them so much that I'm always glad to eat the apple pieces for her.

Anyway, I've tried them since it's come to my attention I'm STILL not getting enough fruits/vegs into my diet though I suck down v8 like it's going out of style. Regardless, they are sweet & flavorful. I love the crunchy & unlike most faux healthy fruit snacks these are not loaded with extra sugar & such. Too bad we have to ba cautious label readers.

review/text: This tea is an excellent herbal tea. Love the taste and it's not as weak as most herbal tea is. I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said "and free shipping when ordered from this seller" above the "add to cart" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products.

review/summary: Crazy Jerky
review/text: Ok, to preface this, I AM A VEGETARIAN. With that being said, I haven't had REAL beef or turkey jerky in quite some time and I have been missing it dearly. Having tried many vegetarian jerkies I can honestly say that this is by far the best! Most soy based jerkies are strangely on the oily side and the flavors are usually off. Being a "dry style" jerky fan I am pleased with the chewiness of Stonewall's and the WILD flavor. I have tried most of the other varieties of Stonewall's but none seemed to please me as much as the WILD. I'm also on Weight Watchers and have found that they are fairly low on points (4pts per bag) and are a great source of protein for vegetarians (14g). Be warned, the WILD is quite WILD, spicy spicy but in a good way!

review/text: The Hot Pastrami flavor is divine!  I like spicy things and just ordered another shipment of these because I went through them faster than I had anticipated.  They are moist and chewy, but not so chewy that you're still chewing to make it swallowable after all the flavor's gone.  I think they struck a nice balance.<br /><br />A caveat: If you're used to Tofurky Jurky or Primal Spirit, these will strike you as a little bit airy.  Also, these are a bit higher in fat than the other brands: 8 or 9 grams per 160-calorie package.  These ones don't really feel too oily in your mouth, though.

I HATE the Cajun varieties, they are so dry and tough to chew.<br />They are high in fat so I usually have to make my husband hide them from me since these are a rare treat for us in the house, I could eat 4-5 bags in a row!<br />Caution if you eat too many bags over a period of a few days, you may experience gas!<br />Try ordering direct and you'll be enjoying the BEST veggie jerquee there is in the US!!!!<br />PS These are made in Louisiana, could you ask for anything more authentic besides the real thing (meaning meat)

Stonewall's original and stonewall's original mild are some of the best tasting jerkey you'll find. What's best, is that this product is meat free. So for all you vegans out there this is especially a great treat idea. The package here is a store display container.  I keep them in the closet and when we remember we have them, it makes a perfect snack.  I think we'll be working on the box for about 2 month and that's with two jerkey freaks eating them.

review/summary: Airy and oily.
review/text: The texture on these things is all off.  For one, they're incredibly airy.  I am a huge fan of Primal Spirit and Tofurky Jurky, and had been used to denser vegan jerky when I first tried these.  It felt like I was chewing air.  Also, because these are higher in fat (8-9 grams per 160 calorie package), they are a bit oilier.  Coupled with the airiness, when you bite down on these, you can feel the oil oozing out of the little nuggets into your mouth, which isn't too pleasant.<br /><br />I don't think the flavor is anything special, either.  To be fair, I'm not sure what chicken tastes like or is supposed to taste like, but there are plenty of wonderfully flavorful vegan and vegetarian products out there.  This is not one of them.

review/text: I've tried two flavors - Pepperoni and Original Wild - and have enjoyed them both.  The texture's pretty good - nice and chewy.  The moisture level is okay, but it could be improved by being just a tiny bit more moist. There's also a little bit of an aftertaste (which I didn't find to be unpleasant, but some might).  The spice level on the Pepperoni and Original Wild flavors were perfect. The Original Wild was medium hot, so it might be a little too much for some.  I loved it though.  I recommend that people try to buy this locally before spending a lot of money on it.  I bought mine from a local vegan store online, then discovered that a large grocery chain carries it in their health food section.

review/summary: My Fave Veg Jerky
review/text: The "Original Wild" is a bit spicy for me, but "Original Mild" is spectacular, and Teriyaki Beef even better. Also like the spicy chicken one. I've tried all the veg jerky products and bewildered that none of the others come even close to this one for quality of flavor and texture. The others are loaded with sugar and taste more like candy than jerky; a couple of them are outright slimy; one was hard as a rock and flavorless. But the only time Stonewall's Jerquee ever displeased me was when the Poulsbo Market used a paper-punch to create holes along the top edge and hung them on a peg to dry out -- which I didn't realize until I got them home and they'd all been turned into hard lumps (which I ate any way). So now I have to buy them on amazon. I'll still get the fresh sushi at Poulsbo Market, that stuff's a dream, but what possessed them to poke holes in packaged foods???

review/summary: I love them:)
review/text: I have always liked these but I haven't had them in years.  Today, I was hungry and saw them at the natural market checkout counter.  I got the flavor "spicy 'chicken'" and LOVED it.  It is clear that this is a love or hate product.  I buy Primal Strips when in need of a snack I can eat in the car and they are just ok...oily and get stuck in my teeth.  Flavor is just OK.  Stonewall's are drier and puffier and chewier but somehow, don't get stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />I am on a low-carb diet and these are only 7 g of carbs for 13 g of protein.  I am getting a case of the original mild since it is Prime.  Would like to see more flavors available on Prime.<br /><br />Definitely suggest buying a small pack first given the love/hate aspect.

review/summary: moldy!
review/text: I've been eating this stuff here and there for many years.  I purchased a packet at the grocery store and the product was speckled with mold.  Unfortunately I didn't realize this until I popped a piece into my mouth whereupon I instantly realized something was very wrong.  It was not expired.  I traded it in or another which was also moldy. ick.

review/summary: Horrific Flavor and Terrible Texture
review/text: I love other brands of vegetarian jerky. This one, I hate. It is spongy instead of chewy and smells and tastes like concentrated, stale, off-brand dog food. I could not get this funky crap out of my mouth fast enough. I should also mention that I'll eat just about anything, including bugs and grass. If it came down to it, I'd turn to them before ingesting another piece of this food-like substance.

review/summary: Terrible. Couldn't finish bag.
review/text: I just purchased this jerky from a local store because they recently quit carrying the kind I like in my town. I ate a piece and thought it was disgusting. I wanted to give it a chance, so I ate a couple more pieces. It has a grainy, nasty texture and a terrible burned BBQ sauce flavor. For some bizarre reason it's made out of soy flour instead of strips of soy.<br /><br />The best soy jerky I've ever had is Tasty Eats jerky, since it's chewy and had a wonderful flavor. Flavor is of course subjective, but personally I thought the taste of Stonewall's is terrible, and the consistency is nasty. It tries too hard to look like meat, which I feel is pretty irrelevant to the demographic of people that will be eating it in the first place. Luckily it's Gluten-Free, so hopefully I can pawn the leftovers on my boyfriend...

review/summary: Best veg jerky
review/text: I think its interesting how spread out the reviews are on this product.  I guess its one of those love it or hate it type things.  Personally, I LOVE this jerky and cannot get enough!!  My favorite flavors are the hot pastrami and teriyaki. You do have to chew quite a bit but its not the same weird chewy texture some other veg jerkys have, like primal strips.  I hate primal strips but I had them about 10 years ago and never ate once since, so if the formula has changes on those then disregard...  So maybe try a small bag of this before ordering in bulk.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: I picked these up at Natural Grocers because I used to really love jerky, but am now vegetarian for four years, and I didn't like the Primal strips enough to re-purchase. I purchased the Original Mild and the Teriyaki flavors.<br /><br />The texture of these is spot on if you like toughier jerky (I do), although the outside has a weird sort of clumpy coating. Unfortunately, the taste is TERRIBLE. Both varieties honestly tasted like dog food. I also had two friends (one recently vegetarian, the other not) try them, and they said exactly the same thing. My friend's toddler-aged son loved them, though.<br /><br />I liked these even less than the Primal strips, and would not recommend them.

review/text: The overall flavor is pretty good (esp. for being vegetarian) and the texture was fine but, the one I tried, "original wild" was just TOO (spicy) hot! I don't mind a little heat but this was rediculous.  My mouth was burning for an hour afterwards.  This may be "fun" for some but not for me!  And I will give the "mild" a try - just to be fair).

review/summary: product was moldy, but company willing to fix problem
review/text: I think the jerky would have been good, but...<br />The packages I received contained jerky that had fuzzy white stuff growing on it. None of the packages had a read-able expiration date. The clearest packaging shows Aug 2011 (which means the product still had 6 months left in its life). When I contacted Lumen, however, I did get an email and phone call from them expressing their concern about my complaint. The man I spoke with was genuinely interested in investigating the problem. The company directly sent me three free packages to replace some of the moldy ones.

review/summary: not my favorite.
review/text: The seasoning is good, but the texture is not to my liking; it's almost spongy, and microwaving did not improve the texture for me. It is a little too dry and chewy, and has a weird aftertaste. I have not tried the other versions of this jerky. If you prefer a dry and chewy veggie jerky, I would go with the Vegan Dream brand. They have a sampler pack, with 6 different flavors. Also, as I follow weight watchers online, the 1.5 oz package has 4 points, with 8 grams of fat, 152 calories, 3 grams of fiber. There are lower calorie veggie jerkies available, if that is a concern for you.

Through Amazon, I get 16 nice one-serving packets & free shipping.  I use it in rice or noodle dishes (shred it & add near the end of cooking). This is terrific stuff!!  I prefer the Hot Pastrami, but try a few of the others to see which you like best.

review/summary: Addictive and Actually Gluten Free (despite label)...
review/text: This stuff is like crack.  There's no other way of describing just how delicious it is.  If it gets old, it gets a little hard, but they never sit around long enough to get old at my house.  I order this constantly and sometimes they run out, which leaves me craving it and miserable-- or begging my local health food store to dig in their back room for stray bags.  It's THAT good!!!  The only catch on Amazon is it's ingredients list wheat (in the soy sauce) as an ingredient, but the kind I've been getting are also labeled gluten free on the front.  I'm fairly confident it's a typographical error, because I've been eating it for a year now and no gluten reaction!  Enjoy!!!

review/summary: not like jerky
review/text: i had high hopes for this stuff. i have tried several types of veggie jerky, in search of the tough, fibrous, highly seasoned jerky of my old meat eating days. granted, my memory is likely hazy as i haven't eaten meat for about 20 years. however, this stuff is NOT like beef jerky. true, they are a bit hard and chewy. and they are very flavourful, but....in my opinion, not in a good way.<br /><br />if you have ever had those dehydrated soy slices made by "so soya" (and others) then you know what these are. take those slices, marinade and fry or bake, and you've probably got something like this jerky. they have a distinct flavour - i really can't pinpoint exactly what flavour it is, but it is consistent in all of the varieties and it is not too pleasant. i found the tofurky jerky to have a better flavour and nicer dense texture, but i think my search for the ideal jerky shall continue.

review/text: I like all the Stonewall Jerquee products. The fat content is somewhat higher than I'd like for very frequent consumption, but if you have an active metabolism/don't diet, it's a great higher protein veggie snack. Very tasty and satisfying to chew. Easy to pack, toss in a purse, travel bag, etc. Helpful for vegan's/vegetarians on the go, looking for protein away from home.

review/text: As with all foods, your mileage may vary with this product depending on freshness and all that. I didn't much care for it at first, but I found it to be an acquired taste and I actually do like the product now.<br /><br />It can be a bit greasy, but word has it that if you let greasy 'jerky' products sit out overnight in the open air that it helps with that. I've never had an issue with it, so I don't know for sure, but I suppose it'd be worth a try if you like the taste but find it a bit oily.<br /><br />All in all, compared with some of the gross real-meat jerky products I've tried, this stuff is pretty good. But don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself.

This sweetener works very well instead of sugar in most applications (beverages), though with black coffee it is clear the product is not sugar.  Its probably the acidity level in the coffee that creates a different result than that with Iced Tea, which tastes very good with stevia.<br /><br />Other Stevia products have tasted more like a chemical to me when tried.

review/summary: Excellent Product but Watch Out Price Keeps Increasing
review/text: We absolutely LOVE all the Plum Organics Pouches. They are awesome for lunch boxes. I am a parent of 3 1/2 yr. old twins. One cannot process fresh fruits and veggies but with these products I don't have to worry. He will now eat five different varieties. The only complaint I have is that they keep saying the item is no longer available for subscribe and save then one day later it becomes available at a higher price.

review/summary: Earl Grey is nice, perhaps a bit bland.  Warning: Never order loose tea!
review/text: I am an avid Earl Grey tea drinker (about 4 cups/day) and generally prefer loose tea.  Without realizing the vendor I choose to give this product a try.  Tea is not too bad, perhaps a bit bland, but not so weak as to warrent two bags per cup. Tea is no worse than Twinings or other mass market products, certainly drinkable and packets are portable and simple to use.  This is no where near the caliber of most loose teas.  One product I do recommend is Kusmi Anastasia tea.<br /><br />As a footnote, I would warn you against purchasing loose tea from Tea District.  I generally purchase by the pound and ordered a pound of tea before I was in dire need of a refill.  After it arrived I stored it in my dry cool basement until it was needed.  In the time it took me to finish my current batch, the tea district tea spoiled - the sealed mylar bag smelled of spoiled oranges or rotten feet or maybe both.  Tasted about as bad too.  Company told me I waited more than 30 days to complain so it's my problem.  Wasn't cheap and wasn't consumable.  If you're looking at loose tea from Tea District, purchase small sample bags not the large sealed bags or better yet, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Nice Product
review/text: Hello,<br /><br />I have been buying this popcorn from Whole Foods market for years. Well recently, for reasons I haven't been able to ascertain, Whole foods stopped carrying it.<br /><br />I have always liked YA-YA's Chedder flavor because they don't overwhelm you with cheese. The big fat American eater probably wont like it. It is low fat and lightly cheese flavored and frankly, it doesn't have the mouth feel that that the unhealth concience eater wants.<br /><br />If you are aware of what your eating, this popcorn is a nice treat. Popcorn is neat food for blood sugar control. Popcorn will not cause an insulin spike. This particular popcorn does not contain Trans Fat. No<br />patially hydrogenated oil. Check your microwave popcorn. Its loaded with it and should never be eaten under any circumstance.<br /><br />So, eat your YA-YA's! I do wish amazon could get it out faster. My last order took 8 days. Cmon now. Does it ship from Egypt?

review/summary: The best deal and the easiest way to buy Soy Formula
review/text: Upon lots of experimentation, we found Nestle Good Start Soy as the best formula for our baby boy. We used Good Start Soy so far. Very recently we upgraded to Good Start 2. No problems at all. The best time for this upgrade is when your baby is on first foods for a while. but not eating enough of it. Our pediatrician recommended frequent feedings. That works semi-successfully for the day-time with attention and mood problems. During night, especially before sleep-time, feeding of Good Start 2 is very effective to put him down for 6 hrs at least. (We have one very active baby). Good Start 2 has worked out as a very effective strategy to fill the nutrition gap.<br /><br />It is not very easy to find big cans and even small cans of Soy products in popular superstores and grocery chains. If you do, the price varies as much as $3-$5 per can from one place to the other. Amazon's 24 Oz. 6-pack is the best deal with free shipping. You pay about 84 cents per ounce. If you go for one size bigger 6-pack 25.6 Oz cans, you pay 93 cents per ounce.

She will squeak it non-stop, groom it, carry it around with her.  And then when we're not watching her, she goes in for the kill.  She loves her ducks and they are worth every penny!!!  Like the other reviewer, I would agree that they are not appropriate for large dogs ... but who would assume that a $2 toy was "large"?  I think they over-reacted a little and I am sure they could have gotten a return or a refund if they contacted this seller.  These are perfect for a miniature or small dog (Chihuahua, mini-Dachshund, Italian Greyhound, any small dog that loves duck toys), not good for a medium or large dog unless.  Buy with confidence!

review/summary: Deceptive Advertising; Product is not suitable for dogs (IMHO)
review/text: These ducks are not the standard stuffed ducks us dog owners are used to seeing in the pet stores. These are mini. I mean mini (about 2-inches in length). If I give this to my 70+ Lb. shepherd he would likely choke on it.<br /><br />The fact that these are mini is in no way clearly advertised. It is listed under product description only. Actual dimension are not provided to the consumer. I am of the opinion that this product is being advertised in a deceptive way. I plan to file a complaint with Amazon. I feel that I have been ripped off. They charged $5.99 in shipping that I cannot recoup. I'm not so concerned with the money as I am with the level of dishonesty I perceive in the advertising of this product from PetFoodDirect.com.<br /><br />Most dog owners are familiar with the normal size (about 12 inches in length) stuffed ducks. I've never seen these "mini" ducks before. I am of the opinion that I have been taken advantage of.<br /><br />I would strongly suggest against purchasing anything from this company.

review/text: I adore watermelon, but things flavored with it tend to be artificial and icky, nothing like the perfect juicy fruit I love. However, I trust Red Leaf to deliver on authentic, juicy flavor, and boy did they ever! Though it smells kind of like a Jolly Rancher in the bag, the tea itself tastes nothing like "watermelon" flavored candy. This watermelon matcha is perfectly fresh and it seriously tastes like matcha made with watermelon juice! The grassy, almost creamy matcha is a perfect base for the lip-smackingly tasty watermelon flavor. It's great straight, as a latte, iced, even as a smoothie with real watermelon and a splash of milk!

review/summary: Seriously delicious matcha
review/text: Sometimes I think mangos are my favourite fruit. Then I remember watermelon! Sweet, juicy watermelon - oh yes! Both of these fruits can share the spotlight - but only when they are ripe, juicy and flavourful! Why did I pick some of the messiest fruits to be my favourite?<br /><br />Luckily, the only thing that gets messy when I whip up a cup of this matcha is my cup and whisk! (...and my white shirt. That's a story for another time) But hey! Virtually mess free! At least it's not all over my face... although this matcha is delicious enough that I wouldn't mind sticking my face into a huge bowl of it. Oh yes, can you tell that I am happy with this matcha? So happy! The flavour is sweet and true watermelon flavour! I like watermelon candies, but I hate watermelon jolly ranchers (too chemically), so I was very happy that this flavour lies between a watermelon flavouring and a real watermelon. That doesn't really make sense, but I guess you'll have to take my word for it lol.<br /><br />Making this hot with a sprinkle of sugar takes it into treat territory! Seriously delicious matcha that has me drooling just thinking about it! Another great summer treat. Chopping up some watermelon to make a watermelon puree to go with this matcha (and a splash of vodka) is definitely on my to-do list.<br /><br />I prefer my watermelon fruit straight from the fridge and icy cold, so it goes without saying that my favourite way to prepare this drink is ICED. I still haven't gotten into the habit of just mixing matcha with cold water - so I mix it up double strong with 170 F water, add ice cubes and top with more water. This gives me a perfect result every time - no clumps (if I drink it right away!) and smooth as the rind of an in season watermelon. Oh yes, I went there.<br /><br />For an extra treat, I experimented with cream and tried a "watermelon and cream" dessert tea. It was delicious! Let it be known - any fruit + cream = wonder! Too bad most flavours stick to strawberries&cream or peaches&cream, because I think I'm on to something here ;)<br />This also went well with vanilla soy milk and plain almond milk! I'm not picky - I always buy almond milk when it's on sale because it's so delish, creamy, and doesn't affect my acid reflux! That's the joy of these flavoured matchas - delicious flavour minus the calories! They don't need milk and sugar to tantalize my tastebuds - even the basic matcha is smooth, grassy and even creamy!

The watermelon does not overwhelm the Matcha, which is vegetative, creamy and sweet.  It feels so rich and smooth on the palate.<br /><br />I've tried a lot of tea - a lot of Matcha, for that matter - and even quite a few flavored Matcha... this is one of the very best I've tried.

review/text: I love watermelon, and I love tea. Needless to say, I've tried just about every watermelon tea I've seen. This one blows them all out of the water. It's best made with a lower water temperature, though you'll probably be drinking it cold so it doesn't matter. A touch of cream brings out the fruit flavor even more.<br />This matcha is also amazing added to a puree of watermelon and mint. It keeps the mint from overpowering the fruit, while adding a nice green tea flavor. And if you want something unique and different, give it a try rubbed onto a slice of watermelon. There are no words to even describe how good it is!

review/summary: What a melon! (tea)
review/text: There are few things in this world that scream "summer" to me like watermelon. Unfortunately, they're one of those rare treats as my father is allergic to it, so I only had it at other people's parties when growing up. Now, my wife doesn't like it, so it's rare I can convince myself to lug a watermelon home and slice it up, just for myself. But the local grocery store now has mini seedless watermelons for a good price, so I've already had two so far this summer and plan on going back for another on Friday. So much love for watermelon in my heart. It's just juicy and delicious and amazing. I'm just curious, did anyone out there grow up salting their watermelon? Until I was 10, we lived in Michigan and I'd never even heard of it, but when we moved to Tennessee, everyone did it. It does bring out the juiciness of it, but it's also, you know, terrible for you.<br /><br />Now, I know watermelon can be a tough flavor for tea. Many people have tried (two come to mind in 52teas' watermelon iced tea and DavidsTea's Luscious Watermelon), but I have to say I wasn't horribly impressed with those I've tried. So while I had to try it, I just had to, I wasn't holding out a lot of high hopes for this watermelon matcha. When I opened the package, I got juicy watermelon...but a hint of metallic or whatever it was that made the lemon, peach, and mango teas so bitter. But since warm weather has moved in, I've gotten into the habit of mixing my tea with room temperature or cold water, and it definitely paid off this time. I get juicy, creamy watermelon and absolutely no bitterness. Mmmm, this is good. This is really good. It's light and refreshing and utterly perfect for these coming summer months...it's gonna be a scorcher. This is the watermelon I've been searching for and I can't wait to try it blended up with some fresh melon. This kind of tastes like a watermelon bubble tea, but without the overwhelming sweetness. Maybe I need to find some tapioca pearls. It reminds me of the Ten Ren watermelon oolong blended with fresh melon, not Freshly Squeezed's idea of a bubble tea. I'm only a little bitter, I promise. But this is a definite restock for me, and one I will definitely be sharing with friends and family.

review/summary: Love Them!
review/text: I was so surprised at the prior review; but then not surprised, because everyone has a different palate and an expectation of what the "perfect" recipe is (just think of chocolate chip cookies and brownies, and arguments over the best recipe). I don't disparage anyone else's take; I just want to offer my own, as a person whose family has been making from-scratch pickled beets for generations AND who has eaten many dozens of jars of Rick's Picks Phat Beets.<br /><br />I love these pickled beets. I only regret is that I can't afford to eat a jar every day.<br /><br />Most commercial brands of pickled beets  (and even from-scratch recipes) flavor the beets with cider vinegar or an herb vinegar such as tarragon vinegar. Then, they throw in sugar and salt, and (ideally) sliced onion--that's it. Phat Beets are a different, gourmet style.<br /><br />The Phat Beets recipe has a complex layering of spices--rosemary, ginger, lemon, onion, allspice, cinnamon sticks, cloves and brown sugar instead of white sugar or corn syrup. The recipe uses cider vinegar. The result: beets with dancing flavors, as addictive as any food you can name.<br /><br />Don't throw away the brine -- it's a bonus. Just add cooked sliced beets (canned are fine) to the leftover brine and you'll have another batch of pickled beets to enjoy in a day or two. And another, and another. When the brine has faded, follow the "recipe" to make a fresh brine for canned beets (tarragon vinegar ads yet another nuance).

review/summary: Worst Beets I've ever eaten
review/text: I just purchased these beets and couldn't wait to get them home and try them.  They are the worst beets I have ever had.  I love pickled beets and have been eating them for years.  These tatse like a musty basement smells.  I'll stick with Greenwood Beets or Joycie's Beets both are delicious.

review/summary: Disappointing beets
review/text: I purchased a sampler package which included the Phat Beets.  I found the spices used overwhelmed the taste of the beets to the point that you could not taste the beets.

review/summary: YUMMY
review/text: This candy is the greatest thing since the zipper.  How can something that is sugar-free taste so dang good????  I order it by the case for my diabetic mother who has a real sweet tooth.  I keep a bag in my purse for those times I want to eat but need to wait.  If you like pralines and cream ice cream.....you will just love this stuff.  I have given many pieces away to friends and co-workers and everyone loves them.  I was admitted to the hospital recently for a few days and the nurse who came in remembered me from awhile ago and reminded me that I had given her this candy the last time I was there (I have a chronic disease).  I don't go around giving out candy but this taste so good, I have to share it! Try a bag...it's taste great and is great for the figure!

review/summary: The best sugar free candy  ever made why must it end?
review/text: This product has been far superior to any other for as long as I have been buying it, which has been at least 6 years.  This flavor and the Baskin Robbins and<br />Cookies and Cream are my favorites.  You can't imagine how devestated I became when there was a message in the box that Baskin Robbins is going to cease the manufacture of this sugar free candy.  They must be nuts or something!!  I intend to write to the company.  Please, please, everyone who reads this review -  inform Baskin Robbins that they are off their rocker.

review/summary: Great addition to Phase II Atkins
review/text: These sugar free treats are definitely delicious--the closest I'll get to ice cream for a while. But be warned, while sugar alcohols can make Atkins more bearable, in excess, they can cause gas, bloating and diarrhea<br />Also, excessive energy intake in any form leads to weight gain. Avoid over consumption of all foods including those containing sugar alcohol

review/summary: The quality of the product itself
review/text: I have been buying this product since I discovered it at Costco, and recently discovered it on Amazon. I find this to be a versatile and extremely useful ingredient in many foods I prepare ... casseroles, soups, stews, any non-sweet that requires flavor and liquid. It has the additional health benefits of chicken soup, and may be used in hot soup drinks for flu and colds. It makes an exceptional baked brown rice side dish when paired with Himalayan Pride Basmati Rice, which is also available here. I may sound like a salesman for this stuff, but I have made my own organic broths from vegetables and bones, and it takes a lot of time and care. For a prepared product, this has good flavor and versatility. And it is not canned, another large health plus - no leached metals, additives, or plastic liner contamination.<br />I can't testify to the shipping practices of the various postal services. I have received damaged products in the past, and it was the responsibility of the seller to package them properly, and it is the responsibility of the shipper to handle the goods properly. Usually, it seems to be the brutal treatment of the shipper in question, which means the seller must be notified. Amazon stands by their products, so I buy a lot from them. When I have had a problem, they promptly took care of it. I find I am buying more from them every month, and will do so as long as they are honest with me, as I am with them.
