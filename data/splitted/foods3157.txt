review/summary: NOT a 10 lb box
review/text: I have purchased items from Fantastic Foods before and I love all of their products.  Easy to make for quick meals and they taste great.  I was very excited to see that Amazon.com has these items in bulk so I purchased a few.  All products arrived in great condition except the Vegetarian Chili Mix arrived in a bag and not a box like the other items and it is NOT 10 lbs.  Judging by the size of it compared to the other items, it weighs around 5 lbs.  Amazon.com customer service is sending a replacement, hopefully it will be the right size.

review/summary: Authentic, tasty and fresh
review/text: I have been getting into Moroccan cuisine in the last year or so and have been building my Moroccan pantry.  The first products that I purchased were <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FVCVS8">Ras El Hanout</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AQMSV4">Preserved Lemons </a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AQDCPA">Harissa Paste,</a> which are fundamental and essential items if you want to tackle this cuisine.  Kefta is a more specialized spice blend but it very nice to have on hand.<br /><br />Kefta seems have less of an Indian influence that Ras El Hanout.  Like many traditional spice blends - each person, restaurant, and shop has their own, "secret" mix.  Are far as instantly noticeable ingredients, the usual suspects are coriander, turmeric and paprika.  The spearmint and marjoram give this blend both high notes and a little more depth.  One of my favorite pastimes is to guess what the "other spices" are in a blend.  I would imagine that I am probably wrong more often that right but it is fun to try to identify those trace fragrances and tastes that are often hidden behind stronger flavors.  My best guess here is that mustard powder and a stronger ground pepper (maybe cayenne) help to round out this blend.<br /><br />The recipe for Moroccan Meatballs that is listed on the product page for this item produces a good and delicious meal.  Deep-frying the meatballs help to give them a little better texture than if you just brown them in a skillet.  I use pretty much the same ingredients as a jumping off point for some less-than-traditional recipes.  I use equal parts 80/20 ground beef and ground lamb to which I add all of the other ingredients in the meatball recipe.  Instead of forming them into balls I make hamburger patties (about 7oz. each).  After grilling them I coat one half of the bun with Harissa paste and the other with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XTD2ZY">Mint Chutney </a>.  I use sliced preserved lemons instead of pickles skip the cheese (BTW, I use about 50% more Kefta spice blend than the recipe calls for when I make these burgers.)<br /><br />One thing that surprises a lot of my guests is that I use a little Kefta when I make tacos, tamales and chile relleno.  For some reason the blend really adds a pleasing extra dimension to my Tex-Mex dishes.  Kefta is one of those spice blends that I will always keep on hand.

review/summary: A satisfying and delicious cup of coffee
review/text: When I choose coffee I usually go directly to a dark French Roast but I thought I'd like a little change of pace so I selected The Bean Coffee Company, Mocha Java Organic Whole Bean Coffee the last time I needed to buy coffee. I'm so glad I did! I now have a new favorite! This mocha java coffee is so wonderful!<br /><br />First of all I love that it is organic. Secondly, it is whole bean because I prefer to grind my own. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, its flavor is divine ~ it is a medium roast that has a full bodied depth; it is smooth and low acidic; and the chocolate "notes" are subtle. All of this simply translates into a very satisfying and delicious cup of coffee.<br /><br />I should also say that the Amazon pricing for the 5 pound bag of whole beans is extraordinary and as soon as I post this review I am going to order some more!

While other Eukanuba varieties have great ingredients, for some reason, this Weight Control formula's first ingredient is...Corn Meal? Second is chicken by product. Actual chicken comes in third.<br /><br />The packaging says that Chicken is always the most important ingredient - so why is it third? Also, this food is made for small breeds but the pieces are pretty substantial in size - too big for my 13-lbs dog.

review/summary: Perfect for the evening...
review/text: Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams.<br /><br />This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect.<br /><br />Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Weavers makes THE BEST decaf coffee, hands down!
review/text: Weaver's makes the best tasting decaf I have found. I tried about a dozen different brands and this was the only one that I found to have the richness of regular without any sourness. The grind is fine enough to use in my Jura automatic espresso machine. It makes fine French press too but reduce the steep time to accomodate the finer grind.<br /><br />MY STORY:<br />As a nursing mother I need to watch my caffeine intake. As a former full-time graphic designer, I had a massive coffee habit that needed taming. I really LOVE the taste of coffee and was used to having 2 double lattes a day, one in morning and one around 2:30 PM. So I tried doing one shot regular espresso and one shot decaf espresso in both my lattes to cut my daily intake by half and spread out the caffeine out so my body could process it without passing a huge slug of it to my baby. It worked ok but the decaf never tasted right, it always lacked richness and tasted sour; until I ordered this. I was amazed and delighted that this decaf really tastes like REAL coffee! No sour notes or weakness to spoil the great flavor of my regular shot of espresso. Now both shots tasted great and this momma gets her coffee AND has a baby that still naps soundly.<br /><br />WEAVER'S IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!

review/summary: Excellent Coffee
review/text: What is there to say about coffee? Either you like it or you dont, for various reasons. I definately like this coffee. Seems Im on a constant hunt for the best tasting brew, and this one is way at the top of the list. Another is the Magnum Jamaican Blue.<br /><br />I also ordered the "Dead Mans Reach" from Ravens Brew, also excellent tasting coffee, but Id rate this flavor slightly higher, it seems to have an almost floral note mixed with a bold but not at all bitter taste. Perfect to get you going for the day. I use a burr grinder set between medium and fine, with a half cup measure for a full 12 cup drip (Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable Coffeemaker)<br /><br />The only negative comment I can make is Im unhappy with the price vs amount in the bag. 10 bucks for 12 ounces in a bag is a bit tough to swallow. (pun intended) I suppose one could argue it costs more to produce in smaller batches. Maybe.... Id not have this everyday for the cost reason alone, rather as a treat maybe two or three times a week, so it lasts longer. Yes, its that good :) I would have given this coffee 5 stars if there were at least 16 oz per bag, so you loose a star for that. I will, without a doubt, buy more, just not very often.

But the tea I received under the label Tea District is so full bodied and delicious for a chamomile tea, it needs very little sweetening if any at all. I like to use a dip of honey or splenda to bring out the additional herbs like licorice root.

review/text: I purchased this product after reading about how its nutritional profile was very similar to that of a mouse (source: catinfo.org). I feed my cats (two 6 month old Siamese females) several different varieties of canned food, and this seems to be their favorite. Half way through the case, I went ahead and purchased a case of the 5.5 oz cans. This food has more texture than the pate-style foods, and you can see bits of the vegetables/fruit in it. It also has nearly no odor. I can't say that this food has improved their health, since they haven't been in poor health for the short time I've had them, but they are very active, have shiny coats, and have firm and regular poops. I anticipate that I will continue to purchase it.

review/text: I had been wanting to get my cats a better quality cat food, and after seeing the Merrick brand mentioned on several pet forums and blogs I decided to try it. I have to admit too, I was a little attracted by the cute names they have for the flavors. I went with Cowboy Cookout for starters, since this flavor was mentioned quite a lot. I was a little worried about ordering a whole case and then having my cats turn their noses up, but I was thrilled to find they licked their plates clean. The ingredients are great, the price is less than a number of the other high quality foods, and my cats love it. I plan on trying some of the other flavors they have in the future to give them some variety, but Cowboy Cookout will definitely be a regular on the menu from now on.

review/text: I became concerned with my cat's weight and the dry, compact stools showing up in her litter.  After doing some research, I decided to transition her from her grain-free dry to this.  It took a few days of mixing the two but she now gobbles this up.  I do notice a drop in her weight, an increase in her activity level, and an improvement in her stools (no more straining).  Guess that is a little TMI but how else does one evaluate a cat food?  Anyway, I am pleased with this food.

review/summary: Kitty's Review
review/text: I have taken the position that it is best for my cats to tell me how to review the new foods that I try out on them. I am always searching for new ways to please the critters. All love Merrick's "Grammy's Pot Pie" and it is always eaten in its entirety everytime it is offered. I read the reviews of Cowboy Cookout and because it was noted as being the closest that wet food in a can provides that is "like a mouse" (noted by one reviewer) I decided to try it.<br /><br />The five of them are given their wet food dinner at about 5:00 PM. Kibble is always available.<br /><br />I have five cats and have given them Merrick's Cowboy Cookout three times with three days spacing between offering. The first time it was offered, half was eaten and that same result occurred on the 3rd offering. The second time it was put out, no one ate any of it. Five or six varieties are always offered at dinner time.<br /><br />So, I gathered up my kitties and they gave Cowboy Cookout 3 stars. One cat admits to liking it when he if Very hungry and someone else has already cornered his favorite canned foods. The other five say they just do not like the taste at all. The consistency is fine and "there is plenty of gravy" but they do not like the taste. All five agree that they much prefer Fancy Feast sliced beef in a can. It is much cheaper. So, go figure.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084EKO">Fancy Feast Sliced Beef Feast (24/3-oz cans)</a>.<br /><br />I always abide by the vote of the kitties and they say "Thank you", from: Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty. "We hope our vote has been helpful. We are just five individual kids and we always tell you the TRUTH about our food likes and dislikes. Thank you or your attention."

review/text: Cornbread is something that people think they're not fond of until they have a really, really good one. I made a really, really good cornbread... and then figured out I couldn't eat it.<br /><br />When I went about preparing this, I modified it to be more similar to my own... and I have to admit it is pretty fantastic. My teenage "real-food" kids ate more of it than I did... They love the texture.<br /><br />My cornbread is on the moist and sweet side. It can all be done in a mixing bowl and greased pan of course, but I like a rustic cornbread in a cast iron skillet, and the a warm skillet helps to shorten the baking time. This is how I prepared it:<br /><br />Preheat oven to 375.<br />Melt a stick of butter in a cast-iron skillet on low- just until melted and turn it off.<br />The next steps move quickly to keep the pan warm but prevent the pan from cooking the ingredients before you get them incorporated... Not as hard as it sounds. Just have it all ready to go. =)<br /><br />sprinkle 1/2tsp baking soda over 1-1/2 cups buttermilk and do not mix<br /><br />Whisk into the pan in this order:<br />1/2 c sugar<br />3 eggs, one at a time, whisking well after each<br /><br />At this point, using the rule of thirds, add a third of the bag of mix, then whisk the soda into the buttermilk and add a third, then another third of the mix, the buttermilk, mixing well after each until all is added and well blended and consistent in texture. I usually scrape the mix off the sides of the pan back into the center for better visual appearance... and then place on the center rack in the oven.<br /><br />Bake until the top is brown...not just golden... Be brave. =) It took about 40 minutes. If you don't bake it until it's medium brown, too much moisture will remain, and it will be more like a cornbread pudding... which is okay... Just tell them you meant to do that. =)

review/summary: Hard to believe it's Gluten-free!!
review/text: I bought one bag of this at a local health food store and I LOVE IT!!  It's so EASY to make, which is such a bonus for Gluten-free baking.  It is incredibly moist and has a spongy texture (although some may not like that as it is a bit different than a traditional cornbread taste....)  It's good Gluten-free cornbread.  There's no other way to describe it.

review/summary: Buttermilk and Honey Cornbread
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Cornbread mix is excellent. The texture is soft, slightly moist and just the right amount of "dense" as cornbread should be . . . I substitute buttermilk for milk, grapeseed oil for the oil/butter and then I add 1 tsp. of vanilla and a 1/4 cup of honey. It comes out perfect every time. Visiting "gluten-eating" family has not been able to tell this is a gluten-free baked item. We are a household of three and two of us recently discovered we had Celiac disease so, for us, gluten-free is not a choice, it is a must. It is good to know most of our loved "gluten" containing items are available in a gluten-free form.

review/summary: The recipe clearly has way too little liquid
review/text: I was excited to try the pre-made cornbread mix.  However, when I made it using the recipe on the back of the packaging, there seemed to be WAY too little liquid.  I could barely get them into the muffin pan, and then they just held their shape (didn't spread into the pan).  It seemed to have a decent taste, aside from being dry.  So I tried it again using a different recipe, and substituting the mix for the flour in the other recipe.  That didn't work perfectly either.  I have had much better results just doing it with a recipe and cornmeal.

review/summary: Awesome cornbread!  Use extra butter and add some brown sugar.
review/text: The first time I tried this mix, I prepared it exactly according to the directions on the package.  The result was a gritty, dry cornbread with a slightly bitter taste.  Not great.<br /><br />I decided to give it another go recently.  This time I used a whole stick of organic pasture butter, added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a little extra salt.  These tweaks made a HUGE difference!  The cornbread turned out rich, moist, and slightly sweet -- more of a traditional southern cornbread with zero bitterness.<br /><br />Now that I've figured out how to make it work, I'm thrilled with this mix and will use it again!

review/summary: Make this as good as GF Pantry
review/text: I have celiac disease and have tried most of the GF mixes around. Bob's Red Mill's GF Cornbread is cheap and easy to find in most grocers. However, I find much to be desired when it comes to the flavor and texture of this product. Someone mentioned it earlier - there is NOT enough liquid. Cornbread should be moist, and if you ever try the mix by Gluten Free Pantry it is very much so. Also, this cornbread has a gritty and sour flavor. Not my choice. Finally, when you bake them into muffins, they tend to get rock hard on the outside while still gooey on the inside.<br /><br />The Gluten Free Pantry Cornbread Mix is hard to find, so I have adapted this mix to taste similar. Instead of 1.5 cups of milk, put in 2 cups of buttermilk (or nearly 2 cups of regular milk with a tablespoon of vinegar). Add one more tablespoon of butter and a little sugar or splenda.<br /><br />People with celiac disease should NOT have to suffer poor quality products. We tend to forget what those taste like. Don't settle!!

review/summary: Really tasty
review/text: I don't have to eat gluten free, but I'm testing things for a friend's visit in a month. I wanted to try cornbread since it's an item I love. This cornbread is great. I prefer a more cake-like cornbread that isn't gritty and this one works for me very well.<br /><br />I didn't have the suggested "grey 9x9 pan" mentioned on the baking instructions and since I wasn't sure how important the pan was, I skipped my glass one and used two grey loaf pans. I just divided the batter and baked for about 30 minutes. It turned out nice and fluffy, moist and delicious. I like it with a smear of lowfat margarine, a drizzle of honey and a dash of cinnamon. It's like dessert. I've eaten it for breakfast and for snacking.<br /><br />It's a recipe that anybody can enjoy, even if one isn't on a restricted diet. Thanks, Bob's Red Mill.

review/summary: OK Corn Muffins but Plastic Packaging Often Defective
review/text: The mix makes ok muffins if you increase the amount of milk to 2+ cups and slightly increase the amount of butter.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have encountered with this product is the packaging. On several occasions I ordered a box of 4 bags of mix and 1 or more of them had holes in the plastic and a lot of the mix was leaking out all over the place. Amazon was very good about replacing the unusable product, and last year I had email correspondence with Bob's Red Mill about the problem.  They promised they would look into it but they have obviously not resolved it as the box I received yesterday again had leaking bags. The holes are at the bottoms and sides of the bags and not on the seams.  A sharp object had apparently pierced them - could it be a manufacturing glitch or employee sabotage at the plant???

While making the cornbread mix was simple enough and baking the mix was easy, this bread just doesn't taste good.<br /><br />For those so starved for a piece of corn bread this will be okay.

review/summary: Good texture and flavor
review/text: I've been gluten free for a few months and have tried several gluten free bread products with disappointment.  I didn't have high hopes for Bobs Gluten Free Cornbread, but was pleasantly surprised.  The cornbread baked beautifully.  The texture was somewhat denser than regular cornbread, but at least it had a natural texture unlike many odd gluten free baked products.  It sliced well both fresh from the oven and leftover, without leaving many crumbs.  I have a few pieces in the freezer and hope they retain the texture when thawed.<br /><br />I would have hoped for more corn flavor, but found the overall flavor to be nice enough.  There is a bit of an oddly bitter aftertaste which would be due to one of the flours in the mixture, and I'm not sure which.  But as long as I serve the cornbread with other foods and don't eat it by itself, then I don't notice the bitterness.  I would like to tweak it with additions such as corn kernels or finely chopped onion.  The Gluten Free Goddess (check her blog) makes a cornbread from scratch and adds chopped green chilies with cinnamon that sounds delicious and could be adapted with this mix.<br /><br />The price is fantastic with the Subscribe and Save option, especially with the current bobs gluten free promo code.  Gluten free products are so darned expensive, so a deal like this really helps.

review/text: All I can say is: This is the BEST darn gluten-free cornbread you will ever find. The taste, the texture...it's so much like the real thing, I feel like I'm cheating somehow. I'm starting to think that Bob's Red Mill has the GF thing nailed better than any other company. Their pancake mix is to die for! I'm baking a loaf of their Gluten Free Hearty Whole Grain bread mix today in my bread maker....I'll weigh in on that when I try it. (Though my dad, who is celiac too, swears it's the best....but you HAVE to toast it, like most other GF breads.)

review/text: This cornbread is my daughter's favorite thus far since being diagnosed with Celiac disease on June 1, 2007. Our favorite gluten brand Jiffy, is a hard act to follow but this one comes very close in texture. It is not grainy like an all cornmeal bread.

review/text: This mix was great! So easy to make. I made half of the recipe first to try it out, it came out great. My bf who isnt celiac raved about them too. We even made thanksgiving stuffing with it, he loved it! couldnt stop eating it. So this mix works for all things. I advise trying it out and trying different things. As fas as people saying its flavorless, I did not encounter that, I mean its a corn muffin not some double decker choco bluberry coffee cake muffin were all use to. Its a great price as well here. Its usually 3-4 dollars at the health food store or even 5-7 in the local grocery. Good buy!

review/summary: Excellent cornbread
review/text: I made this with Eggbeaters, olive oil (not extra virgin so a mild taste), and rice milk.  The batter was very thick and had to be spread rather than poured into the pan.  The instructions stipulated using a 9" square gray non-stick pan which I do not own so I used glass Pyrex instead, sprayed with oil, and it baked just fine with zero stickage.  As it baked it rose up nice and high and turned golden brown on top.  I had not had cornbread since I went GF so this was a huge treat.  I would not hesitate to make this for company.

review/text: It's hard to believe the 5 star reviews for this cornbread mix.  I should have rated it zero stars.  All I can say is these people must not have ever had good cornbread.  The taste is bad, the texture is worse.  I threw away the pan of cornbread after my husband and I each had a piece. I used the next package (I had bought 3)for turkey dressing and ended up throwing it away.  To prevent the possibility of wasting even more ingredients on another recipe, I just went ahead and threw the last unused package away.

review/summary: Great Curry for Chicken Salad
review/text: This is the perfect curry for Curried Chicken Salad.  We don't eat it that often and a can lasts us about a year.  The metal can and lid keeps it fresh.<br /><br />For the best taste, add a little water to a Tablespoon or so of curry powder to make a thick paste and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.  We then measure out the amount of mayonnaise needed for the chicken salad.  Blend in a little of the curry powder at a time until you get the flavor intensity you desire.<br /><br />We usually make it with 13 oz of canned chicken, diced onions, diced celery, chopped pecans/walnuts and the curried mayonnaise.  You can also add, diced hot or bell peppers, diced tomatoes, etc.

review/summary: This is great bouillon!!
review/text: I love this bouillon. It's a lot more flavorful than other brands I have tried. It's not as salty either. The flavor comes through quite well.  I use it in a Garlic Butter Rice recipe that I created. It gives it a lot of flavor and lets the fresh garlic come through too. It doesn't take much and the rice isn't as salty as it was with other brands. If you want my recipe, please feel free to ask in a comment. I'll be more than happy to give it to you. It's very easy to make.<br /><br />I also add it to homemade Green Beans and Ham Hocks. It really brings out the flavor of them. I only add a tablespoon or so, depending on how many green beans I cook.<br /><br />I love Knorr products. This will be the only Chicken Bouillon I will ever buy. It makes a great hot drink when I need something to warm me up.<br /><br />Amazon is the only place I have found this at such a great price. I will continue to order it as I need it. It was well packaged and came quickly. I was impressed!!  Thanks Amazon

review/text: The Knorr granulated chicken bouillon is flavorful and, equally as importantly, easy to use.  Since chicken (or beef) stock is such a wonderful addition to almost any dish that calls for water, a fast disolving soup base is just the ticket for when you do not have your own stock available.<br /><br />Lasts for months on the counter.  Much better than the cubes.

They run for $2 on sale at the supermarket and $1.59 on the Annie's Homegrown website.<br />Taste/Flavor: They are not as good as the white cheddar (purple box) but still taste good and has less sodium than the others. We only have one mac n cheese lover in our home so this 12 pack has lasted us well over 8 months, however I will consider purchasing this again in the future when our child is older.<br />Other Comments: Quick and easy to make, with 11g of protein per serving (each box is 2.5 servings, however, it is quite possible to finish the entire box for one person if you're hungry!), and a decent source of calcium as well. Having all natural ingredients is also a plus.

review/text: In going for a healthier item, Annie's seems to have cut down on the cheese to the point where it's just enough to barely coat the macaroni. It's not at all like traditional mac'n'cheese that has a lush, rich, thick coating of cheese; the cheese entirely disappears into the pasta.<br /><br />If healthiness is your main goal, maybe this is an acceptable version. If you want a traditional taste, this will not do it.

review/text: Frosted Flakes has been my favorite cereal since I was a toddler! I remember my mom taking a small box with her when we went to visit Aunts and Uncles because she was never sure if they'd have a box in the house. (OK, so once my Aunt had some in the house and she took offense; I guess my cousins liked Frosted Flakes, too!)<br /><br />They have that sugar on them that I absolutely crave; true, with all the dietary advice out there these days Frosted Flakes may be something of a guilty pleasure for me--but, then again, who cares! I pour myself a bowl, add some milk and I am ready to go to town!<br /><br />Others have noted that they come with an expiration date that is far enough in advance so you won't have to worry about eating them too fast; and they are right.<br /><br />Overall, Frosted Flakes has always been and probably always will be my favorite cereal. I don't know that I've ever actually met a person who can (honestly) say that they don't like Frosted Flakes. I highly recommend that you get some today and enjoy!

review/text: I buy a lot from Amazon, but have never purchased grocery items from them.  I thought I would take a chance on a less that 12 dollar purchase for four boxes of one of our favorite cereals and it paid off.  I was a bit concerned that the product inside the box might be reduced to crumbs due to the shipping, but was quite happy to find out it is all in good shape. The expiration date is July 2012, plenty of time for us to use the product. I'll be going back for more and will consider other products, as well. By the way, the cereal is almost $2.00 cheaper than I pay for it at the grocery store.  And, the size of the box is the big family size!  Buy it!

GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in this product. They are also made to be resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate, an herbicide, which is linked to birth defects, cancer, organ damage and inflammatory bowel disease.

These GMOs make my family sick. We do not pour pesticides on our food and we no longer eat anything that is an EPA registered pesticide.  GMOs are linked to organ damage, faulty insulin regulation and obesity, autoimmune disease, autism and a whole host of other health and environmental problems. Kellogg has contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California which is spreading lies to convince people that they should vote again GMO Labeling (prop. 37) in California on Nov. 6th because they don't want you to know that Frosted Flakes contain GMOs.

review/summary: great bargain at $10!
review/text: I got the 3-pack of this for $10. In New York where Frosted Flakes sell for $5.50 for the tiniest box, this was a huge bargain.  It looks like the price has gone up a bit, so not sure if it's worth it anymore, but it was definitely a bargain at $10!

review/summary: THEY'RE G R E A T!
review/text: How does anyone NOT like Frosted Flakes?  I know, I know, they're sugary, but if you're hungry for a little somethin' late night, you can not or will not find anything that completes that little naggin' hunger..GOOD STUFF in moderation.
