review/text: This product had the potential to be very good, but unfortunately smells rancid and tastes artificial.  This is in direct contrast to the pure shiitake mushrooms that this producer sells in .67 ounce bags.  Those are ridiculously addictive.

review/text: This product, besides its health-conscious processing, is actually yummy. I've purchased similar products of other organic brands touting their ingredients. To my disappointment, I found other brands much more salty and more greasy. Another difference is that this bag of chips is made of more variety of veggies compared to other similar products I found in my local supermarket. Thus, I'm truly happy to find this veggie chip as the answer to my craving for chips.

review/text: I tried some of the Benson's Gourmet Seasonings recently and the Masterpiece Mediterranean is a beautifully balanced blend and one of my favorites.  Just like described it is great on any variety of ground meat.  Extremely flavorful and if you want a little salty type taste you can add a little of  "Benson's Table Tasty" after serving.  I am very impressed with Benson's and I recommend these seasonings to all my friends and family (many of whom have to cut their salt intake these days).  I no longer miss the salt as all of Benson's seasonings add so much flavor without salt or potassium chloride.

review/text: I've been an avid coffee drinker for many years, but was only exposed to the sub par blends at my office. I was recently over at a friend's place when they introduced me to Kahve's Barcelona blend--now there's no going back. This is exactly what coffee's supposed to taste like: flavorful and bold. I ordered it for myself and now I bring it in a thermos full of it to work. I'd rather microwave my lukewarm Kahve coffee than drink the weak brews I used to suffer through. It's worth every penny!

review/summary: best light decaf
review/text: I am pregnant and have been enjoying a variety of decaf coffees for the last 9 months.  This coffee is the absolute best in decaf for Keurig.  I have tried probably 20+ different flavors and I can say with complete confidence this is my favorite.  I have had the Donut House regular and it is awesome as well.  I've drank it with cream hot and over ice.  Listen--I drink coffee every single day of my life since for like 15 years; I know what I'm talking about. decaf, regular, fresh ground, folgers, french press, hospital cafeteria, peculated, drip, instant, starbucks, dunkin donuts, Caribou, Gloria Jean's, mcdonalds--you name it I've had it.  This machine with this coffee is perfect for a decaf drinker.<br /><br />Decaf can sometimes have an icky taste, this has a coffee house aroma and a smooth taste, not bitter or dirty or chalky.  I highly recommend it.

Then I bought 3 boxes on 8/1 - I haven't had any problems with them yet, either.<br /><br />That's good, because this is by far my favorite decaf.  I hope they get the problems fixed quickly - I'd hate to have to settle for something else.<br /><br />This blend is made by Green Mountain - I think they usually make a quality product.

review/summary: Favorite so far
review/text: I just re-ordered this decaf coffee.  We have tried several decaf varieties looking for that perfect cup.  The Donut House is our reigning favorite.  We had been drinking Donut SHOP decaf and just tried Green Mountain Breakfast Blend decaf.  While both of these coffees are pleasant, neither compares to the Donut House in aroma or flavor.  This coffee is full bodied in taste and very smooth.  We brew it on the 8oz setting and think that is perfect, although we make the next size larger for my mother who likes her's a bit weaker.  We'll probably keep looking for the perfect decaf; this one is excellent.

review/summary: Decaf Coffee
review/text: I wanted to try a decaf coffee for after dinner and found the Donut House Decaf to be very good.  I was a little leery because it was labelled Extra Bold - Light Roast.  Wasn't sure what that label meant - was it going to be very strong (extra bold) or was it going to taste too weak (light roast)?  I don't like real strong coffee or weak coffee, so I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't taste too strong or too weak, as Goldilocks said "it was just right!"  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.

Now I know that I must watch closely and examine each and every one as I load it into my machine to make sure it is what I think it is so I am not so disappointed in the future.  I won't buy from here again.  Someone is responsible for the switch.  I expect to get what I pay for.

review/text: One of the best we have tried and continue to use.  It seems that most of the K cups have very little coffee in them and as a result are very weak...Donut house if very good.  We first tried a Keurig system and took it back because the coffees that came with it, mostly Green Mountain, were no where near as good as our old coffee maker...and we don't make strong coffee.  We then tried a sample of some others at the store and thought to try the Keurig again.  THis time we purchased a decaf sampler kit from Amazon and found that Donut House and Caribu were the best.  We now enjoy our Keurig much better.

review/summary: Really good decaf.
review/text: I'm not big on writing reviews, but since this product has such a wide variety of reviews I thought I'd add my own thoughts.  I was looking for a good, mild decaf coffee for myself and to offer friends in the evening and that is exactly what I received.<br /><br />Does the picture say "extra bold"? Yes, but everything else about the product in the description says that it's a "light roast"...not to mention the scathing 1 star reviews stating that it's not extra bold even though the picture says it is. Take an extra 30 seconds next time and read through the description and maybe some reviews before spending your money. That is a technical error and shouldn't be held against the quality of the actual product in the review.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with the coffee as I do not like dark roasts - so if you are like minded, I believe you will enjoy this coffee, and hey - the price is right, too.  There aren't too many k-cups you can get for around .50/cup.

review/text: BUYERS BEWARE - I guess it's my fault I really thought when I ordered this coffee I was gettinng TWO BOXES of coffee for 22.50 like almost every other coffee dealer on Amazon sells this stuff for. But this guy sells this coffee for 22.50 for ONE!!!!! box of coffee.When it arrived at my house I asked my wife where the other box was and she said: "Thats It just one box arrived!" I looked my order over and sure enough he does sell it for 1 box of coffee for 22.50 making this probably the MOST expensive k-cup coffee on Amazon. So shame on me for not looking the order over before I purchased it. If you look at all the other sellers, their coffee is 23.00 for TWO BOXES OF 25 count k-cups. Thats 50 k-cups. This guy only gives you 25 k-cups for 22.50 which is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!!!!! congratulations you fooled me, but I hope this review warns others off.

review/summary: messy
review/text: The first sample came with my single cup brewer. I liked the taste, but when I removed the k-cup the foil had a huge hole in it. It was awkward and extremely messy. I thought it could have been a bad batch, so I bought a 12 pack of decaf. It was the same. Great taste, but very messy. It still had a huge hole, grounds were in my coffee, and weak foil. Disappointed.

review/summary: Great cup of decaf
review/text: I became aware of Donut House Decaf because Amazon emailed me an ad for it, since I'm a longtime buyer of k-cups.  I'd tried various other varieties of decaf and found them OK but not terribly exciting to the taste buds.<br /><br />Donut House is different, stronger (they mean it when they say Extra Bold)--but not the way espresso or French roast is strong, mellower than that--and more flavorful than the others.  Now I'm a fan, and I hope Amazon keeps carrying it.

review/summary: Nice and smooth flavor
review/text: Saw this in the company office, but it was all gone till I went for a cup.  Bought it hoping I would like it and I am not disappointed.  I think the taste is pretty smooth, and isn't strong, although I do like bold flavored coffees.  All they buy at my work is Green Mountain; this is probably my favorite Green Mountain flavor, and I like it better than Timothy's Original Donut Blend.  I don't understand why the cost is so much; I guess I'll have to make this my "special" coffee for now.  Enjoy.

review/text: I though that everything was fine as the first one I took out of the box matched the illustration exactly.  None of the others matched the illustration.  They do not say "EXTRA BOLD" on the cups at all, but the sticker on the box does actually say extra bold.<br />It's been a while since I tried one of these, so I wasn't sure if they just mislabeled them, decided they weren't "extra bold" to begin with, or they are jsut pranksters.  At any rate, I took off two stars because I suspect that they pulled a fast one at the factory.

review/text: This is not Decaf "Extra Bold". Something is wrong with the computer or the person shipping the product. They have sent Decaf "Light Roast" twice in place of Decaf "Extra Bold". This really needs to be fixed. I sent back the first order. The second order they decided to overnight to me to make up for the mistake. I know the second time it also said Decaf "Light Roast" on the box, but I opened it anyway in hope it was just marked wrong on the outside box and inside would be the correct product. No such luck. I now have coffee I don't want. I'm sure the Decaf Extra Bold is great coffee but if they can't send it I can't try it!!!

review/summary: the ONLY formula we feed our baby!
review/text: We use formula on a supplemental basis and did a ton of research on baby formulas.  Reading the labels on ALL of the other manufacturers' formulas turned my stomach since they primarily consist of corn syrup and vegetable oil (including Earth's Best -which was disappointing). We believe this product contains higher quality ingredients than any other formula. Our baby also has much less spit up with this formula than on any of the other major brands, which we tried before finding this one. Additionally, the company is located in and makes their formulas in the US, which gives us less concern about potential contamination issues. While the products are labeled "Toddler" the nutritional content is the exact same and precisely as all other infant formulas.  It appears that the company labels it "toddler" to encourage breast feeding of infants. Baby's Only is the ONLY formula we feed our baby!

review/summary: Only Soy Formula without Corn Syrup
review/text: When I discovered that the Soy formula I was giving my baby girl was 39% corn syrup, I was really upset.  Thank you NaturesOne for this product - the only soy formula without corn syrup.  Weaning her off the sugar was a little rough and I could tell she was not comfortable.  My physician's office recommended using prune juice, and I would add a little prune juice to her formula (less than .5 ounce).  This seems to help - and she is completely weaned off the corn syrup.  Best of all, she likes the formula.  We use this as a supplement to breast milk.

review/summary: Excellent cereal!
review/text: This cereal is FAR superior than Special K Red Berries. The strawberries in Special K Red Berries get very slimy and disintegrate in milk in no time. It took effort to actually finish a single bowl.<br /><br />In stark contrast, Newman's Own Flakes 'n Strawberries was delicious. The berries held up to the last spoonful, and it really is Sweet Enough. My local grocery stores used to carry it, but I can't find it anywhere anymore. Seriously disappointed. So I'll just order it on Amazon. Yes, it's that good!

review/summary: Newman's Own Flakes 'n Strawberries - YUM!
review/text: This product used to be available at our local, large grocery store chains -- primarily Shaw's and Hannaford. Within the past year or so, I have been unable to purchase this particular variety, although they still carried others such as the Vanilla Almond and the Flax version. Not sure if there was pressure from Special K, which offers a similar but not-quite-as-good product, or not.<br /><br />Nevertheless, because I already get regular shipments of my husband's favorite cereal (McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal Maple & Brown Sugar, also previously available locally but no longer), I searched Amazon to find out if Newman's Own Flakes 'n Strawberries would be available. After a few months, I was notified it had been added and got right on it. The shipment comes in a 5-box pack. As soon as I get down to my last box (It won't be long.) I will sign up for the automatic shipments and save even more money.<br /><br />The cereal itself has a nicely crunchy, slightly sweetened (Remember, it says "Sweet Enough" on the box.) flake, larger and crunchier than the competition's version, and there are more and larger pieces of strawberries. It is, hands down, my favorite dry cereal. Because I always like "more" sweetness, I add some Splenda, but that's only my preference, and it certainly is "sweet enough" for the average cereal eater. I also like the fact that the profits go to charity.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V6A3CE">Newman's Own Flakes'n Strawberries Rice and Wheat Cereal, 12-Ounce (Pack of 5)</a>

review/summary: Mediocre
review/text: I tried some of these from my local grocer, I haven't bought them from Amazon.<br /><br />The flavor was mediocre, but the soup was filling. It was more spicy than sour, I would stay away if you can't handle spicy foods. If you like sour foods you may also be disappointed, as I didn't really taste any sour. It was more tart, like a citrus, than sour like traditional sour soups.<br /><br />A word of caution, there are tags for "gluten free" on here but this contains WHEAT which is a source of gluten. It is right there in the ingredients list, at least at the time of this post. I thought I should mention it as well though.<br /><br />The soup isn't bad, I don't especially recommend it, but that is because there is nothing exciting to recommend. I didn't find it flavorful enough to justify the cost of this versus alternative flavors and brands.

It's hard to find locally, so I order it online and I always have a few jars in my pantry.

It's good on chicken too, though I mostly prefer these thick sweet style sauces for ribs.

review/summary: This has now become a stapple at my workplace
review/text: I am a software engineer, but the worst kind, an extrovert! Well, in comparison with my co-workers, at least. Seeing the world from both sides, I know that a quick way to get an IT person to come out of their shell is with treats. Over the years I've tried many, and this candy has proven itself as the most successful and appreciated.<br /><br />If your co-workers (or whomever the recipient is) cares about their junk food consumption, which my co-workers do, this is a pretty light snack for the amount of flavor it brings. They are called "soft", only in comparison with candy canes. They are solid, but dissolved quickly in the mouth, with tons of flavour.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Wrong quantity listed not 1/2 lb actually 1/4 lb (120 gm)
review/text: I buy this tea often (it is very good) and am aware of three quantities it is sold in: 120 gm (0.25 lb), 227 gm (0.5 lb), 454 gram (1 lb). The description of this item says 1.5 lbs which I have never seen before, so thought it was a typo and was probably 0.5 lb. This was substantiated by another reviewer's experience where they received 0.5 lb instead of 1.5 lbs.  The price for 0.5 lb was a good, not great, but I still opted to buy a quantity of two 0.5 lb tins instead of one 1.0 lb tin from another Amazon vendor. My rational? The price was nearly the same $8.50 for each 0.5 lb tin from this vendor or 17.50 for one 1 lb tin from another vendor. I thought having two tins would preserve the freshness of my 1 lb total Jasmine Tea for a longer time. How surprised was I when this item arrived in the even smaller quantity of 120 grams (1/4 lb). I tried to return it, but the I got stuck in an Amazon do loop. After filling out the return form I was given the message that this product required special handling and must be returned through customer service (link provided).  I clicked the link, filled out the form, but at the end it referred me back to the return processing center (link provided). I clicked the link and it took me back to where I started. I've already proved I'm gullible so it's not unexpected that I thought that some switch was now flipped by the visit to the customer service area that would allow me to use the return processing center... nope. It again required customer service involvement.  I decided not to waste any more time and wrote this review instead.  I'll drink the tea and enjoy it, but I paid more than I needed to. Oh yeah, the packaging was terrible too.

When I saw that I could get four, 12 ounce boxes of Kellog's Rice Krispies for a price lower than two such boxes would cost at local stores, I immediately became a Save & Subscribe customer for this item.

review/summary: RE: MSG concerns
review/text: This is a great product, but I want to address some concern about this product.<br /><br />Amid all this skepticism about MSG I felt I needed to say something. I will cite Wikipedia here -<br /><br />[...]<br />---<br />What it is made from -<br /><br />Monosodium glutamate was once predominantly made from wheat gluten, but is now mostly made from bacterial fermentation; it is acceptable for celiacs following a gluten-free diet.<br /><br />Health concerns -<br /><br />While many people believe that MSG is the cause of these symptoms, a statistical association has not been demonstrated under controlled conditions, even in studies with people who were convinced that they were sensitive to it.<br /><br />In 1993, the FDA proposed adding the phrase "(contains glutamate)" to the common or usual names of certain protein hydrolysates that contain substantial amounts of glutamate. *(This change never went through because, in my opinion there was never enough substantial evidence to prove that MSG is harmful)*<br /><br />In the 2004 version of his book, On Food and Cooking, food scientist Harold McGee states that "[after many studies], toxicologists have concluded that MSG is a harmless ingredient for most people, even in large amounts."<br />---<br /><br />So there you have it; all of this MSG fuss is, for the most part, nonsense.<br /><br />This product does exactly what it claims to do, it makes food (meat namely) taste better.<br /><br />But like with any ingredient in a recipe, don't over do it, moderation is always a good idea (for example, you wouldn't use a handful of salt to make a small batch of cookies)<br /><br />Happy eating!

You can find the same basic components in food items like chicken stock and soy sauce.<br />Five stars for making good food even more delicious!

review/text: Westerners are so silly blaming MSG for all the problems they have.  Just look at Japan, where this thing was discovered.  After all these years using Ajinomoto (MSG), the nation still maintains a healthier population, who lives longer, has less health problems, and are generally thinner.  All those westerners who blame ANYTHING for all their health problems, just stop eating too much of their own crap (pizza, McDonald's, etc., etc.).  Just like anything else, if used judiciously, this thing is totally okay.

review/summary: I LOVE MSG
review/text: MSG (monosodium glutamate), which is the ingredient in Ac'cent has been around since the Japanese invented it about one hundred years ago. I am 61 years of age and my parents and grand-parents used it in place of salt for three generations now. Ac'cent or MSG has 60 per cent less sodium than table salt. I always fill my salt shaker with accent instead of salt. Japanese use MORE of this than any other ethnic group. Look at their longevity and health compared to westerners. My Grandmother who used this in EVERYTHING died at the age of 103 in 1990. Grandfather at 90. Parents both died in their late eighties. I have no health issues. Americans want to eat like hogs, do not excercise and then blame MSG for their ills. BALONEY ! ! ! I take vitamins and minerals, I excercise and I rarely go a day without Ac'cent since I sprinkle it on everything I eat. THANK GOD the maniacs didn't take this great product off the market. They DID succeed in taking cyclamates off the market. It was the BEST sugar substitute on earth. Saccharin was NEVER dangerous and the govt has now stopped making manufacturers put that erroneous cancer warning on the label. The Sugar lobby paid for EVERY study done on artificial sweeteners. They destroyed cyclamates spending a fortune to do so with false allegations. They spent BILLIONS against saccharin and all the others that came later, but they finally gave up. LONG LIVE MSG! it is the BEST flavor enhancer in the world!

review/text: This is a huge canister. It is too tall to put in my kitchen cupboards so I put some in a smaller seasoning shaker to make it easier to handle and so the shaker would fit in my cupboards and put this one on some shelves I have for things that don't fit in my cupboards. I love the flavor enhancement Accent gives food. I don't add very much. There really isn't any need to because even a small amount helps. It doesn't add to the saltiness in food either. I have never been afraid of using MSG because of the fact that you don't need to add a lot. This will probably last me quite awhile. But I will get it from here again. It was delivered rather quickly and well packaged. Thanks Amazon

review/text: The product was wxcellent-- and especially helpful to get, especially because,for soe reason, the local stores were either out of the prduct or were not stocking it-- I don't know why. Another helpful feature-- you can obtain these products as individual items, whereas the grocery stores (like the local Safeway) will only supply if you order $50+ at one time! The only disadvantage-- the S & H is sometimes orihibitive, addin 50% or even 100% to item cost. Also, the local Post Office or the Apt Mgr's office can be uncooperative-- in a couple of cases, I was informed that the item had been sent back because no one had come to pick it up ! You need to take structer action, possibly fines or penalties, to prevent this kind of abuse; this is not Amazon's fault, but a problem nevertheless for your customers.

review/text: Each and every flavor of Loacker's Quadratinis I have tasted are delicious, but this one takes the cake...or should I say, Tiramisu.  These heavenly little bites of wafer and cream really do have the flavor of Tiramisu- that creamy declicious Italian dessert.  The creme has a sweet light coffee flavor with vanilla and chocolate undertones, and maybe even a hint of amaretto rounding it out.  The creme filling is always the right consistency, and the wafers are always crisp, never stale or soggy in texture.  Additionally, by purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, you get a much better per package rate than buying them from a specialty store.  Finally, Quadratini stands for four layers (of creme and wafer), so add these many details to the fact that these cookies are in the form of a cute little cube, and there's no way you can resist these delightful and delicious treats from Italy.

It is also very forgiving if you add too much.  I've been using this in cooking and have recently moved the "tub" to the kitchen table.  I'm thinking of buying a salt spoon.<br /><br />I like this better than a shaker since I can really see how much salt I am using.  In this sense, I am able to keep my salt intake to a minimum.
