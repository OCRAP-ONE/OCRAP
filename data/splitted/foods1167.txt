review/text: Price is for an unknown weight of these nuts?  Maybe the people who think the public is soft-headed.<br /><br />Look at the spec above and you will see "one pound" shipping weight.  Hmmm - but what is the weight of the nuts?  Unknown.  Not stated. Blank.  Yikes.<br /><br />Shape up nut sellers: we wont buy a pig in a poke.

review/summary: Salsa of the Month was Great!
review/text: I just received The Salsa of the Month Club package and everything was great!  I was excited to try two new salsas from different specialty companies that I would've never been able to try.  They arrived in a sturdy box with foam packing peanuts.  I admit that I was a little nervous that they wouldn't arrive safely, but the glass jars were completely fine.  They were even accompanied by a newsletter giving some background about the salsas and the companies who made them.  They both looked so good, it was hard to decide which one to open first!  My wife and I decided to open the Pink's Mild Salsa from Pennsylvania to accompany our fajitas that we were making for dinner.  It was bold, fresh and made with minimal ingredients and also contained no allergens.  Medically, my wife has to follow a Gluten Free diet, so we are always concerned with allergens and trying to eat foods closer to nature.  A few days later we opened the second salsa (after scraping the first jar dry) and were equally impressed!  The second jar was a Picante Salsa from Hillside Orchard farms in Georgia and was very flavorful and had some visibly large cilantro pieces (my favorite), but was not as chunky as the other one.  This one was great to pour over tacos, as it had more of a sauce consistency, but it was a little harder to pick up with a chip.  Overall, I was very satisfied and I'm looking forward to next month's salsas!  This was the perfect gift for us and would highly recommend the Salsa of the Month Club!

And then I had to Google and see I wasn't alone.  Some website said it best when they said: "it was Yabba-Dabba-Eww!

review/text: After reading how horrible this cereal was, I just had to try this nastiness.. After buying the box immediately my nose was gasping for fresh air.. The Rancid toxic scent from this beautiful box destroyed my sense of smell.. now with no sense of smell, I decided that I was still going to eat this stuff.. Started eating the cereal and realized that it wasn't as bad as the smell..(I was unable to finish eating it) here is my own ranking for the cereal that describes it best. ranking 1-10:  SMELL: -127, Taste: -6, Texture: 7, Cost: 7, After Taste: 2..... Hope you find this helpful and keep an eye out for this amazing cereal! Also it has been known that this Cereal taste ten times better and smells amazing if your eating it while wearing a Three Wolf Moon Shirt.. this study has yet to be tested by myself!  Thanks for reading!

review/summary: It works - I think...
review/text: Got about 5 boxes of this stuff: 2 from Amazon, and the rest from the local Home Depot as they are cheaper. (sometimes it pays to check local store before, not after Amazon...)<br /><br />Got them in the ground close to the roots of my 60 Green Giant Arborvitae this spring. They grew very well the whole summer (and we had a drought and we didn't really water them). Also, the grass around the spikes got so denser and greener, I am thinking about grinding this stuff and spread it in my whole yard :)<br /><br />Ah, don't follow the instructions to get it in the ground: the spike will crack or brake if you hammer it directly (they include a plastic thingamagic but it is pretty useless). Instead use a 1x2 wooden spike, or a pry bar, hammer one of these and then insert the fertilizer spike in the hole. I drew a line on the 1x2 to give me the proper depth, and hammered it in. 60 of these puppies went in without a hitch (other than having to change the wooden spike a couple of times - hey there is so much beating one can take).<br /><br />The problem is having to buy 5 more boxes in the fall and start it all over again... It never ends...

Didn't hurt - I know that for sure!<br /><br />fyi, I used a 2x2 stake and pounded it into the ground to create a hole first, then dropped the spike into that. Otherwise, the spike gets pulverized trying to drive it in by itself, with that silly little plastic cap on it.

review/summary: things you should know
review/text: My dog is a finicky eater and in the stores when I bought the packets that come 4 flavors to a box, my dog loved the chicken and the turkey but none of the other flavors so buying just one box full of the flavor he liked seemed perfect. However, I had not fully read the ingredients before making the purchase. The good part is that it is all meat with no grains and my dog seems to have an allergy to many things which makes him finicky. BUT it has onion powder and garlic powder. Now these may make it taste better and the dog seems to enjoy but it also causes damage to his already weakened liver. Had I read the ingredients fully before even as finicky eater I would not have purchased because I know onion in any form is very dangerous to little dogs. Garlic not much better but worse for one with weakened liver already. So after having a package or two of his favs, he got sicker and has gastritis terrible..  had to go to vet and is still recovering so won't be using the rest of the packages.<br /><br />Read full ingredients before giving anything to your little guy and be sure he's able to digest these products.<br /><br />Now I just buy ground turkey and ground chicken, or whole, cook it up myself and give it to my little guy making certain there is nothing in the food that can cause him severe illness.

review/summary: Too much alfalfa?
review/text: We've tried several base mixes for our dogs' raw diet, and this one was one of the easiest to work with--the preparation steps couldn't be easier, and the wait time before serving is the shortest I've encountered yet. I also liked the packaging; it was very easy to store and didn't take up much space. However, our dogs weren't crazy about its smell and taste. It smells overwhelmingly like alfalfa and fruit, even after we mixed in the meat and some chicken broth to cut the odor. One of our dogs flat out refused to eat it. The other picked around the mixture or spit it out as he was eating his meat. I wanted to like this product, but the other flavors that had meat included (and less alfalfa) seemed much more palatable to our pups.

review/summary: First K-Cup coffee I loved.
review/text: A year ago, my dad received a Keurig for Christmas, and with it the K-Cup variety pack. I tried a couple coffee brands without milk and sugar, and this was the one that really caught my taste buds' attention. It's very mild, borderline light-bodied, with a subtle flavor and not too bitter. It doesn't taste like you're chewing on beans, but it's not watered down like some sub-standard brands you find in stores (I'm looking at you Folgers 10lbs jug of "ground").<br /><br />A few months later, a co-worker brought a Keurig to work and offered access to it. I purchased packs of Green Mountain Nantucket Blend the same day and enjoyed 48 cups of it, dreaming of the day I may have a Keurig at home. That has happened now, and I've got this on subscription.<br /><br />Strongly recommend if you are a fan of light-bodied coffee. One of the best K-Cups you'll find in that category.

It is slightly stronger than coffee people coffee shop but has a richer and more flavorful taste.  Not bitter at all, but if you like lighter roasts then you probably will not like this.  I think it tastes best using the 7-8 ounce setting.  This reminds of when I dine out and they have such good coffee but either they don't know or won't tell you what kind it is.  Love it!

review/summary: A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee...
review/text: When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors.  Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.  I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee.  We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least.  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee.  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried).  I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods.  Almost.  All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.  When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!

review/summary: Nantucket is my favorite
review/text: So far I've had no problems ordering this product and receiving it as promised. I am a Nantucket lover and occasionally will buy a specialty/seasonal flavor on the side.Green Mountain is extremely expensive at most local stores! I've been buying bulk online for years. (I'm a coffee-holic) I suggest buying/trying a sample at your local store. (some even will let you brew a free cup!) Then, you can decide where your taste takes you! Happy sipping!

review/text: This is a very good deal. The coffee goes without saying. A perfect cup every time.  I have had a Keurig for a few years now, and to me there is nothing out there that can touch it. A fabulous, fresh cup every time. I never go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks anymore.<br /><br />The offer is a good one. I bought 5 boxes of 24 for $10.95 each and shipping was free! I saw another review where the guy said this was "high" compared to prices locally. I have yet to find the same deal locally. Supermarkets rob you for 12 pods and Bed, Bath and Beyond gives you 16 or 18 for $9.99 at last check (and it could have gone up) as coffee has gone up. I also used to get the same coffee at the same price a couple of years ago at "CoffeeforLess.com. Their prices have increased dramatically recently. I don't see where there are any better values around online or locally.

review/text: Some people like a strong cup of coffee that kicks them in the mouth first thing in the morning, but I don't, so I tried one classified light roast, which was a little too weak for me. I tried Nantucket Blend, and it is perfect! It's not weak at all and had a really delicious flavor to it, what I think a good cup of coffee should taste like. It is so smooth, not a single negative thing about it except that now I go through it so quickly!<br />This is my favorite one so far, and has become my morning drink every day!<br />If you like coffee and are looking for a not too strong, not too weak blend give this a try!

review/summary: Delicious medium-roast blend with complex tones
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:30 Mins<br /><br /></span>The name belies an intoxicating medium-roast blend that fuses flavors from Central America, Indonesia and East Africa. The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands. Is it worth the additional price? Yes, but keep an eye out for sales.<br /><br />Added bonuses:<br />Nantucket Blend is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is Fair Trade Certified.<br />Green Mountain Coffee is organic.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here's my recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYUE6G">Green Mountain Coffee Lake & Lodge Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C4YIFE">Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>

I don't like too strong a coffee but this was way underpowered for coffee.  I enjoy the bolder coffees, too, such as Coffee People Organic Bold and Dark Magic.  I would not buy Nantucket again.

review/summary: Underroasted and weak but not sour
review/text: We got a box of this along with our Keurig brewer from Costco. We have three coffee drinkers in the house and all of us are fond of strong, dark-roasted coffee.  This blend is underroasted and weak.  The one good point is that it isn't as sour as most cinnamon roasts are.  We ended up throwing out half the box because I couldn't get anybody to drink it.<br /><br />If you're a fan of very mild medium-roasts you'll probably enjoy this.  If you like coffee strong and dark with some body to it you'll hate it.

review/summary: A good price If you cannot buy local
review/text: Buying K-Cups appears to take more math & literacy skills than most people seem to have.  People keep comparing the price of different boxes without accounting for the cup-count.  The trick is to comparison shop the price per-Kcup because the boxes vary from 18 count boxes to 24 count boxes...eight more cups makes a difference.  This a a fair deal in my opinion since you get two 24 count boxes, and it is shipped to your door.

review/text: I really like Nantucket Blend.  I drink way too much!  So I thought I would buy the 96 ct. pack.  What a mistake.  I ordered 2 weeks ago, but the product has not arrived.  I checked my Amazon account and it said the product would ship between July and August.  Three to four months for shipping?  How very ridiculous.  I must say that this is my fault.  It clearly says that in the product listing.  However, I usually get everything I order from Amazon.com within a couple or three days, so I didn't even think to look.  Buy this coffee from another vendor, please.

review/summary: Poor coffee , Nothing to do with Nantucket, named wrong
review/text: The Ingredients aren't from Nantucket, the blend is not smooth. Too heavy  or something maybe too much arabica.<br /><br />then today I learn Green Mountain Coffee is involved with this:<br />Burlington, Vermont - October 25, 2010<br /><br />Could a routine inquiry into accounting practices at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters lead to an insider trading investigation? A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.<br /><br />The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's "revenue recognition practices." And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.<br /><br />A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.<br /><br />Not recommending this at all. Try the Donut Shop Kuerig Coffee its a lot better blend..

review/summary: A very nice, full flavored medium roast coffee
review/text: I prefer deep, dark roasted coffees but many people don't.  My mother used standard household blends such as Folger's for many years.  When she received her Keuring machine she started to experiment with other brands and blends.  She occasionally drinks a flavored coffee but this has become her favorite.  I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:<br /><br />The body (or "mouth-feel") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium-low so it won't have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a "Starbucks-type" of coffee too strong or bitter.  If you, like my mother, enjoy a "regular" blend I don't think that it get's better than this.

review/text: The box says it's "one of the most sophisticated blends you'll ever enjoy. Borrowing berry flavors from African beans, a full body from Indonesian beans, and a subtle smokiness from a touch of French Roast, this blend represents a spectacular tapestry of flavors carefully woven together."  It's still a smooth tasting coffee even with all of those descripters.  This coffee actually brings together 4 different coffees from 3 different continents.<br /><br />Actually, this coffee would be for someone who likes a smooth cup of coffee, it's comparable to Folger's medium roast.  You can still add your french vanilla creamer and sweeteners with no problem.  It doesn't cause the coffee to go bitter.  It wouldn't disappoint the avid coffee drinker nor shun the occasional java drinker either. Overall, it's a nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: My favorite coffee K-cup so far
review/text: I first tried this brand and blend as part of a k-cup sampler pack. I was immediately in love with this k-cup! It's my very favorite so far. My personal preference for coffee is a nice bodied medium roast, and this more than fits the bill. It has the smoothest taste of the 6 or 7 medium roasts/breakfast blends that I have tried so far. If you like high octane, this is not going to be your favorite k-cup, but you would certainly enjoy it as a nice change of pace every now and then. My benchmark for a good k-cup is that I can use the large (9oz) setting on my Keurig and still get a cup of real coffee, not coffee flavored water. This passes the test with flying colors. If I need a kick in the pants to get out the door in the morning, I drop down to the 7oz setting for a slightly stronger brew. I like the fact that the taste remains smooth, even if I make it a little stronger. I give this k-cup an A+!

review/text: I recently purchased the Keurig B-60 Special Edition Brewer from Amazon.  It came with a sample variety pack of 12 different K-cup blends (note no light blends included).  I tried all of them and found this particular blend to be the best to my liking although I do prefer a light blend.  It has a nice coffee aroma (like one you would smell at a good restaurant but can't produce at home) and surprised me by tasting as good as it smelled.  It is a medium blend and tastes relatively smooth without an excessively strong or acidic aftertaste.  Recommend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer a  medium blend coffee.  I recently found the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend available at my local Walmart and plan to write a review on it.

review/text: I was recently given the top of the line Keurig single cup coffee maker from Costco that came with a lot of different flavors to test out.  This Nantucket blend was easily the best of the bunch.  It truly is a great tasting coffee and I can't believe it comes out of my Keurig.<br /><br />Now I do drink a cup of coffee every day and I'm not fond of the waste that this product produces so I actually have one of these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">ekobrew Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> and grind my own coffee.  It's cheaper and better for the environment and it's what I use for myself.  However, the fine dust does pass through the filter so I don't like to give it to guests.  I don't mind the dust though that settles at the bottom of the cup and for being much cheaper I don't mind.<br /><br />These cups though I save for my guests so that they can get a great cup of coffee without any of the dust.  And they all love this coffee.

review/summary: Too Weak for Me; Turns White After Adding Cream
review/text: I've had to hunt far and wide to find the right K-cups for me.  Generally, I like coffee people donut shop, and that had been my go to coffee for a while.  The dark bold coffees are way too intense for me, but the mediums are generally way too weak.  Wanting to try something new, I followed the reviews and tried this coffee thinking it would be a good strong but-not-too-strong alternative.<br /><br />It wasn't.  If I use two pods, this is a decent, but weaker, coffee for me to use in my travel cup for the ride into work.  Otherwise, it is much too weak.  I was very surprised that the first time I brewed some and poured in half and half, the coffee turned very light brown.  It was almost white.  I will get through this package, but I will not buy again.  It's not cost effective for me to use two pods to be satisfied.  Any other suggestions?

The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands. Is it worth the additional price?
