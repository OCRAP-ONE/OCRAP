review/summary: Decent sweetness, lingering aftertaste
review/text: I'm using this to sweeten coffee; previously I used Truvia but decided to give SweetLeaf a shot.<br /><br />While I'm drinking, this tastes fine. It adds the requisite amount of sweetness and the coffee goes down nicely. But within a few seconds of finishing my cup of coffee, I'm left with an unpleasant strong bitter aftertaste that lingers for 10-15 minutes unless I rinse out my mouth with water. Truvia had a slight aftertaste but nowhere near as strong as this and nowhere near as lasting. I'll be switching back once I finish the SweetLeaf I already paid for.<br /><br />One thing that's worth noting: Ability to taste certain kinds of bitterness varies from person to person due to genetic factors. For example, some people find grapefruit intolerably bitter while to others it is pleasant; the former have receptors on their tongues that are sensitive to a specific chemical in the fruit, while the latter don't. It is entirely possible that the people giving this product positive reviews truly don't experience the aftertaste I'm talking about. So while this is definitely not the product for me, it may be worth giving it a try to test your own reaction.

review/summary: Very Good Stevia Product
review/text: I've tried the fake stevias...Truvia, PureVia, Sun Crystals...the latter is now discontinued and the former two are chemical-tasting and bitter.<br /><br />I've tried NOW (the one with silica) which is OK, but still has a semi-chemical taste.<br /><br />I've tried Whole Food's 365 liquid stevia, which has alcohol in it and therefore doesn't mix well in my coffee or tea, but which works great mixed into plain yogurt to make it sweet without too much of a weird taste.<br /><br />SweetLeaf is an excellent product, containing only inulin and stevia...but it does take 2 packets to equal the sweetness of 4 teaspoons of sugar in my 12 oz of black English tea. So yeah, you do have to use more of this product--but it has an excellent flavor without too much chemical aftertaste.<br /><br />Simply Stevia, the one and only product that has JUST stevia and nothing else--is super-sweet and super-condensed... but in the packet form, it's hard to mess up and use too much. The flavor is very good, very little aftertaste--but you have to find the right amount for each beverage--it takes more to sweeten coffee and less to sweeten my tea, for example. But it is very good overall, and I'd say you can't go wrong with Simply Stevia or SweetLeaf.<br /><br />Finally...visit SweetLeaf's website to find out about the history of the company and how they produce SweetLeaf...they use a water extraction process and are environmentally concerned, which is always nice to know.

review/summary: The stevia product I had been waiting years for!
review/text: I've tried a number of stevia products, and all of them had a nasty aftertaste. Not SweetLeaf, though. So far I've only used it to sweeten my coffee, but the result is absolutely pure sweetness. I couldn't ask for a better taste. Now, granted sugar sets a standard, but sugar has a taste that comes additive to sweetness; SweetLeaf has a bit of an additive taste to it, too, and it ain't sugar, but neither is it something horribly bitter like some of the other stevia products.<br /><br />I particularly love the fact that SweetLeaf is the real deal. Unlike, say, Truvia, which is a proprietary blend and a misnomer, SweetLeaf is pure stevia.

review/summary: Tastes ok, does not dissolve well, contains inulin, which is FIBER
review/text: I like the fact that this Stevia had no additives such as maltodextrin; however, it does have inulin, which is fiber. The fiber STRONGLY disagreed with my body and caused me severe abdominal cramping that lasted for days before I finally figured out the cause. Once I stopped using this stevia, the cramping subsided.  They REALLY need to cut back on the inulin or completely remove it all together and just give us stevia, which is what we want and pay for anyway. Now I'm stuck with two full boxes and part of a 3rd because it's made me soooooooo sick. I'm really saddened about this because I do have chemical sensitivities and have to be careful with all types of products, but I never dreamed that this would make me so sick.<br />I'm sure that I'm the 000.1% in the world that this has ever happened to, so don't be afraid of it. I would like to add, though, as well that this stevia did not dissolve for me, not in hot and not in cold. I had just little round balls of stevia (or maybe it was the inulin/fiber, who knows??) but I will definitely not buy it again.<br />I just want STEVIA. Why can't I find Stevia WITHOUT something added to it?? Especially when it's so expensive. I give up on the grocery and Amazon type markets and I'm going the whole food / organic supplement route this time.

review/summary: Best non-sugar sweetener
review/text: Stevia is a safe alternative to aspartame (NutraSweet) and sucralose (Splenda). SweetLeaf is one of the only 100% stevia products available--no fillers. Truvia, according to The Guardian newspaper, requires "... a 42-step procedure to derive Rebiana from the stevia leaves, using such country chemicals as acetone, methanol, acetonitrile, isopropanol, tert-butanol ..." (Wikipedia).<br /><br />I do not find SweetLeaf stevia bitter even if I use 2-3 packets. It mixes well with liquids and yogurt. The price is fabulous. There are also flavored liquid stevia by SweetLeaf that are delicious. I will definitely be buying more.

review/summary: Does not dissolve in drinks
review/text: I had great hopes for this product.  Unfortunately, the inulin soluble fiber that is used as "filler" does not dissolve in drinks, such as iced tea.  You can try shaking and shaking, but the stuff just won't dissolve.  It reminds me of those snow globes that used to be popular, with the little flecks of white floating down like snow on a pastoral scene.  Letting the drink sit for 2 hours still does not do the trick.  This stuff still can be found at the bottom of your drink.<br /><br />What's worse is that the manufacturer did not care. I called them to complain, and they simply replied, "OK, we'll report this to blah blah blah."  They never bothered to send me a refund, or to offer me coupons for some other product, or ask that I send them samples of the product, like most companies do when you report a complaint with their products.

review/summary: Yes.  It taste different.
review/text: I have been using Equal and more recently Splenda, as my sweeteners of choice for many years.  We use it in coffee, tea and on cereals primarily.  My doctor suggested getting away from those artificial sweetners and suggested we try Stevia instead.  We did, and as others have suggested.....it does taste different!  Not sure I would call it an after taste, but different none the less.  It is not a bad taste necessarily, but just differnt.  The effect differs based on what you use it for.  My suggestion would to be to try a small order first to see how you like it, and whether you can live with the change in taste.<br /><br />Addendum Januray 2012:  I am no longer using the Stevia for my coffee or tea.  However, I find that I do not notice the after taste when used on solid foods like my oatmeal or breakfast cereal.  FYI, I find that I need to use three packets of Stevia to obtain the same sweetness of two packets of Splenda.  Also, because this is a fine powder rather than granules, it is more difficult to use.  The packets are made of a sturdy paper product and it is difficult to open it without losing some of the powdery sweetener on your hand, the countertop or in the air.

review/summary: To describe it's taste...
review/text: This product DOES do what it says (sweeten) but it doesn't sweeten in the way sugar would. It's like a weird chalky salty-sweet taste which definitely does leave an aftertaste. If you are very particular about how your tea tastes, not sure if this CAN be a good substitute to sugar. For me it was definitely noticeable. Is it tolerable? Perhaps if you want to want to live a healthier lifestyle by avoiding sugar. If I didn't care I'd definitely pick some raw sugar over this ANY day. It's not too bad. It's a bit expensive though. It takes me two packs to get a decent amount of sweetness in, so if you drink a lot of tea or even coffee through out the day, everyday, a box of 70 will definitely not be lasting.

Fell in love with it.  Natural fiber & great sugar replacement.  Being a diabetic I didn't want to spend the rest of my life using chemicals that call themselves sugar.  Stevia came just in time & I have been using it ever since.  It is expensive but found it on Amazon cheaper.  I am a "happy" camper now, don't go anywhere without it.  I even buy extra boxes & keep them in my car & at my kids homes.  I also use the liquid stevia~great in ice teas, anything cold.

This is by far the best I have come across.<br /><br />It is quality produced in that there are no fillers and only pure water is used in the extraction process. It is NOT GMO grown (like Truvia is).  It is VERY sweet! When it says a small packet of the fine powder is equal to 2 teaspoons of sugar....you better believe it! I use about one half a packet to 8 oz of coffee.<br /><br />There is no after taste and the sweetness does taste "natural", to me anyway.<br /><br />This is my sweetener from now on.......I was using NOW xylitol, which is good, but I can't get used to eating something made from corn husks.

review/text: We were using SunCrystals without complaint however they became unavailable on the Subscribe & Save program.  Amazon suggested Sweetleaf as an alternative to continue on the subscription plan and we were hesitant because we had tried other Stevia brands (Truvia) and didn't care for them.  The Sweetleaf is actually pretty good with no after taste we can detect.  My husband ran taste trials (we use it mostly in coffee) and asked if I could tell if it was Sweetleaf or SunCrystals when he made coffee and I typically was not able to tell the difference.

review/text: This is one of my subscription products that I use faithfully everyday. Excellent quality, handy packets, easy to use and healthful as a sugar replacement. It has helped me cut down on my sugar intake which has made me more healthy and alert. This is not a sugar substitute. This is a natural product and I recommend this highly to anyone who loves sweetness without the negative side effects. I feel safe in using SweetLeaf Sweetener because it is absent of those dangerous chemicals that other products designed as sugar substitutes contain. I find that for my one or two cups of coffee a day that the 3-Pack last about three months or thereabouts. I use one packet for each cup. I kept track of my use from the first order so that I'm not stocking up on unnecessary items then having to change my subscription order... however, Amazon is so great! You can change your shipment dates at any time without any fuss and they verify each change and order so that you know exactly what you're receiving and when. THANKS AMAZON!!!

review/summary: Clumps:  Does not Dissolve in Liquids
review/text: Had high hopes for this product, but am very disappointed.  The relative dietary pros and cons of the inulin fiber are a separate issue, but this product does not dissolve in liquids, as others have noted.<br /><br />But I need to add that it is not just in cold drinks, but ANY drink, including hot coffee and tea.  I'll post pictures, but with coffee, you'll get huge solid clumps at the bottom of your cup, no matter how hot the water and no matter how aggressively you stir.  With cold drinks, like ice tea and lemonade, I can see the clumps swishing around in my Naglene bottle -- just like a snow globe as someone else wrote -- and all the vigorous shaking in the world does nothing to break them up. This causes you to use more of the product than you should and you're in for an awful, unpleasant surprise if you accidentally drink one of the clumps.<br /><br />This product may be ok to use on oatmeal or cereal, but not liquids.  I am very happy with the SweetLeaf tabs, however, which seem to dissolve well -- probably due to the lack of inulin fiber.

But at least it doesn't have that funky taste some stevia sweeteners have.  I guess you can just stir a while longer to get rid of the clumps.  That's what I'll be doing.  But I may switch to Pure Via next time - it melts easier and doesn't make your drink taste funny.  I tried this product because my priorites were:  1. The least amount of calories and "junk" ingredients; 2. Taste good; 3. Melts easy.  Now, I'll rearrange my priorities to: 1. Must taste good; 2. Must melt easy; 3. Less calories than sugar - who cares about the junk ingredients. I don't use THAT much of it, anyway.

review/summary: Messy!!!
review/text: The cost of this item was great(I thought). The problem I had though, was when I opened the shipping box I had Powered Stevia ALL OVER. I thought that maybe it was just a couple packs leaked. NO!!! So far, 2 out of 3 boxes had at least 15 of the packs miss cut, therefor they were not sealed. It's like they were misfits! Had to wipe each packet, and so now the cost REALLY WASN"T THAT GREAT!!! I would have sent them back, but I really needed them.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I ordered this on a subscription basis from Amazon -- they send me a couple of boxes every two months. I originally purchased it because I'm trying to get away from the sucralose, etc. chemical products. This fits the bill, more natural than the alternatives.<br /><br />I have a nagging question on price though. This product comes in a smaller package than Splenda and the rest of the sugar substitutes. Plus, it's a more powdery formulation so I have to use more packets than I do when using the other sugar substitutes.<br /><br />Since I'm an avid price-comparer these two facts make SweetLeaf's price difficult to compare. I have a feeling I'm paying a lot more than I should be for it, so I'm cancelling my subscription and purchasing liquid Stevia at Whole Foods.<br /><br />If price doesn't matter, there is certainly nothing wrong with this product.

All the water is taken<br />out of the peanut butter and you just add the water back<br />and stir until smooth.  If you are traveling it is wonderful<br />to pack in your case.

review/summary: Healthy mom vs. junk food lover mom
review/text: There are two ways to look at this peanut butter:  Taste vs. health food value.  Let's be real, we all know that most of us want to be healthy on the inside, but that we struggle with it because things that are healthy don't hit those fat cells the way the smoothy and crunchy do.  So, I reluctantly grabbed some of this PB2, because I will not be without peanut butter.  It's not going to happen.<br /><br />The lazy person in me balked at having to mix my peanut butter.  I know, it's a stretch for most of us to do more steps than to just take the spoon and put it into the peanut butter and slather it onto something heavenly, but I took 2 scoops of this and 1 scoop of water (I think it's tablespoons but double check the back and use a fork to whip it into peanut butter.  I'll be honest that the 2:1 ratio didn't work for me.  I like my peanut butter a little smoother so I added a dab (that's the scientific term) of extra water and had mine a little smoother.<br /><br />A couple of things I noticed:  The taste was wonderful and you sometimes get little dry spots if you don't mix well.  For 85% less fat and calories, it is a good trade off for me.  I did try it in oatmeal and I like that as well.

review/text: This order reached me quickly.<br /><br />I opened up the box to see two packages of the box in the same package. In hindsight, knowing that the seller had the same facility in my state, I shouldn't have bothered to get it delivered overnight.<br /><br />Onto the tea... they were simply thrown into the box as mentioned by someone else. I should've taken this as a warning not to purchase it, as it was not well packaged much like other teabags delivered to me. After I tried the tea, I found the taste to be weak, and the contents of the teabag often coming out of the teabags themselves even though they were not torn either way.<br /><br />Leads me to think that the QA on this isn't very good. Again, in hindsight, I shouldn't have gotten a 100-count box. Ah well. I don't think I'll purchase this particular product again, and I'll more than likely give the second tea box away to someone else.

review/text: I had this tea in my cart for awhile and then it became unavailable, so I waited for it to come back in stock as this sounded like a nice tea.<br /><br />I have been enjoyed the Celestial Seasonings White Tea with Pear that I got on Amazon and so I anxioulsy anticipated this new tea.<br /><br />However, in drinking it, I'm not all that crazy about it. To me, it tastes like a black tea; I hardly taste the ginger at all, and it's not as pepperminty as I thought it would be.<br /><br />I realize tastes are just so personal, but that's how I view it anyway.<br /><br />Oh, you should know that it comes in a regular box (as pictured) and not in a tea box at all. So, you will want a cannister, tea tin, or something to put it in.<br /><br />In the meantime, I do like the White Tea with Pear..

The box doesn't come in a box, how awesome is that?! Also, no more fighting with the plastic wrap and filling your recycling bin with hundreds of flimsy little Stash boxes.<br /><br />The tea itself is delicious. Very earthy, clean and slightly grassy. It reminds me of the green tea you get in real Japanese restaurants, but a bit less grassy (which I like).<br /><br />Decaf is perfect if you want hot tea during the evening.

True to other reviews that they were all just kind of stuffed in the box in an unorganized way, but that doesn't effect the tea at all.  Would buy more in the future, if I need to make more favors.

review/summary: GREAT tasting tea!!
review/text: I LOVE Stash tea! My favorite is the fusion green and white tea though. I bought the box of tea cause it was a GREAT price for such a large quantity. I'm very happy with the purchase, and recommend trying Stash tea to anyone. I also LOVE doing business with Amazon cause they always have great low prices. I recommend Amazon.com to all as well.

review/text: This is my favorite bagged tea, with a little half and half and a couple sugars this tea makes a strong, authentic Indian spiced chai.  I use this as an alternative when I can't have my own homemade chai mix.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This tea is one of my favorites.  It has a clean, subtle, delicious flavor very similar to the Stash White Decaf Lemon, but unlike the lemon it's lemongrass free, which can be important for people with grass allergies.<br /><br />Three warnings for this tea:<br /><br />1.  If you like strong tea, you're in the wrong place.  This is a subtle white.  I find it delicious, but many of my friends want a stronger flavor.  I think this is comparable to flavored water in the intensity of the flavor, though it would be unfair to compare this to the fake chemical flavor of a propel water bottle!<br /><br />2.  It's a white tea.  It steeps FAST.  If you'd like more flavor, choose another tea or put in 2-3 teabags.  This tea will not always forgive a long steep and can become very bitter if left too long.<br /><br />3.  It's not a very good iced tea.  It tastes like it would be lovely, but the flavor oil leaves a film on the top that I find unappetizing.<br /><br />Enjoy your tea!

review/summary: Great tea, just a touch too light
review/text: I purchased this because I wanted a decaf white tea that had some flavor to it.  I normally don't enjoy fruit flavored teas.  This one is a great flavor, but I have noticed it needs to steep longer to get enough flavor out of it.  The raspberry is a little too subtle.<br /><br />The outer package is the pictured cardboard box, but the tea bags are individually wrapped in air tight packets (the small white packet shown with the box) which are pretty enough for display or gift baskets. If you aren't sure about buying 100 at a time, look for a sample package on Amazon or elsewhere (though the Amazon prices are impressive compared to other ones I've seen).<br /><br />If you are interested in a full-flavor tea, I highly recommend Stash's White Christmas Tea.

review/summary: Incredible Chocolate tea!  Hershey's anyone?
review/text: I tell everyone I know to buy this tea.  It's the ONLY chocolate tea I've found that actually tastes like chocolate!  It's not overwhelming and although I'm not normally a fan of hazelnut, it really only serves to act as a flavor enhancer to the chocolate.  It's just awesome, hands down, not weak either, although it is decaf.  The price here is a bit high - you can get this in the store that begins and ends with a t here in the States for about two dollars and a quarter for the 18 bag size.  Great, incredible stuff, I'm almost out again!  Highly, highly recommend!

review/text: I love, love, love this tea.  Generally, I don't like chai teas; they are too harsh of a taste for me.  To me, the taste is similar to Good Earth's original blend, a gentle spiced tea with tastes like cinnamon and nutmeg.  I have drunk this one for quite awhile since I discovered Stash teas after going on vacation in Oregon (where they are based).  So, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and even be able to automatically order it. Keep carrying it, Amazon!

review/text: I first tried this tea when my local grocery store had it at Christmas time. I went back and bought a ton of it because it immediately became my favorite tea. I love the peppermint & ginger and I love the fresh new bud taste of white tea, over green tea leaves (Same plant, different part). This tea has it all. Mildly spicy, and smooth yet refreshing. I practically live on herbal teas and have tried lots of different ones. This is my number one all time favorite!

review/summary: TOTALLY MISLEADING
review/text: Totally misleading; where do i begin.<br /><br />It is not GOJI BERRY like the heading implies; rather, it is goji flavor. Furthermore; it has lots of other ingredients although the title leads you to believe otherwise.<br /><br />It has raspberry leaf, hibiscus, strawberry FLAVOR, licorice powder... a very complex blend in my opinion; considering they lead you to believe it is: GOJI BERRY, MATCHA and GREEN TEA.<br /><br />Goji berries are full of nutrients and antioxidants. WHAT THE HECK IS "GOJI FLAVOR" and why does the heading on the front of the teabag state it is goji berry when it is not?<br /><br />WAY TOO SWEET in addition. A true mislead and disappointment. Shame on them.<br /><br />How can they have the audacity to call the teabag 100% Natural Ingredients? What is goji flavor and strawberry flavor? Tastes terrible.

I guess if you like your tea with a splash of milk or cream it'll taste even more like mint hot chocolate but I only drink tea plain but that's what friends of mine have done when they come over.  This box is also an AMAZING price considering the local stores (that IF they carry this flavor, which 99% don't,) sell it for at least $3.50 a box. Great deal for a great tea!
