review/text: This is a great training treat for my 13 year old cat. I do clicker training with her and am always looking for a treat that she is satisfied with, but doesn't fill her up. These are perfect for that because they break up into little bits easily and Rusty thinks they are fabulous.

review/text: They can be at the opposite end of my home and if I take the lid off the Kitty Kaviar they cannot run fast enough in the hopes of getting some!  My older cat had a medical issue at the beginning of the year and has to eat canned food only with a lot of water added which, even when he is hungry, he is not always willing to eat -- I put a little Kitty Kaviar on it and, wah~la, the bowl is suddenly empty!  Also, this company is great -- got my order quickly and in great condition.

review/summary: LOVE this whole line of organic food
review/text: My daughter is 7 mos old now and has been eating baby food since about 5 mos (cereal & oatmeat at about 4 mos).  I originally planned to make all of her food, but that quickly became very hard to keep up with being that my husband and I both work full time.  I searched and found the Sprout line at Whole foods and tried a couple of the stage one foods.  My daughter LOVED it!  I keep thinking we are going to give her one that she doesn't love as much, but so far, after trying all the stage ones and a couple of the stage two's she loves it all.  I would say this squash and the sweet potatoes are her favorite and more filling to her.  I haven't had any issues with the packaging. I actually feed her right out of the pouches and don't really find it difficult to get it all out,  I make sure that I shape it to the most open position so I can get the spoon in and out and scrape the bottom easily.  Love being able to toss a couple into her bag for trips to grandma's house.

review/summary: My new favorite baby food!!
review/text: Our baby was ready for a little supplementation to breastfeeding, so we've tried the Sprout line-Stage 1 for a week now, 6 different flavors, & I love it!  Every one of the foods tastes delicious (I would happily eat it myself), & my 4 1/2-month old son has gobbled up every one.  They are a thicker consistency, which I find to be a plus - it's easier for my son to swallow & not spit any out with each bite.  It stays in his mouth well.  I noticed some other reviewers didn't like the packaging, saying it was messy & hard to get the food out.  I haven't had that problem.  The packages tear open smoothly at the top every time, with no splattering.  Then I just squeeze the food out into a bowl, & almost every bit of it comes out.  There isn't waste. I found these at the same price as Earth's Best, which has BPA in the lid, so I'm thrilled to get a perfectly safe packaging & HIGH quality organic food for my baby, & not have it cost more then the other organic foods!

review/text: I started buying these through Amazon's Subscribe and Save Subscription, which is a great deal for quick on-the-go meals, when my twins started eating solids.  Now, at 20 months, they still like it.  On my last order the packaging changed, so it no longer has the attached closure, which was helpful, but I rarely have any food leftover, so it's not a big issue.  I've also used it when baking as a substitute for pumpkin!

review/summary: Overall, great food
review/text: My son loves this & I love that I know what it is (it isn't "mystery squash").  I agree with the prior poster about the consistency - it is surprisingly thick.  But we just added some formula to thin it out a bit.<br /><br />I also think the packaging on the Sprouts baby food is annoying.  Eco friendly - great.  But it is very messy trying to get the contents out into a bowl & there is always a fair amount left in there that you can't get out.  It is resealable, which is great so that I can spoon out a little at a time, but with the mess trying to get food out, food gets caught in the zip & I end up having to rinse it.  The quality is enough that I will put up with the annoying packaging, though.

review/summary: Great Tasting Organic Cereal!  It Might be Addictive...
review/text: As many reviewers have already noted, this is a "Kirkland" brand product from Costco.  The price from many vendors roughly seems to be around twice of what Costco charges in their warehouse store.  I highly recommend getting it from Costco if you can.  If you're not able to for one reason or another, the total price (including shipping) still seems to be reasonable when you consider the amount of "organic" cereal you're getting.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this cereal before, it is a delectable cluster of grains and almonds.  It is my favorite cereal and I have to be extra careful how much I eat.  It is one of my guilty, yet healthy pleasures.  I have to cut myself off at two servings!  There comes a time when you've had too much of a good thing!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Highly recommended for people who love tasty and healthy cereal and can't get it at Costco!

If they ever stop selling it there, I would still fork out the money for it online.  It is THAT good:)

review/text: I tried this today at a local gourmet purveyor of wild mushrooms, it was in a salt shaker at the cashier.  I've never tasted anything so wonderful, incredible.  So, I bought a jar immediately.  I was on my lunch hour from work and I had stopped and bought a basil, fresh mozzarella and tomato sandwich, would this taste good on it?  Oh my goodness, it certainly did.  A little goes a long way, but this is an incredible condiment to add to your pantry.  I won't be without it if I can manage it.  Don't hesitate, it is worth every single cent of the price.

It's absolutely delicious on egg dishes (try it on a homemade egg and cheese breakfast sandwich!) and turns ordinary buttered popcorn into a culinary masterpiece.  Here's the catch -- my husband *hates* it.  LOATHES it.  The smell alone makes him push his own truffle-salt-free dish away because he can't get the scent out of his nose.  So now I'm reduced to using my precious find when I'm home alone with the dog.  Thankfully he doesn't seem to mind it.

review/text: I've been using this truffle salt for about a year now, and I can't say enough good about it. It is, in fact, fabulous! You need only a tiny pinch to add an incredible truffle flavor to what ever you are serving. Try roasting asparagus with a little olive oil and a light sprinkle of this truffle salt. While it seems expensive initially, it takes so little to make a big impact, it really isn't that costly. The truffle scent is so intense, you can smell it through the jar. And if you're a truffle lover, that scent is almost better than French perfume.

review/summary: a good product that overshot the mark
review/text: This truffle and salt is impressive in its intensity, but almost to a fault. The mushroomy-garlicky taste and aroma is good in moderation but I found that the salt can act as an obnoxious contaminant in the kitchen, as even fractions of a grain can aromatize an uncleaned countertop or dig itself into your clothes to assert itself later. I store the sealed jar in a firmly-snapped plastic container for security. While the summer truffle content appears to be legit, I suspect that the overpowering aspect is due to an artificial chemical additive that likely covers the vague "truffle flavor" on the label, though I'd like to believe that that is actually a natural extractive of truffle peelings or whatnot.

review/summary: OMG, black truffle heaven!
review/text: This stuff is what it is all about!  The tiniest pinch makes almost everything taste better.  My kids don't like it as it is too strong of a flavor but that means more for me.  It is one of my chef's secret go to seasonings.  Just use 1/4 as much as you think you might need.  People love this stuff, it's like CRACK!  In fact, one of my friends nicknamed a potato dish I make with this "Crack Potatoes"!!! I would give this stuff 6 stars if I could!!!  I use it all the time and this jar lasted me over a year.  Well worth it.

review/text: Is it worth it - let me search it...<br /><br />Fennel is muy good. Salt is muy good. Put them together and you get more muy than you would with a Spanish cow. We put it on everything from omelettes to pizza to chicken and fish.<br /><br />Some people think love makes the world go around - I happen to believe it has more to do with the conservation of angular momentum but a distant second would be this salt. It is good and makes other ordinary things into special tasty treats.<br /><br />Me gusta.

review/text: If you love the taste and smell of truffles but don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a great solution.  It perfectly enhances a variety of dishes.  It's great for spicing up boring scrambled eggs.  It is wonderful on pastas with wild mushrooms, risotto, poached chicken breasts, etc.  It works well even on grilled thick Italian bread with olive oil.

review/summary: Product Good - Package Handling Poor
review/text: I've had this salt before and purchased more 'cause I like it. However, when I opened the box I could smell the fragrance of the product. I found the seal on the jar was broken and the lid was loose. This vendor (Kiva Health Brands LLC) obviously has no compunction about selling a food item with the safety seal compromised; there are two other reviews complaining of the same problem and I can't image how the seal would break in-transit. Four stars for the product itself but one star for the handling.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5SGI4">Casina Rossa Truffle and Salt by Nicola de Laurentiis - 3.5 oz.</a>

review/text: I was in a store which sold odd ball food items from various countries and came across this truffle salt. I have heard before of the truffles high prices and good tastes, but there was no way I wanted to pay 30 dollars for a 3.5oz container of the stuff. It was gifted to me in the end and I used it sparingly, but the flavor is so awesome you don't really need much. This item is a must for all foods really; especially popcorn! The flavor is special and kinda smokey, a flavor you cant imagine till you try it!

review/text: Pretty much what i expected. Tasty & aromatic. However will continue to look for a product with like 10% truffle content. This salt contains "truffle essence" aswell which makes me wonder if a good portion of the aroma flavor comes from synthetic chemicals as found in other various mock truffle products. If that is the case, mehh whatever. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.

The seller (The Frenchy Bee) immediately contacted me and resolved the problem in a very professional manner.  I should have contacted the seller before leaving the feedback.  I learned a lesson.<br /><br />The salt is awesome.  I haven't had the opportunity to use it much.  So far, I have used it in scrambled eggs and I have sprinkled it over pasta.  It really enhances food.  I don't use very much of it, since it is quite fragrant.  The taste is earthy, but subtle when used in moderate amounts.  I look forward to using this salt in many more dishes.

review/summary: Good but perhaps too distictive flavor
review/text: I bought this after having the fortune of a chance encounter with white truffle oil which I found quite tasty. Also I've had black truffles on french dishes in restaurants of which I also was quite fond. So I looked up various truffle options and decided to give this salt a try. The reviews were lauding this product as being the best thing to the fresh truffle itself .. But alas I was disappointed and really kind of frustrated. Maybe it's 'cause I've had the real thing, but no because the truffle oil is still not an issue. The problem is the strong and distinctive quality of this product which doesn't always enhance but rather changes the flavor of foods I've put it on directly. Unfortunately I haven't always found this change for the better. But it has been OK in soups or stews where the flavor is blended in. Maybe I just got a bad batch or something? I don't know if this sort of thing is like wine where storage conditions can damage it? Anyways I give it 3/5 stars.

review/summary: INTENSE aroma and flavor
review/text: I picked this truffle salt because of the user reviews.  When I opened the jaw, the aroma was like a brick in the face.  I thought that the flavor was going to be watered down, but couldn't be wrong.<br />I read that it was great on eggs, so I took a pinch and added it to my eggs.  When I took a taste I nearly vomited. I may have added too much, or may be like the husband of another reviewer.  This may be just a flavor that is a love it or hate it.  I REALLY wanted to love this stuff, but it's just vile to my taste buds.<br />I gave it 3 stars because I want others to know that they may be cursed with my genetic taste buds.  I envy those of you that love it!!!!!

review/text: When I look at the label it says 5% truffle so 95% salt.  It smells mostly like salt.  It looks mostly white, with specks of dark spots.  So you are basically paying for the salt.  Like someone said I would need at least 10%.<br />I do not like the real thing concentrated but this is not enough.  I would have to add some myself. It tastes OK if you like salt.

review/summary: Garlic and psoriasis.
review/text: Garlic and especially garlic juice can make your dinner a little more exciting. Reese Garlic Juice seems to be a little condensate, so be careful. The best thing you can do is to use a little water and add a little juice until you think the taste is okay.<br /><br />A little secret about garlic. Garlic (fresh, powder or juice) reinforces your immunity system to all kinds of inflammation. If you suffer from psoriasis and you persist in taking every day a teaspoon of garlic juice in say, a bowl of soup, after one or two months the skin disease slowly disappears. If you don't believe it try it any way, what do you have to lose. It worked with me so why not with you?

review/summary: Not my fave
review/text: I bought a case of this on the stellar reviews and should have tried one can as a trial b/4 I did that.  I am not crazy about this pizza sauce.  All I taste on the pizza is this sauce, it overpowers the pizza in its entirety.  It is a darker color too, not a bright red.  It has romano cheese in it, so perhaps it is overpowering the sauce.  I prefer Gia Russa, Cento, and Don Pepino...no cheese in those sauces, so I suspect it is the cheese that I prefer OUT of the sauce.  You can always sprinkle some on the pizza to taste.  I also like that the other three brands are allergen free so I can use it safely for my granddaughter who has nut, egg and dairy allergies.  Don Pepino does not contain citric acid (a preservative) which keeps the tomato taste clean and authentic tasting. I will probably use this sauce on occasion but most probably more as a regular sauce in Bolognese, meatloaf, etc..

I've tried 'store bought' pizza sauces just to see what's on the shelves... yuck! WAY too sweet!  Then I saw the reviews for Pastorelli's sauce on Amazon and - what the heck - gave it a try. Wow! Terrific pizza sauce!  No preservatives, additives, no sugar (that I could see on the ingredients), nicely spiced and very 'authentic' excellent taste. Give it a try!  (I make my own rare Italian yeast/sour dough 3-day cold rise crust, and store-bought offerings can NEVER replace THAT, thank-you-very-much ;-)  The 8-ounce is good for 2 pizzas... I bought the 15 oz cans, - 1/2 can too much - and used the left-over for pasta sauce. Good that way, too.

review/text: This has been my favorite pizza sauce for decades.  Only one I'll use, nice and thick, easy to spread on the crust and stays thick throughout the cooking, so that it's not just a wet, runny mess.  Fantastic flavor.  I've lived all over the world and this is the one I always return to.  I prefer it to all the homemade ones people have had me try as well, it's that good.<br /><br />Their shipping, however, is atrocious.  Of the 12 cans that arrived, only one was unscathed.  And only two will be able to be opened by my can opener.  They have them encased in a small short box with plastic wrap, but the larger box they send it out in is not sufficiently packed.  So the cans are all bent, one had actually opened.  I'll have to buy a manual can opener in hopes of being able to open the 9 cans that are useless now for any electric opener.<br /><br />Prices here were far better than the only store in my area that carries these, but it's not worth the hassle for the mangled cans I ended up getting.

I found out Evo is terrible for animals, the food is causing alot of health problems and death.I got a letter in the mail stating there is a lawsuit against Innova Evo plus all Natura products.I'm currently in the lawsuit myself.. Evo lied about the ingredients in all their products...DO NOT BUY EVO AND NATURA PRODUCTS!!! (such as Innova Evo, California Natural, Healthwise, Mother Nature, and Karma Dog)Google it, it's called PetproductsSettlement.com.. It's for a $2,150,000 settlement

review/summary: sweet and crisp, like autumn in new england
review/text: I'm usually *not* a flavored tea person, and I'm definitely not a "fruit for dessert" person (the idea of candied apples makes me gag a little bit), but I LOVE this tea. It smells and tastes amazing- sweet and also very refreshing. It's just a crisp, sweet tea with no aftertaste or "chalkiness" in the mouth. It does remind me a little bit of hot apple cider, but with a good dash of tea in it. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />My brewing recommendation: 1.5 teaspoons to 16 oz of water (or one full Ingenuitea) for no more than 3.5 minutes. The ceylon base of this tea will instantly get bitter if brewed for more than 3.5 minutes.

review/text: This extract doesn't smell like roses at all.  It has a very herbal smell, something like lavender but not as pleasant.  I'm very disappointed.  Small bottles of rose essence I bought at an Indian grocery smell much more like roses than this product does.  I don't know if there's a chance that the bottle was mislabeled and really is some other extract, but I won't be able to use this product to flavor things with a rose flavor.  I'll have to stick with rose water and the rose essence I bought at the Indian market.

I think I'll keep them long for the bouquet if I decide to use them for this.

review/text: This is a fantastic product, and has the benefit of being useful for travel. The product is unlikely to clump because it has a plastic liner which keeps it dry.  However, this plastic liner makes the packet impossible to open without scissors!  And who travels with scissors?<br /><br />This product could be greatly improved if there was an easy-open slit in the packaging, and would be more environmentally-friendly without the plastic.  People who are interested in their health might also be interested in a more *green* product.  I also will not buy this product again in its current state.  It really boggles the mind that they would put this into convenient, portable packets, then make it so maddeningly difficult to open the packets. Packaging FAIL.

review/summary: 100% Kona - not easy to find!
review/text: Many coffee brands that advertise their beans as &quot;Kona&quot; are blends, containing only ten percent beans from the highly desirable region, but these Aloha Island Gold beans are pure Kona, all from plants grown on the Big Island in the designated microclimate that produces some of the smoothest coffee beans in the world. While the Aloha brand may not be Hawaii's best, it is certainly one of the more available brands on the mainland.  Store in the freezer to maintain optimal freshness, and grind the beans immediately before brewing.<p>For coffee connoisseurs, two phrases light up their eyes, &quot;Jamaican Blue Mountain&quot; and &quot;Kona.&quot;  If you want to give a gift sure to impress a sophisticated coffee drinker, you've found your beans.

Emma (Pres) relayed the shipment would go out immediately and apologized for the delay. Thought it was done...  A few moments later, Anna calls back and goes into some diatribe with my wife not knowing what coffee is.  If the president of the company resolved the issue, why is someone else from the company calling to stir it up?!<br /><br />Another call back to speak with Emma and she apologized for the actions of Anna. The coffee and a "for your trouble" gesture would be sent along that day. They are located cross town about 10 miles away and most shipment are next day...nothing came.<br /><br />A week passed and still nothing. Another call. Emma relays that it should have been taken care of and will call me back next day to confirm. Next day came, went...nothing. We are quite disappointed by this company.

This Kona brand seemed very strong to me - I even tried not using to much coffee and more water and it still seemed too stong.  I missed the smoothness and flavor of the Kona I remembered in Hawaii.

Sweet and thick and absolutely delicious, the kind of thing where you diligently scrape every last molecule out of the bottom of the cup because you can't bear to let it go to waste.  Although, if you're not a big cream cheese fan, you probably won't like this either.  Very low carb, moderately high in fat, very high in saturated fat.  And, to me, worth every calorie.
