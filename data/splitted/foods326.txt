review/summary: My toy dogs LOVE these treats!
review/text: These are my Yorkipoo and Shih-Tzu's favorite treats!<br />I've tried getting other brands of similar treats, but they don't compare to the quality of these Veggie Life Happy Hips Chicken & Banana treats.  Even our Labrador loves them!  It's a lot to order at one time (6 packs), but they're well sealed so they stay fresh.

review/summary: Happy Hips makes happy dog
review/text: My granddog stayed with me while my son was deployed to Afghanistan, and I found these special treats for her. They seemed unique, and healthy, so I gave them a try. She loves them! I only give her one a day, after dinner as dessert. She knows what that word means, and will whine if I wait too long to give it to her. She is an older dog, and does have some joint issues, so I really like that these treats have glucosamine and chondroitin. Who knew that dogs like apples!

review/summary: I own a finicky shih-tzu!
review/text: I own a shih tzu that hardly eats anything, and as far as treats go will only eat Happy Hips and (groan!)- Snausages!  Unbelievable!  He'll turn his nose up at filet mignon, but will wolf down a Snausage!  Of course I would rather he eat something somewhat healthy and I have bought many 15 oz. bags of Happy Hips treats through local merchandisers for around $18.99 a bag (plus tax).  Comes to a little over $20 a bag.  Three 15 oz. bags through Amazon with shipping - around $35, vs. three 15 oz. bags through local retailers - over $60.  Same great product - do the math.

review/summary: Treats were stale
review/text: The Dogswell Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews I bought from Amazon were stale.  I have bought these before, in local stores, and they are supposed to be pliable and "chewy".  Although the bags had expiration dates that were in code, each bag I opened, contained "stale" chews.  They broke like crackers and I could hear my dog chomping on them like a bone.  I buy them so I can bend them over and put them in her toys or bones - she can spend a lot of time trying to get at the "treat".  With these, all I could do was feed them to her like snack crackers.  I was very disappointed.  I will continue to buy them, as they are a good product, just not from Amazon.

But I still feel uneasy about giving it to my dogs. Why wouldn't they post this info on the bags then?????

review/summary: Best sauce ever, but beware of description
review/text: The pasta sauce is extremely good.  The best I've ever had.  It is really good and has relatively low sodium (240mg per half cup) and relatively low saturated fat (1.5g per half cup).  Usually companies load their sauces with salt and high saturated fat cream to make their product taste good.  This company does not do that and the product is amazingly good and tastes very fresh.<br /><br />The problem is the description on Amazon as it reads below.  Before I ordered I even did an online chat to confirm that 6 cans would be sent.  However only one was sent.  The price is too high for one can as it can be purchased cheaper in the grocery store or in bulk at other places, even on Amazon I believe.  I paid $11.99 for it thinking I was getting 6 cans which would be an amazing deal.  The grocery store (Whole Foods) sells it for $7.99-$8.99 per 19.6 oz can.  Amazon needs to fix the product feature description as it is wrong.<br /><br />Product Features<br />Description: PASTA SCE,CRMY TOMATO RC Quantity: 6 Size: 19.6 OZ Brand: LUCINI<br /><br />The "Quanity: 6" is not correct.  It should read "Quanity: 1"<br /><br />Anyway, the product itself is very good.  Everyone's taste buds are different but when I say it's the best I've ever had, I really mean it.  It has to be made by hand or something.  You can get it cheaper so shop around.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I should preface this review by saying that I don't actually like the taste of coconut water, at all.  But I keep hearing about the benefits of coconut water so I thought that the flavored coconut water would be better.  I bought both the pineapple and the peach mango, fully expecting to like the peach mango more.  Unfortunately, the peach mango was not for me, I'm pretty sure the coconut water flavor was stronger in that than in straight coconut water.  However, the pineapple one is a great!  The pineapple flavor is not strong, but it almost completely masks the coconut water flavor, so that it tastes like a delicate pineapple drink.  It doesn't have a strong flavor, but a pleasant, light pineapple flavor.  I would recommend this for anyone that wants to get coconut water, but doesn't care for the taste.

review/summary: Subtle, but tasty
review/text: I have tried a few coconut pineapple waters, and this one is pretty good in comparison to other brands. I think Vita is better, but i would rank this second. The pineapple taste here is subtle. It is definitely there, but i would say that pineapple and coconut flavor definitely are in something of a timeshare in this beverage (about 50/50 for each). It's basically just pretty tasty and clean. I wish Pepsi didnt own Naked Juice. From a political and ethical standpoint, it does give me a bit of trepidation to know that a company with seemingly no qualms about poisoning people would be producing something i actually drink, but the flipside of that is that hopefully, seeing that they can produce something healthy that people actually enjoy will encourage them to do so more frequently.

I thought pineapple sounded good.  After it arrived, I thought I'd try one.  It was room temperature and it did not taste good. However, my daughter loves the coconut water and this flavor as well.  So, to each his own - liking or disliking it is obviously a matter of individual preference.

review/summary: This stuff was terrible
review/text: For over a year now I've purchased coconut water from Amazon via subscription.  I usually purchase coconut water "O.N.E", but my subscription was cancelled due to me being deployed.  Once I returned home I decided to purchase Naked coconut water, and wow I was so disappointed.  The taste of this coconut water is horrible, just horrible.  This was suppose to be Pineapple flavor, and it really sucked.  There was no flavor to it at all, but it tasted like old dish water.  I still have these in my frig, because I can't bring myself to drink them.  They are over a month old, and I will probably just wash them down the drain.  They where not what I had expected, and I had to get back on Amazon to find the other brand of coconut water.  I have now found another subscription of "O.N.E", and I'm very happy with them.  No more Naked coconut water, it taste horrible.

review/text: Ever try the goldfish crackers?  They taste as much like the box as they do cheese.  The TLC Country Cheddar crackers are far superior.  They taste of cheddar and the texture balances smooth with crunchy, and savor for a few seconds to soften and get the cheddar flavor.  It's not too sharp or too mild - just right.  My favorite TLC cracker is Honey Sesame, but I eat the other varieties regularly to keep things interesting.

review/text: I discovered these crackers at a small grocery on a beach trip last year. My large local grocery in a major metropolitan city took forever to start carrying them, and they were more expensive. I was very happy to see Amazon have them on a special Kashi deal, and in bulk.<br /><br />As for the product itself...I love the natural cheese flavor. I've never been a Nips fan, because the flavor tasted fake, too salty, and left an unpleasant after taste. These Kashi crackers have great texture, crunch, and taste, and they are a healthy snack, too. I eat them alone, or with a nice crisp apple. Yum!!

review/text: These are fantastic crackers!  Kashi makes a great product in general and these crackers are no exception.  Very cheesy tasting without being overly salted.  The only downside was that this case appears to have been hit by a truck.  We're about halfway through the case and each box has had more broken crackers than whole ones.  Still taste good, but it would be nice to have a box that didn't look like it came from the bottom of the barrel.

review/text: We tried these whole grain crackers with our one year old daughter as an alternative to the 'junk' crackers that are marketed to children.  She loves them!  She even asks for them when it's time for snack and my husband loves them as well.  Be aware, if you are a die-hard CheezIt fan these ARE different.  But if you realize how good for you they are and that they are made with real, natural ingredients then hopefully they will satisfy.  My husband says they are a little smelley, but I think it is because they are made with real cheddar not the imitation stuff in other cheese crackers.  Nicely salted and very yummy.  Finally, a packaged snack that I can feel good about serving my daughter (and the rest of the family).

Make no mistake, you are not going to get a full pound of high-quality matcha for less than several hundred dollars.<br />This is not matcha for drinking; it is matcha for cooking, baking, and even adventurously powdering breakfast cereal and ice cream with.

review/summary: Culinary teas bulk matcha vs. "tea ceremony quality" matcha
review/text: I am new to matcha drinking, so was somewhat concerned re: customer comments Culinary Teas matcha being "brown" (i.e. a not the correct bright green color). I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest "tea ceremony" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha  is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less "green" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my "working" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my "too much coffee" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect.<br />PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any. As consumers, we need to ask companies to STOP ADDING SUGAR (in whatever processed form it takes) to everything they make.

review/text: It tastes good enough and is affordable enough to use every day. It's not sweet and super bright, almost-neon green like medium and high grade matcha, but it's not bitter, unpleasant, stale, and brownish like Malden's similarly priced matcha. It is only slightly more expensive than Malden's matcha ($3.40/oz. or $2.62/oz. in bulk vs. Malden's $2.50/oz) but the quality is superior. I highly recommend this as an overall good mathca at a really good price.<br /><br />If this is the first matcha you try you won't be disappointed. But if you're not impressed with the taste keep in mind that the next step up in quality available through Amazon is at around $10/oz (ex. DoMatcha's 2nd Harvest).

review/summary: Green tea powder for life!
review/text: At first glance it may seem that this product is somewhat expensive--$30+ for tea, right? But a pound of green tea powder is A LOT!!! For a 6 oz cup of tea or most other uses you only need to use about a half a teaspoon or things get a little strong and murky. But I add it to everything--my morning protein shake, yogurt, Gatorade for the gym, etc., etc. and still I have yet to make a dent in the bag. I have also looked at green tea powder at places like Whole Foods and Asian super markets, and this is a really good deal in comparison. So buy some and enjoy!

review/text: This product is everything you would expect, and then some. The shipping was fast. The Matcha is sent in a resealable, heavy-duty FOILED plastic bag, EXCELLENT quality. I recommend using a small tin for everyday use, taking no more than an ounce or two from the larger bag, to preserve the flavor and freshness.<br /><br />The taste is WONDERFUL. Very fresh, very green, very subtle, yet intense.<br />I purchased this product after Starbucks raised their prices (again!), because I had become a frozen green tea frappucino addict...Now I am just a Matcha addict.<br /><br />I love it in the evening warm, in a large mug with a good splash of milk, and simply adore it from the blender with milk, ice cubes, some vanilla syrup and a splash of whipping cream for the frothy, creamy taste...<br /><br />I use 2 level teaspoons, not packed, to a 20 oz. mug, so figure 1 teaspoon per "regular" coffee cup.<br /><br />The illustrative picture is what your matcha will look like. None of the other vendors show the color/quality of their product...For something like this, being able to see what you will get is half the issue. I can tell you that the flavor, which is the other half, is also the quality you would expect and wish for.

review/summary: Good but not quite starbucks
review/text: I bought this item based on the good reviews it got and for the price. I think this is a product that is more useful in baking than a hot tea - it seems to require a lot of careful mixing that is too much hassle for a quick cuppa. It was green and not brown like one of the reviews here stated. I just bought an ice cream maker and am planning to use it for that or just to add to my morning smoothie for a boost. I recently got a bag of the Starbucks version that is mixed with sugar and it blends very easily with hot water. They don't sell it in their stores in powder form like you can buy coffee, but I know enough people in the Starbucks biz to get it on a regular basis. I think I will stick with that version for a hot tea, but I think this 1lb bag is good value for my baking purposes. Hopefully the ice cream will be as good as I want it to be!

review/summary: Lots of perfectly acceptable Matcha for absolutely dirt cheap.
review/text: I go through a lot of matcha, and I've tried a lot of different kinds. No, this is not tea ceremony quality tea powder, but it is bright green and tastes great. It's a far cry from the brown matcha that the super-cheap stuff often is. It's even significantly better than cooking-grade matcha. This is great tea for in just about anything or alone in water, and cheap enough to make it inexpensive for daily use. Came properly sealed in a foil bag.

review/summary: Affordable to drink everyday.
review/text: Considering the price of top grade Matcha I figured that this would be "good enough".  It is just that. It is good enough for everyday drinking, smoothies and cooking.  If you looking for top shelf, well then pay the high prices and get the best you can afford.  If you want second best I recommend DoMatcha's 2nd Harvest.  If you want cooking, smoothie or food grade matcha at an affordable price, ten this is the stuff. It is not brown. It is green.  Bright green no, but green.  Considering the price, the quick delivery and if you want to be able to afford to drink this at least twice a day, this is perfect.  No complaints.

review/text: Matcha green really works! I am so glad I decided to give it a chance. I am quite a skeptic about trying new products. It does exactly what I have been researching. It gives me energy and controls my appetite. I also tried it as a facial mask. It left my skin with a nice and beautiful glow. I have recommended this product to my mother-in-law, great aunt, my dad and my husband. A week ago my husband drank his first cup of matcha green tea. I came home from work, he had dinner cooked, and he cleaned the house. I will always have matcha green tea in my house with a 180 like this one. I am very, very pleased and satisfied with my purchase.

review/summary: Quite pleased with the transaction and the product
review/text: Fast shipping, quality product in durable bag with ziplock. Good quantity and cheap. Good taste. The only drawbacks is that product is really difficult to dissolve. I like to make mine with vanilla soy milk, but I always have to stir out the powder in a small quantity of boiling water before adding the soy milk and then microwaving or steeming it. It still does not dissolve completely. Also this is a problem because green tea should be made with water that is about 60 degrees to preserve the best taste...  I would like for the color to be more like the color in the photo, but it is a much more muddy green color. Not like starbucks...but maybe that means it is more natural - I dunno.

review/text: I purchased some macha at a health food store and figured it was the best quality. I was assuming that with the bright color and smell it was the best. It was good-----but this macha tea is BETTER in my opinion. The color is darker-but the smell is stronger--which told me this was going to be more potent than what I had tried before. So far it gives me a great boost and my body likes it as well. ---I'm highly sensative to what I put into my body and I was happy to feel I made a great choice with this company and product. ****I plan to buy more in the future------

review/summary: Absolutely delicious! Great quality matcha.
review/text: Firstly, I received my matcha a day earlier than Amazon expected, which was awesome, I was so anxious to get it. The matcha came in neatly packaged with a note from the company who makes it.<br />Secondly, the first thing I did was to make a cold cinnamon matcha smoothie with 2% milk. It was delicious! The matcha is a deep green color and had a very fine grain, there was hardly a difference between this and ridiculously expensive "ceremonial grade" matcha. This matcha, as long as it is properly sifted and mixed properly, will make beautiful drinks.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more of this when I run out but that won't be for a while- I ordered the 8oz bag. :)<br /><br />I can't wait to make matcha sugar cookies, and mocha cupcakes with matcha frosting. So many delicious possibilities!

review/summary: Solid Product, Fast shipping
review/text: The matcha green tea powder had a great color too it. The packaging was in a large, sealed reflective foil bag with a label showing the manufacture's nutrition information. (Note: The bag was not resealable, so make sure you have a container to store it in after opening.)<br /><br />The tea itself was a nice green color, very close to what is pictured in the description. I did not find it having a brownish tint at all, unlike some of the reviews that I have seen on here. It was all green. I could not find a better price for 8 oz. of matcha tea powder.<br /><br />I personally started drinking matcha tea recently so I cannot determine how much better or worse it is compared to other brands. I do, however, have to say that I love the taste of this tea. I drink it unsweetened as both hot and iced tea. I also have successfully replicated great smoothie recipes and  an iced latte recipe from my favorite beverage establishments (this stuff has saved me so much $$$ in smoothies that it has already paid for itself.)<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. I was even more impressed with how fast it arrived. I was expecting 7-10 business days for it to be shipped and arrive, but it was at my doorstep in 3 business days!

review/summary: Strong but deelish!
review/text: By looking for an affordable substitute to the big coffee chains, I found this. It's excellent and more healthy because it is not full of sugar like other powders. At first I kept making it WAAAAY too strong because I've tried many other types of powder that required 2-3 tbsp per cup. This powder is pure green tea and a little goes a long way. Because a little goes a long way, it is definitely worth paying a little more $$ for this product...the other ones might be cheaper but you need a lot more in your cup to make a good quality green tea latte.

review/summary: extreme mediocritiy
review/text: The Matcha came promptly.  There is plenty of it.  Those are the positives.<br />The color of the Matcha looks nothing like the photo.  It is a deeper,  darker more muted green.  It tastes similar to what it looks-muddy,  sort of like dirty,  grassy, water.<br />I have purchased much higher quality Matcha at very reasonable prices ($18.00 for 8oz.) in Japanese markets in NYC and L.A.  I purchased this to drink every morning and to use in cooking and frappuccinos.  So far,  it is best for frappuccinos where the flavor is enhanced with plenty of sugar and Mimic Cream (almond, cashew cream substitute).<br />I would not recommend this product.  Either spend more or keep looking.  Good luck!

review/text: Tried matcha green tea powder for the first time and this one is actually not too bad.  It doesn't taste muddy and I taste the matcha green tea flavor.  So far, I've only tried this with hot water and as an ice tea. I will try it in smoothies next week.  Satisfied with the product and price but the only drawback is the packaging.  I cut a slit on the side and fold it after using, but a lot of the powder came out! So I had to pour it all in a tuber ware. You gotta change the packaging to a zip lock bag or something.  I wanted to order more but in the 16 oz, but the only thing stopping me is that there is a shipping fee AND it's sold by another company, why is that??

review/text: I really liked the idea of having one handy kit to make a curry dinner.  I found this kit to be quite gross.  Its was that little seasoning packet, not sure whats in it but the directions have you cook it all together with the meat (not strain it). This leaves you with huge pieces of leaves and extremly woody pieces of spices and theres no easy way to avoid eating them. GROSS. Perhaps if you just made the sauce separate and strained it before use it would be ok. The flavor wasnt bad but always wasnt great.  Not worth the money.  You're better off just buying the curry paste and coconut milk separate. Its the same thing as this "kit" and tastes better!

review/text: I'm new to making smoothies with a blender at home, so I like any products that make this easier. The MOCAFE Madagascar Vanilla Smoothie Mix is a sweet powder that will give your smoothies a nice, thick, rich body. We have tried it with ice cream-based shakes and fruit and yogurt-based smoothies and it works great for all of these. The main ingredients are fructose (a type of plant sugar), nonfat powdered milk, and vanilla. There are some simple recipes on the side of the can to help you get started. This stuff is yummy! Probably because it is not low-calorie.<br /><br />It comes in a generous 3-pound tin. We quit making smoothies for a while because the weather was cold. But now that the weather is warming up, we are back to making them again. When I openned the partially used tin, I was pleased to see that the powder stored well. It did not cake up, (like so many products do when weather is humid), and it still tastes just as good and freash as did when first openned a couple of months ago.

review/text: I would (occasionally) treat myself by purchasing vanilla smoothies from my employer's cafeteria at a cost of $4 per 12oz. serving. Since this treat was a bit expensive I researched to determine if I could purchase a product that would produce the same reward. I read the reviews of the other buyers of this product, and made the investment. It turned out to be just as good as the cafeteria, and it is quite easy to make. Instead of paying $4.00 per 12 oz. serving, it only costs  approximately $1.00. If you want a smoothie that is different than vanilla, just add fresh or frozen fruit. If you are contemplating about whether you should purchase, I would recommend to do so.

review/text: There was a weird after taste. I found that 1/4 of a good vanilla extract and 1-2 table spoons of powder sugar work a lot better. For the liquid I use almond milk or soy milk. If you use a flavored milk you might want to go light on the sugar.

review/summary: Great "Chinese Restaurant" Jasmine Tea
review/text: A disappointed buyer and reviewer of this tea commented that this tea is not like Twining's Jasmine tea, which has a much stronger jasmine flavor. Nor does this tea contain (many) actual jasmine flower petals, which perhaps led to the other reviewer's statement that this tea is mislabeled. However, it is not mislabeled and it is jasmine tea, and unlike stronger jasmine teas, the flavors of the tea and jasmine in this scented tea are very well balanced.<br /><br />This tea is exactly the same as that served in many Chinese restaurants, so if you like that tea, you will like this. The jasmine flavor is produced by placing a large quantity of green tea in an enclosed hopper, placing jasmine flowers in an adjacent hopper with a mesh or air channels between, then blowing very hot air through the jasmine flowers, which picks up the flowers' fragrant essential oils and distributes them onto the tea leaves in the adjacent hopper. This process produces a gently but wonderfully jasmine-scented green tea with a well balanced flavor. I love it.

review/text: This is perfect for my needs. I am a huge fan of loose leaf teas, from very mild white teas to deep, rich, strong black teas. I realized the only thing missing from my inventory was a Jasmine tea that was almost identical to the ones served in finer Chinese eateries. And, voila, this Sunflower Jasmine fits the bill just as I had hoped. A nice, smooth, easy to drink tea that goes well with any meal. Couldn't be more pleased.

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: The first time I ever had this tea, I could not believe how delicious is was.  I had only been exposed to southern style sweet tea (which I still love), and had decided to pick up a tin of the sunflower brand jasmine to try.  It is so delicate and sweet -- just perfect!  I have been a fan ever since and I am loyal to this brand.<br />By the way, this IS real jasmine tea.  The reviewer who said otherwise didn't read the description or label.  It is a delicate tea, not overpowering, and steeps up beautifully as long as you don't steep too long (all green tea will become bitter if steeped too long or in water that is too hot).  It really is tasty, with or without a dash of sweetener. With a drop or two of honey, it is heavenly!  It also makes a yummy bubble tea, if you like that kind of thing.

review/text: I have been a fan of Jasmine Tea for quite a while.  Several years ago,<br />I had my first taste of TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea, and fell in love with the<br />sweet, delicate flavour....totally different from even the "English Breakfast Tea" made by the same company.  Though "English Breakfast Tea",<br />(and "Darjeeling", and even Fortum & Mason's "Royal Blend" tea are different from the usual "Orange Pekoe" or "Orange Pekoe and Black" teas, one usually gets bagged in the supermarket, these other 'rarified' teas are far more like the usual tea than Jasmine Tea.  Jasmine Tea, (at least as made by Twinnings), will always be my total favourite.<br /><br />When I went to purchase some "TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea" through Amazon, they were out of it...thank goodness, as it turns out, temporarily.  I didn't know this at the time...and so, I bought the "substitute" then offered...Sunflower Jasmine Tea.  I figured that Jasmine Tea is Jasmine Tea, no matter who makes it ....right?  And this Sunflower Tea DID seem slightly less expensive....so, I bought some.<br /><br />I have just had my first cup.  It did NOT taste like the Jasmine Tea I so remember and appreciate.  This is a very, very PALE tea in colour....and what is worse, the taste is somewhat peppery, (ulgh!)....with only the VERY slightest hint of the wonderful Jasmine Tea Flavour I remember.<br /><br />WHAT went wrong, I wondered.  HOW could this be so different?  Tea trees<br />should know no nationality or political system!  I was extremely bewildered and confused....for about five minutes.  But I found out the reason, (I think), just before I started to write this review...seeking out the Sunflower Jasmine Tea for which I wanted to write a review.<br /><br />Amongst the "Jasmine Teas" listed are TWO TYPES of Twinnings Jasmine Tea.<br />One is "Jasmine Tea", the other "Jasmine Green Tea".  I suspect that THIS is the reason I so dislike the Jasmine Tea from Sunflower.  It is NOT "straight" Jasmine Tea...but MUST be Jasmine Green Tea.  And although Green Tea is said to have myriad health benefits, it sure doesn't make as tasty and satisfying a brew as Jasmine tea.  Even when, it seems, it is MIXED with Jasmine Tea.<br /><br />One would expect people in the People's Republic of China to know the difference!  And to label their tea accordingly!  Not everyone, (including me!) is a tea expert...and the difference between "Jasmine Tea" and "Jasmine Green Tea" should be noted on the tea-box label, for tea novices, such as I...as it is, thoughtfully, by Twinnings Teas.  I am, at present, extremely disappointed at the carelessness in labeling.<br />Those who want "Jasmine Tea" only will, I am sure, be likewise disappointed by this probably-mislabeled-by-mistake-or-by-carelessness "Jasmine Tea".  It is NOT "Jasmine Tea" to my palate -- it is, I am almost certain, "Jasmine Green Tea".  There is SUCH a difference in taste!!!!!!<br /><br />I know Green Tea is good for one, and so I will keep this tea.  I will combine it with the "ordinary" tea I find at the supermarket -- and which I find far more flavourful!  (NOTE: Second cup of tea -- even mixed with "ordinary" orange pekoe tea, (two tea-bags!), is not to my taste.  Therefore....as is listed in the "NOTE: PS",  below, I HAVE DECIDED I AM NOT KEEPING this tea, but am putting it up for sale, for those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, (obviously some people do, as reflected in the other, sterling reviews of this tea), and would like it -- 1 pound minus two servings -- at a bargain price.)<br /><br />However, this tea is certainly not to MY taste.  And so disappointed am I, that, unless there is a very, very great difference in price, I will stick to buying genuine,<br />"JASMINE Tea", from Twinnings, (who takes the time and trouble to carefully label each TYPE of Jasmine Tea), from now on -- even if Sunflower does decide to mend it's ways and re-label its tea!<br /><br />A great flavor disappointment -- due to careless labelling!<br /><br />.............................................................<br />.............................................................<br /><br />p.S.  NOTE:  Today, 12th March, 2009 -- two days after I have written this review -- and about 6 days after I have received this tea, I have FINALLY seen that, yes indeedy....the package DOES say, "Green Tea With Jasmine Flowers" -- on the BACK of the tin, in smallish lettering!  One cannot see the BACK of the tin from the Amazon.com illustration!  From the "Product Description", it states that "Jasmine Tea is one of the most pleasant-tasting green teas available...." -- but does NOT mention any differentiation between the two varieties: "Jasmine Tea", ane "Jasmine Green Tea" -- as Twinnings Teas thoughtfully does.  Even from the "Proudct Description", which probably has been supplied by Sunflower, a novice would STILL not know there are two distinct and different TYPES of Jasmine Tea!  AND THERE DEFINITELY ARE TWO VARIETIES: - I have been on the phone with my sister, and she concurs: she (also), LOVES plain Jasmine Tea, but detests Jasmine GREEN Tea.  But -- I suppopose there ARE those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, looking at the ohter sterling reviews of this same tea.<br /><br />I don't like it. But I'm glad that there are those who do like it.  I have had two cups of 5his tea -- and have revised my opinion about keeping it.  I am putting it up for sale, via my Amazon.com shop.  I may lose mnney in this transaction, but better that, (for me), than suffering through more of this Jasmine Green Tea.  Besides, there PROBABLY ARE others who like it.  I guess I'll not only be doing myself a favour -- but will also be doing my "good deed" for the day, by putting it up at a bargain price for those who truly enjoy Jasmine GREEN Tea!  If you want to buy it, it's here -- used only twice, at the aforesaid bargain price! (Hey, that rhymes!)<br /><br />Note to Sunflower Teas:  PLEASE LABEL YOUR TEAS MORE CAREFULLY FROM NOW ON!

You can't eat a lot of them at a time because the sour coating can make your mouth feel rough.  Lots of punch in a small candy.  These are my favorite Warheads candy.

review/summary: a good product for the chocolate enthusiast
review/text: I've tried MaraNatha's peanut butter and almond butters with mixed satisfaction.  While other MaraNatha products may not be my personal favorites, the company has produced a winning product with its dark chocolate almond spread.  The product is velvety and delicious and belongs in any chocolate lover's pantry.<br /><br />The dark chocolate almond spread is easily retrieved from the container and no stirring is required.  This product tastes awesome on toast, banana pieces, mixed with ice cream or oatmeal or straight out of the jar (my personal favorite).  It is so smooth that I could envision one using this spread as an icing for cupcakes or cake.<br /><br />There is no indication on the jar that the product must be refrigerated.  I typically refrigerate my peanut butters and other nut butters so I did that with this product and it did make the product more stiff.  If you wanted to use this as a frosting, you would need to heat it slightly after refrigeration.<br /><br />A serving is 2 tablespoons and has 180 calories, 14 grams of fat (3 grams saturated), 2 grams of dietary fiber, 9 grams of sugar and 4 grams of protein.  The product's ingredients include: dry roasted almonds, evaporated can juice, palm oil, cocoa powder, non-fat dry milk, canola oil, soy lecithin, natural vanilla flavor and salt.<br /><br />While the product is vegetarian, it is not vegan due to the milk content and those sensitive to soy should be cautious.  If you are a vegan and/or desire something that is a little lighter in terms of sugar content, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046GRD0O">Artisana Coconut Butter-Cacao Bliss (100% Organic),8-Ounce</a> , which is a coconut butter that, when warmed, is very smooth and flavorful.<br /><br />For holiday and birthday gifts, I often pair some of my favorite teas or spreads in baskets.  This product will definitely be on my short list to give to other chocolate lovers.<br /><br />I purchase MaraNatha dark chocolate almond spread at my local co-op for about 4.50 a jar.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.

It definitely tastes and feels better than some "healthy" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.

It has a very delicate flavor (almost floral) and you don't need a lot. Will taste great on salads. A clear healthy winner.

review/text: Not really sure if I can describe this salt properly. Yes, it has a wonderful flavor without too much of a salty flavor. It's very clean tasting. Mostly, though, I think it seems "creamy". Yea, I know that sounds weird, but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment. I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.

review/text: This is good, briny large crystal grey sea salt, which for most uses I prefer to the more expensive white.

review/text: I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me.

review/text: Got this stuff and it looked like they just swept it off the beach . I think its still wet actually. We got the course and we grind it ourselves. We love it. We even took a taste test, first this French gray , then Mortons salt. Hands down we could taste the difference and we could taste how much better the French Gray was. I would get the fine salt next time. I wanted that but must have hit the course by accident. We still like it! You will too. Worth every dollar. And now im spoiled.

review/text: I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, "French gray" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.
