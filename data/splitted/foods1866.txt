review/summary: Gluten Free and Tastes Great
review/text: The ingredients listed on this page are wrong.  Actual ingredients on the box are different and ARE GLUTEN FREE.  Even my fussy non-GF husband likes this one. We've now tried several of these mixes and like them.  My only complaint is it's a lot cheaper at Walmart.  I just paid $1.50 per box there.  That's quite a price difference.

review/summary: MARINATION IS KEY!!!
review/text: Please take my advice and marinate your chicken before making this meal, otherwise you'll have plain chicken mixed in with fried rice. I recommend some toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, and ginger (add some red pepper flakes if you like heat).

review/summary: Cheaper than takeout
review/text: I just made this tonight with shrimp instead of chicken, and it was pretty good. I did not put in the eggs. I could taste the salt though. It had more flavor than my regular salt-free cooking has. It does state clearly on the box that it is "gluten free," but that is not a concern for us. For a little over a dollar a box, this is a good deal.

review/summary: Good and Definitely Worth A TRY
review/text: We made the gluten-free version of this tonight.  It was really good, I don't know what some of the other reviewers are talking about on amazon or on the betty crocker website.  First, a lack of gluten isn't going to make there be too little water, that's a failure to follow the directions.  Followed as directed it works out fine.  Second, this is worth a *TRY* if you like this dish from restaurants.  I thought it was really good and certainly for the price cheaper than Chinese restaurant chicken fried rice. I picked this up from my local grocery store for $1 a box plus a coupon I got off the betty crocker website I got three boxes for like $2.25. Also when I cooked it, it smelled good to me, certainly not nasty or inedible like some people say.  I like the new version, don't stop making it just because some people miss the old one! Everyone in my household loved it, and we didn't even have leftovers!! I will be making it again. I just wish the ingredients were a little more specific: It says "Spice" is an ingredient. Uh?? Also it says it has yellow food coloring in it, I wish they would just leave that crap out.

review/summary: Worst smelling meal I have had in a long time
review/text: As soon as I dumped the seasoning packet in I knew it was going to be bad.  My kitchen was instantly filled with an awful smell that only got worse as it cooked.  If it were up to me at this point I would have stopped and made something else.  But my wife insisted we stay the course and eat this meal.  To describe the smell I think excrement works best, I am not using this term to be funny, its just what it actually smelled like.<br /><br />Fortunately it did not taste as bad as it smelled, while it was not the best tasting, it was not as unbearable as its smell.  The recipe did not call for enough water and the rice was rather chewy.<br /><br />In conclusion I'm sure there are products out there that taste better, and definitely smell better than this one.

review/summary: Asian Helper Chicken Fried Rice
review/text: This was horrible!  It was too salty and it the rice never gets fluffly.  Even though I followed the recipe exactly there was not enough water to get the rice done, so even after adding more water and cooking longer it remained crunchy.  The rice reminded me more of macaroni than rice.  There were hardly any vegetables in it and it smelled very unappetizing.  YUCK!  I ended up feeding mine to the dog; she seemed to like it just fine.

Got this at Target and was excited since it is supposed to be gluten free, but I think the ingredients listed online are wrong..but besides that, this is the most disgusting meal in a box i have ever tried. the sauce just oozed msg and was so nasty. i mean, i like sweet sauces, and salty, but this was just beyond bad. it is not worth trying in my opinion. just mix some tamari and agave and you have a better alternative than this. i tried saving it, but it was impossible. even the dog wouldn't eat it...

review/text: C'mon Betty, overlooking the wheat in soy sauce is a rookie g/f mistake. That's usually where the wheat is sneaking in - and in the caramel coloring. Yes, General Mills, it's quite tough to eat the way we need to eat. We appreciate that you want our business but you have to get this right. I get a headache from even a little soy sauce. Take this seriously. It's our lives.

review/summary: An excellent product with hygienic handling problems
review/text: In general, Del Monte canned fruits are of excellent quality deserving of a five-star rating. These peaches are no exception...except for what seem to be persistent problems in Amazon's handling of Del Monte products.<br /><br />I use subscription purchases to get Del Monte peaches and mandarin oranges from Amazon. Of the last four shipments I have received in the last two months, three have been very unhygienic. The cans were dusty and scraped, and they looked like they had been rolling loose on a warehouse floor and then gathered up and repackaged. Cans in one shipment were severely dented almost to the point of rupturing.<br /><br />It's not clear where in the supply chain this problem is occurring. It may be in an Amazon warehouse. Or Del Monte may be selling seconds to Amazon. Either way, the product being delivered to the customer is something I would not choose myself from a supermarket shelf.<br /><br />I've advised Amazon customer service of this problem. You should do the same if this problem occurs. And I will update this review if the problem is resolved.

review/summary: The taste has changed
review/text: I am a long-time consumer of Del Monte canned products, and their 100% Juice Sliced Peaches have been my favorite as long as they have been produced.  It has not been uncommon for me to eat an entire can in one sitting, several times a week.  Not any longer...  Several months ago, this item started sporting "Improved Taste!" on the label.  When I first saw this, I wondered what they changed; the ingredient list is short, the way I like all of my ingredient lists: peaches, peach juice, pear juice, natural flavor, ascorbic acid.  (If I could get it without the "natural flavor," that would appeal to me even more.)  I do not know if they have a new source of peaches or juice or ascorbic acid, a new formula for the natural flavor they add, or a new process, but whatever they did, improvement is not a word I would use to describe the change.  My mouth still waters when I think about what used to be, but I am sorely disappointed each time I eat them now.  I do not like the new flavor, and I am left with a strange aftertaste.  This does not happen with other foods or beverages, so this is due to the product, not me.  When my current supply is gone (and I plan to give them away to speed up the process), I will not be buying any more.  Since the change, I have bought them at various times from Amazon, local grocery stores, and discount supercenters, just in case the issue stemmed from certain batches or storage conditions, but the flavor has been consistently bad.  You may not agree, and should not be afraid to try them, especially if you value short ingredient lists, as I do, but I certainly would not recommend buying a large quantity until you know for sure.<br /><br />  Another reason I chose to post a review was to agree with a posting by Rooster Eberle on 8-31-12 informing customers of multiple Del Monte canned peaches shipments he received from Amazon which were dented and dirty.  My July 2012 order of two six-packs was received in the same condition, and I canceled Subscribe and Save on this product because of it.  I threw away several of the cans, and decided I would rather hand-select my cans in a local store.  They were, indeed, in very bad condition.  I did separately contact Amazon about this recently.  Hopefully Rooster will post if future shipments arrive in better shape.<br /><br />  I have to add that I am a long-time Amazon Prime customer who places frequent orders of many types of items, and 98% of the time I am extremely pleased with products, service, and shipping.  I brag about Amazon to my friends, and suggest that they might want to become Prime members, also.  So this is not a case of sour grapes about any aspect of Amazon, just a case of sour peaches...

review/summary: Arrived melted from the heat
review/text: Saddly, I won't get to write a review about how the candy bars tasted because they were allowed to melt in the mailbox in 90 degree heat. The shipper Indulgence chose to carelessly ship the product in a USPS mailer that had no markings stating that the contents were temperature sensitive or perishable. Had they made that simple effort, my postman would have never left them to be destroyed in the heat. There was a cooling packet in the box but without any insulation...that effort was surely moot.<br /><br />When we contacted them about getting a replacement...they simply suggested that we wait until winter to order any Candy from them. Our suggestions to mark the packages fell on deaf ears. If you live anywhere that is warm at all...don't order and perishibles from them.

review/summary: The yummiest chocolate bar ever made.
review/text: I got hooked on these candy bars when I lived in London in the early 90s.  Finally, last spring, during a trip to Epcot Center in Orlando, I found a shop that had Curly Wurly Bars.  I bought 20 of them on the spot.  Little did I know, that by sharing them with my 2 sons, ages 5 and 7, I had created another Curly Wurly addict.  The supply dwindled mysteriously until they were completely gone in a few days.  THAT's how good they are, chewy, chocolatey, and delightful, and definitely worth risking a mother's wrath for.

review/text: I love cashews.  Watch out around the kids, a lot of kids are developing nut allergies these days so be careful.  But, if everyone's cool with the nuts, check out the Libman salad:<br /><br />You take some baby spinach or whatever greens you are into, 5 or 6 cups worth, and whatever else you like to throw in a salad, l'il bitty slices of celery, some carrots, cucumbers...  I'd throw in some sliced green onion and some sesame seeds too, but your call.<br /><br />Then, you throw in the honey roasted cashews.  You can even go with half a cup or more of these things.  Throw in some fresh berries.  You get crunchy, salty, and sweet all covered right there.  Now here's what you do:  Make your dressing with 1/2 cut vegetable oil, 4 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar, and 1 half teaspoon of pepper.  Seriously, it's good.  Try it, thank me later.  Goes well with Tanqueray, Sudoku, Gabby La La, dental floss, and poptarts.

review/text: I like these because there are enough cashews to pour into a small bowl and share with wife and friends over a beer.  We get and order of these for our vacation cabin, and they make a great, portable beloved snack when we visit neighbors or they pop over to our place.  The cashews keep fresh forever, and Planters has the honey roasting formula down perfectly.  Great to get via Amazon prime.

review/text: Well, I am one of those rare Americans who struggles to put on weight instead of the normal battle to lose weight. But these cashews are a great snack. A little high in fat - but also loaded with lots of good minerals. And they are not too sweet, a good mixture of honey, salt and sugar. I really like them. Just eat and enjoy.

review/summary: Healthy plant
review/text: This is one of the best purchases I have made from Hirt's.<br /><br />A brief comment on the packaging: instead of the regular tape they use at the base of the plant (I assume to keep the soil in the pot), they wrapped a lightly damp soft paper around the base and then wrapped that and the pot in plastic (I assume to hold in the moisture). It arrived in excellent condition - not a leaf was broken, the entire plant was green, and it was at the right size (not too small/young, not too old/root-bound) for repotting.<br /><br />I repotted the plant 3 days after arrival into a 9.5 inch basket, though it probably would've done just as well in the pot in which it arrived for another 1-2 weeks. It arrived fantastically healthy and has started growing wonderfully in the new pot.<br /><br />One comment on my overall purchase: the plant arrived in a 4" pot, not a 6" hanging basket. I had my own cute basket and the plant arrived in great form, so it did not change my satisfaction.

review/text: I ordered a number of plants from Hirt's recently, this one included. Each plant is healthy, robust and larger than I had expected. They were all packaged so well that as the plants came out of the box they looked as though we had taken them off a shelf at our local nursery. As these spider plants are in presentable 6" hanging baskets, they are ready to display either hanging or sitting on a shelf without the need to repot, which would be required of a 4" pot. I will be ordering from Hirt's again and would recommend this vendor to everyone.

review/text: I received 3.9 lbs in my 5 lb order.  The remaining pound consisted of catalogs.  The quality of the product was fine and it was shipped quickly.  The short quantity was the only problem, but it was 20% short.  The company told me that the manufacturer indicated that the order was shipped correctly and that they never had this problem before.  I was careful to weigh it a couple times on different scales to make sure.  KV Vet Supply Company said they believed that the order was shipped correctly.  Regardless, the company sent me a gift certificate for $5 to make up for it.  When I attempted to use it, it did not work through Amazon nor through The KV website.  The customer service person answered my emails quickly, but just trying to get what I ordered and paid for cost me far more time than it was worth and in the end I never got it.  I will not use them again.

review/text: cotton candy bubble gum is a very nice product.  i feel that it really has a similar taste to cotton candy.  it has a nice smell that people sniff the air and say: 'hey, i smell something and i don't know what it is but i've smelt it before."  then you say: "oh, that's my gum."  then they'll tell you: "no.  it's not gum."  and then you say: "does it smell like cotton candy?"  "yes."  ...<br />  anyhow, the flavor seems to last well.  it's a good large size.  it starts out soft.  as it ages [in your mouth] it will become a little firmer.  [i, personally, like that but i know some people don't like a firmer gum.  if yoy have small kids you may wish to cut the gum in half but that'll double your purchase.  so the peice is bigger then dentine, winterfresh, ...<br />  so, cotton candy bubble gum is a very nice product.

review/summary: Low carb bread mix
review/text: This bread mix is very good. The bread is a little chewy, but has a good flavor. I have to use the manual cycle and bake it in the oven in two pans, as my bread machine has only a 1-1/2 lb. capacity. The first time I used it, the bread rose so high it popped the top off and didn't finish baking. So if  you don't have a 2 lb. machine, you'll have to bake it in the oven.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Bread Mix -- Good Product, Worth Breaking Out the Bread Machine For
review/text: Being a Bob's Red Mill fan, I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDM772">Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> on a whim to try it. I have a bread machine, but hadn't used it it a long while (like many folks, I suspect). Plus, I have been watching carbs but I love bread. If you are a fan of low-carb bread (if it's possible to be a fan of anything low-carb), I think you will enjoy this product.  It produces a large loaf of fluffy, light but a bit chewy bread -- great for slicing or tearing up by hand.  It has a nice wheaty taste and doesn't have that cardboardy consistency/taste that many low-carb products have. It uses half-and-half as one of its ingredients, which I think makes it fluffy.  My only quibble: I have a two-pound bread machine and the bread consistently overflows the top of the machine at the end of the baking cycle -- creating a mushroom-like top to the loaf. So, the top is a bit underdone. I am going to try baking it in the regular oven the next time and see if that is better.  Again, Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but they are very high quality and the four packages produce four large loaves of bread that stay fresh for quite a while and travel well. (I often tuck one into my suitcase when I travel.)

review/summary: Vile
review/text: Since Atkins discontinued their low-carb bread mix several years ago, we haven't used our bread maker. I was delighted to discover someone was still making a low-carb product and ordered Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Bread Mix. I should have known we were in trouble when the anticipated "fresh baked bread aroma" never materialized. There was a slight smell... but not a good one. My wife and I both took one bite and had to spit it out. Initially, it was tasteless, but after a few seconds there was a horrible, disgusting aftertaste. We quickly toasted some regular bread to rid our mouths of the taste. Even with our regular toast slightly burned, it couldn't clear that disgusting aftertaste. Needless to say, the rest of the loaf went into the trash along with the 3 unopened packs of bread mix. This is the most vile, disgusting thing I've ever eaten. It's hard to believe that some folks actually gave this a positive rating.

review/summary: Makes Good Low Carb Bread
review/text: I am on a low carb diet because of my diabetes.  I bake one loaf of this bread and it lasts me about a week.  I have a subscription and get 4 packs a month. That averages about $4.00 per loaf.  The carb count is much lower than anything I can buy in the market and is simple to make in the bread machine. In my case, it has completely eliminated cravings for any other bread products.  I try to eat at least one slice per day, usually toast in the morning.  I have added some of my own ingredients from time to time, but that is not necessary. It may take a few days to develop a taste for it, but once you do, you won't want anything else.  By the way, this bread has helped me lose about 30 lbs!

review/text: We bought a new bread machine to use this mix. Threw out the old one years ago. I gave this bread a bad review after the 1st loaf. Just made the 4th batch, and this bread is worth at least three and a half stars. Here's what we've learned: All ingredients must be at room temperature. The water and milk should be a bit warmer. Follow the directions carefully. It'll actually smell like you're baking bread in the last hour of the process. On second taste, the bread is pretty good. Most bread depends on what you put on it, and this bread is no different. I like the whipped peanut spread. Another favorite: spreadable butter with cinnamon and a sweetener. I'm coming back for a 2nd order. I'm a bread person, and this fits the bill.

review/summary: Exceeded my expectations!!!
review/text: I have been experimenting with many different low carb bread recipes and been disappointed with all of them (horrible texture, flavor, etc).  I've been off my low-carb diet since Thanksgiving and have become addicted to the local bakery's jalapeno cheddar bread (VERY high in carbs), so I decided to experiment with Bob's Red Mill low-carb bread mix.  I had this item in my pantry for months before I made it and decided that yesterday was the day to finally give it a whirl.  I was amazed at how well it turned out!  I added in some diced canned jalapenos and a half a cup of shredded cheddar and cooked in a 2 lb bread machine (FYI - the bread did rise to the top and barely lifted the top open).  The texture is AMAZING!!!  The flavor isn't bad but still seems like its missing something.  I think it definitely needs some more flavor.  I'll probably add in a bit of splenda and a tsp of salt for starters....then maybe some garlic, basil, sundried tomatoes and maybe parmesan cheese.  It makes a great sandwich bread for the carb conscious.  I highly recommend you give it a try.

review/summary: Horrible taste! Freakish looking!
review/text: Worst experience I've ever had with bread. I usually LOVE Bob's Red Mill products. I've used everything from the low carb baking mix to their almond flour. Fabulous! But the low-carb bread mix? Awful. I bought 2 mixes. I followed instructions carefully and ended up with a mass of strawlike fingers criss-crossing over a misshapen loaf the first time. And it tastes awful! Strangely gluely, spongy, and bits of straw or cardboard. You've got to be kidding! So I try again. This time I follow instructions carefully and put my bread machine on "rapid rise" instead of standard (like the bread mix product stated). This time it's slightly better--not as many odd fingers of straw stretching across the loaf. Still, misshapen and tastes horrible. I've re-read the instructions a thousand times. I've read my bread machine instruction booklet a thousand times. No reason that this bread should come out this way, but it does. By the way, I've tried other recipes that have vital wheat gluten and other ingredients in the Bob's Red Mill low-carb bread mix. Same outcome. Horrible tasting. Could not cut the loaf (the Bob's or the homemade) at all. Was able to twist off a misshapen lump from the loaf. Ugh! I'll stick with other Bob's Red Mill products, but this one? Never again!

review/text: We just made our first loaf in our 2 lb breadmaker (which usually produces awesome loaves of bread).  The bread never rose.  It turned out to be a very dense, 1/2 sized loaf with a horrible texture on top.  After reading our breadmaker trouble-shooting suggestions, I have to wonder if the yeast was old or the flour was old.  We'll try it again (since we still have 3 bags) but so far we are completely disappointed.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY
review/text: This product did not rise in my bread machine. It's heavy and brown and yucky. It's expensive, and it requires the addition of whipping cream - a not inexpensive ingredient. PLUS, the mix should be stored in refrig. All in all this is a HORRIBLE product. Do not buy. Hodgson Mill European Cheese & Herb Bread Mix is 1000% better!

review/summary: You almost get used to it after a while.
review/text: I almost threw this loaf into the garbage when I first tasted it. Very horrible taste and texture. But I kept it in the fridge and toasted a slice every once in a while. I don't know whether it improved with age or I just got used to it, but eventually I ate the whole thing. I can't give it more than two stars though. I suggest the people who package this mix try another recipe, because the world needs a better low-carb bread mix.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: This product is fantastic.  Since I am a diabetic I have to keep my carbs down and this bread does just that.  I start it in the bread machine and when risen the first time I place the dough in two bread pans and let rise again before I bake it.  That way I can have a thick slice for about 9 gr. of carbs.  It is great with either peanut butter on it or a mix of cinnamon and Truvia.

review/summary: A diabetic who loves bread
review/text: Low carb bread is great for diabetics, however stores that do sell it charge very high prices.  Bob's Red Mill Low-car Bread Mix is more expensive than other mixes, even at Amazon, but the extremely low carb count makes it worth trying.<br />  I've baked two of the four packs we received from our Amazon order.  The taste is strong, like whole wheat.  We do like a tastier flavored bread giving us a decision to make:  tolerating the flavor in exchange for healthy bread, or ignoring the carbs for a richer taste.<br />  I'm not too enthusiastic about reordering Bob's low-carb bread mix...unless my physician makes it mandatory.  If you're on a low-carb diet, I suggest you give Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb bread mix a try.  I couldn't find anyone beside Amazon to place an order at such a good price--which included home delivery.

review/summary: Great Option!
review/text: I'm glad I bought more than one because I'm still tweaking the recipe for my bread machine.  As an earlier reviewer said, it's makes a 2-pound loaf, and I learned the hard way that I have a 1 1/2-pound bread machine.  I welcome the chewy consistency and cut it thin.  It makes TERRIFIC FRENCH TOAST (throwing a low-carb diet out the window).  I noticed a bit of egg-y-ness to the texture, but I don't mind that either.  It's a great overall way to cut your carb intake down but still enjoy bread.

review/summary: Better than average low carb taste
review/text: When folks give this a 5 star, they MUST be basing it on the taste of low carb bread. As far as breads go (Fresh made Italian being the best), this does not compare. However, if you want an edible bread that is very filling, this will fit the bill. Don't confuse this with really good tasting bread, it isn't. But it serves its purpose!

review/summary: Surprisingly edible
review/text: My doctor had told me she wanted me on a low-carb diet, and I decided on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738213861">Metabolism Miracle</a>. This diet is very restrictive on carbs, but doesn't count calories, so it's pretty easy to follow. Finding bread is almost impossible, so this came as a god-send. I have problems with my breakfasts and this will help. However, it's not really as good as bread, but it will do. I baked my first loaf yesterday, so let me break it down for you.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* doesn't give the house that good fresh bread smell<br />* it's lightly rubbery, nay, bouncy. It is a bit weird, because it doesn't break down like normal bread does when you chew it.<br />* slightly dry<br />* an after taste that reminds a bit of chewing tree, kind of nutty and it lingers for a long time. It isn't very pleasant.<br />* doesn't taste as good as normal bread<br /><br />Pro:<br />* will be a nice addition to breakfasts and lunches, and can be used with soups!<br />* probably a bread that will do great with sugar free jelly.<br />* very filling!<br />* is actually great toasted. I had planned in giving it a 3* (especially for the after taste, as I can even smell it), but because it's pretty nice toasted (feels more like toast) I am upping it to 4 stars.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy I tried it. It adds some dimension to the diet.

I've checked several specialty stores, as well as on line, over the past couple of years and what a nice surprise when I found this on Amazon.  Goes great with chicken dishes, but I served it with a cheese, salami and cracker appetizer and it was a hit.  It has a very strong, unique flavor.

review/summary: Zingy addition to a cheese roll
review/text: I love this stuff. I've tried a few brands and they're all much the same at the end of the day, but Patak's version isn't too bad at all. If you've never had lime pickle, bear in mind that it's an acquired taste, like olives. My first reaction was that it tasted like curried soap, but these days a good tiger roll with thick slabs of cheddar isn't the same without this stuff in it. It works on cheese topped oatcakes as well and when I'm most badly in need of a spice fix, I can eat the stuff straight off a spoon.

We found these Happy Hips at a specialty dog store, read the label, saw that it had no by-products, no fillers, no sugar, and no BHA/BHT or added hormones, and decided to try it.  She loves it!  It looks like bacon and is considered a treat for her, but still has the added vitamins and supplements she needs.  I would highly recommend this product (which is why I'm online trying to find more!).

review/summary: Delicious but hard to find
review/text: This is one of the best Hamburger Helper products of the line, and it's REALLY difficult to find, for some reason.  Perhaps because it's such a relatively simple and 'unsophisticated' flavor line, compared to their more fancy names and flavors.  It's a simple 10"-12" skillet meal, so if you want something exotic or 'fancier', you may think this 'beneath' you (and you'd be wrong) but the spaghetti texture and taste is excellent, and the sauce taste has the same great, satisfying taste.  For our family, I always use about twice the ground beef they recommend, but that's because my family prefers more meat.  I've always been quite picky about prepackaged pasta sauces and meal kits, and this is really the only one that we all love.  It's quite simply great tasting, easy, and very satisfying -- something adults and kids both will enjoy.<br /><br />Because it is so hard to find in local stores, I was thrilled to find this here, and am ordering a couple of the 12-packs.

It was a big hit with the whole family and no one could believe it was Hamburger Helper. It isn't gourmet, but it serves its purpose. It is easy, tasty, and quick to fix. Just the thing when cooking is not tops on the agenda, but you still gotta feed the hungry horde.

review/text: In all honesty I don't know why you'd make box spaghetti when you're already most of the way for making real spaghetti after cooking the meat. For me it was absolutely bland and flavourless. I would never recommend this. I think next time I'll just stick to making spaghetti with regular sauce and noodles. The nice part is that it doesn't take long to make I guess. I was incredibly disappointed with this product.

review/text: It's Hamburger Helper.  What can you say?  You either like it or you don't.  We do.  It's not exactly like homemade, but for a quick meal when you're in a hurry, it's okay.  The Hamburger Helper meal sizes are continuing to shrink.  These are a measly 6.6 ounces; about enough for one hungry person or two mildly hungry ones. I add a few extras--about 4 ounces of dry spaghetti noodles, a cup of additional water, some tomatoes and/or other veggies, to make a bigger meal.  Also, I quite often use ground Italian sausage, instead of hamburger, very tasty!  I look for these meals on sale, because at full price, they are just too expensive for what you get.  Hope this helps!

However, our current vet noted that Tiki Cat is high in carbohydrates and fat.

After some research I found that the sweetener used, xylitol, has this effect on many people. I never really get sick like that from anything so it's not like I was susceptible or anything.

I'm very happy with the quality of this product - all came individually wrapped in a large cardboard box as pictured. Best of all - no smell (unlike other natural pet treats or chews)! All my dogs, including a picky eater, are enticed by the buffalo (bison) taste.<br /><br />Be advised: this is not a chew product for aggressive chewers unless you are looking to give them a quick snack. Since it is jerky, it doesn't have the hardness of other products intended for longer chewing time. However, it works perfectly for my allergy-prone medium-level chewer as a 10 minute-long treat.

I've also added a can to a pound of snow peas, and cooked them together in a little olive oil with salt and pepper, for a nice side dish.

review/text: I very much dislike this dog food. The dogs both make big sloppy poops, and much more than they used to, like twice as much. Sure they like it, but they are both lab crosses, they would eat cardboard with a little grease or salt on it. Very unhappy, and trying something else.

review/text: My dogs like this food; but, since learning that some of Diamond's other "Naturals" contain powdered cellulose, I doubt that I will ever buy anything else made by Diamond.  I returned two bags that did contain the cellulose.  I don't see powdered cellulose in the list of ingredients of this product, so I've decided to keep it.  I still don't have a very high opinion of Diamond, however, and will not be back as a customer.

review/text: My picky dog likes this food, it's cheap, and it doesn't have a bunch of fillers like other dog foods, also free shipping with prime is amazing.
