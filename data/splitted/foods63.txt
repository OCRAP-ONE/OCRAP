review/summary: All Baking Soda is Aluminum Free
review/text: All baking soda is aluminum free. This is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product. Buy this because it is naturally mined and is cruelty free; but do not be duped into thinking that good ole $.59 Arm&Hammer has aluminum in it. BTW the chemical process used to make A&H is almost exactly what occurs in nature; just faster but not cheaper. It costs no more to mine sodium bicarbonate than it does to manufacture. So yes you are paying for a name.

review/text: I've found this product (Bob's Red Mill Bicarbonate of Soda or Soda Bicarb without Aluminum) to be just as I'd hoped.  I use it in a 3 to 1 (Pure Maple Syrup to Bob's Soda Bicarb) ration, respectively, as an anti-cancer holistic therapy approach to a recent rise in my (16 year) post-op PSA.  I don't have the results yet, as I'm only in my third week of use.  My next PSA lab test will tell the story.  (These tests should be conducted by the same laboratory, as differing labs employ different reagents and the results may vary to some degree.)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041CKRJC">Bob'Red Mill Aluminum-Free Baking Soda - 16 oz Bundle of 4</a><br /><br />This product is mixed with the maple syrup, heated and stirred in a LARGE pot (when mixed, the two react and create an initial rapidly expanding and foaming mixture which soon 'settles down') for five minutes, not to exceed 120 degrees farenheit.  The mixture will not remain as a homogeneous mixture; it will separate and must be stirred with each use.*  The goal is to raise one's systemic pH to above 7.  I've been keeping mine at 8 to 9.  Avoid use of sugar, white bread, meat and alcohol during therapy.  One may check several testimonials on the internet by searching for "Maple Syrup Soda Bicarb therapy".  My height is 5' 10; weight 164 lbs.  I average 2 1/2 tablespoons of this mixture morning and evening (before breakfast and after dinner).<br />  *Best to use a funnel and pour the heated/stirred mixture into a clean plastic milk bottle.  This makes re-mixing by shaking easier.<br /><br />I measure my pH at least twice daily, prior to taking each dose, using the Urine test strips purchased through Amazon made by Phinex**.  These strips will also measure one's pH by testing saliva.  (Probably more accurate at the moment tested - as the urine may have accumulated over a period of hours; a combination of high pH and, possibly a current acetic pH level.  The goal is to maintain an alkaline pH level.<br /><br />**See: [...]<br /><br />The author is NOT a member of the medical profession.

review/summary: Aluminum Free versus Natural Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda
review/text: I just called Bob's Red Mill and talked to a representative there.  I was told that the packaging has been changed and no longer states "aluminum free" but "natural".  It would be helpful if Amazon clearly stated that the packaging has been changed by Bob's Red Mill so that one will not be ordering Bob's Red Mill Aluminum Free Baking Soda when this is no longer an item.  It would save wasted time by customers who are trying to rectify  what was sent when it appears that a name change took place.  It would also spare vendors from receiving less than excellent reviews.

review/summary: Very Disappointed
review/text: What constitutes a good coffee is rather subjective. You can read countless reviews about it, but you don't know until you've tried it for yourself.  Having enjoyed peaberry coffee (I think the spherical shape results in better roasting) from many different parts of the world , I gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The beans are light/medium in roast, has a mild subdued smell.  The beans looked dry, but this is not uncommon for light roasts.  I made a fine grind of the beans, and brewed it in a press. Sad to say, it was the most disappointing cup of coffee I have had in a long time.  The flavor was stale, without any fruity characteristic of peaberries, and reminded me of a cheap cup of joe from a dirty diner.  The worst part is I am stuck with 3 lbs of terrible coffee that cannot be returned (Amazon does not accept return of food items).

review/summary: Good Flavor but dry beans
review/text: My reason for the low rating is that there was no "use by" date on the bag, making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if that's just the way Tanzanian peaberry beans roast up.  Not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products, but this supplier has found some way to get around it.  The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste. So, to find peaberry coffee from Tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up.  I expect to finish up the coffee I've purchased, but probably wouldn't buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since I have no assurance of its freshness.

review/text: I rarely post a product review, but I feel that I would be irresponsible as a consumer if I did not comment on the Tanzania Peaberry whole coffee beans. I had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and I did my best to tolerate them. To illustrate, I have consumed almost one whole bag of the three, but will have to dump the other two in the trash! The beans are stale, dry, over-roasted, with little flavor. Even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help! I resolved that this morning would be my last cup! I will have to resort to buying the Eight O'Clock brand at my local grocery store. I even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend, but decided that it wasn't worth alienating him!

review/text: I purchased this coffee because my subscription Hawaiian Peaberry coffee was wiped out due to unusual weather and insects in Hawaii.  While these peaberry beans are smaller than the Kona, they have a much more full bodied taste.  There were "hints" of cocoa bean and something else I couldn't put my finger on.  It's also about $50 less that what I pay for the Kona coffee!  Gotta love it!

review/summary: Good price for a good coffee
review/text: I've drunk whole-bean Tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years.  My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain, which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium.  Although the beans made good coffee, Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable.  An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee.  Their beans were also light to medium and, thus, had a dry appearance.  That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine, and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts.  When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended, I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct.  It has essentially the same good taste as the Tanzanian peaberry from the Tennessee roaster, and the price is lower.  I'm totally satisfied with the beans roasted by Coffee Bean Direct, and the shipping by Amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out.

review/summary: Beautiful Coffee
review/text: I was in love from the moment I opened a bag and took the first whiff.  However, it did take me a while to figure out the right brewing method, because I found it was much easier to "scald."  Might be just me though.  First I boil the water, but whereas usually I just let it sit there for about a minute to cool, here I actually poured it into a pot and let it sit for about 2 or 3 minutes.  Then I grind the beans medium-coarse (it smells heavenly) and 2 tablespoons into the french press it goes.  Pour the water in, and I let it sit for a bit longer than usual, too (still hot though).  I find that it has a very nice... sort of crunchy, hard caramelized sugar finish to it, kind of tastes like the top of a cr&egrave;me brulee.  Delicious.  I drink it black.

First of all, making a decision on what food to buy is confusing.  They have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting.  With the help of a sales clerk I picked the Medium Breed adult. My dog, at first did like the food very much but I felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food I had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it.  The ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils.  Certainly this was not worth the price tag.

The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon.

review/summary: For licorice lovers only
review/text: Once again I find myself trying to like Tazo herbal teas, but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just doesn't seem to belong, to me anyway.  This is another example where I expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong, it's just about all I can taste.  I guess I'll just give up on Tazo - who ever blends all their teas has radically different taste buds than mine!

review/text: This tea was not what I expected.  I love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product.  The tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which I enjoy.  This tea has a stronger Rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor.  Furthermore, I found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea's ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients listed on the box include:  Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Orange Peel, Indian Sarsaparilla, Chicory Root, Rooibos, Natural Flavors, Star Anise, Almond Extract and Locorice Extract

It makes great hot tea or iced tea.

review/summary: 2nd ORDER went awry
review/text: Well I bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely. Pink Salmon is very good for you.<br /><br />This time I ordered again, received ALBACORE TUNA INSTEAD OF PINK SALMON. AMAZON DOES NOT DO RETURNS ON GROCERIES SUCH AS THESE, EVEN IF NOT OPENED THAT I CAN SEE. I sent personally an email to Raincoast Trading Company based in Canada, also left a phone message as well. Delayed response, but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item. Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail. Until I found the Toll Free Amazon phone number, Amazon LLC confirmed they can not accept the return, but will send the correct item promptly. We shall see, awaiting a replacement item.<br />A minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon I am used to ordering.<br />Anyone want some tuna? O well.<br /><br />P.S. Updated  review Sept 30th 2009, I finally got the ordered item, partly because the Amazon rep corrected it when I called in and sent it fast! BTW, it cost me a Toll Call to Canada to the company without a prompt reply. That just added insult to injury. Well I was able to order from a different merchant through Amazon. Thank you Amazon for coming through :)

review/text: I grew up in upstate NY where this stuff was born. It is pretty much a regional favorite that just hasn't caught on yet - and aside from here, upstate NY is the only place to get it. What you do is use the Spiedie sauce to marinate cubes of chicken overnight, then just grill them up, slide 'em on a soft italian roll and add some mayo. Bam! Good eats! I use this stuff at home in the DC area and I would highly recommend the marinade to anyone looking for a something different in their chicken!

review/text: I love chipotle. Back here in MA when I live now, it was years before you could find any products with chipotle. Things are better now, but I still have to fetch chipotle things in CA. And I was so ticked off when TSA would not let me take this stuff on the plane. So I have been forced to order this stuff online for years. Of all my sauces though this one is my go to favorite. And it is the roasted garlic-it is a real sauce changer. It adds a complexity to the sauce that is really just different. But I love roasted garlic too. So the best of two worlds combined. I keep other hot sauces around for different ethnic foods, but when I eat hummus (which is a lot) this is the one I reach for in the fridge.

review/summary: Tastes more like a green than an oolong
review/text: Not bad.  This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it.

review/text: Our two Shih Tzu pups love Ziggies more than any other treat. We have given them Ziggies from the time we brought them home four years ago and truly, nothing makes them happier than when they hear the wrappers crinkle on these treats.  We give them these special treats when we leave for work in the morning and/or before we head out for a while in the evening.  Often we just split one treat in half to share between the two.  Ziggies aren't always readily available to order in the bulk cube and we've gone to great lengths to find them to keep our pups happy and in constant supply because they really bring joy to their little faces.<br /><br />You can use them to stuff into the rubber Kong things but we don't use them that way - we did when they were little but stopped bothering after a few weeks.

review/summary: Excellent Gift Set of Fine Green Tea
review/text: I've been a connoisseur of fine tea for many years.  Yet, I can no longer afford to frequent the fine tea rooms and tea stores that I used to, which offered my favorite varieties and international brands.  Subsequently, I've had to settle for lessor quality brands sold in most major supermarkets.<br /><br />Knowing how much I enjoy superior tea, my daughter-in-law chose Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a holiday gift.  I could not have been more pleased!  *I regret that I delayed writing this review. Yet, with Mother's Day approaching, I'm hoping for another gift set.<br /><br />Bentley's Royal Green Tea is a superb collection of fine tea which is equal in quality and taste to some of the world's best green tea I've enjoyed.  This elegantly wrapped gift-set offers 6 varieties of special blends of green tea and fruit blends, from exotic fruits to popular favorites, such as Mango or Raspberry.<br /><br />Each teabag is securely sealed in a beautifully designed packet, with an elegant artistic image representing the fruit which flavors that teabag.  Bentley's goes further by providing a sturdy wood-like case, designed with 6 separate sections, each section containing 6 teabags of one flavor.  This solid well-designed dark-green case holds a total of 36 individually wrapped tea bags in its six compartments; a case which aptly resembles a jewelry box for the true 'jewels' of exquisite fine teabags it holds.  Indeed, when you lift the firm lid on this elegant case of fine tea, you will know you have a treasure-chest of great varieties of fine green tea.<br /><br />I was especially impressed that each teabag was expertly measured and prepared to effect the perfect aroma and optimal taste for the average teacup.  No other green teabags comes close to the perfect brew one would expect from the finest loose tea sold in specialty tea stores and tea rooms.<br /><br />Whether you purchase Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a gift, or for your personal use, you will not be disappointed by the suburb quality of this wonderful selection of fruit-flavored green tea.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />April 2, 2012

review/summary: Temptations Vomiting
review/text: I have two cats. My big boy has eaten these and never had a problem...as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since I adopted him at 2 months. My girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor. Since I treat them equally these are no longer purchased. I hate to see my girl sick so I just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats. If not a problem...carry on.

review/summary: Causes Vomitting!
review/text: I've tried it with both my cats, several times. Every time they eat this, and other Whiskas Temptations products, they vomit within minutes.<br />They LOVE it, they WANT it, it's CHEAP but it makes them puke, so, I'd consider this a bad purchase.

review/summary: Causes Vomiting!!!!
review/text: Both of my cats vomit from all Temptations treats, but especially the Hairball variety. One of my cats actually is getting hairballs from these treats when he didn't before. I've tried all of them, and minutes after they eat their treats they vomit. This doesn't happen with any other treats like Whisker Lickins or Pounce.

review/summary: Not safe for kittens!
review/text: I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.<br /><br />When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package.

review/summary: Throw up Treats
review/text: I finally did the research on this temptation treats and I'm glad to see that my suspicions are correct. I have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting. Ironically, I even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting. Now is official, I stopped giving them to him as often, and then monitored him whenever I gave him any. It soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever I give him this treats. Sometimes he would vomit within minutes, and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning, but if I give him this treats, I'm sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after.  I think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients, and they probably don't do anything to other cats but I'm never buying this again for my kitty.

review/summary: Makes Some Cats Vomit
review/text: You know, I was searching the Internet for the words "temptations" and "vomit" when I came across these reviews.  I was surprised to hear that I'm not the only one who has had problems with this product.  Within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about 40 minutes.  I didn't realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her.  It's really bad because it doesn't cause the cat to throw up all at once.  It's like she can just vomit a little at a time and you're forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit ((or locking her in the bathroom (which is horrible)).

review/summary: Cats love them and they are healthy!
review/text: We do pet adoptions and also run a shelter for cats. I personally own 7 cats!!! I have absolutely never had a problem with feeding these to any of my cats.<br /><br />They have NEVER vommited from this treat, I have a hard time believing this!!<br /><br />I do know that the recommended amt of treats is only 10.. I have never fed more then 10-12 at a time!<br /><br />At home I have adopted a persian and I often use the hairball treatments with her and they actually DO WORK!!!!! I give her the suggested doce of 10 treats at a time and they are very tasty. Since, I have never seen her gag from hairballs, not once!<br /><br />All of my cats come running when I open these treats. My favorites are the vitamins as well as the hairball and the regular plain I also love to feed them. They love them all!<br /><br />The ONLY other treats I feed usually are Pounce and Party Mix but Temptations are there favortires!<br /><br />I HAVE ABOUT 8 BAGS OF THESE IN MY CABINETS... Because I have a lot of treats!<br /><br />At the shelter I run, we keep all kinds of cats and kittens and we have about 35 right now and NONE have never had any problems with these treats to date. I am sorry that others have maybe had problems but these are the most tastiest and healthy treats available. I also love that they provide GREAT dental care and tarter control.<br /><br />Providing these treats I honestly feel that my vet bills will be less in the future with also providing treats that they absolutely LOVE!!!!<br /><br />My mom and I pay the vet bills for any sick cats, we love cats!!! So far we have been blessed with wonderful healthy strays and none have been diagnosed with feline aids or Leukemia and we do vaccinate and have them tested.<br /><br />Please give these treats a try, they are awesome! Oh and also buy the large bags because it is actually saving you lots of money from buying the smaller bags.. You get about 3x the ammount!

review/summary: Vomiting Kitty
review/text: Like many others on here, my cat was vomiting within minutes of eating these "tasty" treats. She really loves them, however they don't love her back. It took me about a week to put this product and my sick kitty together. Finally after a google search, I came across these reviews. I stopped giving her the treats and so far, my cat has been vomit free. Buyer beware, this might not happen with every cat, so it may be wise to start slow with this product to see how your pet will react and build up slowly. Back to her "greenies" I go!!

review/text: And they never vomit. They wolf them down, thought I think they are crunching. They haven't TOTALLY stopped their occasional hairball hacking, but it is rare. Perhaps they would completely solve it if I could AFFORD to give them to them all the time. Only problem with this product is $$$. I would love to buy it in a larger bag . . . if they just made one. If your cat's don't like 'em move on, but definately worth a try if you want a treat that also helps with hairballs.

review/text: Bobby loves these treat so much and they work very well for hairballs. He has long hair and if he goes without these treats for a few days he is throwing up hairballs, and driving me crazy begging for his treats. I have been able to teach him to stay off of things by not giving him treats too. I  noticed that Bobby always chews them well so that may be the reason that some cats vomit.

review/text: My cat is very picky and this is the only hairball remedy that I can give him that he eats and it works!  I don't have a problem with him vomiting at all.  I give him about 8-10 treats per day (and you have to make sure that you are giving them on an empty stomach), and the hairballs pass through his system - he never spits them up.  I used to purchase them at the store, but they stopped carrying this specific type and only sell the hairball/tartar control combo ones now - my cat hates them.  So happy to find these online!

review/summary: Nice treat, make sure they CHEW them!
review/text: As with most cats I've read about here, both of mine gulp these down without even the slightest tooth mark in them.  This can make them vomit so my trick is to snap them in two so then they have to chew them because of the ragged edges.  I"m used to the snapping since I have Persians (they have smaller mouths than a regular Tom does) and these aren't hard to snap at all.  They love the taste of these although I'm not all that sure they really help with the furballs.  Does anything really help though?! :)  I do recommend these because of the great taste, but try snapping them in two if your cat has trouble vomiting after gulping his/her food.

review/text: I was reminded of my mother's cat when I read the comments about vomiting. Mom's cat gulps the Whiskas Temptations WHOLE and resembles a Kirby vaccuum! If you inhaled your food, you would vomit too! With my kitties, it is an entirely different story - they love them, they chew them, they purr. These are not a dietary supplement, they are a TREAT. I even managed to train my eldest kitty to "shake hands" using Temptations. I will definately buy them, again and again.

Amazingly there is not much of a price difference (12-9.5oz for 33.36 vs. 12-8.5 oz. for 29.83)to purchase the better quality cracker. If the coupon offer is in effect, then these crackers are also the price winner! The only disadvantage is since I think these are healthy, I eat more of them at one time than I would normally of the other brand. They are sooooo tasty w/ melted cheddar cheese on top or warmed crab dip. Enjoy!

review/text: I've bought three kinds of the Back to Nature crackers now, I'm so impressed by the brand. And with my food allergy problem, I was excited to find them. I normally get the rounds, which are terrific with my Manchego cheese.  So this time around I tried the crispy thins and the Harvest whole wheat. The Harvest whole wheat closely resembles triscuits.  A good thing.  However I'm disappointed they are so salty.  I would've strongly preferred less or no salt.  I'm perplexed about why a supposed healthy cracker would be so salty. So I won't be ordering this one again. Which is a bummer.

I most definitely signed up for "Subscribe and Save" delivery.<br /><br />Not yet 2 months later I learn the identical item now cost $55.00 for 12 boxes.<br /><br />Bait and switch?<br /><br />I think these crackers taste better than their clone parent the Triscuit. 12 boxes is just right for a two month period- I keep a couple boxes at work. Use them for bringing nibblies to gatherings and more importantly as a stable of my diet because I choose not to eat bread and I love food items with ingredient lists like this: Whole Wheat, Expeller-Pressed Oleic Safflower Oil, Sea Salt, Natural Tocopherols Added to Preserve Freshness.<br /><br />As a big city dweller who uses public trans (I don't own a car)I rely on Amazon for certain essential groceries. I pick them up at the UPS store on my walk home from the train stop. It's one of the main reasons I'm a "Prime" member.<br /><br />I'll need to cancel my "Subscribe and Save" for this item. I like to think Amazon wasn't going to send the next delivery without notifying me of the new price.<br /><br />I can get Triscuits anywhere for ~$4.50 a box, sometimes less. The Back To Nature cracker is now $4.59 a box.<br /><br />It's likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but I'm so disappointed!<br /><br />Looks like I'll be checking out the cracker selection at CostCo.

review/summary: Good crackers
review/text: These taste just as good as Triscuits in my opinion.<br />I have not found them to be overly salty.<br />I buy these as a cheaper alternative.<br /><br />If you want to know the source of any of the ingredients, you should ask the company. Soy is a natural ingredient... I am not sure what the 1 star review is about.
