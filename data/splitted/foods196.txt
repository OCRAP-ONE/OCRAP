review/summary: A bit weak for me, smells great!
review/text: This coffee does smell wonderful (mostly of raspberry and not so much the chocolate) but it tastes weak to me.  I usually prefer a donut shop taste (middle of the road for boldness) and was disappointed that this tasted a bit watered down.  I will not be purchasing it again.

review/summary: Not bad at all, just not my favorite
review/text: As a relatively new Keurig user (former Senseo user), I have been trying various flavored coffees along with regular pods.  This coffee was not bad, just not my favorite flavor combination.  I'm not sure why because how can you beat chocolate and raspberry.  This is just a personal preference issue.  The product was received in a timely manner and arrived in good shape.  So far my favorite flavored coffee is Timothy's Sugar Bush maple. This flavor may work well for you.  Enjoy

review/summary: Incredibly disappointing
review/text: The idea of creme brulee coffee sounded so delicious.  It took a week and a half to get here so we were REALLY looking forward to trying it for the first time.  How disappointed we were.  There's absolutely nothing that indicates a creme brulee flavor or even anything with a slightly sweet (or sweet smell).  This is a smokey coffee and I think that makes a difference.  There's a somewhat nice aftertaste but it's nothing like we'd expected.  Now I'm pouring sugar and cream, or flavored cream, in it just so it's not wasted.  We have the vanilla flavored coffee in this brand so we really thought this would be amazing.  What's not amazing is that I'll never see my $33 again.  I can't wait until we drink it all up just so we can forget it ever happened.

Given some of the very negative reviews of this product,  perhaps it is a discontinued item or maybe it is not a Van Houtte product.

review/text: Awful, Awful, Awful!  I like a lighter roast and I really love french vanilla so I was thrilled to find this one.  With the first sip I was highly disappointed.  It has a very strong artificial flavor that doesn't taste anything like french vanilla and it certainly doesn't taste like coffee.  Like one other reviewer said, I'll probably just toss it in the trash and throw that money away because I don't know anybody who would enjoy it.  YUK!

review/summary: One of the best k cups we've tried so far!
review/text: I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla. It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!<br /><br />Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either. It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.

review/text: I have been drinking this Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee for quite a while and recommending it to all my friends.  I LOVED it!  My first conscious thought every morning would be of that great-tasting cup of coffee.  YUM!  So what happened to it?  The last few boxes have been absolutely tastless :(  There is no wonderful aroma either.  I might as well be drinking hot water.  This is SUCH a disappointment.  That wonderful flavor is now only a memory.  Sadly, I am giving up on Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and will purchase another flavor from now on.

review/text: After seeing all the reviews for this, I had to try it and now need to order another box of them. The smell of it brewing alone is probably enough reason to want to get more, but it tastes just as good as it smells. I've come to expect the same aromatic results from other kcup flavors and every other kind I have tried hasn't come anywhere near how this one brews. I find myself sniffing other flavors while they're brewing to see if there is any smell at all and I'm generally disappointed. This is my favorite flavor thus far!

review/summary: Decadence without the guilt!
review/text: I am happy to find that Amazon carries the Van Houtte k-cups, as the pricing is far better than other resources for k-cups.  This k-cup flavor strikes a nice balance between coffee and the chocolate and raspberry flavors, and you can feel like you're enjoying a nice truffle candy without the calories or guilt.<br /><br />The two box packaging is a plus if you're like me and have a Keurig at home and another at work.  This way, a box can go to work and the other stay home.  NOTE: these are the 24 count boxes, too, not the 12 or 14 that seem to fill the shelves of the local supermarkets, WalMart and department stores!<br /><br />If you're new to the K-cups and want a flavored coffee that delivers the flavor in the title, you can't go wrong with any of the Van Houtte varieties.  The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle and French Vanilla are my favorites, followed by Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee and Mudslide.

review/summary: Meh....
review/text: I would actually give this coffee 2-1/2 stars, as I don't hate it, it isn't awful, but very "meh" for me.  As others have said, nice raspberry aroma and noticeable raspberry taste, but that's it.  The only flavor I detected (close to overriding the coffee altogether, so you could almost be drinking flavored hot water) is the raspberry.  The coffee is WEAK, no buts about it.  If you like coffee with body/"legs", you won't be happy.  Very watery-tasting 'mouth feel.'  I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz "cup" I brewed *two* K-cups - one 6 oz. and one 8 oz. - likely smaller than most people would brew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had brewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder. Maybe try adding 4 oz. shots of it to a full-bodied coffee.

review/text: I like strong coffee and found that some of the other K Cups were too light tasting.  This is the best one yet.  This is all i drink now.  I like mochas and sweet coffee drinks from Starbucks and Coffee Bean, so that should give you an idea of how my taste is skewed.  I mix this coffee with International Delight "White Chocolate Mocha" creamer and it is the bomb!  Perfect hint of raspberry with the chocolate truffle flavor.  You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Terrible waste of chocolate and raspberry flavors
review/text: I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.  I drink a lot of flavored coffees and decided to try this one due to the rave reviews and being a combo of two of my favorite flavors.<br /><br />I've gone through one box, and am either giving the second one away (if I can find someone to take it) or just pitching it.  The quality control on the flavorings is HORRIBLE.  One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a "tinny" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.<br /><br />If the flavor/strength of the chocolate and raspberry were consistent throughout, it would be two and a half stars.  As it stands, it's more of a waste of water and electricity.

It is nearly OK.<br />Strong after taste , flavor is  fake.<br /><br />If anyone reading this knows what brand is great, please post so I can try out. The original one I tried was incredible, thus my fruitless search for perfection.

review/summary: Dog Approved!
review/text: I received a Kyjen Tennis Slider to review, and at first I was skeptical. It seemed flimsy and gimmicky. My two dogs changed my mind, and a friend's dog has also tried it and given her approval too! All three dogs thoroughly enjoyed learning to move the individual flaps of the puzzle toy to release one and then both tennis balls, and then moving the center piece to slide up or down, revealing treats! All of the dogs figured the puzzle out within minutes, and each has their own style. My Rott paws it open, bashing it with his giant paws. My Lab nosed it for a while, then picked it up and tossed it. My friend's Terrier mix nosed it open. This is a great way to keep the dogs thinking and to give an outlet for some mental energy. I thought it was flimsy, but so far even with the abuse dished out by close to 200 lbs of dog so far, it only has a few minor scratches, so I would say it is holding up nicely!<br /><br />The bad: the dogs solve it too quickly, and there is no way to make it harder. Additionally, I am not sure how it will hold up in the long term, but I will let you know!<br /><br />Feel free to read the entire review at: [...]

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: This was a great treat. I got it as a gift for family with two young labs and it was so interesting for all of us to see how interested they were. The more 'biddable' bitch was attracted, but the more 'rambunctious' male stayed nosing and chewing at different angles until he discovered how to lift the cups and get to the treats inside. He quickly became an expert and was easily lifting and dropping the cups, while his friend stayed close and occasionally sneaked a treat out before her could get to it. Don't leave the dogs to play with the cups, or they'll chew them out of shape and they won't lift out as easily. Great fun and gave us a better understanding of the dogs.

review/text: This game was great...for about 3 days.  My 7-month old lab mix spent a lot of energy (yay!) figuring out how to get the treats.  Unfortunately after about 3 tries, he had it totally mastered.  Even tightening it up to the max was still too easy.  It also completely broke after about the 5th use.  Might be great if your dog is smaller or less energetic.

review/summary: Cut my dog's mouth :-(
review/text: As a previous reviewer stated, the wells for the treats in this game were too narrow and deep for my dog's nose/mouth to reach the treat. The very first time she tried it she cut her mouth on the plastic edges and started bleeding.  I didn't think this would happen as she isn't a large dog with a big snout (30 lb. Cocker Spaniel mix) - her snout is longer and thinner than an average Cocker. It would have helped to know the size of the treat compartments to have an idea of the size before I purchased this. I measured it myself and it is about 1.5" deep, 2 1/8" wide and 2 1/4" long. Seems big enough, but it wasn't. Additionally, only 1 of the 3 yellow compartment covers that are meant to flip up to expose the treat actually stay up long enough to allow a few seconds for the dog to get the treat. The other 2 fall down right away on top of the dog's face which could result in more cuts to the eyes or other parts of the face. I was disappointed because my dog was excited to play and find the treats, but I couldn't let it continue with her being cut. Good game concept, but edges of the toy need to be more smooth and rounded. I am returning this tomorrow.

review/summary: Good for long toungues or really small faces
review/text: Even though this appears to be intended for dogs, I bought this for my cat Digby. He is very smart and likes puzzle toys (the ones that conceal treats of course). The problem with this toy is the depth of the 'bowls' that hold the treats. Digby cannot get his snout deep enough into the bowls to get the food. I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat. This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it. If your pet can lick the inside bottom of a jelly jar, perhaps this will be a good item to get them.

review/summary: Great for slowing down feeding time!
review/text: This is a super easy puzzle it took my standard poodle who is about 6 months old about 3 minutes to figure it out the very first time. So I don't think it makes the best puzzle, but it is amazing at slowing down chow time.  I fill all four compartments up with kibble.  I holds about 2 cups of food, and it extends eating time from 2 minutes to 10 minutes.  Which means less gas for my dog and sweeter air for me.

The cups will break if chewed on, but they're not intended to be chew toys.

review/summary: Two paws down
review/text: My ten pound Yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food, he isn't playing.  We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to "spin" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't "Paw-centric" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw. Granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended, but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product. (yes I'm a worry wart pet parent, but you'd be amazed at the predicaments our pets have gotten themselves into...)

We just have to watch she doesn't try to eat the yellow cups but the blue part is durable.  She easily figured out, tho, that she can move it around instead of spinning the disc to get the treats out.  She knows where we store this game and tries to get into the cabinet to get it out!  Great price at Amazon and a good value dog toy.  I would buy this again.

review/summary: Star Spinner Treat Game A Hit
review/text: I have two dogs that received this gift from Santa and figured it out pretty quick since Santa pre-filled it. They play with it until it is empty... as most dogs would, I suspect, since they can smell the food inside. They seem to really enjoy it. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it needs really small bits of food/treats and is not so easy to fill. I end up with quite a bit of food on the floor while trying to fill it. I might try to find some really small cookies to put inside to cut down on the frustration of filling it. My dogs like it though and that is all that matters to me!

review/summary: Great interactive toy for dogs!
review/text: My two year old Havapoo (half Havanese, half Poodle) loves this toy! She is food motivated and she is smart so I thought this would be a good challenge for her. It took her five minutes to figure out how to remove the yellow cup. In the beginning, she was pawing at it. Finally she figured out a way to remove the cup with her mouth. Within ten minutes she was able to find all the hidden treats. After this exercise, she was a bit tired from all the mental stimulation, she took a nap for a couple hours. LOL. It was just the right level of difficulty for her. There was a tiny bit of frustration but any more frustration, she would have given up. Now, this is the only way she has dinner. She is getting more and more efficient at removing the cups. I didn't know if this would be too big for her mouth, but she has no problems. This is a great toy and a fun way to keep your dog stimulated and active.

review/summary: Love it!!
review/text: I'm happy to say that all three of my dogs had no issue with the yellow covers cracking. They are hard plastic, but they are fairly thick and don't give even to a hard squeeze. My dogs all realized that the object was to get the covers out of the way, not to chew on them, so that may be the issue. My 4-month-old German Shepherd figured this out very quickly and even put the little covers back on after all the treats were gone, as if she expected them to refill magically, lol! It took my 3-year-old golden retriever a bit more time to figure out and she used her paws quite a bit whereas the puppy was all teeth. It was very interesting to see them try different ways of figuring out the puzzle. However, my 3-year-old malamute is kind of a baby and he tried very briefly before he looked at me and started to whine. Clearly it's not as much fun for a furbaby who is used to having everything handed to him! My girls still get very excited every time we pull this out though. We always use a high value treat in the puzzle, something special that they don't get every day. They will play the game over and over and over as many times as I refill it. I definitely think this is something most dogs can do on their own if you need to keep them busy for 10-15 minutes but my girls seems to enjoy it even more when I'm there cheering them on every time they have a success. The materials are very durable, in my opinion, and clean up couldn't be easier. The holes are very easy to wipe clean and a quick rinse under the faucet for the rest is generally all I need to do for the rest. Wonderful toy at a great price if you have highly intelligent dogs who get bored easily!

review/summary: Good fun, but too easy
review/text: We have a 16 week Cocker Spaniel-Australian Shepherd mix (~20 lbs). We got this toy for him when he was only around 10 weeks old.  It was challenging for him the first time.  When we gave it to him the next day, he knew exactly what he was doing and got all the treats out within two minutes.  We even timed it.  Now, as soon as we set it on the floor, it takes only a few seconds for him to get each compartment open, and we don't give it to him very often.  It's a cute/fun way to deliver some treats, but it's not long before he's looking at us like, "Okay, now what?  What's next??"<br /><br />Pros: Opens easily so it's not too frustrating.  The star design makes compartments a bit more challenging if the treats are pushed further inside.  You can put a dab of peanut butter in a few, and it will take him longer to lick it out, but you might have to clean it after.  The grips on the underside really help hold it in place so that he doesn't slide it around the floor too far or too quickly. It has withstood his strong bite/chewing. It is rare that he flips it over, too, so it's weighted well.<br /><br />Cons: Too easy, finished with it and bored within a minute, if not a few seconds.

It does serve well as a puppy food/snack bowl if your pup eats too fast - making him move from compartment to compartment to eat will slow him down. Not great for trying to improve or test your puppy's IQ, but a fun way to feed him.

review/summary: Dog's Completely Enjoy This Toy!
review/text: This dog toy puzzle comes assembled (which I completely appreciated) and was easy and straight forward to set up for our two dogs. It truly put our Rottweiler's problem solving skills to the test and proved to be quite interactive and entertaining for our German Shepard. Colorful and easy to store, the Star Spinner has been a good addition to our household.<br /><br />This is a social writeup!

review/summary: My Dog gave it 2 paws up :)
review/text: My Large Shepard/Chow/Collie Mix is very smart and easily bored. Lets just say he can disembowel a stuffed toy in seconds. Anywhoo, we needed to find a toy that at least challenges him a little bit. The Paw puzzle was fun for him and my family to use. He's definitely food motivated so this was a perfect fit. At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy. Other than that its fun, and well worth it.

review/summary: Affordable Dog Puzzle!!!
review/text: I bought this puzzle to help entertain my smart and curious and food driven dogs. My "boys" love it! We play it every single day. Often to work on obedience (sit, get it, down, get it!) and just for fun administration of treats and even dinner. My golden retriever loves it, but is a chewer, so he must be supervised with it. He pulled the cups out and thought that in itself was the reward... LOL  but once I simply pointed to the treat hidden in the pawprint dish, he figured it out and was a happy camper. I also bought the spinner, which is actually my favorite of the two styles. I can get my golden's entire kibble allotment for one meal (we feed twice a day) inside it, so it slows down his feeding (so he doesn't gulp it down and get bloat). I know that my dogs love it by the perked ears and bouncing when they see me pick one of the toys up. They also sit and wait to be "released" to start their game. Great fun! The plastic is nice too since you can disinfect it easily or wash it in the sink without worrying about warping, splitting, or cracking wood like on the expensive models of similar toys. Plus, the price has been great and I found it at my local canine speciality store too!

review/summary: too easy, even for "not-so-smart" dogs
review/text: i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy, and *bonus* got a iive person on the phone (brownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy.  See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further.<br /><br />However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser,  Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead.

review/summary: Affordable Fun for your Dog!
review/text: I have a golden retriever as well as a pembroke welsh corgi. They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the "name brand" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their "drive" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win!

review/summary: good even for dogs that might not be too bright
review/text: i have to admit - i was worried this was a big mistake when i first gave this toy to Bacon.  he was confused.  he first tried barking maniacally to get the treats to appear.  he then tried digging into the carpet next to the toy.  i wondered if i'd be able to send the toy back, as there was no way i would pull this toy out again if all it did is prove that my dog is not smart and barks too much.  luckily, within 15 minutes, he successfully unearthed a treat.  it's not an easy toy for him - but it's amazing to me that he has learned how to do it.  he's learned a bit of patience and problem solving.  two things i doubted he'd ever learn.<br /><br />the yellow plastic parts - we've lost one.  i'm really not sure what Bacon did with it.  i just use that open cubby as the 'easy hole' for him to find a treat in.  Bacon is a schnorkitzu (schnauzer yorkie shihtzu). i imagine larger dogs would chew the yellow parts up pretty quickly.<br /><br />i'm looking forward to getting another puzzle toy in the future.  i recommend this toy.

The first time we gave it to him it took several minutes to get all the tops off and get the food; however, by the third time it was introduced to him he had mastered it in 1-2 minutes.  We now use it as a way to feed him full meals so that he doesn't eat too fast.  Love that it is dishwasher safe but wish it kept him entertained a while longer.

It took a little time for her to figure out how to remove the pieces without them falling out but she stayed with it so it wasn't frustrating just stimulating. She finished her meal in 20 minutes and then grabbed a chew toy and jumped on the couch. I know Lily likes this toy and so do I. The price makes it extremely likable also. I will point out that Lily thought the yellow pieces were chew toys so I had to take them away when she was done with it. It's a fun quiet meal dispenser

review/summary: Good idea - implemention flawed. Maybe good for small dogs.
review/text: I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning "nosework" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I'll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don't see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective "nosing the flap" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2"x2" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could "find" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she "finds" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-

My other dog (the chi x you see in the picture) has absolutely no interest in working for his food. So I guess it's not for all dogs, but if your dog is busy, this is a good way to occupy him for awhile.

review/summary: Good idea however....
review/text: This toy is not that great for my pug. He loves finding stuff in the little cups, however the yellow covers are impossible for him to get off. His mouth won't fit around them so he can't pick them up with his teeth, when he uses his nose to try to get at them the cups just fall back into place and if he uses his paws (that's when he's really frustrated) he winds up just flipping the whole thing over. I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped. It's not a bad toy as a starter puzzle but if your dog has done puzzles before, this one won't keep him interested. And if you have a dog with no snout, it's not really worth it.

She loves her chew toys but she needs to be challanged.  First of all she found her toy under the tree wrapped and without a treat in it.  How did she do that?  With encouragement we allowed her to open her toy.  I took it away after she examined it.  While she wasn't looking I put a few treats in a few of the compartments.  It took her a few minutes to figure it out.  Next time, no challange at all.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.  It was too easy, but I think to some dogs it will be great, others fustrating.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043A71PU">Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy</a>

review/summary: Amazing Toy!!!
review/text: My dog loves this game.  As soon as he sees it, he runs over and waits for his command.  Even though there are 7 areas to hide treats, I usually only do 4 or 5.  When I give him the commad "Find the treats" he sniffs by each cover until he finds the one with the treat.  Then he gets his jaws around the cover and tries to pull it off, sometimes not on the first attempt.  He goes around until he has pulled off each cover that holds a treat.  The ones that are empty, he does not bother to remove the cover.  Really AMAZING Toy!!!!<br /><br />I would recommend keeping the toy hidden until it is time to play, especially if your dog is a chewer.  The covers are small and can be chewed up quickly.

I might even ue it sometimes just to put his dinner in so it will take him a little longer to go from well to well instead of gobbling down his bowl of food.  I do like the fact that the toy is all plastic so it can easily be washed.

review/text: Not a bad starter puzzle, especially for the price.<br /><br />My Lab/Border Collie had it totally figured out within about 20 minutes, so it wasn't super challenging for her. She had more issues with the cups located in the "palm" section of the paw. It was hard for her to get her mouth on them, and almost impossible to "slide up."<br /><br />The primary complaint I have with this toy are the yellow cups. They are flimsy and could be easily cracked into pieces with very minimal effort for a decent sized dog, or an aggressive chewer.<br /><br />DEFINITELY do not leave your dog alone with the toy. (This should go without saying..but...)<br /><br />Would I recommend the toy? Maybe. I think it would be ideal for medium sized dogs that aren't too smart for their own good. (If your dog can unscrew things, open doors, drawers, etc..then you may want to go for a more challenging toy. I wish I had of.)

review/summary: Kyjen Dog Games Treat Wheel (Misc.)
review/text: I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup

review/summary: decent puzzle game
review/text: clearly the more expensive puzzle games may offer more, but for what you pay, this is nice.  My dog enjoyed it, and caught on after a try or 2.  at first she took the yellow cover and ran... thinking that was the prize, but i called her back to show her the treats, and then it was on!

review/summary: Think of this not as a puzzle or toy but more of an interactive feeder
review/text: I would definitely agree with others that this is not a very challenging puzzle toy.  So why do I give it 5 stars?  Well, challenging or not, this toy keeps my dog engaged and happy while eating!<br /><br />When my husband and I adopted our little dachshund/miniature schnauzer mix, he wasn't eating very much.  The vet told us that once he acclimated to his new owners and surroundings, his appetite would pick up.  Well, it didn't.  After two months, he still would not eat very much out of his bowl.  He would take 3-4 bites and would walk away from all his food.  My husband and I had to force our dog to eat or hand feed him - neither of which we liked.<br /><br />I read up on dachshunds and found out that they are hunting dogs.  I thought that maybe if we made getting his meal a bit more of a hunt or challenge that he would like it more - and sure enough, I was right!  Ever since we bought this star toy, he eats ALL his food with no problems!  It is such a relief not to have force or hand feed our dog and to not worry if our dog is getting enough food.  The fact that he enjoys it and likes it so much is just the icing on the cake and makes us so happy!  So, for our dog, it's more of an interactive feeder than a toy or brain game but we feel that it was well worth the money paid!<br /><br />We've had it about a month now and our dog eats out of it 1-2 times a day and it's holding up just fine.  He is a big chewer and he's tried to chew this a few times but so far, has not done any damage.  We have high hopes that this will last for a while!

review/summary: Flimsy plastic, easy to solve
review/text: My dog had this mastered in less than 5 minutes. It takes me longer to hide the treat in it than it takes for him to solve the puzzle. Pieces made of thin plastic. My dog had more fun chewing on the pieces than looking for the treats.

review/summary: Too easy for my dogs
review/text: Nice product, but just too easy for all three of my dogs. The compartments are fairly small - so this would be best for a medium to small dog. This might be a great thing to use if your dog eats too fast... you could put their meal in all the compartments.

review/summary: Challenging Dog Toy for my Smart Puppy! Great Dog Game!
review/text: My yellow lab loves staying busy and trying new things. After my dog, Homer played the Paw Hide-Dog Toy Puzzle it confirmed how smart he actually is. There were treats placed under each puzzle piece. He was able to figure out the game and get the prize...the treats! It keeps him entertained and I can really tell that he likes it. I have been bragging to all my friends that my dog has a puzzle game and that he actually understands it. Such a smart puppy! Awesome!<br /><br />This is a social writeup

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: My dogs love this puzzle and I think have a lot of fun with it. This is the 3rd dog puzzle I've bought(each were different brands), and this one has been the easiest so far. My one dog caught on to all the puzzles right away but my other dog is a slow learner and it took him a while to get how the other two we had worked, but with this one, he didn't need any help and figured out how to get the treats right away.

review/summary: Toy for a bored and smart dog
review/text: If your dog is bored and destructive at home, this would be a great toy for you, especially if your dog is food-driven. Even my dog, who doesn't like to play much anymore was instantly interested in the bits of chicken. Although she got some help from my young son, when we leave her at home, this will be a great treat for her, so she won't be so sad when we leave.<br /><br />This toy is a great idea for any dog owner.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup.

review/summary: Great Toy to get dogs thinking!
review/text: I have two rat terriers, and they did not understand instantly what they had to do.  They actually had to think and use their powers of deductive reasoning to figure out how to get to the treats.  Their main drive in life is to eat, and then play, so this was perfect.  I loaded the treat compartments with their favorite chicken stick treats and then rotated the base and put the plastic puzzle pieces in.  It took them about 10-15 minutes of playing, barking and trying to get to the treats.  Eventually they figured out that the puzzle pieces ALL had to be removed before they could spin the base and reach their goal.  It was so much fun to watch.  Great toy Kyjen!<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup

review/summary: Too hard for a small dog to use
review/text: My toy poodle was quite interested in this toy, but it proved difficult for him to play with.  He has a small mouth and it was hard for him to pick up the yellow pieces to get at the treats.  It was also hard for him to rotate it on its base to expose the other treats.  I think this is a fine toy for bigger dogs, but Liam is only 7.7 lbs.  My husband also didn't like all the noise.

review/summary: Cool Toy  Lots of Fun
review/text: My two dogs (father and son) just loved this toy.  They played with it for hours, back and forth.  They liked trying to get the ball out of the ball and did not seem to tire of it.  Fortunately, they are not chewers, as this might be dangerous for those whose dogs are. A unique idea that seems to work!  Great for small to medium size dogs.<br /><br />This is a Social Write-up Review.

review/summary: Rover Rescue for a little chewer
review/text: The Rover Rescue ball is perfect for all sizes of dogs.  I have 2 3 lb. yorkies and they love this toy.  The little rover inside has a great squeeker.  You put it inside the moon ball and the dogs go crazy to try and get the rover out of the ball.  This toy will keep them entertained for hours.  Also there is no material to rip get torn...the entire thing is a soft rubber and is completely washable.

review/summary: I LOVE MY DOG
review/text: I have a Bigon Fri Maltipoo. He is soooo cute and I give him nothing but the best. He is sweet and friendly.<br /><br /> When he saw this product he first ignored it but I turned my back and then he stuck his little paw in the large shape to get the ball. Such a cute lil guy. Also since he is color blind like all dogs of course, the neon ball was very interesting to him. He rolled it around the house happily. The red part is great too because I can actually clean it unlike his other furry toys. I'm so happy a company actually took the time and effort to create such a great product with your dog in mind.<br /><br />Thanks CAGEY :)
