review/summary: Love this sauce!
review/text: This stuff is great, i put it on almost everything.  I like the 3-pack of the large bottles because I don't have to buy it as much.<br /><br />I've noticed that the price tends to fluctuate a lot, between $12 and $18.  It's still a good deal, but kind of frustrating when I check back a week after my last purchase and it's $2 less.

review/summary: The chileheads' perfectly-balanced "ketchup".
review/text: Jared Castle mentioned in his review: "Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at Bon App&eacute;tit magazine, predicts Sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!" I must state that Mr. Knowlton doesn't know what he's talking about and that this chilehead banging out this review was aware of and used Sriracha since 1995 (at least). And it isn't like it's a big breakthrough: Guy Fieri of Food Network fame has been to plenty of "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" where Sriracha is used not just as a condiment but as a prime ingredient.<br /><br />What is not to love about this sauce? It is nice and thick, has a coarse chili and garlic texture and packs a perfect Asian taste of chili heat and pungent garlic. It is a perfectly balanced sauce which isn't too hot or too weak. It presents a nice punch yet isn't overpowering.<br /><br />It's such a great sauce that shady people have tried to imitate Sriracha and failed horrendously. There's one counterfeit that had a yellow lid on his while the bottle tried to mimic the genuine article. The flavor of that counterfeit was sickeningly sweet and had little chile and garlic flavor. Horrible! For those looking for the Real Sriracha the following is copied directly from Huy Fong's website circa 2004:<br /><br />---8&lt;--cut--here--8&lt;---<br /><br />The counterfeit products are identical to our products in all regards, including the logo and wording on the label, except for the following distinguishable characteristics.<br /><br />1.  That taste is not identical to our product.<br /><br />2.  Below the green cap of our bottles, there is a protruding plastic ring, which is the same diameter of the green cap.  The counterfeit product's ring is much smaller.<br /><br />3.  Our product's batch code consists of two lines printed with a laser etcher, which produces a clear, colorless imprint.  The first line states the product/batch code (must start with an H) and the second line states the expiration date.  The counterfeit does not have a product/batch code but has an expiration date that may be either be printed in black ink or or hot-stamped resulting in a colorless, blurry imprint.<br /><br />4.  Finally, our bottle has 'Huy Fong USA' embossed on the bottom of our bottle.  The counterfeit does not.<br /><br />---8&lt;--cut--here--8&lt;---<br /><br />Accept neither substitutes nor imitators: Huy Fong's Sriracha sauce is the real deal. And, ounce by ounce, is quite inexpensive. Event Sprawl*Mart carries it, though I'd rather go down to the Strip District in Pittsburgh and pick up a bunch of 28oz bottles cheap.<br /><br />It's not just awesome sauce: It's sublime sauce! This is something that should be mandatory in any refrigerator's condiment rack.

review/summary: A Potent Hot Sauce, similar to Tabasco, but Much Better. Buy the 28oz which costs only a few cents more
review/text: This is an excellent hot sauce - quite potent on a drop per drop basis. Beyond its considerable heat there is a subtle sweetness to it and also a vague hint of garlic. Compared to traditional hot sauces (such as Tabasco) this sauce has better flavoring and lacks the harsh vinegar after-taste of Tabasco and so many other hot sauces.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label) Chili, sugar, salt, garlic ... etc<br /><br />This sauce is quite potent on a drop per drop basic. Notice that "chilies" are the first (major) ingredient in the sauce. That is a fairly rare. More often it is water.<br /><br />This sauce is available in two different sizes - 17oz and 28oz. Quite often these two different sizes are priced only a few cents apart. Keep that in mind!<br /><br />This sauce is widely distributed and can often be found in any supermarket --- just look in the Asian food isle.<br /><br />The overall favoring of this sauce is clearly superior. There is a wonderful balance of heat against a vague hint of sugar with subtle garlic notes. I'd recommend this sauce to anyone, a true staple worthy of being in any kitchen and one of my top 5 choices. It is that good!<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato is simply the sun ripened chilies and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- this sauce is a great buy.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned - given the potency of this stuff - you probably only want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this sauce locally or one at a time at Amazon and not in the 2/3/6 packs. I doubt that many households will go through a bottle a year. Hard core hot sauce users might go through a 28oz bottle in a few months. As I said: this is potent stuff.<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too "hot" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh but sweeter note

review/text: It's hard to imagine a decent meal I prepare these days without Sriracha.  I put it on everything: eggs, sandwiches, Chinese, pizza, burgers, etc.  As someone who's attempting to eat healthier, sometimes the healthy food is a bit bland.  Add a bit of 'Rach, and what was bland instantly becomes flavorful and delicious.  I love Sriracha and can't imagine eating food without it.  And with Amazon's great price and free shipping with Prime, I will never buy it in a grocery store again.

review/summary: Powerful Flavor
review/text: This product contains a nice strong chile/garlic flavor. Anyone saying otherwise is desensitized. It is not sweet despite the sugar being listed as number 2 on ingredients. A quick look at the nutrition facts shows only 1g of carbs, VERY little sugar content. Pretty much a chile sauce with an equal part garlic flavor as garlic is fairly potent in small amounts. The heat is comparable to Tabasco sauce I suppose. This sauce is also fairly low in sodium (100mg/5g/4%) which is hard to find these days depending on what kind of food you like to eat.<br /><br />I use this in place of ketchup(or BBQ sauce etc..) and along with other hot sauces to bump the heat up considerably. I also use it as a base with Worcestershire, soy sauce, hot sauces and seasonings to create a stout steak sauce baste for flat iron steaks or grilling. The flavor is sort of like this: half/half Heinz chili sauce-cocktail sauce, and garlic (at least this is how I'm afflicted, I haven't eaten those in awhile since I have Sriracha :) ).<br /><br />This is my ketchup replacement which covers a wide variety of foods for most people including me. If you like garlic, mild heat, and chile flavor this is for you -- Don't even hesitate to run down to the local stop-n-shop and get a bottle to try then come back here and get the deal.

review/summary: Okay but not the best
review/text: I've used this sauce off and on for years.  Generally, though, I don't use it much compared to many of the other hot sauces in my fridge.<br /><br />For a sriracha, you can't beat Shark brand.  Hot and spicy, sweet and flavorful, it's excellent.  Huy Fong will blast you with a sharp, sweet, flavorless heat that does nothing but give me a corresponding sharp tummyache.  I don't know why, I eat hot food constantly, even foods seemingly hotter that Huy Fong's.  Maybe it's all the sugar in it, but if I want to add pure heat there are better ways to go- fresh smashed chiles, jarred paste, even crushed red pepper (especially thai peppers) are excellent.<br /><br />If this is your only choice, buy it, but hold out for Shark- still quite hot but with a much better flavor.  (See the review by Jared Castle, it's a "real" Thai hot sauce.)  Once you go Shark you'll never go back!<br /><br />Huy Fong sriracha:<br /><br />Heat:  4-5<br />Flavor:  2<br />Overall: 3

review/summary: Good Value
review/text: This is a very good value. The price has increased over the past year, but that seems to be true with most things. It is a far lower price than retail and the flavor is so much richer than the standard chocolate powders in the common supermarkets.<br /><br />In response to those who complained about the box containing a plastic bag with the plastic tie as the only closure, what do you expect from bulk purchases?  How do you think restaurants receive their bulk goods? It is something to be expected and I have no fear of contamination since it comes directly from the factory. I am quite happy with my purchase. This is real chocolate that must be mixed into milk...not water, as it does not contain powdered milk or artificial oily milk substitutes. I don't buy those as I like my chocolate made with real milk. This powder does not dissolve quickly in cold milk, but I make a syrup of it (1 part water to 1-2 parts chocolate powder) and keep a small jar of it in the fridge for summer days when I crave some cold chocolate milk.<br /><br />This is a good all purpose chocolate powder and can be used for baking when a sweetened chocolate powder is called for. When I want truly gourmet hot chocolate for special occasions, I dissolve pieces of dark solid chocolate in hot  milk and whisk vigorously while heating the milk on the stove. For normal use, Ghirardelli's is great.<br /><br />I did check the weight of my product and it was a full 10 pounds. I had not thought to check the weight on previous shipments.

Mine is a full ten pounds, in a heavy-weight plastic bag closed with a zip tie.  My local grocery store, which carried this product for years, seems to have dropped it, and I've found no acceptable substitute.  It makes simply the best hot cocoa from real milk and the brownies just cannot be beat.  The recipe does not come with the bulk box, nor could I locate the recipe on the Ghirardelli web site, so save a one lb can if you still have one.

review/summary: I really do use this much
review/text: We've been buying the Ghiradelli Sweet Ground Chocolate in the 1 lb cans for a long time. It makes a wonderful hot cocoa and is especially good in coffee. It dissolves into drinks easily and is just the right level of sweetness. Note that this is ground chocolate, not ground cocoa. Cocoa is unsweetened; chocolate contains sugar. Buying cocoa and then adding your sugar yourself is probably more cost-effective, but it is less convenient for beverages, especially since even Dutch process cocoa does not dissolve as well as this ground chocolate does.<br /><br />However, I got tired of the 1 lb cans piling up, and so I decided to try finding a larger size online. This 10 lb package is a definite price saving over the 1 lb cans in the supermarket (at the price I paid; don't forget to add up the shipping!), and it means I won't have to buy so often, nor will I feel bad about discarding all those sturdy cans. It comes in a bag, tied with a reclosable zip tie, in a box - nothing fancy! I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015R9VXO">Camwear Polycarbonate Square Food Storage container, 6 Quart</a> 6 liter square plastic container that turned out to be exactly the right size for this ten pounds of powdered chocolate. You probably won't want to go through the ten pounds with it staying in the plastic bag inside the cardboard box if you're using a tablespoon at a time. Alternately, if you have the cans or other jars around, refill them from the box and you'll do just fine.

review/summary: Best chocolate ever
review/text: I purchased the 10 pound box of Ghirardelli Chocolate Sweet Ground Mix.  The box came within about 3 days.  When I opened it, I too noticed that it was in a large plastic bag with a zip tie.  I contacted the chocolate Company and they advised that is how they package large quantities, which are usually sold to food companies, coffee shops, and smoothie stores.  I feel very confident that this is very safe, since I called the manufacturer directly and spoke to their consumer products relations person.  I would buy this again!<br /><br />I enjoy making chocolate smoothies as well as hot cocoa.  Thanks Amazon for offering such quality products!

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: I wanted an American high quality cocoa for my chocolate cakes.  I'd been using Hershey's and thought I'd upgrade to this.  What a mistake!  While this might make a good hot chocolate, it is certainly not that great for baking.  Not sure what I'm going to do with all that I have left. :(

review/text: I have just ordered 2 more bags of this popcorn, as the first one is gone and it was the best tasting popcorn and with next to no hulls in it after popping. I also gave some to my sister to try and she thinks it's better than any other popcorn either of us have tried in the past. I am going to try some of Bob's Red Mill other products, since the popcorn was so great.

review/summary: The flavor will drive you (coco) nuts!
review/text: I recently received an order of the original flavor of these coconut patties from Amazon. They arrived fresh with no melting or damage to the contents. Upon my first bite of these squared delights I fell in love with the flavor and texture. The dark chocolate is high quality but does overtake the flavor of the coconut which is firm and full of true coconut flavor. If you love Mounds bars or are a true lover of anything coconut then these squares of paradise are for you. Also the price of these boxes is actually cheaper than ordering directly from the manufacturer and you cannot beat Amazon's free shipping which makes this a product I would order again maybe in the key lime or pina colada flavors in the future. Bottom line- a really great tasting coconut confection!

review/text: I first tasted these coconut patties when I was in Florida.  Since that time, I always made a point to pick some up when I was there - especially for my choco/coconut lover partner in crime.  Well, if you like chocolate, and you like coconut ... eat one of these things and you will feel like you went to heaven.  They are very moist, with real pieces of coconut, and the chocolate is very rich.  I have tried the other flavors, and can't say I really care for them - but every pot has a lid, right?  So, you may like the other flavors.  I was tempted to give these 4 stars only because they are SO bad for you ... haha.  But, I can't blame them for making a tasty product ... I blame myself for having no self control when a box of these is around.

review/summary: Excellent Tea, Good Price
review/text: I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.<br /><br />After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.<br /><br />What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.<br /><br />I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />Ken

review/summary: Delicious and nutricious
review/text: I've tried a variety of whole wheat pastas, whole grain "blend" pastas, etc. Many of these taste a little "funny." For example, Ronzoni's Healthy Harvest has a slightly gritty texture. Other brands taste slightly bitter, or have textures that aren't quite like regular pasta.<br /><br />Gia Russa seems to overcome all of these issues, probably by using the Italian wheat that goes into regular pasta. The texture is just like white pasta. And the taste is great. Of course, it doesn't taste the same as white pasta, just as whole wheat bread doesn't taste like white bread. But it's a very pleasant taste, with no bitterness, and it goes well with all of the traditional pasta sauces that we use.<br /><br />Before, I was sacrificing taste for health value. With Gia Russa, I can have both!

review/text: We find this brand to be very hearty and the hollow products to be quite thick. I disagree with another reviewer that product is grainy after cooking - this is a sign that product is not done. I found that some types of this pasta brand took 14 minutes to cook when 10 was called for. I do not fault the product for this - it can vary due to your altitude, age of pasta, relative humidity, and your preference for "al dente". This also seems like a "real whole wheat product" (not a blend with white flour) to me and is filling and sticks with you but it does require you to accept that taste and texture will not be like typical white flour pasta.

Regular pasta tastes bland in comparison. This pasta actually brings something nice into the mix, especially with rich tomato sauces.<br /><br />I like it so well I've reordered several times.

review/summary: Healthy Drink
review/text: At the VA hospital, my dietician asked me to revise my diet.  Most of the diet is no problem, but increasing vegetables can be a big problem.  I need five to seven servings of vegetables each day.  To meet all the "healthy" requirements, I have to eat too much.  I have forced myself to eat it all and I end up feeling  stuffed.  Most days the best I can do is 4 servings.<br /><br />I discussed this with my dietician and she said I could drink vegetables for some of my servings.  V8 vegetable juice qualifies as a vegetable serving.  Somehow its is like that commercial where Bill Cosby says "there is always room for Jell-O,".I can drink an eight ounce glass of V8 and not feel stuffed.  A side benefit is that it tastes good.<br /><br />V8 contains wonderful ingredients: calories 50; Sodium 140 mg; Potassium 820mg; Fiber 2g; Sugars 8g; Protein 2g.  Percent daily value: Vitamin A  40%;  Vitamin C, 120%;  Calcium 2%; Iron, 2%; Vitamin C, 120%; Calcium 2%, iron, 2%.  I try to purchase the low sodium bottle.<br /><br />So, with V8,  I increase my vegetables and eat healthy.  I highly recommend V8 vegetable juice for daily consumption.

The low sodium version tastes different, but whether or not it's better tasting compared to the regular version is up to you.

review/summary: Best vegetable juice on the market
review/text: Nutritionists recommend that you get a serving of vegetables with every meal, but how to accomplish that with a breakfast has always been a tough one for me since I don't like starchy vegetables like potatoes, and aside from cutting up a tomato, few other things go well with yogurt, egg whites, oatmeal, or any of the other stuff I like in the morning. A simple glass of V8 works perfectly. I've always loved V8 juice for that reason, but found it just a tad too salty. The low sodium version has made V8 perfect in my opinion. It has more flavor than most tomato juices, with a nice hint of celery seed. (It also makes a mean Bloody Mary!). Amazon's price for a 12 pack shipped free is very competitive, especially if you sign up for a subscription. Whether you get it from Amazon or somewhere else, it's just as good. Get yourself some. Your body will thank you!

review/summary: Great product, but watch Amazon's price!
review/text: This review is more of a warning about Amazon's price, especially for those who buy this with "subscribe and save".<br /><br />I bought this product for $29 and free shipping with subscribe and save last week.  That comes to $2.50 a bottle, which is the same as the grocery store sale price.  Walmart's regular price I believe.<br /><br />Low and behold, I check the product today and it's $42 with subscribe and save.  $50 without!  That's over $3.50 or $4 a bottle!  That's a big jump and I find it odd that Amazon is selling something at a price so much higher than the grocery store.  Even when it's not on sale at my local it's cheaper than that.<br /><br />Just watch the price if you're ordering from Amazon.  If you can get this for around $30 with free shipping it's a good deal. If not, buy it locally because you'll be paying too much.  I'm cancelling my subscribe and save subscription for this because I don't want Amazon sending me a case when the price goes through the roof and beyond.<br /><br />That being said, this has almost 300mg less salt per serving than regular V8, and personally I can't tell much difference in flavor.  If I'm drinking something for health reasons, why would I want it loaded with salt?  Whether it be through Amazon or at the grocery store, I plan on taking this product daily as long as it's available.

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious product
review/text: I often have trouble finding the low-sodium version of V8 on my grocery-store shelves, and when it is there, the price is very high. I was delighted to discover that Amazon carries this product in bulk, at a great price, with free shipping through their autoship program, Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />V8 not only tastes great, is an excellent source of potassium, vitamin C, and lycopene, a potent antioxidant. Lycopene is what gives red fruits and vegetables their color. Decades of research has indicated that antioxidants protect cells in the body against free-radical damage, which can lead to inflammation and disease. Lycopene in particular has been shown to protect against cancer, especially breast, uterine and prostate cancer. Research has also indicated it can help reduce LDL cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) and is useful in preventing male infertility, osteoporosis, skin cancer, varicose veins, and eye disease.<br /><br />On top of all that, V8's viscosity makes it a useful liquid for swallowing pills such as nutritional supplements and medications because it lubricates the throat.<br /><br />Finally, if you are someone who keeps a food stock for emergencies (which local, state and federal emergency agencies urge us all to do), this product is an excellent addition to your stockpile. It is both a drink and a food.

review/summary: V8 for cancer survivors
review/text: I battled T4 Squamous Cell Carcinoma in 2007.  As a result of the radiation therapy I have permanent chronic dry mouth.  It is very painful and debilitating.  It feels like pins and needles every second.  This is because the radiation killed all the saliva producing cells.  I have no spit.  For relief, I use the XEROS Dry Mouth Pump seen at [...].  It turned my life completely around to a fully productive existence.<br /><br />However, I lost near 30 pounds.  I cannot eat solid foods (pizza, hot dogs, burgers, etc) and I cannot eat cold or hot foods or acidic or spicy foods.  I have very little taste.  My diet consists of drinking cans of medical nutrition liquids.  However, the doctors said that I should eat regular foods as well, otherwise, my organs would eventually start behaving weirdly.<br /><br />So, I tried a selection of food stuffs and found that cream soups satisfy the need.  I gained back my 30 pounds and then some!  I also drink a glass of V8 juice every night.  This gives me my required daily natural food intake.<br /><br />This vendor is going to make a killing off of me for the next 30 years so I hope they read this and keep their prices down so that I don't have to grow my own tomatoes and veggies and squeeze my own juice.

review/summary: Pretzel Perfection
review/text: This new product from Unique is a MUST try!!  I had them for the first time a few weeks ago and have been extremely addicted ever since.  These new pretzels are the outside of the pretzel but the inside is hallow, leaving just the best part: the crunchy outer shell with salt on it.  I don't even know how to describe how delicious these are.  I can't believe that no one thought of this before! The best part is that the shell is perfect for dipping in mustard or cheese sauce.  This product is worth the price easily.  Also they are a little better nutritionally than regular pretzels as the middle is missing leaving them with less calories.

review/summary: Great on-the-go snack - my toddler is obsessed with Mish Mash!
review/text: My son is obsessed with mish mash - it's great snack to have on-the-go as it does not need to be refrigerated and can satisfy little tummies in between meals. I love it because it's pure fruit without added sugar like a lot of the competitors. When my son sees a mish mash or I ask him if he wants one, he gets really excited. At home, I sometimes use it to add fruit to something like a waffle or pancake when I don't have fresh fruit on hand or am in a rush.<br /><br />The delivery system is great for little hands to feel like they are enjoying it independently - just make sure they put it in their mouth before they start squeezing! He first starting eating these at about a year old and still loves it at almost 2. His 'friends' all love it too.<br /><br />Because it doesn't need to be refrigerated, I buy cases in each flavor from Amazon and keep them in our pantry.

review/text: I ordered this because I'd been reading a lot about the benefits of tart cherry juice for long distance runners, but hadn't seen any in the stores by me. The first ingredient in this is tart cherry juice, which isn't always the case with flavored juices. As the previous reviewer stated, there is apple juice added for a little sweetness. However, it is not particularly sweet. I'm not sure it would be drinkable for most people if they didn't add the apple juice. I much prefer the apple juice to sugar or some other artificial sweetner. It has a very strong cherry flavor. I would highly recommend it!!

review/summary: I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IT....
review/text: Ok, I am a skeptic, I admit it. I read all these reviews (on here and elsewhere) about the benefits of tart cherry juice. I'm diabetic, I have a LOT of health/joint issues and super-high inflammation in my body. So I hurt. I hurt A LOT. I thought I'd give this product a try, without really expecting it to do what people said it can do. I thought, "It's natural, and better for me than medications that take a toll on my pocket and my health.." and I really thought that it was all hype...but who knew?  I've tried it albeit for two days now and I honestly feel a difference. I can't believe it, but I honestly DO. I haven't had any rx painkillers all day and I am not writhing in pain!  I even went out to the park with my 6 yr old yesterday and didn't come home, crying in pain. I thought it had to be a fluke, but again, today, I feel better as well! It's not cheap, by any stretch...but if you can drink a small bottle of tart cherry juice (it has apple juice in it too but no sugar, and yes, it IS tart!) and feel so much better, it's worth it. At least it is for me!! Great product.

review/text: Jelly Belly jelly beans have been my favorite candy since I was a kid.  I love the variety of flavors and the quality of flavor and texture.  In fact, the only flavors I don't like are licorice and sizzling cinnamon!  The one thing I don't love about Jelly Bellies is the price.  I was really excited to learn about Belly Flops, especially available on Amazon.<br /><br />I've now ordered several bags of Belly Flops, and every one has been fresh and tasty.  I find that all of the bags have had a wide variety of flavors, though of course the flavor distribution varies by batch.  The last batch was heavy on the kiwi and tangerine, which are two of my favorites.  Another batch had quite a few of the Coldstone flavors, which I had not tried, but enjoyed.  Each bag had some of the sours included, and one had some of the super fruit blend.  I love the differences in each bag, it's fun to see what you end up with.  I wish they would screw up more caramel corn beans, though... they're my favorite and I've only found a few in my Belly Flops so far. :)<br /><br />The beans taste just as good as regular jelly bellies. Many are double beans, which are my favorite...others are just slightly misshapen or don't have the jelly belly stamp. I have had a few that were the wrong color - like the wrong coating was put on a batch of fillings.  The result was still good and fun to eat.  I will continue to buy Belly Flops to keep my candy jar filled. They're not only a great value, but they're fun and interesting and a great conversation starter!

review/text: I went to the factory itself, which is where I bought these.  They are just as wonderful as regular Jelly Bellys, just a little imperfect.  I only removed a star because ALL the flavors get mixed in, including the Bertie Bott ones.  Bertie Bott beans are the Harry Potter ones that include flavors like pencil shavings, salmon, lamb, dirt, etc.  It is fun, however, to share them with friends and not tell them about the funky flavored ones!

review/summary: Don't be decieved by appearances- these are delicious!
review/text: I've been a huge Jelly Belly fan all my life, but as jelly beans go, they're too expensive for regular indulgence. Belly Flops can be quite ugly, but they retain the intense and interesting flavors of their more attractive brethren. The only differences are cosmetic, generally in shape and size, and the lower price point.<br /><br />My only caveat is that the flavor distribution is irregular; you will almost certainly not get the full range of flavors, and several flavors (presumably those with particular problems on the production line) will predominate. The last batch I bought had quite a few of the Sours flavors, while the one before that had no Sours at all. Fortunately, there are only a few flavors that I dislike, but if you're pickier, this product might be too much of a gamble.

review/summary: UCKA!  BELLY FLOPS IS RIGHT!
review/text: I have a sweet tooth for jelly beans every now and then.  And since Jelly Belly jelly beans are among my favorite brands and the price was right, I jumped at the chance to purchase Jelly Belly Belly Flops.  After a couple of handfuls, however, I kind of wished I hadn't.  The printed statements on the bag are correct, but they're more than a "little less perfect": for example,  you get quite a few that have no jelly center and consist entirely of candy coating instead.  Then there are some flavors that, for some reason,  taste like they should have come out of a bag of Harry Potter inspired flavors.  In short, this was not an enjoyable experience and it even turned me off jelly beans for a bit.

review/summary: Freshest Beans Ever
review/text: Jelly Beans have always been my most beloved candy, even as a child in the 1960's. In the mid 1980's, thanks to Ronald Reagan, I discovered Jelly Belly Jelly Beans and have never turned back. Actually I have tried several competing brands and they all have merits of their own, but Jelly Belly is my favorite. Anyway, I was surprised several years ago that a Retail chain which uses a red bulls-eye as it's symbol installed a self serve Jelly Belly candy section in it's "super" stores.  You could get almost all the flavors individually or they had the 49 flavor mix. Everything was priced out at $7.49/lb. I would go in and get about 2 lbs. of the mix and then add a partial scoop of some of my favorite flavors. Let me note that the self serve candy section at the red bulls-eye store here in Mobile Alabama was removed about two months ago.<br /><br />One day I noticed a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDOSN2">Jelly Belly Jelly Beans, 49 Flavors, 2-Pound Stand-Up Pouch</a> and it was priced at $10.99. That was less than the self serve price. Two pounds of the self serve would run $15, the bag was $11 so i just started buying the two pound bag. All this to say that I can still get the two pound bag of 49 flavors for $11 at the red bulls-eye superstore, Amazon wants $22 for it. Guess where I get mine.<br /><br />Now I find the Belly Flops and they are $9 for two pounds, being a Amazon Prime member I get free second day shipping and pay no tax. While they are available I am getting the belly flops. I love them, my co-workers love them and they especially love the funky shapes. Another reviewer says that they have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057ISDW2">Harry Potter Bertie Botts Every Flavour Jelly Beans 2 Boxes</a> flavors mixed in also but I have not found any, and I hope I never do. I am on my third bag of Belly Flops. The one thing that I do notice is that since these are fulfilled by the Jelly Belly Company the beans are extremely fresh. I wholeheartedly recommend these and when you can no longer get the Belly Flops go to the red bulls-eye store for the two pound bag. The Belly flop bag itself says that they are not always available.

review/text: They might be funny looking and I may not get to pick my flavors, but for a person like me who can eat a ton of Jelly Bellys this is the way to buy them.  I usually wait for a sale and quite often they will have them Buy 3 Get 2 Free. The most recent purchase was in November and we are down to 2 bags now.  Hopefully around April the sale will be offered again so we can stock up.  My favorite way to store them is in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJ7C2E">OXO Good Grips POP Rectangle 1-1/2-Quart Storage Container</a>.  Fits a bag at a time and keeps them fresh.  If you aren't picky about the flavors or funny looking beans, this is the best deal around unless you live near the factory.

review/summary: Yes from CA but Flavor is Sugar
review/text: Price = GREAT! Shipping = Excellent! The 2 lb bag I received this week came from the Fairfield, CA plant. As a lover of jelly bellies I always meant to drive over to the company store when visiting California, but never made it. I was delighted to find these available through Amazon. I only treat myself to these tasty jelly beans once a year or so because I find it difficult to stop eating them. One leads to another. The reason I have liked them has been intensity of flavor - and I like a big variety of flavors, probably favoring sour flavors more than sweet. My Belly Flops bag has a big variety of colors and shapes and misshapes, but each bean I have tried so far reminded me of run-of-the-mill inexpensive jelly beans long on corn syrup and sugar with little flavor. I am going to jump to the conclusion that steps in the processing of the candy are excluded due to being pulled off the "conveyor belt" - if that is done by machine or person....prior to additional flavor enhancement steps that deliver the intense jelly belly flavor the confection is known and loved for. You will get your genuine belly flops with this order, so do not worry over that one review about coming from Thailand - Everyone else here has looked and seen the product is genuine and made in USA. No worries there! I'm just throwing this three-star review in the mix to let you know some flavor steps were skipped so the flops are Long on Sugar, not so much on flavor intensity. Still a good value.

review/summary: My bag was a flop.
review/text: I love Jelly Belly jelly beans and would have rated the Belly Flops higher except that the jelly beans in the bag I received all stick together.  Since this is the first bag of Belly Flops I bought, I'm not sure if I got a real flop of a bag or if this is normal.

review/summary: Good Munchies ...
review/text: These are fun. It's weird that some of the colors don't have the flavor you expect, but it's still good. Keeps me from zeroing in one something I like, like lime flavor, and then picking them out and scarfing them all at once.<br /><br />There are oddball shapes in there,too ... like 2 or 3 beans glued together.<br /><br />So, if you're like me with little or no life, grab a bag of these and take a chance on what flavor jelly bean is coming up next ....

review/summary: Yummy treats.
review/text: I purchased these when a deal was offered if I bought 5? bags. I still they stay fresh in the package, so I didn't mind having a lot. They taste great. I would buy them again.

review/text: It is cheap but some pieces are stuck together.  I removed the beans from the bag and put them into a plastic container.

review/summary: Love These!
review/text: I buy Jelly Bellys for the taste, not the looks so saving a couple bucks a pound is a no brainer for me. I've purchased these several times and always gotten a good assortment in each package. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Fun beans
review/text: These are still great Jelly Bellies, despite their irregular shape, and sometimes unfamiliar flavor, but that's part of the fun for someone that likes just about any flavor.

review/summary: Jelly Belly on the CHEAP!
review/text: As many reviewers have noted each bag is really something of a mixed bag - literally!  So sometimes you'll get a few different beans that taste a little weird (we can thank the Bertie Botz that get mixed in).  But for the most part, you get a great variety of beans which to me taste great.  I haven't had any bags that were entirely one thing or another, although one of my bags did have a few more chocolate beans than usual, but again nothing too weird, so I may have lucked out, but from my experience, you get a good variety regardless.  Now I tend to be someone who likes to get a handful and occasionally enjoy one at a time, so if you are the one at a time person, you may have some problems with this bag.  On the other hand, I'm not a very picky person and I really have no complaints. For the price you get an excellent value on beans that would normally cost a lot more.  Overall, I'm glad I get these, and I know whenever they have sales on these I try to pick them up, because they can be difficult to get.  So if you're a fan of Jelly Belly, you've come to the right place, but if you're a little bit particular on beans, I'd suggest you shy away, or just know you may get some flavors that are not going to make you happy.

review/summary: Jelly Bellies at a reasonable price.
review/text: I have a small candy machine which I keep filled with jelly beans. I used to order the 10lb Bulk Jelly Bellies These are even more cost effective, and definitely beat the price of any of the small jelly belly gift boxes. A majority of the beans are the exact same jelly bellies you get normally except they don't have  the logo printed on them. The next most common issue is that two or more beans got fused together. Out of 20 bags of these I've only had a handful where the flavors were off to the point I could notice.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these for someone who loves jelly bellies.

review/summary: NOT AS HANDSOME, BUT FILLED WITH  JUST AS MUCH FLAVOR!
review/text: These Belly Flop Jelly Belly Jelly Beans are in odd shapes, some are stuck together and they are not as perfectly formed as the regular ones are, but they taste exactly the same and once they are in your mouth, you never know just what they looked like, and they are half the price.  My husband says "ORDER MORE"!!

review/summary: Bellys full of Jellys
review/text: My girlfriend and I absolutely love these! We actually prefer the variety and unpredictable nature of the Flops to the regular old 'gourmet' thing. Sure some are actually 2-4 beans welded together (actually my favorite ones!), sure some are abnormally sour or overly sweet, and yes the flavors can range anywhere... but that's part of the fun! I tried to find them cheaper but since the jellybelly's website sells them for the same price, I think any cheaper is mostly a luck thing. I've never seen these in any stores where I live. So yeah I imagine I'm overpaying a bit, but I still enjoy my jellybeans; and until I find them cheaper I'll just have to deal.

review/summary: Best money you can spend on jelly beans
review/text: Jelly bellies are awesome! These are jelly bellies, therefore, these are awesome!<br /><br />There were a few in the bag that had questionable flavor and some of the ones that were stuck together have quite a bit more coating (personally my favorite ones!) but over all this is really a great buy because Jelly bellies are usually pretty expensive.<br /><br />The bags that I got had many different flavors in them although there were probably only about 40 flavors all together. This doesn't cover the full smorgasbord of Jelly belly bean flavors but it did hit many of the more regular ones with the occasional sour bean thrown in. Who knows though what flavors you might get in the bag, I think it makes it all the more fun!

review/summary: These are great!
review/text: I wonder who came up with the wonderful idea of calling these great candies Belly Flops. Very clever. In my family we call them the accidental jelly bean. There's nothing wrong with the taste of these wonderful candies, and we often serve them as a little side snack to relatives who are currently celebrating their status as new members of the over-the-hill gang. A little misshapen, a little weird, a little wrinkled -- both the family members and the beans -- but both exquisitely popular in the family.

review/summary: Just buy a bag...or 5!
review/text: They had a special on these, so I bought 5 bags to get the free shipping.  They taste great, so what if they have some funny shapes?  Like some other reviewers said, yes, sometimes you get a flavor dud, or a Harry Potter icky tasting bean...but that's part of the fun.  Just spit it out if you don't like that flavor.  Or, pay double the price, and get the regular Jelly Belly beans.  Me, I'll stick with Belly Flops!
