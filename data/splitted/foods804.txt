review/summary: Tasty Treats For Toy Dogs
review/text: I am lucky in that my 1 year Chihuahua isn't picky about his snacks and will eat just about anything. This product is no exception. I gave him one and he promptly took it to his favorite "eating spot" on the rug and went at it. I like the fact that it is low in fat and has somewhat natural ingredients as well as being good for the teeth. Since Chihuahuas can have dental problems, I am all for products that keep their teeth in good condition, since dental cleanings are quite expensive. Anyhow, he knows where his treats are kept and will eagerly anticipate getting one of these or some other tasty snack. Although it's made in China, my dog hasn't had any adverse reaction to the product. The product can get expensive but you can probably find a deal on it at your local pet store. That's how I first discovered these.

review/summary: Good Dog Treat
review/text: I have bought these many times for my two hungry golden retrievers.  This is one of their favorite treats.  They have had before the rice balls that are on the ends of these dumbbells and the treat in the middle is an added bonus.  They are crunchy so it helps keep their teeth clean.  Will be back buying these as they go thru these quickly.

review/summary: Great, but a little pricey
review/text: I have two dogs, a Cairn Terrier/Chihuahua and a Yorkie/Chihuahua. Both are rescue dogs, and both love treats. Chik 'n Dumbells are their favorites by far. I have to ration them in order to make them last as long as possible. I would be willing to buy a larger size, or buy a larger quantity, if the price would come down. They are easily the most expensive treats I buy. Great product.

review/summary: Pet NShape Dumbbells  32oz
review/text: MY dog doesn't like many treats so I was delighted when I found the small packs at Petsmart.  They no longer carry them. Going online, I discovered that you sell them. For several months I have purchased these from you and my dog has loved them.  My last order seems to have changed.  The texture and color seem different and my dog won't eat them at all.  I don't know if this is a one time thing or the change is permanent.  I am very, very disappointed. The other treats I bought at the same time are the same, or at least she eats them sometimes.<br />So I probably won't be purchasing the dumbbells again, especially since the price has gone from under $30 to $40...<br />Thanks<br />Marye

review/summary: Delightful for snacking and beyond
review/text: Having had most of the varieties of Lush nuts, aside from the new one, I can say that they are an addictive and delicious snack! The curry one is my favorite, as I am a sucker for all things curry.  However, every flavor is delicious in it's own right. The coffee ones would be fantastic in ice cream, the salt and pepper ones would be delightful over a salad, and...well, I haven't been able to try experiments with the curry or cinnamon since my girlfriend and I have eaten them too quickly for experimentation to begin! They are made with such simple ingredients that you can eat them without worrying about all sorts of chemicals and preservatives. Buy them as a gift, or if you want a delicious something to munch on!

review/text: It is nice that this comes in a 20oz can, since this is enough for a casserole for a family.  There was a recipe on the can using Chik'n Dinner, mushroom soup, noodles, and frozen veggies. This worked really well. The taste is quite good.  It is a lot softer than the Worthington or Loma Linda products, so if you want firm pieces of "chicken," use one of those.

review/text: I have tried other Chocolate Mate teas and this is by far the smoothest, most fragrant and the best.  I LOVE it.  Remember folks it's tea, so it's not going to replace a chocolate truffle by any stretch of the imagination.  I gave up coffee for health reasons, and I find that this satisfies my coffee yearnings in the morning, and is a cup of warmth with that oh-so-chocolatey aroma that I look forward to.  With a splash of soy creamer, it's perfect!  I am about two-thirds of the way through my first tin, and will definitely replace it.  Really yummy.

review/summary: Dark Chocolate Tea - I Love This Stuff
review/text: I couldn't believe it when I saw the poor reviews for this product.  I guess it proves that old adage, "One person's trash is another's treasure."<br /><br />I love this tea. For me, it has a deep, dark, rich chocolate taste that I just don't get from other chocolate teas.  It is really smooth.  And, I like the added chocolate taste that the cocoa adds to the tea.<br /><br />I also like Yogi's Mayan Cocoa Spice for a different taste.  It has a more spicy taste rather than the dark chocolate taste of this one.

review/summary: Have a Lindt truffle instead
review/text: This tea has a lovely fragrance and comes in an attractive reusable canister.  Unfortunately, the tin's only protection during shipping was a paper envelope with a thin bubble wrap lining, and consequently it arrived dented.  The lid advised that "The light cloud of cocoa powder that emerges from these tea bags is filled with good intentions."  I would have preferred to have the clouds of cocoa powder inside the tea bags, rather than all over my kitchen counter.  I used one bag for a 6 ounce cup of tea & it seemed the paper taste from the tea bag overpowered any chocolate flavor.  The next time I used two tea bags, which resulted in a more pronounced paper flavor, but still nothing I would identify as chocolate in a blind taste test.  All things considered, this product was an expensive and messy disappointment.  A Lindt Lindor dark chocolate truffle would provide far more of the benefits of chocolate at a fraction of the cost, without leaving a powdery mess behind in the cup & on the counter.

review/text: I tried The Republic of Tea, Double Dark Chocolate Mate and found it to be rather bland.  I tried 2 tea pods to a cup of water but with very little taste.  After trying this tea and Stash Premium Tea I've come to the conclusion the flavored teas at The English Tea Store (online) have a better quality of tea.  Bigelow and Lipton have better tastes.

review/summary: Luzianne makes great dirty rice!
review/text: I've used Zatarain's dirty rice mix for years, but decided to try the Luzianne brand.  I am happy to say that we love it!  Fry up a pound of hamburger, drain it, then add it back to the pot with the dirty rice package and 2.5 cups of water.  Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer, and in 20 minutes you have a tasty, Cajun flavored meal.<br /><br />Luzianne also adds a small package of cayenne pepper to the box, for those who like their dirty rice really spicy.  I usually add in peas or frozen spinach, and sometimes extra chopped onions or green peppers.  But the spices in the box are great the way they are.  My only complaint is that there are 680 mg. of sodium per serving, which is a lot.  I think it would taste just as good with less sodium.<br /><br />If you like one dish meals or spicy Cajun food, you will enjoy this product.

review/summary: Excellent product, perfect Naan
review/text: I'll preface this by saying that I have always like Naan bread - when it is done correctly. However, I have often been disappointed with the usual commercial offerings; too tough, soggy, flavorless, etc.  I have made it at home many times, using various recipes, especially that of Madhur Jaffrey, which I "discovered" many years ago.<br /><br />This Onion Flat Bread / Naan, is excellent.  It is as good as any I have prepared and better than any I have purchased and is extremely fresh.<br /><br />Since I received my order, I have eaten this plain, as a snack, made pizza with various toppings, made a breakfast sandwich with sausage and eggs.<br />This is a versatile product with many uses.  Great to keep in the freezer for emergency meals.

review/summary: Dental chews for dogs teeth
review/text: My dogs like these the best and I'm glad if it cleans their teeth.  I bought a 32-count for what I felt was a very reasonable price and will buy more, hopefully for the same price.  I have two VERY picky eaters of food and treats, a toy and a miniature poodle.  They turn down practically all treats offered them.  These are their favorite (except for the gourmet duck treats from Costco that I can't find anywhere else).  These are really worth buying.

review/summary: Dog loves them, but I hate the smell
review/text: I have a 70 pound lab mix, and he goes nuts for these treats. He'll devour one in less than 5 minutes, but it's awesome to see him so happy. However, they have a super strong odor, and I do not find them to be as appealing as he does. Recommended for dog's happiness, just hold your nose if you're sensitive to strong, funky, meat-like smells.

review/summary: Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor
review/text: My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

I was amazed to see her crunch it up the large bone so quickly!  She's always been very well disciplined until these bones arrived at least.  She went into my pantry and tore the bag open and ate 7 bones!!!  She had such a low hung head when I approached her about the issue all I could do was laugh!!!  Luckily, my 4 month old shephard got one before her sister ate the batch!)  I save about $5 ordering the bones on Amazon.

review/summary: Ithing and chewing on paws
review/text: I first purchased a pack of Nutri Dent puppy chews for my Welsh Terrier when he was just a few months old. He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these.

Neither Wal-Mart nor Kroger stocks them anymore.  I am thrilled with Amazon's subscription service.  Now I get my Bran Chex delivered automatically right to my door (for a price less than I once paid at the stores ... please don't let the folks at Amazon know that) and the shipping is free!  Much tastier than their cousin Wheat Chex and especially good when mixed with Grape Nuts.  I dare you to try that combo.

I actually use them as a "condiment" on another brand of whole grain bite-sized shredded wheat.  That one is sugar free, and these have a little sugar.  I sprinkle a just a few on top for added flavor.  A local grocery chain stopped stocking the Chex Multi Bran cereal, so I started a Subscribe and Save delivery with Amazon.  Order them a week ahead, and they are at my door when I need them.

Tastes a LOT like those pine trees he was always trying to get us to eat.  The second listed ingredient on this product is sugar, so think about that before you purchase what you think is something healthy.  Go for something else that's better and has less sugar.  This one will leave the birds in YOUR yard standing up and saluting!

review/summary: Love the C. Howards Lemon!
review/text: I picked up a pack of these mints from a deli when I was in New York.  It was love at first mint!  I too eat the whole pack in one sitting.  But, you can buy them directly from the C. Howards web site...  They're much cheaper.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: first let me say that i have not purchased this from amazon only my local gym it is cheaper on here so i will be buying it from here soon as far as the product my trainer introduced it to me and my friend, since we was trying to lose weight and build lean muscle, i have used it roughly 2 months and love it i drink it every morning and it curbs my appetite i can go till 1:00 or later before i start felling hungry where before i was hungry from the moment i woke till i went to bed, i also drink my shake after my workouts in the evening 3 times a week. as far as the taste if you just mix with water for me it is a little hard to swallow, i blend up frozen blueberry's and strawberry's which i thaw and add 2/3 cup water mix with powder in a shaker pretty good stuff you can also leave berries frozen to make shake thicker and more like a milk shake if you add powder to blender to mix it will be a little foamy that's why i mix it in a shaker if you decide to buy it try different ways till you find the way you like to drink it!

review/summary: Excellent Protein
review/text: This protein has an excellent amino acid complex. I prefer Milk and Egg over why proteins as they are absorb into your body more efficiently. Whey protein is absorbed quickly, and if you are only working out once or twice a day, then a lot of the protein isn't going to get absorbed effectively. Milk and Egg based proteins take longer, so you get a constant flow of protein rather than having your body trying to absorb it a couple times a day. I take about 2 scoops of this protein, 2-4 times a day, and, working out every other day, I've been putting on about 5lbs every other week.

review/summary: NOT CHOLESTEROL FREE
review/text: I bought this because the amazon page says that it is "cholesterol free." It isn't...it actually has more than most (I think around 40% of your daily intake in one serving). Plus it tasts REALLY bad (I've been mixing it with Muscle Milk to cover the taste because I'm too cheap to just throw it away), it's extremely grainy (kinda coats your throat going down making it super gaggy) and sometimes all the protein in it dumps out and coagulates into a nasty ball inside the shake ball in my shaker-cup if I don't drink it fast enough...I've eaten some pretty horrible stuff (mostly on dares) and I can't handle a Universal only protein shake...too nasty. I'm sticking souly to Muscle Milk and Optimum Nutrition brand protein powders...lower cholesterol (Muscle Milk is only 5% per serving) and MUCH better taste.

review/summary: love liquid nation!
review/text: I ordered 4 boxes of this chocolate glazed doughnut coffee for a large number of overnight guests that were coming. I rec'd the wrong coffee and reached out to company, not being very pleasant about it. I then contacted amazon, and received a call from Liquid nation.<br />They were very sorry about the error and tried to get information from me in order to prevent orders in the future. This was a Thursday afternoon and my guests were arriving Friday at noon.<br />They overnighted the coffee at no extra charge and it was there as promised. Additionally, I did not have time to return the coffee, so they gave the "wrong" coffee at a 50% discount.<br />All in all, I have to say I was really upset when I initially contacted Liquid Nation, but they were more than fair in dealing with the issue.<br />Thanks!

It's not really all that hot, but it's packed with flavor.  I can only say so much, but I'd advise you try it yourself.

review/summary: Absolutely the BEST Sauerkraut Ever!
review/text: Gold Mine sauerkraut is absolutely the BEST sauerkraut on the market. I especially love their Garlic Kraut. It may seem a bit pricey, but it is packed very tightly in the jars, so you actually get far more product than with other brands. It is also very crunchy with very little liquid, unlike brands that are soggy or where you get mostly liquid. I like the fact that it is organic, and the company fills and ships orders very quickly. If you are particular about your sauerkraut, I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Not just for babies!  Love it for nausea/stomach bugs
review/text: I'll admit, I'm somewhat embarrassed to write a review for baby food, since I'm a grown woman with no children...  :-)<br /><br />However, I AM a teacher, and thus tend to get more than my fair share of stomach illnesses during the school year.  The past few months, I also needed to take a presciption medication that made me nauseous regularly.<br /><br />This remains as THE ONLY FOOD that I can hold down when I am ill and recovering from a stomach bug.  It is gentle, mild flavored, completely smooth, can be mixed to any consistency (from 'smoothie'-like to paste-like)...and it just stays down.  Doctors always say to start back on food with that "BRAT" diet -- banana, rice, applesauce, toast -- well, this seems to have 3/4 of those in 1 box!<br /><br />As a bonus, it has excellent nutritional value -- gives you some vitamins and such, versus when you only eat plain rice or toast.  It gets me back on my feet much sooner...and it takes almost no effort to make it (important to me, since when I'm sick, I don't want to be 'vertical' any longer than I have to!)  I usually just mix it with water, which works wonderfully (I stay away from dairy if I'm ill).  You can eat it cold or warm.  I find it to be kind of soothing when I'm under the weather.<br /><br />It doesn't spoil, and I always keep some on hand just because you never know when you'll get sick (or at least I don't, what with students sneezing in my face!!)  ;-)<br /><br />Finally, I must admit that I think it's YUMMY!  I do wish they still made just the banana rice kind -- I wonder why they discontinued that, which I remember having as far back as the 1970s?  But this is pretty close.<br /><br />I'll admit to having a little bowl of it now or then just as comfort food!  :-)

review/summary: Powdery "fish food" tea leaves
review/text: While in China, I had everything from the cheap tea to the much more expensive high quality leaves. This tea isn't even on the scale, as it appears the quality is below what people in China would buy for the cheapest price at a local supermarket. To begin with, the tea is chopped or broken up into something resembling large flakes of fish food. (Note: it does not resemble the picture of the tea leaves shown on the product page at all.) Second, because of this condition, the tea has an overall powdery and dry character to it. Now, maybe you will say, "But what about the taste? Maybe it tastes just the same..." No, it doesn't. It is basically tasteless and bland, the opposite of high quality green tea in this style. The best quality green tea leaves in this style are small and bright green. When steeped, they give a fresh and vegetal flavor with all sorts of subtlety and deliciousness. This tea has none of those qualities. In summary: this tea is not good, and especially for the price. Please do yourself a favor and avoid it. In China, I doubt even poor people would drink this tea, which makes me sad to say since I bought it. :-(<br /><br />Foojoy's Longjing in teabags is infinitely superior to this tea, and is a real Longjing.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007V1Q7I">Foojoy Lungching (Dragonwell) Green Tea - 100 Individually Wrapped Tea Bags</a>

review/summary: The worst green tea I've ever had
review/text: The review by "Small Stuffed Monkey" appeared just a few days after I placed my order for this tea...too late to cancel my order.  When I read it, I was hoping his critical comments would prove to be simply wrong, or at least too harsh.  But in fact they are right on target.  First, he is correct that the tea itself does not look at all like the image on the webpage (it doesn't consist of what looks like rolled leaves, but rather is in tiny flakes).  Most importantly, he is right about the flavor.  There is practically none; and the flavor that is there is stale, dull.  It is the most insipid green tea I have ever drunk (and I have drunk many kinds, from China, Japan, Sri Lanka, etc.); but in light of the off-putting nature of the flavor, I was actually glad there was not more of it.  This tea might, in light of its price, look like a bargain; instead, it is exactly the opposite...a complete waste of money.
