review/summary: Solid cup of coffee
review/text: This coffee is one of the best of the "donut" style brands that are on the market. It is a smooth coffee that has a nice body, and no bitter aftertaste. It is not acidic, and in fact has some notes of sweetness. It is more flavorful than donut shoppe, and better than the timothy's similarly named variety. Highly recommend. Although it is listed as a light roast, I would describe it as almost a medium body coffee.

review/summary: Great Taste!! Smooth
review/text: Love this Coffee, it's just right for my taste. I tried several different brands until I tried Coffee House and then I knew this was the best choice for me. If your a Starbucks fan don't even waste you money because this coffee doesn't have the smokey or strong taste that Starbucks has. This is lighter and smoother. Other reviewers state it's cheaper at Costco and Sams, and that's true if they have it in stock but at my local Sams Club its hit or miss on what they have in stock at any given timeframe. So to know you can come here and order is a great option.

review/summary: DONUT HOUSE-DONUT SHOP EITHER EXCELLENT CHOICE
review/text: I was up late ordering from Amazon and got the Donut House instead of the Donut Shop because of senioritis!!  When it came, I first thought..."what the h... I did not order this coffee".  After checking my orders, I confirmed that it was me!!! HA!  Anyway, I too did a taste test comparison and can say that I could not tell the difference between them.  Both excellent flavor and body.<br />I have a Saeco Royal Professional espresso machine that I use every morning to make coffee fresh from Italian or French roasted beans.  I hate to admit that I like this Donut House better as a coffee for the lasting taste.  No, I did not stop drinking my morning espresso, I just added a couple of cups of Donut House or Donut Shop..forgot again...what was I saying!!!  Only kidding. 5 Stars!

review/text: I am giving this coffee a 5 star excellent rating.  It is absolutely delicious and has a perfect medium level balance that I assume is the result of the light roasting.  I am only a few weeks into my Keurig B40 and of all the k-cups I have tried so far this is the best.  It you want a mid-strength, delicious, "everyday type of coffee" this is the one for you.

review/text: I have never been a fan of decaf as it always seems to have an aftertaste for me.  This blend seems to circumvent that as there is no tinny taste of decaf (at least for my palate).<br /><br />Donut House just serves a great, mild blend, suitable for all.

review/summary: Excellent coffee: mild and flavorful...
review/text: ...like many people, I have soft spot for Dunkin' Donuts coffee, which can take the edge of a morning commute or the start of a long road trip. While I was happy when DD recently introduced their own K-Cup varieties, the only place you can get them is in DD stores.<br /><br />Donut House clearly gets the popularity of DD's freshly brewed coffee, which is richly flavored without being overpowered. They tapped into that need with their Light Roast version, which has has much wider availability that the venerable DD store brand.<br /><br />Check prices in brick and mortar stores (especially big box/club stores), where you might be able to do a little better (IF they have it in stock).<br /><br />This is by far the favorite K-cup choice in our house, which never goes a day without drinking coffee.

review/text: In the past, the Donut House K-Cups have been of the highest quality & would have been rated 5 stars. However, even tho the quality of the product is still there, the last time I received the 80 pack, several of the K-Cups were broken & the coffee missing. Some of them were broken within the box & the coffee was everywhere. That is the reason for the 4 star rating - will order them once more to see if the last order was an anomaly.

review/text: I hate calling out an entire brand, but sadly, I must. I accidentally ordered this thinking it was a different, very similarly named brand, and didn't realize it I brewed a K-cup. It was so bitter, typical of this brand (this is my third attempt with this brand). And of course, I just had to accidentally buy the jumbo 24-count pack. Even with a 1/4 c of cream or a whole packet of hot cocoa, it still has a big bite to it. Anyway, it's just not for me. Good price, though, and arrived on time.

In short, it's not bad for a light roast!

review/summary: Great package for your Keurig!
review/text: If you own any of the Keurig K-Cup Brewers then you should definitely get this package. Its filled with 24 count K-Cups for your Keurig. Get a nice cup of coffee fast. They also have other flavors but this is for the Regular which we bought for ours. Nothing better in the morning than a nice fresh cup of coffee and I love the taste! Its not just a generic bland coffee blend. Please try!

review/text: After shopping around for some K-cups that were affordable, I decided to give Donut House a try.  We don't like the heavier French roast types or flavored coffees, so this brand and type are a good one for us. We like a light  to medium roast coffee.

review/summary: Graet Cup of Coffee
review/text: This blend has got me hooked. I was an avid DD fan but 11.99 for 14 cups. I even was grinding my own DD and using the adapter filters. Definitely cheaper. Still the convenience of the k-cup is nice.  Then I tried this blend. Not only is it comparible in taste...its actually better. Much better.  Sorry DD.  Since each even cheaper in quanitity I wonder how fresh the cups stay?  In either case this is an awesome blend

review/summary: Neither light or very good :-(
review/text: When I bought this coffee I was expecting a light-roast coffee with smooth body and great flavor as could be found in some donut shops in days gone by.  For me, this doesn't fulfill either.  This coffee should be described as bold, there is nothing light about it.  Forget about smooth body, instead it has an acidity and bitterness that I found unpleasant.  I'm still debating just tossing it out or letting it collect dust in the event I need to use it if I'm out of all other k-cups.<br /><br />This coffee made it to my "Do not buy again" list.

review/summary: VERY LIGHT!
review/text: I mistakenly grabbed this Donut HOUSE blend at Costco thinking it was the Donut SHOP blend of k-cup (by Coffee People).  I realized it wasn't Donut SHOP the first time I made a cup.  It was REALLY light - basically colored water, very little flavor if made on the recommended 8 oz brew size.  Not much better on a lower setting either.  If you like a very, very mild coffee, then this is for you.  I'm not a fan of strong coffee, but this was WAY to mild and I'll be making sure I'm getting the Coffee People Donut SHOP coffee rather than Donut HOUSE in the future!

Second, when the box is empty, and if you are big enough you can be stuck in it.<br /><br />This tasty meal in a pop-top can, reminiscent of C rations takes some strength and skill to open so you will not hear the sound of lids pealing back in the middle of the night and cats slurping the juice.<br /><br />Some cats rub on the hand that opens the can. Others wait until you are out of sight before you hear them devouring the tasty can innards. Bottom line is this product is part of a balanced diet and has yet to encounter any detractors.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

review/summary: 7 cats are rating 7 paws up
review/text: I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in p�t&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.

review/summary: Making all of my cats sick
review/text: Due to the good price I started doing subscribe and save for my 3 cats. I just got my second shipment and am planning on throwing all of them away because I have realized it is making all 3 of my cats sick. All 3 have dry noses and warm ears. Their poop is black and one of my cats has very bad smelling poop which has never happened. I give them Earthborn on Saturday and Sunday and noticed that they seem to be more active and feel better by the end of the weekend. I thought they were just passing around a cold until I substituted their weekend wet food and they seemed to improve. I googled Friskes cat food makes my cat sick and found a lot of people saying their cats were vomiting, getting sick and even dying because of Friskies. I'm throwing a full shipment away rather than risking my cats lives.

review/summary: Damaged and full of maggots
review/text: We've ordered this item via subscribe and save for a couple of months and it has always arrived damaged (usually one or two cans are opened; nothing more to report). This month the package contained a number of open cans that contained families of maggots that paraded across our bathroom floor.  Not the bonus you're hoping to get with your online cat food order.

review/summary: Ovaltine has changed their formula
review/text: Ovaltine has updated their packaging and changed their formula.  The new formula is very similar to Nesquik.  It no longer dissolves in the milk and stays dissolved, but settles on the bottom of the glass.  This was the main reason I bought Ovaltine over Nesquik; it dissolved and stayed dissolved. The new formula is a real disappointment.

review/summary: New Ovaltine - Please give me the original formula!
review/text: What a disappointment it was to try the new Nestletized "Malt Classic Ovaltine." Gone are the granules - instead, it's now a fine powder. The taste has changed too. It's not really awful - still drinkable, but it's definitely not in the same league as the original that I grew up on. In my estimation, they ruined an excellent product and disappointed a loyal customer base.

review/text: I, too, noticed a change in the Ovaltine with the new packaging.  It is extremely disappointing.  The flavor seems a little different and the texture is definitely different.  I'm not sure why they changed something that didn't need changing.  I am no longer a loyal Ovaltine customer -- it doesn't seem much better than Nesquik anymore.

review/summary: Original recipe was great - new one is awful
review/text: Really simple - nestle changed the formula of Ovaltine to make it cheaper to produce, and the result is a powder that has 1/4 the vitamins and half the flavor. The marketing spin is that it is somehow healthier because it has less sugar, but that's only because you are putting half the amount in. Alternatives my kids like are carnation instant breakfast which still has all the vitamins and tastes great.

review/summary: Pleaes bring back the old formula
review/text: I have purchased Rich, chocolate Ovaltine since my now 15 year old was old enough to drink milk, but wouldn't because of the taste. Doctor said to add chocolate. Since Ovaltine has more vitamins than the others, we started using it. Now I have 4 children all considered under weight and loved that Ovaltine made their milk palatable. My youngest and most underweight refuses to drink milk without it. Bought the new recipe a few weeks ago. Kids opened it up and the smell was horrendous! I thought it went bad. The taste was not the same either (sort of like egg nog that's gone bad). Then I noticed the "New Improved recipe". Who's the marketing genius behind this one. Yes I see less calories, sugar and sodium in the new recipe, but if I was worried about that I wouldn't be adding chocolate to my milk in the first place! PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD RECIPE. My underweight children need it!!

review/summary: less nutrients, more sugar, higher price, ZERO STARS!!!!!!!
review/text: My kids are very disappointed that I no longer buy Ovaltine. It costs more, there is less product, more sugar and less nutrients. I have 3 boys and I started my oldest, who is now 8, on Ovaltine ever since he started on milk. It was great to have something for him that I could count on for nutrients when he was a pickyeater. Now we are no longer an Ovaltine family unless they go back to the old formula.

review/summary: "The New Ovaltine" = Ruining perfection
review/text: This highly reminds me of "THE NEW COKE" debacle. Until recently, Ovaltine was perfect in my opinion. It dissolved perfectly and uniformly. Tasted great, and was better than most other chocolate drinks in a nutritional sense. Now the formula has changed and I can't stand it. It looks, tastes and mixes like Nesquik. It takes the whole of five minutes of hand mixing to get it to dissolve. WHY? It doesn't taste as rich or of any form of real chocolate. In fact, it is nothing like the good old Ovaltine that I've always loved. It gets two stars because, independent of the old Ovaltine, I simply don't like it. In comparison, I'd give it one star for complete mockery. Whoever decided to change the recipe obviously didn't do their research or even listen to their customer base. I won't drink Ovaltine again until the recipe changes back. They should probably call it "Ovaltine Classic" or something to signify it's return.

review/summary: OVALTINE = ALTERTINE - Yet another tampered with product so the manufacturer can cut corners and save a buck
review/text: I too have noticed the horrible difference in Ovaltine.  Open up the container and you get an instant whiff of the ocean.  It stinks like fish.  Mixing it is like mixing hot cocoa in cold milk.  Clumps floating at the top of the glass, never dissolving.  WHY, OH WHY, do these manufacturers constantly have to cheapen everything at the expense of the consumer.  I am so tired of everything being tampered with or skimped on.  We Americans should really start standing up to these inequities.  We need to make our voices heard and spread the word.

Now, it doesn't mix in the milk well and it tastes like vitamins - like a healthfood drink. When I called the company, they said, it was because they made it healthier. Sure, but I want some taste too! Bring back the OLD OVALTINE.

review/summary: Where did the vitamins go?
review/text: I have been really disappointed with the new Ovaltine formula. I have bought this mostly for my kids because it had an amazing amount of vitamins and minerals and tasted pretty good. I am a label reader. The new product has about one fourth of the nutritional values as before. What used to be 100% or close to it on several vitamins is now only 10%. It's a shame. They have ruined a great product. The taste is still okay, but the new formula doesn't dissolve well. It's funny that the new formula is much cheaper to make, because the price hasn't gone down at all. We are just getting a lot less for our money.

review/summary: The Change was not for the Better
review/text: Ovaltine has changed its formula, and the change is definitely NOT for the better! True, they now include more vitamins - but at a paltry little 10%, with riboflavin B2, and vitamin B12 at 0%! (Why they even bother to list it on the container is beyond me), and phosporus has been reduced to 4%. The previous formula included higher percentages: vitamin A 45%, vitamin C 45%, calcium 8%, iron 15%, thiamine B1 60%, riboflavin B2 45%, niacin 45%, vitamin B6 45%, and phosphorus 8%. In short, they took something that was fairly healthy, and in the typical manner of American corporations, cheapened it into nothing more than junk-food milk-flavoring! I quoted the above percentages from an Ovaltine container from last year. Ovaltine is worthless now and I refuse to buy it until they return it to its orginial formula. I will be writing the company about this, too. They obviously think we're all stupid, and I boycott any company that acts like it thinks I'm stupid!

review/text: I use to have a glass of tasty Ovaline, Chocolate Malt just about every day. NO MORE. The new formula is bitter, has more calories, doesn't dissolve well, isn't chocolatey or malty enough. I'm so disappointed. And even worse, when I wrote them, all they said to my email was "acknowledged!" Meaning they there's not even a person reading our complaints. This is why I'm going public and encouraging all fellow Ovaltine lovers to write reviews and return their purchases - hopefully that will get their attention!

review/text: For DECADES I loved Ovaltine! I loved the way the crunchy crystals tasted and felt in my mouth; sometimes I would just eat a dry spoonful of Ovaltine straight from the jar and wash it down with a glug of milk. Good times!<br /><br />This USED to be more nutritional than Nesquik, but not anymore. Now, it's just like Nesquik, only sweeter and with LESS of a chocolate taste. Ovaltine isn't special anymore. If I want a chocolate-like flavoring in my milk now, I just buy whatever's cheaper.<br /><br />Since the flavor, texture, and nutritional value have changed so drastically, why even call it Ovaltine anymore? VERY disappointed.

I talked him into letting me try the old recipe Ovaltine and it was delicious. I loved it. It  blew nesquick out of the water. He then proceeded to give me a glass of the new recipe. It was horrible. I immediately tasted the difference and almost spit it out. Disgusting. My girlfriend was given the same test and she too thought it was rancid. There is no excuse to ruin the flavor of a long loved product to a horrible tasting product with much lesser nutritional value. I really hope no one buys this garbage to send them a clear message.

review/summary: Down the Drain - Odd Taste
review/text: I was a big-time Ovaltine user.  I had some everyday.  Lately, I have noticed the taste is way off.  I took about two sips, and had to dump the rest down the drain.  No time to investigate because I had to rush off to work.<br /><br />The next day, I did the same thing.  After a couple of sips, I said, "I can't drink this stuff."  And I dumped my glass of chocolate milk down the drain.<br /><br />On the third day, I opened up a new container.  I figured maybe I just had a bad batch.  That second container was bad too.  I had to dump out the whole glass of milk.  And I opened a third container, and it was just as disappointing as the first two had been.  (I usually keep several containers on hand because I would not ever want to run out of Ovaltine.)<br /><br />I am done with Ovaltine.  I did find a web page posted by the product manufacturer, and they were saying they had switched over to all natural ingredients for flavoring, and they have learned that there are variations in potency when you use natural products.  So essentially, they were saying "sorry for the screw up."  (This reminds me of New Coke.)<br /><br />I am never buying another Ovaltine again.  My only regret is that I have too much of an inventory of the stuff, and so maybe I will donate it to a food shelf.
