Try it, I'm so sure you WILL like it.  Once you start using it, you will continue to buy it.  CRIX really is a VITAL supply, that's why I keep one in my office drawer...

review/summary: The Adult Gum...
review/text: Lotte Ginseng Gum<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZM7P10">Lotte Ginseng Gum 1 pk 5 Sticks</a> is different in a couple of ways from the other available ginseng gums.  Firstly, it has no other flavor covering the ginseng taste- so don't expect minty or fruity tastes.  Since sometimes these mint cover-ups are biting, it is much more relaxing chewing gum without them.  Besides the flavor, it is a strong gum, with a pleasant ginseng effect.

review/summary: The spice is cinnamon
review/text: So this is cinnamon raspberry tea.  I think the cinnamon flavor is much stronger than the raspberry flavor, so if you like cinnamon tea you'll probably like this.  I ordered it hoping the spice would be cloves or something; I'm not a fan of cinnamon in tea.  But that's my problem, not the tea's problem.  :)  The tea bags are not individually wrapped, so you may want to seal them in ziploc bags or something after opening the box.

review/summary: Best root beer out there
review/text: This is definitely the best root beer I've ever tasted. Unlike some other beverages that are flavored with honey, you can actually taste it in this. It has a nice bite, not too harsh, and the after taste is smooth and sweet. That being said, I wouldn't pay more than $2/bottle for this-and that would really be pushing it for a soda you were drinking at home. (I could see paying a premium at a restaurant.) $36 for a 12 pack is ridiculous (current advertised price). They sell 4 packs at my local grocery store for less than $5. If you can get it at a reasonable price, it's definitely recommended.

review/summary: Best Soda in the World
review/text: Sprecher Root Beer is probably the best soda I've ever tasted, surely in no small part because it incorporates vanilla and real Wisconsin honey into the mix.  But don't take my word for it.  The food editors for the NEW YORK TIMES did a blind taste test of 25 root beers, and Sprecher was their #1 choice.  In their words, Sprecher is "a wonderfully balanced and complex brew."  If you're a root beer enthusiast and have never enjoyed Sprecher, you have no idea what you're missing.  Even the lo-cal version is really good...better than most full-calorie root beers I've tasted.<br /><br />Sprecher is brewed in Milwaukee, where I was born and raised.  Now that I live in Maryland, one of the toughest pills to swallow has been the unavailability of Sprecher Root Beer.  Around Milwaukee, you can get it at just about any restaurant and in every store.  In Maryland, only my local specialty grocery store stocks it.  I stop in every so often to buy some, but it is always sold out.  Other gourmet root beers line the shelves, but there is always a big gap where the Sprecher used to be.

review/summary: Has High Fructose Corn Syrup!
review/text: The BOTTOMLINE requirement for the FIRST STEP towards a premium root beer is to have PURE SUGAR CANE! This should be obvious. This drink simply cannot compare with Bulldog Gourmet's or Virgil's where they use actual herbs (wintergreen) and PURE SUGAR CANE. Wish I could be more detailed in this review, but this is an immediate PASS. Clearly the company is trying to save a buck and not fork out the real sugar to produce a quality product.  Do not get me wrong though, I am not saying this root beer does not taste good, it just can't compare and shouldn't even be in competition due to its cheap (and very unhealthy) corn syrup. Cheers to Bulldog Gourmet!

review/summary: A bit pricey, but worth it for your pet.
review/text: Now I know many people would rather spend $30 on something else rather than their cat food, but I have to say this cat food is great. Ever since I switched to this from Nutro brand cat food, my cats now have shinier and healthier coats, as well as more energy. My overweight cat has lost some weight too. Both my 2 year old and my 9 year old love this food. Though the price is a bit high, I think it's worth it for my cats. They're much more active and healthy after switching to this. They also eat less, as the food is more rich.<br /><br />This food is 45% protein, so it's really good for your cats. Also, it's a cheaper alternative to Innova EVO and Core Wellness cat foods, which have slightly higher protein content but higher price. In case you were wondering, all cheap cat foods will usually have around 10% of protein.... This is carnivore food we're talking about here! They can't even use most of the filler other foods have, it just contributes to empty calories and overweight kitties!<br /><br />Do your cats a favor and buy them this, it'll make them healthier and I promise you'll notice the difference within a couple days. Oh by the way, since this is full of protein, their poops WILL get stinkier. Now my two cats BOMB the place after buying this food, the smell is something similar to human poop after a big meaty meal! LOL. To me though, it's worth it. Just remember to keep some Febreeze handy!

review/summary: Perfect addition to any Indian meal and a versatile condiment that works as a dip or spread
review/text: I like to tinker in the kitchen and make my own chutney but when winter comes I fill my pantry with Patak's. Compared with other chutney brands, I find Patak's offers a bolder taste that is both spicy and salty.<br /><br />We buy Sweet Mango Chutney for the entire family because Patak's rates this blend at two chilies on a five-chili scale. Our sons, ages 7 and 5, have no trouble enjoying the chutney. I like hotter chutney as well but don't want to use up the refrigerator space by storing multiple jars.<br /><br />Chutneys - derived from the Hindu word chatni - have many variations and can range from sweet, sour, hot or mild. Chutney consists of fruits, vegetables or a combination of both that is reduced to a pulp that is roasted or simmered and flavored with spices, sugar and vinegar.<br /><br />Patak's Sweet Mango Chutney blends juicy mangoes with authentic spices and is served as a condiment to a curry but is also delicious on sandwiches (especially turkey, so keep it handy after Thanksgiving!) and hot salads.<br /><br />Aida Mollenkamp at Chow offers this recipe for Cheddar and Chutney Tea Sandwiches.<br /><br />TIME/SERVINGS<br />Total: 35 mins<br />Active: 5 mins<br />Makes: 8 tea sandwiches<br /><br />The question is not whether cheese and chutney go well together, but rather which cheese to choose. As a nod to the British, we've opted for an aged sharp cheddar to star in this sandwich, but snacking in the test kitchen revealed that fresh goat cheese is a close runner-up.<br /><br />Game plan: Let the sandwiches rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving, so the chutney has time to soak into the bread.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />8 tablespoons mango chutney<br />16 slices (2-1/2-by-2-1/2-inch) dark pumpernickel cocktail bread<br />4 ounces aged sharp cheddar, thinly sliced<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />Spread a thin layer of chutney on one side of each bread slice. (You will use 1 tablespoon per sandwich or 1 1/2 teaspoons [1/2 tablespoon] per slice of bread.)<br /><br />Top 8 slices with a layer of cheese (about 1/2 ounce per slice) and close sandwiches with remaining 8 slices of bread. Let sit about 30 minutes before serving to allow flavors to meld. Serve sandwiches whole, or if you like, slice each sandwich in half on the diagonal.<br /><br />Here's another delicious chutney recipe I found online:<br /><br />Chutney-Glazed Cheese Pate<br /><br />6 oz. cream cheese, softened<br />4 oz. sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded<br />3 tablespoons dry Sherry<br />3/4 teaspoon curry powder<br />1/4 teaspoon salt<br />2 green onions, finely sliced (optional)<br />Mango chutney<br /><br />Process the first five ingredients using a food processor until well blended. Spread cheese mixture in a �" thick disc on a serving platter. Cover and chill until serving time. At serving time, spread the top of the cheese with chutney. Top with sliced green onions. Serve with crackers.

review/text: I had to taste the stuff when it arrived. I was at first hit with the sweet salty flavor of it. I screwed the lid back on the jar and thought "not bad". I stuck the opened jar in the fridge and stacked the rest on the shelf. It was then that I realized that the mango chutney was not through with me. My mouth was a symphony of flavors and residual tastes that demanded an encore. If I was not diabetic that jar would be empty by now. It beats Major Grey's in my estimation. As I type this I am thinking of an excuse to go get some more. This stuff is dangerous.

review/summary: Cost-effective and tasty base for making your own soups on the fly...
review/text: As a soup lover who doesn't have enough time to regularly make batches of homemade soups, but who is not satisfied with either the ingredients or nutritional value of most canned soups (not to mention the horrificly high sodium levels), I'm always trying to make simple soups in one or two-serving sizes on the fly using packaged stocks (chicken or vegetable).<br /><br />It's very easy for me to add some steamed veggies (or beans) and seasonings to low-sodium chicken stock and then quickly heat and whirr (with my electric hand blender) up a healthy and tasty soup course. The only problem has been that I often did not want or need to use 32-ounces of the stock (the size of most aseptic packaged soup stocks) at one time. Although once opened, these 32-ounce packages can stay usable for maybe 10 days after opening, I still found myself throwing the unused contents out. Wasteful.<br /><br />These individually packaged small (8-ounce) sizes allow you to make just enough for a serving or two (depending on appetite) without waste. (Yes, you're paying a bit more in a cost-per-ounce comparison, but this is about convenience and avoiding waste.)<br /><br />Since I'm always adding my own seasonings (in dried or fresh form), the base flavor is not that important. In fact, I prefer a "neutral" or blandish stock so that it doesn't dominate the soup I"m making. I'm not saying this stock is tasteless, but if you're not used to low-sodium stock you're not gonna like any brand of it. (I use store generic brands as well as Pacific which I find tasty enough to heat up alone and sip if needed, especially in the winter. But again this is a stock and the base for building something. Not something that has a pronounced "taste/flavor" of its own. You will however, know that it is chicken and not vegetable stock.)<br /><br />Since I use chicken stock to flavor a lot of other dishes (including sauteed  vegetables) instead of oils and butter, having small amounts available to use as needed is both convenient and cost-effective. (I would never use those horrible chicken boullion cubes and the only other alternative, a fairly tasty powdered mix from Vogue, is just too expensive in dry form and hard to find.)<br /><br />That the stock is organic is a big plus. That does matter to me.<br /><br />If you are not cooking for a crowd, but rather for one or two, and use chicken stock for soups or in other foods, these are something you'll want to keep on hand.<br /><br />FYI: They are hard to find in stock locally and are more expensive than amazon. It's another convenience and cost saver to be able to order them online.

review/summary: Not your average broth...
review/text: This broth is tasty and works well with so many dishes.  However, since my family was used to Swanson, we found recipes that we were used to tasted different.  Although my taste buds are not smart enough to know what the difference was, I assume this comes from the combination of ingredients used to make this broth.  The ingredients are listed here:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic chicken broth (filtered water, organic chicken), Organic chicken flavor, Natural chicken flavor (chicken broth, salt), Organic evaporated cane juice, Autolyzed yeast extract, Organic onion powder, Turmeric, Organic flavor.<br /><br />Going organic I have had to make many adjustments and this is just another one but totally worth it.  In the long run going organic is the best thing for our family and despite tasting different this broth is still delicious.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Also, for those interested, from what I have read 'autolyzed yeast extract' is a type of MSG.<br /><br />"The amino-acids contained in the Yeast Extracts result exclusively from the proteins present in food grade Yeasts (baker's or brewer's or lactic) which are used to manufacture the Extracts. Those amino-acids contain a large proportion of essential amino-acids, particularly lysine, together with glutamic acid. The Yeast Extracts contain a maximum of 18 % glutamic acid on the basis of the total protein content (total glutamic acid refers to both free glutamic acid and glutamic acid in small peptides). The free glutamic acid content is between 6 % and 13 % of the total protein content. This free glutamic acid, which is a natural component of Yeast Extract, plays a major role in its aromatic power. Glutamic acid, also referred to as monosodium glutamate (MSG) has flavor enhancing capabilities and is associated with Umami, the fifth taste sensation."<br />-www.yeastextract.info

review/summary: Beware, this is NOT English Breakfast Tea.
review/text: The following is a review of the larger size product offering of this tea that I wrote after buying it:  This is NOT English Breakfast tea. In fact, it is closer to Chinese tea than it is to western style black tea. It tastes like the stuff that used (perhaps still is) to be served on the trains in Taiwan, ROC, or in restaurants...yes, that's right, it tastes just like cheap grade commercial Chinese tea (not Chinese/Japanese Green tea, but commercial grade drinking tea such as that given out for free in restaurants like we do iced water here in USA).<br />As such it is insipid, with just a hint of flavor. It may be decaffeinated, but who knows, its flavor is so weak and flacid that one hardly cares.<br />I feel ripped off after buying this and you will too. Do yourself a favor and avoid it. If you want good, strong, loose leaf decaf tea buy the stuff from Taylor's of Harrogate when it is available here on Amazon.

review/summary: Olives arrived slimy and gross
review/text: I've purchased bulk olives from Amazon twice before and they where great. These olives I just recieved today must be many years old.<br />The cover had some kind of brown crust on the threads.<br /> The olives are all discolored and slimy. Many of them are covered with spots and some are just mush.<br /> What should be green olives are a washed out tan color and the black olives are tan with black spots.<br />  These olives are clealy many years old and I don't think they are safe to eat.<br /><br /> The package has no sell by date but the lot number is 64 10620.<br /><br />I art a few before I reolized how nasty they looked. I'm feeling a little quezy and I hope it is all in my head.

review/text: I was hesitant to buy this for lack of reviews, but I am glad that I did. These mixed olives are very tasty. Salty as one reviewer put it? DUH! They are brined olives. Not any more salty than any others that I have had. The blend of herbs is quite nice (mostly rosemary & bay leaf). I believe that there are really only two kinds of olives in this mix, if you discount sizes. Definitely worth the price. I will buy again.

review/summary: Closest thing to 70s Girl Scout Fudge Patties I've found yet--Keebler Fudge Filled Cookies
review/text: For anyone who remembers those fudgy little cookies and has been missing them, this is a good news/bad news story.  The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby.

review/summary: Tastes just like thin mints!
review/text: The last time my boyfriend was in town, we say these at walmart and bought 4 boxes since the markets in his area do not stock these. They didn't last long at all once he got them home! I ordered these for the same price per box that we got them at wallyworld and had them shipped to his house. He forgot that the package was for him, and once he opened it he was delighted to find a weeks worth of these yummy cookies! Normally he would be stocking up on the girl scout thin mints this time of year, but he is delighted to find that keebler has a similar product for so much cheaper and available all year. He is now joking that the serving size is a box instead of a sleeve!<br /><br />Apparently these taste amazing with peanut butter.

review/summary: Thin & crispy but too salty
review/text: I love blue corn tortillas and their products. I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do. I like eating dipping them into my homemade, low-salt guacamole- YUM!!

review/summary: Too salty and nearly expired.
review/text: I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried.  I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year.  But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips!  And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have "best by" dates of February 3, 2010.  How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month?  Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank.  I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first.  And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month.  Learn from my experience!

review/text: These 1.5" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale.

review/summary: Good, as long as they are still fresh
review/text: I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....

review/summary: I love the sesame in these chips, you will too!
review/text: I love sesame in general. It makes foods more satisfying. There are two brands of blue corn sesame chips I know of; this one and one by Kettle. I think I might prefer the Kettle brand a little over this one since they use sprouted corn. Somehow that improves the flavor a little. These are still a 5 star product though. Sadly, I just searched for the Kettle chips and found they have been discontinued, so not only are these a great choice for sesame blue goodness they are your only choice!<br /><br />Of course chips like these are pretty high in fat, so it is not a good idea to eat them too often. They are quite addictive as well. For a little addition to a lunchtime meal you will not be disappointed. I hope you like them as much as I do.<br /><br />-Dan

Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of "flavor enhancer".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free.

review/text: Many snacks labeled "healthy" today still have hydrogenated oils in them.  Garden of eatin' snacks do not.  The taste is wonderful.  Great with salsa and/or guacamole.  The sesame seeds add a nice flavor without being overpowering.  My favorite chip for all occasions.

review/summary: The best corn chips out there
review/text: Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable.

Canola oil is made from genetically modified rapeseed. They also say it may have Safflower or Sunflower oil, but I'd<br />rather not take part in that lottery. I'd like to send back this lot, but I'm not willing to bet, they would not have the nerve to sell it to the next unsuspecting soul, so it will go straight into the trash can ,where it belongs.

review/summary: The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization
review/text: Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole "organic" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this "red hot" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.

review/summary: If you want fiber, don't buy!
review/text: I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!

review/text: I purchased these chips on October 18, 2010.  They were rancid/stale so you can certainly believe the other reviewers.  I had not noticed the reviews about the horrible taste and staleness of these chips.  I wish I had.  I contacted customer service for a refund which they approved but I think Amazon should either stop selling these chips due to such poor reviews or check their stock to make sure they are FRESH. If you order, you should order with caution.  I am trying another brand instead of reordering these.

The Amazon vendor was no longer shipping so they were not replaced. I thought I was out the cost of a case of corn chips and still hungry.<br />  But...........<br />Upon hearing my concern, Amazon found a vendor and sent a new shipment at their cost next day.

review/text: I have eaten the varieties of these for years and appreciate the concept- organic, not over salted, good varieities, etc.<br /><br />But more and more often, whether purchased here or in the store, in all varieties, the chips come with a sharp odor and flavor that to more suggests that rancid oil was used.  Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.  I had to throw out a whole case of sesame blues from Amazon, which is a bad deal at any price. I am done with your rancid products.

review/summary: Regular tortilla chips.  Not flavorful.
review/text: I have noooo idea what the "blech" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad. They were not too crunchy either.  In fact they are almost plain regular chips.  No big pizzaz here.  I was sad about that.<br /><br />I was actually really hoping for something limey! And Spicy! But don't expect that here.  I've almost gone through a whole bag, and maybe 1% of the bites have a hint of lime?  Zero bites have had a hint of chili.  99% taste like regular unflavored tortilla chips.  Well...a suuupppper small hint of flavor.  I'm almost wishing I had bought the pico de gallo instead.<br /><br />Basically, if you've been eating any chili-lemon flavored cheetos, completely wipe your memory and expectations- nothing that bold and tangy here.  (Which can be good and bad, my hubby hated the cheetos chili-lemon unspicy flavor and was worried we'd get that here, so he's happy we didn't.  I was looking forward to getting that popping taste, and am sad that wasn't there.)<br /><br />** WARNING: If you've never ordered full size bag of chips from amazon, be warned, 12 bags is A LOT!!! I opened the box and my jaw almost dropped, cause I don't know what I'm going to do with all the bags.  I'm sure they'll disappear at parties though.  (I had ordered mini 2oz bags from Amazon, and with those, the bulk amount is more manageable.)<br /><br />** Also, to make you feel good...I was at Ralphs shopping and one bag of 'Garden of Eaten' chips cost $5.39.  I think it was jalapeno cheese, and that's all they had, but regardless, I felt so good that I got the same thing for about $1.25 a bag (yea Amazon had it on sale). Yippy :-)<br /><br />** Chips were not stale, chipped or smashed on arrival, in case you're wondering.  And expiration date (on my on sale ones) is in about 4 months.

I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work.

review/text: I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone.

review/summary: Yuck-a-moldy
review/text: If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of "guac-a-mole" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) "new look, same great taste" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the "Mad-Men" era I grew up in.

review/text: I really like these chips. We go through a lot of corn chips in this house and it is important to me that our corn chips are organic as I refuse to eat GMO corn. They have a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. My only complaint is that this last case we recieved, the chips are so fragile! They are breaking really easily, they are not holding up to any amount of dipping, which is a bummer. I'll still buy these chips, I'm just not as pleased with them as I have been in the past. Perhaps it was just an odd batch, as they haven't always been this way.<br /><br />We have bought several flavors of Garden of Eatin chips and this brand is a winner, overall. Definitely our favorite corn chip brand!

review/text: You watch your mouth!<br /><br />Simply, one of the best things I have ever eaten. Healthy organic blue corn chips with taste that packs a punch.<br /><br />I won't waste your time reading about these when you can be enjoying them instead. Just note that some bags seem to have a more generous allotment of cayenne pepper (the special ingredient that distinguishes Red Hot Blues from the standard Blue Chips). Or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment, in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag. You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews. Hopefully this will be of some help to customers, plus point them toward the main listing (the one with Free Shipping and sold directly from Amazon!).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQYW0E">Garden of Eatin'� Tortilla Chips Red Hot Blues, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />P.P.S.

review/summary: If Amazon could have sent the right product, it would have been good.
review/text: These are excellent chips, except Amazon couldn't get the order straight and twice sent me cases of Red Hot Blues. Great. What does a single person do with 2 cases of already flavored chips? Yep, give them away. I liked the Red Hots, but wanted these with no seasoning (I make my own salsas) for every day and Amazon just couldn't pull it off. The case was even clearly labelled.  Go figure. Amazon did refund my money fully.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: These chips are delicious. Salty sweet with a hint of spice. I have no idea how Tamari is supposed to taste, but these chips are awesome. I just finished an entire bag in one day!

review/summary: Sodium: 120mg, not 70mg as reported by Amazon
review/text: Just received my shipment. Tasty chips, but as my title says, they have 120mg of sodium which is almost double the amount listed by amazon on the product page.

review/summary: Super taste sensation, not too hot, but spicy enough for children to crave
review/text: If you cannot tolerate extremely hot spicy chips, but like some zing with the crunch then these chips are made for your enjoyment. I purchased these around the holidays and they were truly enjoyed by many guests. Yes, I will be purchasing these chips again because they are really good for you being organic, and affordable.

review/summary: a fine product from a savvy company
review/text: Be warned that these chips have NO SALT.  That is what I want, so that I can taste the interesting flavor of this unique variety of corn, unadulterated by unhealthful sodium.  The blue color is not a artificial chemical coloring, but healthful anthocyanins.  This corn is a great source of these compounds, which have been demonstrated to have immense and healthful benefits.  Highly recommended, especially for corn lovers!<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]

review/summary: Vegan Natural [Organic Corn] Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Kosher Parve. Made with organic yellow corn; canola, safflower, or sunflower oils [all organic and/or conventional]; and sea salt. Great choice for those who like corn chips like Fr*tos. Great with bean burritos, enchiladas, soups, and even as a crunchy salad topping. Like most chips, highly caloric. 170 calories per 1oz/28g serving. Use as a garnish, repackage in smaller snack bag sizes, or eat in moderation. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

review/summary: No salt added!
review/text: I love this product very much. Normally, chips are too salty for me. This product is just perfect. I like to eat it without any sauce to enjoy its natural great flavor.

review/summary: Great Flavour - Excellent Find!
review/text: I've been hunting for snacks which taste good, but don't have BHA,BHT,EDTA,hydrogenated (partially or otherwise) fats, artificial colors and a myriad of other ingredients which are known to be "bad" yet they are still allowed in food production.  I can't express how excited I was to find these!  My husband is a very picky snacker - he loves these.  My children one which likes spicy and one which doesn't (third is too young for this kind of food) love these.  They are great straight out of the bag or as an accompaniment to a sandwich or bowl of chili.<br /><br />I initially found these in our local PCC and Whole Foods.  I'm glad Amazon carries them.  Price wise I'm saving at least $1.00/bag by buying through Amazon instead of from my grocery.
