review/summary: My dogs are not that impressed
review/text: My dogs love the wet/can version so I thought I would buy them some dry to mix with the can.  They seem to look at it just like any other dry dog food.  Maybe they are spoiled.  But at least they claim the products are natural and the Merrick brand seems to be nutritious overall.

review/summary: Not a fan of cleaning up after sick dogs
review/text: So I spent hours researching dog foods- I wanted something not outrageously expensive but also did not contain all the horrible things we're told not to feed our dogs. I read reviews that said people's dogs didn't like the food, got sick, etc. I assumed those were picky or old dogs. My dogs generally love eating time and will eat anything from frogs to cat poo-- lovely.<br />Anyway- my younger dog begs me not to make him eat the food. I mixed in soft food just so he'd eat it. They dogs have been constipated, throwing up, diarrhea-- the whole nine yards. I isolated other factors to make sure it was the food- continued to feed it to them for a week- and just finished scrubbing the carpet again. Enough. I was so excited to find 'good' food. Too bad my dogs hate it.

review/text: I absolutely love this Cat Butt Gum.  When I chew it I instantly feel warm and fuzzy!  At first I was a litte reluctant to try it because of the name but after opening the box and trying a piece out, I realized that I love the taste and smell of Cat Butt.  The cute box is just a plus!

review/summary: Whole lotta flour goin' on.
review/text: More than $50 in price, 5 pounds in weight and with 6 packages of flour in total, this perhaps the most outrageous food item available on Amazon.com. I can't think of a reason why you'd order it in this fashion- 6 packs of flour can't possibly run this much in a store, and you don't have to pay for shipping there. If you have a little over $50 that ain't doing much and a need for 6 packs of King Arthur 100% organic flour, I'd say this is a good buy. Otherwise, buy what flour you need in a store. King Arthur flour is, in my experience, as good as it gets. Don't eat it straight, though. That isn't what it's for and you'll see why few people do it if you try. It's not dangerous, though. But flour, King Arthur brand or not, isn't supposed to be eaten straight out of the bag.

review/summary: Authentic Shaved Ice Syrup
review/text: We received a shaved ice machine as a gift, a Japanese style one that makes very fine shaved ice, and we searched far and wide for good, authentic shaved ice syrup.  I had never heard of this brand before but decided to give it a shot.  The shipping was expensive, $10, the same price as 2 bottles of syrup but it was worth it.  The bottles are on the smaller side but the flavor is amazing.  Reminds me of my childhood.  We bought the cherry and grape flavor and eat it almost every night!  This is the real stuff.  I would recommend ordering several bottles at once because it is so good that you'll run out quickly.

Too bad the government had to put the local growers out of business.  I'd hoped to find the taste of these beans to be in the same league;  but, no dice.  They were a decent bean, but not for the price.

review/summary: Addicting
review/text: I love eating nuts as a snack, in part because I can pretend they're healthy.  Plain walunts can be a bit bland, and I wanted something that wasn't chocolate covered.  These omega munchies hit the spot.  (I have to portion them out so I won't eat the entire bag in one sitting!)  Even my husband, who has a habit of using the words "cinnamon" and "too much" in the same sentence likes them.  They're sweet, crunchy and a good source of omega-3, which is great because who wants to snack on salmon to boost their omega-3 intake?  It's hard to get groceries like this from Amazon because you have to get so much at once, but it's worth the risk.  My second time ordering them, I decided to do a "subscribe and save" order.  I don't see myself wanting to look for a different snack anytime soon.

review/text: I bought this for my wife because she was looking for a change of pace from her usual mandarin orange spice tea. She was disappointed in that the tea had very little discernible cranberry flavor. Green teas are generally much milder (at least to me), but I had to agree that this one is too weak. I love iced green tea with lemon, but I am not a big hot tea drinker. Since you must buy the 2-pack from Amazon, I would suggest you really consider if you want to experiment. We won't be buying it again, but some might like it.

review/summary: The 'best' instant coffee in my humble opinion.
review/text: I first met this coffee while traveling in Mexico during the early 1980's. I enjoyed it very much. My father also was spending time in Mexico, and he wrote to Nescafe and asked why they were not selling it in the USA. The answer? 'Americans don't like strong tasting coffee' was the answer from Nescafe. Thirty years later, and countless 'strong' coffee shops later, they were proved wrong. I am very happy to be able to purchase this product on American store shelves now. However, I was not happy to see that Amazon is charging $7 a jar, when the going price in every 'normal' grocery store I have been in is under $5, generally around $4.78. I would love to purchase from Amazon, but please, try charging the going rate, or close to it.

I'm retracting that statement because now I have no problems with opening the lid.<br /><br />I agree with reviewer T. Salazar that there is a bitter aftertaste, which is tolerable for me, but I was a little disappointed at first. I only take cream with my coffee. Now I'm getting used to it, but my usual instant coffee of choice is a toss-up between Yuban and Maxwell House. I wanted to try this out because on Amazon each bottle comes out to be a couple of bucks cheaper than how much they sell Yuban and Maxwell House at my local grocery store (not to mention I wanted to try something different).

review/summary: such good coffee!
review/text: Such good coffee! Yes, it's instant, but as one reviewer mentioned, a live orchestra sounds better than a CD, but does that fact invalidate the CD? Why would it? Nestl&eacute; produces this coffee specifically for the latino/a market; I live close to the Mexican border and for the most part I've found freshly brewed coffee in Baja California is similar to freshly brewed in Alta California and usually very good to excellent. This is a product to keep on hand for quick cups of java; it's not quite the real thing, but consider my CD comparison that's also not exactly a live musical performance, but like Nestl&eacute; Clasico, can be an extremely pleasant addition to any day. PS Please don't purchase this through Amazon; it's lots less expensive if you can find it in your local market.

review/text: Nescafe Clasico is my all-time favorite. In fact, I like it so much, that I stopped brewing coffee from beans at home (I get Starbucks/Peet's drip-coffee at work). The flavor is complex and without any unpleasant aftertaste. I drink 3-4 cups a day, and never get tired of it.

review/summary: Great for instant coffee
review/text: I'm a bit of a coffee addict, but with my current living conditions I can't have a coffee maker. I bought a 3-pack of Nescafe Clasico based on all the positive reviews, and I'm not disappointed! While instant coffee will never be as delicious as the real thing, this coffee is really quite good. I've tried a few instant coffees (Starbucks, Folgers, and some others), and this is my favorite by far. It's slightly bitter, but I have no problem drinking it without creamer.

review/text: I love the taste of this coffee. I am like many others who don't like the strong taste of brewed coffee. And in most restaurants that is what I always end up with. With instant you can adjust it to your own taste. I drink probably about the equivalent of three cups every morning. I do it within a large thermal mug that can be taken with me. I use a heaping spoonful for the flavor I want. When I get down to half a jar I am picking up another jar for backup. At a little over $5 I will pay whatever the price for this particular brand.

Altoids has moved from "Naturally" flavored to "Naturally and Artificially Flavored."  The mints have a bite now and an undesirable aftertaste.  Sadly, I will never purchase these again and after decades of my favorite mint, I now have to bid a sad farewell.  If you are a fan of the good ol' Spearmint Altoids, do not buy these.

review/summary: Consistent and very high quality
review/text: Illy espresso beans are my favorite of all the widely available commercially produced roasted espresso beans. This is the standard medium roast that Illy produces and it is a bit less aggressive and milder tasting than the dark roasts of Lavazza (the other major Italian brand that some people favor).<br /><br />When properly ground, tamped, and brewed Illy espresso has a delightful aroma and flavor, unmatched by any of the other brands.<br /><br />Granted, Illy is quite pricey, and I do not use it all the time for this reason. However, you get what you pay for. Usually, I buy my espresso from a small roasting house in the Midwest that produces a decent medium roast substitute that I do not mind using most of the time. But Illy definitely produces a higher quality bean.<br /><br />One way to judge the quality of roasted espresso beans even before you taste the coffee that they will produce is to look at the evenness of color and size of the beans. The reason is that beans of a uniform size tend to roast more evenly than beans of varying sizes. Moreover, even when the beans are of a uniform size, it is important that they be roasted in small batches and churned during the the entire roasting process to ensure that they all get roasted to the same point. This is why most high quality coffee is roasted in small batches in a rotating drum that roasts all the beans to the exact same point. Moreover, since the moisture content of the beans varies a bit from batch to batch, quality control in the roasting process is extremely important. And it is here that Illy is unmatched. Just do a simple visual comparison of the color and consisteny of Illy beans when compared to any of the other widely available brands and you can easily see why Illy is the best.

review/text: Coffee taste is a personal preference. I love coffee and Illy medium roast espresso beans are among my favorites. That's not why I buy Illy for the office however. I buy it for use in my office because the beans stay perfectly fresh in the super sturdy sealed cans for a very long time. Three month old cans open as fresh as 3 day old cans. So, I can buy 6 cans at a time, and never run out!

review/summary: It's expensive and delicious!
review/text: I'm a bit of a coffee snob, not a total fanatic but I have tried just about every variety under the sun, enjoy my espresso and lattes, have a favorite local coffee shop where I buy locally-roasted espresso... we have all the appropriate equipment at home and enjoy a latte every morning.<br /><br />This Illy medium-roast is seriously delicious stuff. It really is extremely high-quality, perfectly roasted, nutty coffee that produces a wonderful, creamy espresso. We've had the red-top Illy a couple of times over the years and it has always been a delightful treat.<br /><br />The downside: price. The locally-roasted locally-designed blend I buy (Global Village Organic Coffee, Raleigh, NC) is our staple espresso and has been for 12 years. The price inches up every few years and we now find it at $12.50/lb, which is fair for a pound of GOOD espresso (not the cigarette ash taste of Starbucks - why stop roasting there? Why not just leave the beans going for another 30 seconds and turn them in to pure carbon?). This Illy comes in at, approximately, $25/lb, about double (or even triple) what you need to spend to get a VERY good coffee bean to brew.<br /><br />I guess it depends what you're looking for. For us, it's a very nice treat, something a little different in the hopper, a little special, with a long shelf life and comes out fresh when you pop open the can. But there's no way we'd buy it on a regular basis; it will never be a staple. There are other varieties (right here on Amazon!) that are comparable for 1/3 of the cost per pound, and local options available in most cities that may be comparable or better.<br /><br />Still... Illy is VERY good. Worth trying at least once!

review/summary: Premium Gum - Good For Your Teeth
review/text: Just like other chewing gums, I have to open two everytime.  One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth.  Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price.  Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle.  But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out.  What more, it cleans your teeth.  No calorie and no sugar.<br /><br />Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the maker of "Juicy Fruit".  Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944.  Distributed to US soldiers during the war.<br />It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health.  It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States.

review/summary: Regional soda
review/text: Cheerwine is a regional soda from North Carolina, that has expanded into 12 other southeast states in the last 8 years. Started in 1917, Cheerwine was first formulated in the basement of L. D. Peeler's wholesale grocery store. Created during prohibition when it was common to name sodas after liquors. The owner added a new cherry flavor syrup to his previous soda and cheerwine was born. Believe it or his great grandsons still run the company.<br />The bergundy red soft drink has a nice mellow cherry flavor, and the color is really a pretty burgundy color, almost like wine. It is more subtle and seems less sweet on the palate than the grocery store house brands of cherry soda. No aftertaste or bite. It is easy to see why the locals in North Carolina rave about this and the other drink from this company, "Cool Moon".  Also made in diet soda.

review/text: Like many others, I have been looking for a decent replacement for the restaurant-style sweet and sour sauce.  I know it isn't the most healthy thing to consume, but it sure is good.  This is as close as I have found to the "real" stuff.  It is very similar in appearance, texture, and taste.  It seems to have more of a vinegar smell to it than the real stuff, but the taste is not overpowering in the vinegar department.  I think the key difference between this stuff and the other stuff out there is the fact that this is labeled as being "Hawaiian style."  It did not really register for me until I started thinking about it.  Once, while at a tiny little Chinese restaurant, I remember seeing a sweet and sour sauce container that boasted a "Hawaiian style" and it had large chunks of veggies and pineapple in it.  After thinking about it, this stuff seems to be very similar.  This does not have large chunks of anything in it, though.  It is just the sauce.<br /><br />If you are looking for the stuff you find in restaurants and you cannot find it elsewhere, give this a shot.  It is not dead on, but it is really close.  Even though there is a slight taste difference, it is not as bad as some of the others out there.

review/summary: Great sauce & the kids love it too
review/text: This is the only sweet and sour sauce that I can find in the grocery stores that my 11 year old son will eat. I've been using it for years along with cooking up store-bought frozen chicken nuggets (or my own homemade chicken or turkey nuggets) as a replacement to taking him out to his favorite fast food restaurant. I've served it up to his friends and they all seem to love it too, so I definitely recommend it for kids. Love it myself too.<br /><br />It definitely tastes a lot closer to what you'll find in Chinese-American restaurants. All the other bottled sweet and sour sauces seem to be spicy/hot or aren't sweet at all. This one definitely isn't spicy and is sweet like it should be.<br /><br />Its been getting a little more difficult finding this in the grocery stores lately, and it always seems to go fast when anyone does have it in stock. I'm really glad to find it here on Amazon, with free super saver shipping, and such a great deal on sale! It may be a pack of 6 bottles, but I usually have to stock up when I can find it anyhow, so its worth it. Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: I saw this at Target and pulled it up on Amazon to check the reviews. They were great! So I bought a jar (very expensive compared to other peanut butter) and brought it home. I opened it up immediately excited to try it based on the great reviews and couldn't even eat a spoonful of it. Disgusting is the only the word I can think of, it tastes like a combination of sea water (it is SOOO salty) and synthetic peanut butter. All I have to say is, don't order in bulk until you try it and know you like it. Yuck!

review/summary: The best peanut butter with 1/2 the fat and calories
review/text: I was skeptical when I heard about this peanut butter because I wondered how they removed the fat from peanuts that are naturally fatty, and what would it taste like.  Well I absolutely love this peanut butter because they just drained some fat and replaced it with other natural and organic products.  This is definitely must try after searching everyone for one jar, I finished that then bought the case.

review/summary: The only sushi wrap I use and trust!
review/text: With the seaweed sushi nori, you have to be careful with, especially the ones from China.  A lot of them have added chemicals, or are manufactured in questionable ways.  Eden Foods is a company that really cares about the quality of their products from the research I have spent online, reading about their company, from the material they sent me after I inquired, and from finding out that a lot of their Japanese products are imported from Japan from a very reputable company.  They do business with companies that produce the products in the traditional way (for ex. their soy sauce, tamari, toasted sesame oil), while maintaining the products integrity. It's pricey, but it's worth the money knowing you are eating food that is safe to eat.  This brand is often sold at Whole Foods, and other health stores.  I buy several items from their line, especially the toasted sesame oil, all of their various seaweed, soy sauce/tamari, mirin, and some of their noodles.  I respect this company and am pleased that they try to keep their products natural...and no...I do not work for this company.  I'm just really into organics, and food that is safe for our bodies, and this company gets A+ marks in that category from me.

review/summary: Excellent product! Only Nori I will buy!
review/text: This is the only nori I will buy!  Be careful of other brands like Pacific Cove, who sources from China!  This nori comes from Japan, and the company, Eden Foods, is an upstanding company.  When the Japan earthquake occurred, they put up informational notices on their website informing everyone of what had been hit hard, what products could be contaminated, and were going to be sourced elsewhere.<br /><br />I DO NOT WORK FOR THEIR COMPANY!  But I really love Eden!  They are not owned by a major company, as many organic brands have sold out to bigger corporations:General Mills owns Muir Glen and Cascadian Farm<br /><br />* Heinz owns Hain, Breadshop, Arrowhead Mills, Garden of Eatin', Farm Foods, Imagine Rice (and Soy) Dream, Casbah, Health Valley, DeBoles, Nile Spice, Celestial Seasonings, Westbrae, Westsoy, Little Bear, Walnut Acres, Shari Ann's, Mountain Sun, and Millina's Finest<br /><br />* M&M-Mars owns Seeds of Change<br /><br />* Coca-Cola owns Odwalla<br /><br />* Kellogg owns Kashi, Morningstar Farms, and Sunrise Organic<br /><br />* Philip Morris/Kraft owns Boca Foods and Back to Nature<br /><br />* Tyson owns Nature's Farm Organic<br /><br />* ConAgra owns LightLife<br /><br />* Danone owns Stonyfield Farm<br /><br />* Dean owns White Wave Silk, Alta Dena, Horizon, and The Organic Cow of Vermont<br /><br />* Unilever owns Ben and Jerry's<br /><br />This company is very proud and in tune with the organic movement, unlike many other companies now producing organic foods and interested only in profit.<br /><br />Now, back to the Nori, I have eaten a TON of nori in my lifetime.  This is certainly not the most tastiest toasted nori, but it is not terrible either.  As far as taste goes, I give it a 3.5 to 4 stars.  But it's the only nori I consume, because I know it was harvested from clean waters, and is less likely to be laden with chemicals in the manufacturing process since it is produced in partnership with Eden foods.

These Plato organic strips were my next test before making my own - and one bag of each flavor was cheaper than the Chinese jerky I purchased!  We haven't received the salmon flavor yet but my dog seems to like both the chicken and duck flavors very much.  I was a little surprised at the product itself, given it is called a "strip," but looks more like a cookie than anything else.  Still, it's nice to find something made in the USA, with no corn, soy, or wheat gluten.  I will continue to buy these if my dog continues to eat them.

review/summary: Great Treat, Alternative of Chicken Jerky
review/text: I used to feed my then two month old puppy chicken jerky treats from Sams. It was cheap and he LOVED it. However, he started getting bloody diarrhea. This happened twice before I finally realized it was the jerky by researching this online. Since my puppy was also eating Greenies, Zuke's chicken treats, Milk Bones, Milk Bones Trail Mix, Iams Puppy dog food, Royal Canin food (digestion formula), puppy vitamins, Platos chicken treats, Natures Recipe food and treats, his puppy trainer's treats, and Benadryl (he has dermatitis), it was hard to pinpoint what the cause was. But once I figured it out, I stopped the Waggin Train and switched to Platos. Although these treats are more expensive and contain preservatives, it does seem a better alternative to liver failure or sudden death some pet owners were experiencing with chicken jerky treats.<br /><br />As for the seemingly biased reviews against jerky treats coming from China, I am a first generation Chinese immigrant with family back East, and I love them and where I am from, but shady practices are abound in China. So no xenophobia driven bias here, I have seen the damage done to my pup by Chinese treats, and these Platos treats are definitely a safer bet.<br /><br />The FDA statement regarding Chinese chicken treats can be found here:<br />[...]

review/summary: Made in USA and the new favorite treat!
review/text: I too am boycotting dog chews and treats not made in the US, so was nervous about ordering these.  Amazon needs to be very specific about this info in its descriptions, and not dance around the issue by leaving it out.  Country of origin should not be "optional" in terms of the descriptive information provided!<br /><br />That being said, these are a huge hit with our big guys.  They are a crunchy bisquit - not jerky - about 1 1/2" long by maybe 3/4" wide, but the first ingredient is organic chicken (package specifies "over 90% organic chicken"), followed by organic brown rice; the product is certified USDA Organic.  [I am of the camp that "organic" means anything containing a carbon atom, and that aspect is not a big selling point for ME, but may be desirable info for some.]  They are not inexpensive, but for a product made in the US AND mostly chicken, I think it's in line with other pet treats, or less.  I use them in combination with other, more grain-containing treats, since TOO much protein can put a lot of strain on the kidneys, especially in older dogs.<br /><br />Bottom line - great product...this doggy Mom approves!
