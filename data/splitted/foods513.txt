review/summary: Marmalade Done Right
review/text: Most marmalades are so sugary that they mask the underlying bitterness of the citrus.  This one puts the bitterness on display, to good effect.  This is a real marmalade, and not an orange-colored jelly.  Great on buttered toast.

review/text: The word 'bitter' is a category, not the experience of this wonderfully fruity and chunky preserve. Hero brand Orange Marmalade Bitter has plenty of sweetness yet the natural tang is present, along with orange fiber and rind to enliven morning toast. Try it on roast pork. This is my favorite fruit spread of any kind, hands down. I give it 6 stars.

review/text: I like a middle of the road marmalade, not overwhelmingly sweet, but also not too bitter. This product, in a 20g serving, has 10g of sugars and to me it doesn't taste like it's even remotely sweet. If you really like a bitter marmalade you'll probably like this, but it's not to my taste.

review/summary: Identifiable ingredients!
review/text: When we adopted two small shih-tzu puppies, we went to our local pet store and sampled a variety of puppy and adult canned foods. The biggest difference in puppy diets is that they are higher in fats and calories for high-energy fast growing puppies. Our puppies are not picky at all, so it wasn't like there was one they hated, but what we liked about this food was that had identifiable food chunks in it - duck, carrots, peas, etc, it wasn't too smelly, they have good solid poops with it, and they are growing quickly / happily on it! They've been eating it for three months now with no major issues, so it is our go-to food until they hit 1. We like it so much that I bought some of the adult food for our senior dog, and he is doing great on it - he has sensitive stomach issues, so not all canned or dried food digests well for him, but we've had no issues with this brand for him (Senior Plate, Turduckhen, Thanksgiving plate, etc).

Also, no more loose stool,whereas with every other food I tried, he would just leave half of it in the bowl until he was starving,then beg at the table for scraps. He would also have unpredictable stools, mostly loose. I highly recommend this food to anyone who cares for their dog like I do.

review/summary: So much easier on my babies tummy.
review/text: When we switch my daughter from nursing to eating her first solid foods we started with rice cereal.  The misery that caused will be forever emblazoned on my memory.  Colic, gas, and it backed her up right proper.<br /><br />My wife and I started researching alternatives on the Internet.  We found a bunch of references to how Barley was easier on a tummy.  That Barley soup/broth is often what is given to people recovering in hospitals etc...  I went to every local store looking for some.  Family and friends that had used it used to buy it locally.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  I found it here on Amazon and bought this pack of 12 boxes.<br /><br />We found rather strongly that this was much easier on my daughters tummy.  She continued to eat without distress after we made the switch.  We started using it just as cereal and then as she got older we started using it as a thickening agent and filler when mixed with pureed vegetables etc...  She liked things better when they were less runny and we liked things better when she was happy.<br /><br />We will be ordering more here shortly for the twins that have now joined our family.  For us it worked great.  I really do recommend it as a far better option that rice cereal.

review/summary: Always have this on hand
review/text: I keep Gerber 'Mixed' and 'Barley' on hand all the time. The 'mixed' consists of rice, oat and wheat so I mix a box of that with a box of the 'barley' and have a completely balanced breakfast cereal. I don't use it for people: I keep it handy for when the dogs have upset tummies and their regular food is too harsh on their digestive systems and they need soft, easy to digest food that fills them up and is healthy for them.  As their tummies return to normal, I reduce the baby cereal a bit and add in some of their normal foods and as they continue to improve, the baby cereal gets reduced while their normal foods eventually return to full bore.<br /><br />This is good for them, too, after dental cleanings/extractions, surgeries, when they need a little help in the 'bowel' department (fiber), or just as an added treat to change it up a bit in their daily diet.<br /><br />I have used this in place of bread crumbs when making a meatloaf (ok, I was desperate), but didn't care for the texture of the meatloaf once cooked. It was too soft for our liking, but still quite tasty.

review/summary: Not the best I've had but it's still pretty darn good
review/text: I bought these because I was given a bag of S'mores snacks and it tasted so good I wanted to get more so I decided to get these but they don't taste as good.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is the yogurt covered marshmallows.  They're too big (about the size of a small marble), they're crunchy and there's only like 15 in each bag.  As far as I know S'mores don't have any yogurt and the marshmallows are not supposed to be crunchy.  The other brand bag I was given had lots of small marshmallows and they were soft and smooth, not crunchy.  I wish they would drop the yogurt part and just throw in the soft marshmallows.<br /><br />Also it has peanuts and chocolate morsels (just like those Hershey kisses but smaller) AND on top of that it has chocolate covered peanuts (just like M&M peanut but without the shell) so I don't know why they would add those when you already have peanuts and chocolate.<br /><br />For the price though you can't beat it.  You get a total of 95 Ounces which is slightly less than 6 pounds of this stuff so I can't really complain.<br /><br />Either way it's a good snack, doesn't taste bad at all.<br /><br />Get it for the kids, yourself or your workplace.

review/text: I have been using Willingham's BBQ rub for years on ribs, brisket, pork chops, chicken, shrimp, etc.  It is incredibly versatile and adds wonderful flavor to each dish.  The key to the effectiveness of any rub is the freshness of the spices and one whiff from this jar will convince you that you can't get generate any more freshness other than to make the rub yourself.  I have done that too and I couldn't find a recipe that has produced as many consistent compliments as Willingham's.

review/text: I use to live in Memphis, TN and actually was handed a free bottle of seasoning by the creator and owner of the company, at that time just starting.  I have used this product ever since, and make sure that i have extra bottles in my cabinet.  If you rub this on your ribs the night before, and put them covered in the refrigerator the night before, and then put the ribs and some additional rub in a large stew pot and cook the ribs slowly; you're in for a wonderful experience.<br /><br />If you love BBQ sauce, after you take the ribs out of the water put them on a large cookie sheet after dipping them in your BBQ sauce. Cover with foil, and bake 200 degrees for 2 hours. If you really plan ahead, dipping in BBQ sauce the day before and allowing the sauce to melt into the ribs only enhances the experience.<br /><br />NEVER add BBQ sauce to any meat on an open flame.  The sugar will carmelize when removed from the open flame and seal the rest of the BBQ sauce flavoring out of the meat.

The stuff is fantastic!  It is slightly sweet, but not cloyingly so.  It has a little zing (at least the extra hot one does) and it adds a lot of flavor, especially to curry dishes.  I doused my curry chicken with it and it is a fabulous combination.<br /><br />What a great condiment.  And much cheaper to buy from Amazon than have to send to South Africa for it!

review/summary: Wake up your taste buds!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001590JQ">Mrs Balls Hot Chutney</a><br />I first discovered Mrs. Ball's on a trip to England years ago.  I fell in love with it.  Alas, I had only brought one bottle home with me.  This was pre-Internet, so there was no more to be had.  Now I can get it again!<br /><br />It really is a delicious chutney, hot and smooth by comparison with others such as mild and chunky Major Grey's (a very good chutney of a different type).  It's flavor is just right, not too heavy handed with the strong spices, like cloves, which can leave a tinny aftertaste, but enough heat to make you sit up and take notice.<br /><br />If you're new to chutney and like things a bit spicy, give this a try.  It's not only good with curries, but it's excellent as a spread with cream cheese and, thinned with a little juice, makes a delicious baste for a pork roast.  Great product.

review/text: If you grew up in South Africa, this would just have a place in your heart. It is like tomato sauce, in that i put it on eggs, roasts, into stew, on fries (chips for those from UK or SA!) especially good with meatloaf! I can't rate it high enough, perhaps being South African i am slightly biased. Thanks Amazon for stocking this.

I use it a lot so this size package was ideal for me.  The quality is good, however I was less than pleased with the product packaging.  The product came in a plastic sachet which was completely ripped open on one side, causing the seeds to spill out into the packaging carton.  I was able to salvage most of the seeds, but it was an hassle to remove the debris accumulated.

review/summary: carefully consider your intended use of this product
review/text: i assumed since Lorann seems to be the market leader in the cake & candy semi-pro flavorings arena, that this would be an excellent product.  I was making a lot of milk shakes with the standard McCormick strawberry flavoring, found in most grocery stores, which worked well but was getting expensive.  I thought this might help me save some money.  Boy was I wrong.  No matter what I did, I couldn't get anything resembling a strawberry flavor.  I couldn't believe it, so I literally titrated the stuff into a glass of whole milk with one tablespoon of sugar added.  Drop by drop.  2-3 drops wasn't too noticeable.  By 9 to 10 drops, there was a horrible chemical mouthfeel, almost a mouth burn.  It was as though I was drinking Kodak film developer or something.  Maybe there was the slightest hint of strawberries, but nobody would have found it palatable. Avoid buying unless you know for certain it will work...I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one because I can't be sure it doesn't somehow become edible after certain cooking or processing steps.

review/summary: Love the flavors
review/text: I am in love with the Rise Bar brand. My favorites are their breakfast bars, which have a chunkier and crispier consistency. The energy bars have more of a "Powerbar" like texture, everything is ground, with some shredded coconut added to some flavors for interest. Little bits of amaranth add some texture too, but they are still more soft and chewy than crunchy. That said, the energy bars taste pretty amazing too, and are a better alternative for strict vegans (sweetened with brown rice syrup and tapioca syrup instead of honey).<br /><br />To note, the Rise Energy Bars are very sweet, and almost dessert-like in my opinion. I enjoyed them most as a mid-day treat, particularly when I hit an afternoon lull before a workout. Plus, they are the perfect size for a sustainable energy snack.<br /><br />I love all of the "superfruit" inspired flavors, which are a fun change from the ordinary. That said, I think the blueberry and coconut is still my favorite - the flavors really stand out and are great together!

review/summary: My favorite energy bar
review/text: I've tried a bunch of different energy bars and this is my favorite. It's not as heavy as some, is quite satisfying, and is not too sweet. It is also organic, mostly raw (which I think is healthier), and doesn't have a ton of weird non-food ingredients. It's also fairly tidy to eat - I like the kind bars also, but they are very sweet and very messy. Generally I cut it in 1/2 - as I don't think I need all the calories at once, and use it as an in-between meal snack, or to help fill me up if I've only had a smoothie or salad for a meal. I used to be a big fan of the lara bars, but I prefer these. I've bought this flavor and the coconut flavor - and buy both in bulk on on subscribe and save.

review/text: A long-time devotee, I don't expect to buy it again. After I tasted the "new improved" and found it much less flavorful than the old, I did a sniff test. The OLDER jar is more aromatic. Then I compared the ingredient lists. The one posted in Amazon is the old one, which begins sugar, chocolate, malt. The new list begins sugar, malt, chocolate. The new packaging looks blander and less robust -- a clue I should have heeded before buying. As far as I'm concerned there is no longer a Chocolate Malt Ovaltine.

review/summary: The "New Improved Recipe" is GROSS!
review/text: Started to order Chocolate Malt Ovaltine on here, but read some reviews first.  Then went to my cupboard to see what I had, as it still tastes like the real thing.  Well, I'd had several jars on hand, all with the new look, but now I'm using the second-to-last jar, and it has the new design, but doesn't say "New Improved Recipe".  Still good.  However, I always try to keep an open mind.  Decided to open the last jar which says "New Improved Recipe" on it, had some last night, and it had the worst, fishy-tasting, disgustingly awful flavor!  Will be calling Nestle right away to beg for the original recipe back. Needless to say, I won't be buying any until they do. (Their phone number is on the jar 800-442-0099 M-F 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern) OR OvaltineUSA.com<br /><br />Update: Just spoke with a Nestle rep. He says the vanilla they used in the batch I had was too strong, and they now have corrected that.  We'll see.  Also, he bragged that the new recipe has 12 vitamins (as opposed to the old recipe's 8 vitamins)  I had to point out to him that the new recipe may have 12 vitamins, but they all have only 10% of the RDA, whereas, of the old recipe's 8 vitamins, 5 had 45% of RDA, 1 had 50%, 1 had 60%, 1 had 15%, and they also list Calcium & Phosporous as 8% each (so that's 10 added vitamins).  He said he would tell the "marketing" person what I said.  I had hoped he'd tell the cook!  I'll try another jar with the coupon he's sending me, and then post an update.

review/text: Nestle Ovaltine Chocolate Malt, is not even close to a Chocolate Malt! Nestle shouldn't be able to advertise this as a malted drink, because, this product has absolutely no malt flavor at all, at least none I could taste.<br /><br />It does have a fairly decent Chocolate taste, (1-star) and is creamy, , (1-star), but that's where it all stops! I doubled the suggested serving amount, and no malt taste. I then tripled it, and still no distinguishable malt taste. The ingredients do list "malt" as one, so where's the Malt?? Then to top  it all off, it's rather pricey for pretty much just cheap coco powder.

review/text: Normally, I don't even look at chocolate milk flavorings for milk, but happened to be in that aisle.  Spotting my old friend Ovaltine, I was looking forward to some nostalgia.  I am a senior citizen, so that was a long time ago.  The Chocolate Malt was my guess for being closest to the original I remember.  The carb content looked pretty low at 9g even though sugar is listed first, and only 40 calories is low for a treat.  Unfortunately, I failed to see soy in the ingredient listing at the store.  I am one of those people who get a lingering metallic aftertaste from the smallest amount of any derivative of soy.  I'm so disappointed!

review/summary: The New and Improved Receipe is Awful!
review/text: My children and I immediately noticed a difference in the taste and texture of the "New and Improved" recipe.  It is awful!  Some have commented on a slight difference in flavor, but for us, it was completely different, and disgusting.  We have switched to Carnation Instant Breakfast and at times, plain old Hershey's Syrup!  We used to buy three cans each of Chocolate and Malt Ovaltine, every few weeks, but we will not buy more until the recipe is changed back to the original.  This change was so very upsetting to our family.  My kids only liked Ovaltine in their milk.<br /><br />This change was unnecessary, uncalled-for and is ruining the brand name Ovaltine after so many generations of loyalty.  This change reminds me of "New Coke!"

I do understand that not everyone cares for malt, but for my 2 cents worth - this stuff should get 6 stars.  I can't always find this locally.  Usually I can get plain chocolate Ovaltine, but not the chocolate malt.  It's also seemingly unavailable at my local discount department store (Target.)  This 6 pack is priced comparably (you know, for when I can find it) and I got free shipping.  I'm just happy that I will have enough and know where to get it when I get low.

review/summary: Mmm... One of my all time favorite chocolate bars! :-P~
review/text: For those of you not familiar, "crunchie" bars are solid honeycomb coated with a relatively thin layer of milk chocolate. Personally, I love 'em! They're one of my all time favorite chocolate bars. They're popular both in England and here in Australia where I live.<br /><br />Not much more to say except that you can buy crunchies in a variety of pack sizes (size being determined by the number of bars included), and this 6-pack is the smallest. I've also seen packs of 12 and 24, as well as bags of "treat sized" mini-bars for sale. Although prices on Amazon do fluctuate over time, as of the time of writing, this 6-pack will wind up costing you just a fraction of a cent under $1.40 a bar. Weirdly, that actually works out cheaper per bar than if you buy the 12 pack; although the 24 pack definitely offers the best value of all at just a fraction over $1.12 per bar. So if you are going to go to the trouble of buying chocolate bars over the internet, it may be worth your while buying MORE!!!<br /><br />That said, it's not like these are a health food. So please... Enjoy in moderation! ;-)<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Shipping almost doubles the price
review/text: Really looking hard for amaretto creamer for my husband who loves it, and thought getting the powder would make it last longer in the cupboard.  As it's an outside website there are no shipping discounts and when I put a case of 12 @ $35.00 in my shopping cart, I was informed the shipping was over $20.00. I cancelled my order as it's not worth it. A 3 case order cost $60.00 to ship and only gives an item price break of $2.69 per case. They need to get something set up with Amazon which gives a price break on shipping or there's going to be many more people who cancel their orders too.

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: These are sold at Lowe's in my area and are one of the few treats I will allow my three big dogs. They crumble under these powerful jaws, so I don't worry about choking with them. One of my dogs is diabetic, but these don't seem to effect her blood sugar at all. It feels great to be able to allow her some treats like the other two who aren't restricted. I like the product and the price - good value and quality both!

review/summary: cautious mom approves
review/text: My dog is a 13.5 year old two foot tall 35-pound mutt, whom I am extremely cautious with in giving bones of any type. I worry that she'll swollow too large of pieces and choke, like she did one day on a rawhide chewy stick. Luckily I was able to pull it out of the back of her throat. Since then I watch her like a hawk and only give her certain bones. These Salix Premium Beefhide bones are made in Brazil. They are 3" long by 1" wide by 1/2" deep. They are basted w/ a natural beef coating that doesn't rub off easily or rinse off with water. They are very hard yet she is able to break off pieces that seem to crumble. I can hear her teeth grind along the bone, for she has to use her jaw power to break off chunks of rawhide. My dog can chew one stick in about 5 minutes, which is not a long time but I know that those 5 minutes she is getting her teeth vigorously scraped. I give her one a day after dinner. She loves them. I wouldn't recommend them to a large dog because they are probably too small. Small dogs may find them too hard to chew. Cost at Publix grocery store for an 8 pack of bones is $1.79 a package.

review/summary: WARNING: Contains sulfites
review/text: I am extremely sensitive to MSG, sulfites, etc. - they give me terrible migraines.  Although this mix says "no msg" it DOES contain sulfites, so if a glass or two of wine gives you a headache (wine typically contains sulfites), then this pickling spice may give you migraines/headaches as well.  This is just an FYI to the folks like me who have to be careful what they eat and drink. The sulfites in this pickling blend are used a preservative, which is completely unnecessary in my opinion.  McCormick simply wishes to ensure an indefinite shelf life for this stuff at the expense of individuals' health.<br /><br />PS - I love to make pickles, jellies and preserves, etc., and to give them as gifts.  If you give gifts of pickles made from this spice, please consider warning the recipients about the sulfites.  Nothing ruins a gift like associating a friend or loved one with a gift that makes you ill!  I speak from experience.

review/text: As a vet tech with tens years experience it is my opinion that this is the worst dog food on the market. Yes, of course dogs love it, just like people love greasy, terrible-for-us fast food. In general, people should choose foods that contain only a few ingredients, and as little soy as possible, especially if your pet has any GI problems or any sort of allergies (which mostly manifest as red, itchy, gunky ears), and if so, corn, wheat, and even chicken may be a problem as well. Getting your pet on a better diet will make them happier and healthier and will reduce vet bills.

review/text: I have seen celebrity endorsements on products before - but I'm the type of person is not easily motivated to buy anything based on what I see and hear strangers tell me on the TV, the radio or the Internet.  But in this case since the Cadbury Mr. Big is on my Top Five list, I was going to buy this item anyway.  But with Alex Ovechkin on the wrapper - it's just a bonus for my Grandson!  He has not figured out that the wrapper does not change what is inside since he is only 5 years old.  I shared a small piece of the Cadbury Mr. Big with him (don't tell his mother...) - but just like Christmas, he probably liked the Special Edition wrapper the most.  Kids are like that...anyway, I just hope he does not chit-chat with his Buds since I will be the one to pay for (and pass around...) the rest of my Mr. Big candy bars.  Yikes!  Bottom Line?  Liked the product since I was much younger and hope that I can keep my teeth (in my head...) long enough to enjoy a lot more of them...

review/text: I have used Celestial Seasons teas for many years, but normally buy only the non caffeine , herbal teas.  I selected this Green Tea as so many friends were championing the heath benefits of green tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasons Authentic Green Tea is made with all natural ingredients.  Green Tea comes from the same plant as black tea but the company dries the green tea leaves  quickly to preserve the natural antioxidants.  Then the green tea is blended with Bai Mu Dan white tea (a rare and young tea) to balance flavor.  I like this blend as pure green tea must be polluted with a bit of milk to partially neutralize the tannic acid.<br /><br />I have been drinking this tea for several months, and I recommend it.

review/text: I love the taste of this tea.  It's very smooth and not bitter as another reviewer stated.  Very mellow and soothing.<br /><br />My only gripe is the packaging.  With all other tea I've purchased in 20 count boxes, the bags came individually wrapped in metallic packages. These bags are loose in the box without any wrappers.  They're all hooked together like sausage links, and as stated in the description they have no strings.  So you have to fish them out of your tea cup with a spoon.<br /><br />If they were individually wrapped and had strings, they'd be 5 star IMO.  And if you use Amazon's "suscribe and save", not only will this be cheaper, but shipping will always be free.  And you can cancel at any time.  I love this feature!

review/summary: Not authentic, should be called "Green Tea Blend"
review/text: I have tried numerous teas from Celestial Seasonings and by and large I've enjoyed them all.  Not this one.  They prominently display "GREEN TEA" on the box cover, and state "with WHITE TEA for SMOOTH TASTE".  But unless you really look, you won't notice that it also has natural lemon, and orange flavors, along with other listed flavorings, and Stevia to boot (for natural sweetness).  All this sounds yummy, right?  I don't think so.  Sure, the first few sips were like "hmm, that's not bad" but quickly the flavor of this bastardized "green tea" became annoying.  Probably not so much the flavor, but definitely the sweetness is too much for me.  But if you like sweet beverages this one is fairly tame so you'll likely find it OK in that department.<br /><br />My main problem with this is the fact that it's advertised as "Green Tea" and I believe this is misleading.  It doesn't remotely resemble authentic green tea in terms of flavor, in fact you can't even taste the green tea here because it's overpowered by the other flavors.  Real green tea is very mild in taste and doesn't need a sweetener because it's smooth and tasty without all the extra ingredients.<br /><br />Even if it wasn't for the misleading here, this mix is still not my cup of tea.  It's "OK" at best, but I wouldn't buy it again and I'm not sure I would even mix a bag or two in with my regular brand of green tea (for iced tea).<br /><br />Finally, I am NOT in the habit of writing bad reviews for products on Amazon.  I believe this is my first.  But I know green tea, green tea is a friend of mine, and this sir is no green tea.

Even from the name "antioxidant" green tea, I wouldn't normally expect such a fruit-flavored beverage. Frustrating. Having said that, I do enjoy Celestial Seasonings Authentic Green Tea as one of the most drinkable low-priced greens, and I also appreciate their eco-friendly packaging. (And, really, it was my mistake in ordering the wrong tea, however I think their packaging or description maybe could be clearer about the differences.)

review/summary: This tea is not what it seems
review/text: I enjoy Celestial Seasonings teas as an inexpensive source of pretty good tea. I drink a lot of green tea, especially Korean green tea, and so most Western green teas are a bit too heavy-handed for my taste. The problem with this tea, though, is that it is packed with orange flavoring - apparently, vitamins, too, - which is nice, if you wanted to buy orange-flavored tea. The orange flavoring completely overwhelms the necessarily subtle taste of the simple green tea. So if you want an orange (green) tea, this is the product for you. I've rated it one-star because there's nothing about the packaging that conveys the strength of the orange flavoring, which should be mentioned prominently, since it is so prominent in the taste.

review/summary: Great snack!
review/text: In wondering how to make a yummy snack even yummier, Emerald has answered the question with this product.  The seasonings enhance this already highly-esteemed nut.  The ground sea salt and pepper is generous as a topping, and the kick of pepper combined with the saltiness covers any savory hankering.<br /><br />Its size is a boon, as it makes it easier to stow in a backpack, carry-on, or a picnic basket  It's also just enough to keep handy in your pantry for last minute guests.  I am adding this to my corral of "What's easy to put out and look really put together?"<br /><br />This is a keeper.
