review/summary: Old reliable...great deals with sales and/or subscribe and save
review/text: Sometimes good products are dazzling, they are just reliable.  That's Lipton's tea.  When amazon puts this on sale and/or you can get the sale with subscribe and save, the price is less than it is at my local WalMart.  I'd pay more to NOT have to go to WalMart, so I buy cases from amazon.<br />If there were a "state drink" in Georgia, it would be tea (sweet tea for the masses, unsweet for me).<br />I use this tea and Lipton's decaf tea as the "base" for many flavored ice teas that I drink year-round.<br />I use two family bags of Lipton's tea and 4-6 flavored fruit tea bags to make one 2-quart pot of tea.  I find that using the fruit teas makes the tea sweet enough for me that I don't need to add any sweetners to get a "sweet tea" fix without adding to my waist or risk of diabetes.

review/summary: Swiss Licorice is a delicious gourmet treat
review/text: Chateau D' Lanz is a small US company located in the Pacific NW.  Their black licorice is manufactured in small batches using very high quality natural ingredients like herbal licorice & anise, rather than synthetic flavors.<br /><br />The flavor of Swiss Licorice is intense & long-lasting. Comparing it to my childhood favorite, gluten-filled black licorice pipes, I would say that while the Swiss is neither bitter nor overpowering, yet it has a flavor that is deeper and mellower than the childhood favorite.<br /><br />These candies are called "hard" but they are not hard like a brittle lifesaver.  Rather, the texture is semi-hard, allowing the candy to dissolve very slowly in the mouth -- at a much slower rate than livesavers, IME.  The long-lasting nature of the candy texture, combined with the intense flavor, makes for a unique taste experience.<br /><br />While the price of this product seems a bit high, I've found on balance that Swiss licorice is a bargain, for both the pocket-book and the diet. Two drops per day gives me about 1/2 hour of satisfying licorice-flavored snacking.<br /><br />My only complaint is, this licorice is quite addictive.  I don't miss jawing down on hard licorice ropes at all.<br /><br />If the company would come out with a cherry-flavored (think red Nibs) licorice as well, my gluten-free licorice dreams will be completely fulfilled.

review/summary: Dog Loves This Bone
review/text: Our Boxer has been chewing these high quality Jones' Slammer bones for a couple of months now and loves them.  This bone is made in the USA and we only give our dog American bones.  He would do nothing but chew on his Slammer for days if we left him.  I recommend taking bones away after a couple of hours to keep up the intensity and interest of your dog, and as with any bone or toy you should watch the dog while he has them.  This is compairable to the Sargent bone where there are different kinds of treats, ie it has jerk and bone and more.  We store the opened bone in a gallon sized bag between chews.

review/summary: Not a super food.
review/text: I was one of those people who was looking into all things raw. Imagine my delight when I found out that you could eat chocolate like a supplement by eating raw cacao nibs! Well, like all new things, it's best to wait to purchase until you have all the facts.<br /><br />Raw cacao is high in oxalic acid which inhibits absorption of calcium. As well, raw cacao contains theobromind,<br />theophylline and caffeine which all mess with your central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, cardiovascular<br />and endocrine system.<br /><br />When I ate these, I got the jitters and headaches. I thought that I would suffer through the jitters, the dirt taste and the sudden addiction to chocolate in the name of "health." It wasn't until Kevin Gianni of Renegade Health did a piece about how he no longer was going to recommend cacao because of health issues he was getting after he praised it, that I started looking into if I should consume any more cacao. I got sick of being jittery so I quit and haven't looked back.

Going to experiment with the nibs including roasting them.<br /><br />I haven't met any cacao I didn't like so these are probably fine; haven't used yet. Organic is good.

It's like eating wood chips or something.  The powder is delicious, but I am now reading article after article about the negative effects of raw cacao stemming from the theobromine, caffeine, etc.  It's a powerful stimulant, not unlike a drug.  After spending the last few months cleansing, losing 25 pounds and switching to a mostly raw food diet, I feel like I've backslid into my old addictions to chocolate and caffeine.

review/text: I have read countless articles about the health benefits of cacao nibs and was excited to purchase these. I even ripped open the bag upon receiving the product from Amazon excited to get my chocolate fix! However, after stuffing a small handful into my mouth expecting a chocolatey taste, I was surprised at the bitter almost coffee like taste (similar to the dregs at the bottom of an espresso). Bottom line, I am not a fan of the taste. I have Googled a bunch of recipes about how to consume this product besides eating it raw and the only ones that I can stomach are those involving adding either sugar or Splenda. A heads up to those out there that are expecting these nibs to taste like dark chocolate shavings because you will be sorely disappointed.

Actually, I'd say they taste "like they came from somewhere besides Ecuador..." which they did! Peru, if you didn't know -- and I think Peru's a spiffy place.

review/summary: Oxidation Musings
review/text: Raw coco powders and nibs touted to be the hyest in anti-oxidant compounds of all plants have yet to be proven beneficial. Please keep in mind a few lab experiments showing that antioxidants slow or prevent stuff physically near them from combining with, you guessed it, oxygen, dont prove anything good happens in a human body from the same chemical activity. Vitamin E slows or prevents oil it is mixed with from going rancid. This is good, but do it happen in you?<br /><br />U kno, not all "oxidation" can or should be prevented. Digestion is oxidation, and so is pickling, and cooking, and aging (wine, cheese, us, etc). Oxidation is necessary, so blanket awe for Auntie Oxidant is unfounded. You wonder if raw coco is worth the premium price--twice, thrice, or quad what regular (roasted) organic Fair Trade coco products cost. It is definitely worth it if you can rev up your proneness  to enjoy the "placebo effect".  I dont say that cynically. A benefit is a benefit.<br /><br />THis product is milder than regular roasted coco nibs, but the mouthfeel is different than chocolit or roasted nibs--very fibrous. It isnt, however, celery, and breaks down in the mouth without much brux. My feeling at the moment is, go back to eating regular roasted coco products--nibs and powder, and take resveratrol or grape seed extract capsules to make up the diff in (presumedly) lost antioxis. Five stars, not for what the product is--but for what I hope it is.

review/summary: This Cacao is NOT RAW!!!
review/text: Raw Cacao has a high Vitamin C content. This product has O% if you look at the label on the back.<br />Within the last year they covered up where it used to say Vitamin C with Vitality. If you look closely on some of the older packages, you can pull the Vitality sticker off that is covering up the vitamin C label. Which means that it has been cooked/processed in some way that removed that natural occurring Vitamin C.<br />I only use the highest quality cacao, from reputable sources. Less quality, Other "raw" cacao beans on the market are not only of cheap forastero cacao varieties, they also are contaminated with several types of dangerous bacteria (remember cacao is a tropical crop where microbe contamination is more difficult to control).<br />Remember you get what you pay for. Quality usually comes with a price. So check your facts before going cheap.

review/summary: Awesome quality cacao nibs - powerful and satisfying.
review/text: I'm a certified chocoholic with a weight problem. I had heard that cacao nibs had all the health benefits of dark chocolate (way more, actually) without the sugar and junk food aspects. They are loaded with antioxidants and have those powerful endorphin releasing stimulants. They are also quite high in fiber (but also in saturated fats).<br /><br />I got my big pile of Navitas Naturals nibs and dug right in. Well - these are a bit of an acquired taste; but once acquired, they really satisfy. Cacao nibs are broken pieces of raw whole cacao beans that have been fermented and dried (and that's it). They are brown, with a dark cocoa smell, and a seductive texture that's partly like a coffee bean (crunchy and hard), and partly like a piece of chocolate (buttery with a crisp and then melting fat). The flavor initially gives you a cocoa hit and then a winey fermented flavor that is hard to describe. The aftertaste is bitter like baking chocolate. Like a coffee bean, there's some fibrous grit with the aftertaste after the creamy fats have dissolved on your tongue. My first impressions was "phew - that's disgusting". The winey flavor was off-putting and the bitterness in the aftertaste was hard to take. That didn't prevent me from immediately having more, however - as the crisp rich creamy quality made me want more. After a few pinches (maybe 3/4s of a tablespoon) I was flying! I mean, these things are POTENT. They really are loaded with all those endorphin releasing stimulants - and man they wake you up and then make you feel loved. Over the next few days I kept a big baggie of these in my pack and ate them whenever I wanted a cup of coffee. The stimulant effect is totally as strong as coffee - and more. To go with the speed, there's a feeling of well being and intellectual stimulation that's seductive in the extreme. I began to almost enjoy the odd powerful flavor. My only concerns at this point are whether these are addictive! About 1/2 way through my bag I have yet to hit a stem or a stone or an inedible piece (unlike what I've heard with some other brands). The flavor and texture is pretty consistent as I work my way through too - pretty good for a totally raw organic product.<br /><br />I found that I could grind them up into powder in the blender and use the powder to "cocoa" up various foods (especially ones bearing some sweetness). For example, after my workout I'd put a tablespoon of nibs and a tablespoon of chia seeds in the blender and grind nice and fine and then toss in a fist full of frozen blueberries, a glug of Walden Farms zero calorie chocolate sauce, 8 oz water and two scoops of whey protein powder (chocolate flavor, of course) and then blend. It all whips up into a rich chocolatey blueberry shake that packs the nutritional wallop of a steak dinner with omega 3 oils, TONS of antioxidants, and a wicked emotional and blood sugar pick-me-up. You can buy the powder pre-ground, but I imagine the goodies keep better in this coarsely cracked version.<br /><br />All in all - I think of cacao nibs as much as a drug like coffee as I do a food. People who eat ultra-dark chocolate for the health aspects should absolutely check nibs out because my body tells me they have WAY MORE of the chemical goodies of chocolate with far less sugar and fat. They also are brimming with a rich raw cocoa flavor that's weird and wonderful and hard to describe. If you are bent in this way - this stuff is wonderful.

review/summary: The Truth About Vitamin C In Raw Cacao
review/text: Hello Raw Cacao Lovers!<br /><br />Here is the real truth about vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content in Raw Cacao:<br /><br />Despite the trafficked reports circulating the internet, the honest truth remains: even when processed at low temperatures (i.e. "raw"), there is no vitamin C (ascorbic acid) present in cacao.<br /><br />Recently, highly trafficked websites such as [...] and [...] have highlighted the misinformation of cacao's supposed vitamin C content. Included in these reports are claims that raw cacao is "extraordinarily high in vitamin C."<br /><br />Back in 2004, our Navitas Naturals lab tests directly looked for vitamin C content in raw cacao, but came up negative. Despite these results, the current media blitz brought us back again for another round of lab testing of our best-selling raw cacao products (beans, nibs and powder) for vitamin C. This time, we used two different laboratories instead of one, and utilized three different analytical methods: High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Capilary Electrophoresis (CE) with UV detection, and Titration.<br /><br />Though all three methods have their place in the scientific community, Titration is the most commonly used method in the food industry when determining vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content. However, there is a critical detail within the Titration method many companies miss when testing raw cacao. The method of Titration is unable to differentiate the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) from the vitamin's analogs. The result is what is known as a "false positive."<br /><br />This is why, at Navitas Naturals, we use HPLC when testing raw cacao's vitamin C content. The HPLC method looks directly for vitamin C (ascorbic acid), and not just the analogs. Additionally, after sending samples of our products to another lab to test using the CE method, the reports returned consistent the HPLC results.<br /><br />We have now also tested one of the largest raw cacao brands in the United States using the Titration and HPLC methods. And yet again the results confirm our previous conclusion that raw cacao has no vitamin C (ascorbic acid) present.<br /><br />Cacao is a tremendously beneficial superfood, containing a wide spectrum of minerals and phytonutrients. It is important to be clear however, Vitamin C is not amongst these nutrients.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Zach Adelman, President<br />Navitas Naturals

review/summary: What to do with two pounds of nibs...
review/text: This is an awesome deal, but don't purchase these thinking you'll just snack on them because they're so healthy for you...you should make sure you like cacao nibs first. The flavor is intense and something of an acquired taste.<br /><br />I purchased these to use with the cookbook "Bitter Sweet" by Alice Medrich, which contains a chapter of recipes for cacao nibs and the author talks about ways she tried to use nibs that were a big failure and why...how they are good in cookies,  but awful in cream caramel. It even includes some savory recipes, green beans, eggplant, mushroom ragout, pasta sauce. Definitely worth a look if you've got two pounds of these things and don't know what to do with them.<br /><br />I should note for raw foodies: all those recipes are for cooked foods except one for a salad that is just baby greens, olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper and cacao nibs, with a suggestion to optionally add a few more items like dried currants, shaved fennel or nicoise olives and/or goat cheese.

review/text: I love chocolate, but not the added fat and sugar, so I couldn't wait to try these. They lived up to my expectations. Delicious. When I get the urge to eat a candy bar - I roll a banana into these cacao nibs for a delicious and healthy treat. For a yummy cocoa substitute in cookies and cakes - I put them in the coffee grinder until powdered. Or just a split second in the coffee grinder makes tiny "chocolate" chips for our smoothies. This is the best chocolate product I've found so far.

review/summary: Where has this been all my life!
review/text: I have no negative comments about this product. It far exceeded my expectations and there is no better price either at any other site. I became interested in the Cacao nibs after reading the rave reviews and the health benefits( full of minerals and antioxidants) of the raw, organic bean at various raw food lifestyle sites. Although I am not 100% raw, I am trying to exchange as many foods as I can. These nibs are crunchy--but not rock hard crunchy. Do not look to compare this to processed, cooked chocolate that is full of sugar. These nibs are not "candy" but a healthy food. Dipped in a little agave syrup( a honeylike , low glycemic index, organic sweetener that is delicious) or honey, one would have a candy like snack. Since they are not a processed food full of sugar, they are more bitter than chocolate  but they are not by any means too terribly bitter to enjoy. I thought they were wonderful with a small amount of agave syrup. I will use them in cereal and smoothies next. More people will for sure enjoy these than not.

review/summary: Thought they were bad at first
review/text: 85% was the darkest chocolate I could find until Lindt's new 90% (I think they need to fine-tune it with a version 2.0. It seems a bit rich/gummy) Ghiradelli's 100% bar for baking is smooth, and I can eat, but man, how happy would many of us be with a 95% Dove bar!<br /><br />Enter Cocoa nibs: Why not "eliminate the middle man" and go straight to the source - the cocoa beans themselves? Get the cocoa taste I love so much, but without the processing, added fat, etc. Plus, hey, no processing leaves more of the antioxidents & nutrients.<br /><br />Day of arrival and I'm excited. I opened them immediately and saw a bunch of nuggets that looked just like chocolate. So, I stuck my nose in the bag, and it wiped the smile right off my face. It smelled sort of musty, and of vinegar. Like bad wine. Eating them proved no better. So, I put them down and tried them later. Again the next day, and so on.<br /><br />Disappointed is an understatement to say the least. I've got 2 lbs of this stuff and I'm not one to waste food. Did I mention that I'm out $28? What the heck happened? I read that if beans weren't fermented long enough, they could smell like this. I've not compared to other nibs, but thought maybe this is the case. I was looking for that familiar cocoa smell & flavor, yet wasn't finding it. And how strange that there are so few written references to actual flavor and smell!<br /><br />All ends well. I realized that these are raw (yes, I know, "duh" you say). But, I didn't truly make the connection. Cocoa beans need to be roasted. They WANT to be roasted. And I believe they'll thumb their nose at any purist snob that discredits roasting solely for any "loss of nutritional benefits" (and so will I, so save your comments).<br /><br />Conclusion: If you haven't yet done so, get crazy and live on the wild side! Place a thin layer on a cookie sheet, then in the oven. I've done two roasts: 350* at 18 minutes and 275* at 15 minutes. I prefer the latter, but experimenting is half the fun. Oh yeah, don't forget to peek inside around the 8 minute mark...smells sort of like warm brownies! Got to go, I've made myself hungry!

review/text: I have enjoyed the intense flavor, versatility, and healthful benefits of cocoa nibs for many years.  These nibs from Navitas are of consistently high quality and I recommend them to anyone who is looking for nibs. Nibs may be used to make chocolate.  I use them for a wide range of culinary purposes including: crunchy addition to yogurt, berries, desserts, ground with coffee beans for coffee.  I sometimes incorporate them into sauces if I'm not feeling lazy.  I like to cook but I tend to stick to simple things without sauces.  Unless you grind these things, only eat them if you are certain of the strength of your teeth as they are hard.  The flavor and aroma are mindful of chocolate, but unlike chocolate there is no sugar and they have a bitter finish.  I like it but your experience may vary.

review/summary: A Well Kept Secret Snack!
review/text: These organic Cacao Nibs are my secret weapon against night eating and stress nibbling. It turns out that Cacao (aka chocolate in its original organic form)is GOOD for you. It's one of the best antioxidants God made naturally for us to enjoy! I put these Nibs in a mini-bowl by the TV and when there is a desire to nibble or snack, I nibble on these. I am satisfied and its healthy at the same time. I believe that this little action step of nibbling on Nibs brought about the loss of the last few difficult pounds to lose. Nibs are also great to use in cooking as a substitute for chocolate morsels in just about any recipe. I am really hooked on these. I can't live well without them!

review/summary: really like this product
review/text: When I first tried this product, I was not impressed.  The bitter flavor seemed overwhelming but I kept nibbling away as I had two pounds of bean fragments lying around.  After three days of nibbling, I was hooked.  Here is what I love about this product:<br /><br />1) Energy:  Around 2pm, I am ready for a nap.  I eat a half tablespoon of these beans and I am ready to conquer the last two hours of work.  These beans provide amazing energy.<br /><br />2) Two ounces replace numerous candy bars: My workplace has too may candy bowls and casual snacking is easy.  I fill a little container with two ounces of nibs and slowly eat them throughout the day. The taste and nature of the nibs is conducive to careful, slow eating.  Now, instead of popping 10 snickers, I just fill my palm with nibs and I am completely content.<br /><br />3) Replaces sweet cravings:  As noted above, I am no longer eating excessive, sugary sweets at work and I don't miss the super sweet chocolate from the candy bowl.  I don't feel deprived and the calorie savings are significant.<br /><br />4)The recipe possibilities are endless: If the nibs alone do not provide you with enough kick, grind some nibs and blend with your coffee for a delightful chocolate coffee. For tea, I've done something similar by mixing ground nibs with loose tea and then steeping in water to create a phenomenally rich tea. I've purchased bulk granola and sprinkled nibs and almonds in to create a nice snack mix.  To create flavorful smoothies, I've also blended these with banana and So Delicious Coconut Milk or Chocolate Silk Soy Milk.  There are numerous possibilities with this product so be creative!<br /><br />As a side note, for those that are worried about the bitterness of this product, the company makes a sweetened version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PA8VNG">Navitas Naturals Cacao Nibs Sweetened, 8-Ounce</a> that is addictive, and admittedly, not as easy to eat in moderation.

review/text: I think I've died and gone to heaven.  I have health concerns that keep me from being able to eat sugar/artificial sweetners/caffeine/gluten/some nuts and have had to give up a lot of my previous snacking favorites....hah....all of them, including my most favorite, chocolate.  This product, though, being naturally sugar-free and extremely low in caffeine, satisfies my urge for chocolate but doesn't create a feeding frenzy of wanting a lot at a time (no blood sugar surge).  It's quite bitter in a very pleasant way (I'd never liked really dark chocolate before because it wasn't sweet enough), and, I think, delicious right out of the bag (in a crunchy, at-first-weird way).

review/text: This is a very high quality product, which can be used in many things, from smoothies, to Raw desserts, or even as a very nutritious satisfying snack. I noticed that people had noted the horrible taste, etc... You have to be prepared for the fact that real Cacao is not sweetened, and can be rather bitter. However, if you want to get the full benefit from Cacao then this is the best form to get it in. As processed Cacao, loses much of its nutritional benefits. I would suggest mixing the Cacao nibs with a natural sweetener such as Raw Agave, to make more palatable, etc... Although, I think they are very good by themselves. To your health, and well being. Enjoy!

review/summary: The new wine.....??? Sure smells like it..
review/text: I believe I read someone referring to Cacao nibs as 'The New Wine'.<br /><br />WELL... I'D HAVE TO AGREE!<br /><br />The problem is....I don't like wine!<br /><br />These cacao nibs oddly smell and taste like red wine to me.<br /><br />The taste is very pungent and in your face. I definitely wouldn't refer to it as pleasing.<br /><br />I usually am able to stomach through nasty tasting, health benificial foods that I buy, but this one is proving to be quite a challenge.<br /><br />I bought this because I already owned the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0Y2">Navitas Naturals Cacao Powder, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 2)</a> and I really like the taste of it. Especially when added to my oatmeal.<br /><br />These cacao nibs do not taste anything like the powder in my opinion. I even added it to my oatmeal just to be fair.<br /><br />I now own 2 bags of these nibs, and being they are expensive, you best believe I will be eating them! But as I said, the taste is hard to stomach, especially when eating alone.<br /><br />I usually add it to a handful of nuts and raisins and the taste is dulled which isn't so bad.<br /><br />I do notice a small spike in energy after eating these, but if I had to choose between the horrible taste of these Cacao nibs and the horrid taste of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O7T87C">DoMatcha DoMatcha Organic 2nd Harvest Matcha, 2.82-Ounce</a> for an energy boost, I think I'd have to go with the Matcha.<br /><br />It does a much better job at giving you that extra kick of energy because of the caffeine.<br /><br />As far as antioxidants go, there are plenty of other Nativa blends such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CGX3ZK">Navitas Naturals Acai Powder, 8-Ounce Pouches</a> if that's what your looking for.<br /><br />I would not recommend this to snack on per say, and if I had to choose between the nibs and the powdered form, I'd go for the powder.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />****UPDATE 09/01/12<br /><br />So I finally found another way to get these things down and its working out pretty well. I've actually been throwing a few in my oatmeal along with a million other things (besides sugar of course  =)<br /><br />By the time I dont mixing everything in, the taste of the cacao is masked and it actually add a bit of crunch to the oatmeal which is kinda nice.<br /><br />I recommend you try it if your having trouble getting these down.

I also have this brand of cacao nibs in my kitchen, and honestly, these are just as good as my beans from the dominican republic.  There size also makes them more convenient than the large beans.

review/summary: I am addicted!
review/text: I am following a low carb diet where my sugar intake is substantially restricted... and thus I cant even stand the taste of milk chocolate or most 70% dark chocolates anymore because they are far too sweet for me now. But these nibs do the trick for my chocolate cravings! Delicious and irresistible! I will definitely be buying more when my bag goes empty (which will happen soon at the rate I am munching on these!)

review/summary: YUM!  control your own cocoa or mocha coffee sweetness
review/text: These are so great.  They are admittedly an acquired taste for a quick munch, but then addictive.  I use them when making cocoa or in coffee.  They don't dissolve, but flavor the drink nicely.  You can put in way less than a teaspoon of regular cocoa mix to fool your nose, and you have a great drink!!  Then you get to munch the softened nibs at the bottom, which are even better than out of the bag.<br /><br />I was so pleased, when I finally finished a bag (took a long time, even using every day) and found a number 4 recycle icon on the back of the package (not on the bottom, where I thought to look).  So many natural items are packed in non-recyclable containers.  Nice that this one did it right.

review/summary: If I had known...
review/text: Let me first say that this is the 1st time I have ordered raw cocoa in any form.  However, had I known that I would not be able to make it into a very fine powder for smooth cramy recipes, I would have ordered the powder instead.  The taste is really rich and great, but if you need to use it in recipes you want very silky and smooth...don't order this use this. Use the powder instead.  I will say the bags are huge, the price is AWESOME you will not find it cheaper ANYWHERE.

review/text: The Navitas Naturals cacao nibs were a new purchase for me.  Took a little getting used to.  My husband doesn't care for them.  I love the fact that they are so good for you and so I kept trying them and found that my favorite way to enjoy these is to combine them with a few blueberries ( another super food!) and have them for an afternoon snack.  Extra energy boost  and really taste good together!

review/summary: Great addition to my health shakes
review/text: First off - for all the yahoos that are wagging their finger at us "next best thing, gimmick, followers" I'd like to tell you to take a hike.  A lot of reviewers seem to think that just because Cacao is taking off that it means its benefits are not worthy of a crazed following and accusing many of just following the trend and not doing the research.  I say, take your comments over to the McDonalds blog and yell at those people who blindly follow a craze without researching it's health impact.  Not those that are health conscious.  What is even more insulting is that you assume that anyone who gives these a 5 star rating isn't doing their research.  Being a condescending cynic about something like Cacao nibs does not make you appear smarter or better informed in the health community.<br /><br />The Cacao nibs provide an excellent addition to my morning green shakes.  They add some crunch, the bitter taste is non existent thanks to the shakes other ingredients and these things are loaded with fiber so I can make sure to hit my goal of 35g of fiber a day.  1TBS is a serving and I usually get two serving in a day. I do not get that jittery feeling that some people have claimed and I listen to my body that way I can make sure that anything new I'm putting in it I can review naturally.  I think this is a product worth looking into if you want a good source of fiber in a small amount.

review/summary: Chocolate cardboard
review/text: Bought for health aspects after reading a food article in a tennis magazine.  My blood pressure has been easing slowly up (I'm 50) so I am trying to be proactive in a natural way. Since health aspects are my main criteria, I'm not sure how many stars to give it, as I did not take a before/after test of my cholesterol level, and it is too soon to be aware of blood pressure changes.<br /><br />I love dark chocolate, so I figured this would be a good way to do it.<br /><br />Well, there is a vague chocolate flavor, but mostly it tastes like cardboard.  Good texture though.  It is certainly eatable straight up, if not particularly tasty.  I either take a heaping spoonful straight, or put a small square of dark chocolate on the spoon with the nibs.<br /><br />Since my main reason is health, not taste, I assume this is doing its dark chocolate magic and I can manage the so-so flavor.<br /><br />So-so taste, but all the benefits of dark chocolate without the added junk that makes candy taste good  (unless you do as I do and add a smidge of processed 70%+ dark chocolate bar for flavor.<br /><br />A bit of an energy boost too, though that might be a placebo effect.

review/summary: STRONG!!! Enough
review/text: i'm new to the raw chocolate deal. I must say it's a aquired taste that will take a while to get use to. But, I will continue to because my research lead me to believe this is the best approach to getting the best benefits from chocolate. I do feel the energy surge but I would have to say that if you are not use to consuming raw chocolate than start out slow and I would only consume maybe 10 grams the first few days or week. The gradually every 4 or 5 days add another 5grams. The serving size is 28grams but all I have read up on says 14 grams a day is plenty. I will wait a see the long term affects. good deal here at Amazon and I recieved the item in 2 days.

review/summary: Quality is variable
review/text: The flavor is great if you like nibs (and I do) but the quality of the nibs varies greatly from bag to bag.<br /><br />One bag will be full of good-sized chunks of bean with only the occasional bit of hull.  The next will be full of tiny bits with innumerable pieces of residual hull and a ton of twigs - which are hard as ROCKS.  Plus, who wants to eat twig?<br /><br />If you open a bag and find a lot of very small pieces, go carefully, because you'll probably be chewing a lot of twig and pulling a lot of hull bits off your nibs.  Better quality control would be nice.

review/summary: Sneak them in!
review/text: These things are great! The other reviews are pretty much right on when they say that the taste can be bitter and(depending on the person) disgusting if you shovel too many in your mouth at once. They aren't chocolate, so it's kind of hard to know what to expect, but they make a great topping on foods/snacks that you already eat!<br /><br />I've found that my favorite so far is to sprinkle them on ice cream, but I also eat them in my cereal and yogurt/pudding.<br /><br />The taste actually complements these things very well. It says right on the back you can use them in cookies. I might try that next.<br /><br />Oh and did I mention they're a super food and have things like iron, magnesium, and antioxidants in them?<br /><br />You can't lose :)

review/text: Keep in mind - NOT sweet, NOT like regular chocolate. If you've got your head wrapped around that and are still interested, then chances are good you'll enjoy this product.<br /><br />The flavor is good, but the extreme not-sweetness factor makes them a pass for straight munching. I enjoy these nibs blended into smoothies and had some this morning in a bowl of steel cut oats (the sweetness of the fruit and agave syrup really brought out the flavor! Gud!) Also heard that the flavor combines well with maca, so I'll be trying that out in the future.<br /><br />Like all the Navitas products that are fulfilled through Amazon the shipping was quick, packaging was sturdy and the product is good quality.

review/summary: Bitter, but what else did I expect
review/text: The Navitas chocolate nibs (from Peru) are more bitter than the nibs I previously bought from a grower in Maui, so I was surprised by the flavor. The nibs are clean and in great condition and the price is excellent. The bitterness can be lessened by roasting. The intense, almost smoky flavor, reminded me of the superb chocolates I ate while in Peru. Peruvian chocolate is not for wimps but it is quickly addicting.

Other than that it's a great product to snack on when in need of a little boost!

review/summary: Chocolate in the Raw
review/text: Navitas Natural Raw Cacao Nibs are EXCELLENT. On their own,they're not snacks like chocolate chips. They're kicky due to cocoa liquor. They're way too potent. However,they are delicious mixed in with nut butters,yogurt,cereal,etc. They need to be paired WITH SOMETHING. They're like unsweetened cocoa. I've used these raw cacao nibs in halvah from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0825305845">Vegan Fusion World Cuisine: Healing Recipes and Timeless Wisdom from our Hearts to Yours</a> They're superior to the melted chocolate chips called for in the recipe.<br /><br />Chocolate is best enjoyed in the raw! Marin County-based Navitas Naturals calls these cacao nibs "Mayan Superfood." In that case,they're best enjoyed with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S3E770">Emergence 2012</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585425923">2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl</a> Good chocolate is timeless... the Mayans understood,as did the Aztecs.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1905087691">Aztec and Mayan Myths (Graphic Myths)</a> Enjoy it at Tenochitlan and Chichen Itza...

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I had been snacking on unsweetened bakers chocolate for years - I melt the squares in an aluminum pan (the kind they call disposable but I reuse them many times) and then tip the pan so the melted chocolate spreads out, then I put it in the 'fridge to harden and because the pan is flexible I can pop it out, then break it up into bite sized shards.  Anyway that story about how many roach parts are in cacao when it goes to be processed resurfaced so I thought I'd try these nibs for snacking instead.  They're okay but nothing compared to the unsweetened bakers chocolate.  Much more mild and they have a sort of rotted taste, not bad but probably from the fermenting process.  They aren't hard like roasted coffee beans so if you're worried about breaking a tooth, don't.  They have a kind of waxy texture.  I like them best mixed with roasted salted peanuts and raisins.  Eating them alone is okay too, but not as good as when they are combined with other things.  For trail mix they would be excellent.

review/text: This cacao is divine.  I have been using these nibs to make my own granola, and they are simply awesome.  Never before have I been able to eat chocolate for breakfast without having to feel guilty about it!  The type of energy these give me is quite euphoric -- not dissimilar to coffee but without the jitter, anxious feeling or afternoon crash I usually get with caffeine.  I would recommend these with agave nectar if you prefer them sweetened.

review/text: This IS chocolate -- I mean, when you read about the beneficial effects of dark chocolate, they surely don't mean the sugar, low-quality added fat, and artificial ingredients.<br /><br />Cacao is the raw stuff, and a one ounce serving contains 140 calories -- and believe me, an ounce of this stuff is a lot.<br /><br />Does it taste like wood chips as mentioned by one of the other reviewers?  Well, perhaps it might seem like that to you if your palate is trained only for highly refined foods, but, otherwise, they are quite yummy.<br /><br />I like to make a trail mix with nibs and goji berries.  My husband puts them in smoothies.  Today, as a special treat for Passover, I made raw chocolate candy with ground nibs.

review/text: Like everyone else, I like chocolate. Having said that, I use either cacao nibs or cacao beans more than 90% of the time. The reason is, I get the benefit of cacao without all the other ingredients that might be in a chocolate bar. By no means, I am insinuating that chocolate bars or truffles are not healthy or delicious. they absolutely, are and I have had my fair share of them. If you, however, want to enjoy the cacao nibs, try this product and there is a chance that you might want to make this food as something that you would want to enjoy daily for many years to come.

I use some every day in my tea and even got to like eatig them right out of the package.  I liked reviewing the other comments as I am looking for ideas for other uses of these great nibs!

review/summary: Chocolate lovers: do not be deceived by this product
review/text: I decided to try these as a substitute for my insatiable love of Chocolate. The reviews (and description) led me to believe that these cacao nibs are edible on their own, and a reasonably tasty alternative to what I know and love to be dark chocolate (70%+ cocoa). Alas, were that the case.<br /><br />Cacao nibs are best used as a cooking ingredient, not as a raw snack. They are edible (but not enjoyable) if you mix them into cereal/oatmeal/something else, but they are pretty much inedible eaten alone. I knew they would taste nothing like Chocolate, but I was hoping they would at least be enjoyable in their own way - turns out, they are not.<br /><br />In a nutshell, they are alternately bitter and bland, and the "chocolate" taste, to the extent it even exists, is indiscernible. Do not buy these if you love Chocolate and are seeking an alternative - buy them only if you have tried them and know what you are getting into.

review/summary: a great product and deal
review/text: I looked at all of the reviews and shopped around locally before buying these.  Locally the best deal I could find was $6 for 1 oz!!!!! I use them on my cereal, yogurt, granola and even in baking. They are yummy and very good for you. I shared one bag with my two health conscious kids and put the other bag in the freezer so I can dip into as needed.  You will not regret buying these.  I tried roasting some but prefer the nibs in their natural state.  I plan to grind some up and try in place of cocoa powder in recipes.

review/summary: Not my original intention...
review/text: I love chocolate. I LOVE chocolate. I've struggled with my weight all my life, and recently discovered my blood pressure is higher than it should be. After reading a couple of books about HBP, both which suggested dark chocolate could help lower BP, I thought I'd give these nibs a try.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the chocolate smell was overwhelming - in a very good way. I tried a couple nibs and YUCK, too hard, too bitter. I don't know how people can snack on these plain. Then I thought I'd add them to my oatmeal. Good idea - they softened up in the liquid, and the fruit in the oatmeal adds needed sweetness for me. I'm hooked, and I'm in for more of these.<br /><br />My BP is lower, I am losing weight and taking some additional supplements. Do these help? I don't know, but they don't hurt.<br /><br />My original purpose for buying these nibs was to add them to a batch of home brewed beer. I haven't made that beer yet, but am glad I found another use for these.

review/summary: Acquired a taste, now I love these
review/text: The first time I tasted Cacao Nibs I thought they were very strange. But, after seeing on Doctor Oz that these are healthy and may help boost metabolism, I tried them again.  Now, I look forward to my 2 tablespoons a day.  I should mention that I am basically a chocolate lover, but when I tried these the second time around I had given up my daily dose of dark chocolate.  Perhaps that was what helped me get over the fact that these have no sugar--I was no longer used to eating the sweet chocolate, so this no longer seemed bitter to me.<br />  I now use these in baking, as well.  I put the wet ingredients of a recipe into a blender with one or two tablespoons of the nibs and process the ingredients until the nibs are grounded down and no longer chunky, and people are amazed at the way my chocolate cakes taste!

review/summary: great product
review/text: I bought this product to add to my Isopure shakes for weight loss.<br /> I wanted to lose weight but also improve my overall health which<br />meant antioxidants. Cocoa Nibs have more antioxidents than any other<br />food.  I don't care they are not sweet. I like them the way they are.<br />I will keep using them.  My friend mixes them in homemade granola.

review/text: I purchased this product thinking it would give me that "kick" a cup of coffee would during the day.  But have not figured out yet how much of it I need for that.  I still need my coffee for that extra "pick me up".  I do like the taste.

review/summary: It is what it is and nothing else..
review/text: It is a bitter health food mainly because it is not sugar laden. So, if you can't eat it<br />raw and unsweetened, and you want the health benefits, find a way to love it- like what<br />unconditional love is all about. Today I picked up some orange yogurt, let it get a little<br />soft- the way I like it- and stirred in about a T per serving and I loved it and so did the wife. She loves to make homemade bread and she says she will experiment with that. The<br />product website has great ideas and so do the various health food websites, as well as Amazon feedback. Don't throw it away, work with it and I don't think you will be unhappy.

review/summary: Not as good as they sound
review/text: This product, recommended by Dr. Oz, is practically inedible. That is how gross the aftertaste of these cocao nibs. They don't even taste remotely like chocolate, they taste very "chemically".

review/summary: Competitive pricing, fast delivery, quality product
review/text: Compared to the same type product from Whole Foods these were half the price and just as good. Product was delivered within a few days of ordering. 4 rather than 5 stars because they were not better tasting than their more expensive counterparts. Had they tasted better they would have earned 5 stars.

review/summary: Delicious Chocolate Taste - Price Rose Quickly
review/text: Like the taste:<br />Have bought these before and liked them sprinkled over fruit in the morning...this batch tasted more like dark chocolate, not as bitter as some cacao nibs.<br /><br />Disappointed in such a price jump over a short period of time:<br />I was however a little disappointed that the price increased as much as it did in a short period of time...might look for a less expensive source. Also was not available as well as the powdered cacao for quite awhile, especially around the holiday season when I would have bought some for gifts.
