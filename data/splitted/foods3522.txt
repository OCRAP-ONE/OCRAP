review/summary: custard
review/text: I really enjoy custard but do not like making from scratch and baking. "Jell-o Custard" is simple and easy to use. For some reason the stores in my region do not carry it any more.Decided to check the net one day and found it. Now I can have custard whenever. Good for snacking, when you have been ill and things just dont sound or taste good.Better then Chicken soup as far as I'm concerned.Also nutritious.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I used to be able to buy this in the grocery store, but I haven't seen it in ages, so I was tickled to find it at Amazon.  The case of 24 packets that I received had a "Use By" date some two years away, so I have plenty of time to enjoy my custard.<br /><br />There are two ways I like to make it. (1) Add an egg yolk to the milk/mix, and bring to boil.  Pour into a baked pastry dish.  After it cools, top with Rediwhip cream and shredded coconut, then slice for a custard cream pie. (2) Slice bananas into a serving bowl and cover with the boiled custard mix.  Sprinkle with nutmeg and place in fridge to cool.<br /><br />Overall rating: Yummy!

review/summary: New Box, New Name, Same Americana Egg Custard
review/text: A few years ago this product disappeared from the store shelves.  I thought maybe it had been downgraded to a seasonal item, but year after year, and with every trip to every grocery store I shopped in, I had finally all but given up hope of ever finding it again.  Searching the net as a last resort, I just found it here on Amazon.  My trust level was low at first, after all, how could it be the same if it didn't come in a brown box?  But I took a chance based on other reviews and bought the case.  Sure enough, it's The One.  I ate the first box before it even set.  (don't tell on me!)  I'd give it 10 stars, but Amazon only gives us 5.

review/summary: If your allergic to egg yolk, this is fantastic!
review/text: I am allergic to egg yolks, but LOVE custard, so I either never get to have it or sneak a bite and suffer a horrible tummy ache.  LAME!  But since Jello Custard uses flavoring and not actual eggs, I can enjoy it again.  I used to make wonderful trifles before diagnosed with my allergy, and they are now back on the menu again.<br /><br />To keep it from giving me a sugar crash, I mix in flavorless protein powder (it is amazing and sold on amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MAK59O">100% Pure Whey Protein Isolate (Natural) Unflavored (Mega Pack) 10 lbs</a> ) in the milk and it truly stays out of the way of the wonderful custard flavor and doesn't make me feel rotten afterwards.  In fact, I find it actually leaves me full and satisfied and not wanting seconds!  I have been making sure to ALWAYS have carbs and protein together, even in my occasional desserts, and I have lost 14 pounds in 10 weeks with that single change.<br /><br />Sorry to get off topic, it is just exciting to be able to have my custard and eat it too :)

review/text: So happy to get my favorite pudding, don't know why they don't still sell in the store. They brought out a bunch of new flavors, that have already gone away. They need to bring back this one. It is in a different box than it was in the store, but yes it is the same (yummy). Buying a case seemed a hard way to get a box of pudding, but when you have been craving something for a long time, well you just got to do it. I Just put the extra case and all in the freezer and bring out a box a little ahead of cooking it. Haven't had any problems.

I hesitated at ordering, as one has to buy a rather large quantity . . . such a foolish hesitation.  Everyone who has it wants to know where they can get it . . . the answer . . . a few boxes from my "stash" go home with them.  Yes, it does take a bit of time to prepare in today's "everything is micro-waveable and ready in 60 seconds" world, but the results are so worth it.

First delivery attempt I was home all day long waiting....seems the driver tried to deliver my package to the FUNERAL HOME down the street on a Saturday.  So being a Monday holiday I had to wait till Tuesday for my package. Finally arrived on my front porch Tuesday morning.Wish Amazon would get rid of ENSENDA for their deliveries or I will have to think twice before I order again from Amazon.  My house is clearly marked easy to find.....UPS, FedEX and the USPS have NO problem finding my house...just across the street from the Funeral Home I guess ENSENDA only hires MORONS as their drivers.

review/summary: Made a big difference for our dog
review/text: Our dog, an 11 year old lab mix, has struggled with arthritis and issues in his hips.  Our vet suggested a product like this and we have tried several favors now of the Happy Hips brand.<br /><br />I can certainly say he loves these -- as another reviewer mentioned, they're now an expected part of the morning routine and the look of betrayal should we run out ... Well, we don't run out often.<br /><br />The change in his mobility was gradual, but noticeable, it was more noticeable after we stopped giving him the strips for about two weeks after our first batch ran out.  Suddenly, he was struggling to get up the stairs again, and the sudden decline was shocking.  We checked with our vet who said this was a common reaction to,supplements like these, after a day or two of the strips again he was back to a normal, active, happy dog.<br /><br />We've used these for about 3 years now and never noticed any issues with quality or strange smells.  Our dog reports he likes the lamb and chicken, but the duck is by far his favorite.

review/summary: Great for Dogs with Arthritis
review/text: After discovering that our dog had arthritis in two legs and spinal disc degeneration, we took her to a veterinary specialist who closely examined our dog's food for irritants and inflammation triggers. These treats were one of the few things the vet did not disapprove of.<br /><br />Apparently chicken causes a number of physical and behavioral problems in canines, but duck is okay. What's even better about Happy Hips is that they contain glucosamine, which is beneficial to animals' joints. However, the amount of it is minimal so if your dog has arthritic issues, you should invest in some sort of glucosamine supplement to mix in your dog's food.

review/summary: My Dogs FAVORITE Treats - stinks that it's sourced from China!
review/text: Far and away these are my dogs favorite treats - and I've always liked the fact that it's really just pure jerky with a few added beneficial ingredients. She really loves the "Duck" Happy Hips the most for whatever reason, but she also likes the Chicken Vitality Treats and sometimes the Chicken Happy Hips.<br /><br /> She started eating these intially (when I first brought her home) because my local Safeway used to sell them at a decent price buy one, get one free. I would stockpile like crazy whenever they went on sale and as she got pickier and pickier as she got healthier these remained one of the few treats she would eat.<br /><br />Unfortunately I know that "free range" chicken (or duck, or any poultry, really) doesn't mean a thing as the requirements for a farm to be called free range are not stringent at all. Pretty much they will pile them up on top of each other but so long as they can "touch the ground" (not in cages) it's "free range." (Ugh, now I remember why I've been a vegetarian for 15+ years....)<br /><br />I have heard of a number of issues with the jerky chicken treats sourced from China and I keep closely monitoring her for any changes; in the interim I limit the amount of treats she gets anyway and the air dried raw food she eats is sourced from New Zealand. Hopefully I will eventually be able to find something to replace these with, but until then I'm fairly confident about them.<br /><br />After all, I feel better feeding these even if they ARE sourced from China because they are (at least) not irridiated and I feel better feeding these than the biscuit-style treats that have little nutriotional value.<br /><br />Unfortunately my Safeways finally stopped their buy-1 get-1 sales and raised their prices accordingly so I started orderign online via Amazon. I'm cautious whenever I open a new package of ANY kind of treats so I really like the fact that I now buy the larger packages for "bulk" discounts. It means I am using the same bags longer.<br /><br />Of course not all treats are for all dogs, and if I was starting from scratch I'd probably avoid feeding her these. (I really like Jones Natural Chews and would love to try their USA-sourced jerky) However, considering I'm on a very tight budget at the moment and she is picky beyond belief I have to made do.

Honesty and integrity are essential in all supplements, we no longer will endorse this product and have removed from our watchdog list, read all labels and make sure of mfrg place not distribution place for all food items, with over 70 dogs dying from dog treats it is essential to only buy from usa companys who have a zero recall track record like Flint River.com

review/summary: purchase with caution!!!
review/text: I normally buy Canyon Creek Ranch brand duck and chicken strips from Petsmart; my dogs love it and they have never gotten sick or had any problems. Unfortunately, I was out of town with my dogs on Saturday and I bought two 15 oz bags of the Dogswell Happy Hips duck breast treats from Petco. After giving my two dogs a strip each, my little dog started vomiting five minutes later and my big dog seemed fine until the next morning when I discovered vomit all over his crate. It is a strange coincident that both of my dogs got sick after trying this product. I am throwing away both bags and I will never buy from this brand again. I would rather pay a little more for quality treats than risk the health of my dogs.

review/summary: DO NOT TRUST THIS PRODUCT!  MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I had been buying my 2 year old Bichon Frise these Happy Hips Duck Treats for  months until recently when I purchased a large bag from Petco that, upon opening it, reeked of some sort of chemical substance which smelled very much like chlorine or bleach. The smell was overwhleming and disgusting. Not knowing what was wrong with it, just out of curiosity I looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough....at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words, "Made in China".<br /><br />Up until this time I had assumed their treats were made in the USA, and some of them are. But after looking through all their products it seems that their duck and chicken breast treats come from China.<br /><br />If they want to peddle their toxic crap from China they can look elsewhere because this customer will NEVER buy their product again.

review/text: Check on the web FDA WARNING, I bought this for my 10 pound Havenses, he only had 2 of these and got deathly sick. Went emergency to the vets over a 1,000.00 bill, and my dog is still not well, but he is alive. 70 dogs have died this year from this product so I guess we were lucky. Please BEWARE my little guy was so sick, he could not stand or walk he had watery bloody stools,vomiting, shaking uncontrollably. This was nearly 2 weeks ago, he is still sick and not eating well. I know for fact it was this product that made him so sick as I home cook his meals daily and this was the only new thing I ever gave him, with in hours of giving him this he was vomiting, and throwing this POISON up. The dog is never out of our sight, we have to watch him even when he is outside, to many coyotes here. Amazon Please, don't sell this, the MADE in China is so small I could not read it with my glasses on, larger it says Dogswell dist, Ca

review/summary: HEMP!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I love hemp. I am a vegan college student and find it really difficut to eat enough while taking six classes and wasting my life away doing homework. Having such an accessable form of protein, minerals, and essential fatty acids is nice (3 tbsp. = 22% protein DRI!!) No other food can claim that while being super-digestable. Flax seeds go right through, hemp is easily digested. It has an interesting taste, somewhere between sunflower, almond, and pine nuts. It is good.

review/summary: You CAN make hemp milk too!
review/text: I decided to start making my own hemp milk.  My boys are allergic to wheat/gluten, dairy/beef, eggs/chicken, shellfish, peanuts, soy, corn, sesame, mushrooms, maple, oranges and cinnamon so they are very restricted vegans eating a high raw and organic diet.  Hemp is wonderful for protein, omegas, and healthy fats!<br /><br />At first I had subscribed and saved to this 8 oz (pack of 3) organic hempseed for $16.75.  I bought 10 (30 packs) to start. That's about 70 cents per ounce. I like the portable packs for traveling, visiting grandparents, snacking out of.  An ounce is 3 TBSP which is one serving.<br /><br />I bought quarts of commercial hemp milk for years, Manitoba Harvest, Living Harvest and Pacific (Pacific Vanilla was our favorite.)  I did the Amazon s/s program.  But when I bought my Blendtec Wildside blender I started thinking "I CAN MAKE IT MYSELF!"<br /><br />Here's what you need:<br />a high performance blender like VitaMix or Blendtec is best<br />Shelled hempseed, 8 ounces<br />purified water<br />a nut milk bag for straining (sold on Amazon for $8)<br />a sweetener like honey, agave, dates, or brown rice syrup<br />vanilla if you like<br />Real salt or sea salt of high quality<br />two 78 ounce frigoverre glass jars with tight sealing hermetic lids (sold on Amazon for $10-15) or equivalent<br /><br />Make 1 gallon of hemp milk by adding 1 quart of pure water and the an entire 8 oz package shelled hempseed to a blender bowl and blend on medium about 2 minutes (soaking 15 minutes first is optional).  Line the inside of one of the jars with the nut milk bag (hold the bag so it won't fall in) and pour the cream into the bag.  Squeeze it through the nut milk bag into one of the jars, twisting the bag to extract, then pour the strained cream back into the blender.  I added 1 teaspoon Real Salt, 1 tablespoon organic vanilla, 4 tablespoons raw agave, OR Lundberg brown rice syrup , OR a handful of high quality dates to sweeten a bit.  After blending again (more blending if using dates) pour equal amounts of the flavored cream into the two 78 ounce jars.  Add pure water to fill the jars. Seal the hermetic lid properly.  They keep for a few days and I can gently shake the jar before opening and serving to reincorporate.<br /><br />This way makes 16 - 8 ounce servings of my own hemp milk, the same strength as commercial hemp milk.  Just calculating the hemp in each 8 ounce bag gives totals of 1360 calories, 108g fats, 20g carbs, 16g fiber, 84g proteins.  Making 16 eight ounce servings in a gallon means each serving (just the hemp numbers) is 85 calories, 6.75g fat, 1.25g carb, 1g fiber, 5.25g protein. I used the average of Nutiva and Manitoba Harvest brand nutrition facts for these figures.  As ready as packaged quarts of hemp milk are now I no longer have to carry in heavy cases of premade milk and throw away all those containers.  And it only takes me 5 minutes to make milk.<br /><br />Compared to a commercial quart this milk is fresher, it tastes 'greener', smells like cut grass but doesn't taste it, and the milk is still very 'nutty' in flavor, just as smooth and creamy.<br /><br />You can make a heavy cream to drink or use in smoothies by doubling the hempseed OR halving the water. "Banana Milk" with hemp cream or hemp milk and a banana is awesome. Nutiva and Manitoba Harvest have recipes on their websites.<br /><br />I have started buying the Manitoba Harvest 25# tubs of shelled hempseed.  It is not labeled organic.  But, as hempseed needs no chemicals to grow wonderfully, and it is NON GMO, eco farmed without insecticides or pesticides I have no problems with it not having a label. I store it in the deep freeze in divided portions.  The savings on Amazon is incredible.  The 25# tub is about $136 on the s/s program.  It is 500 oz and costs 27 cents per ounce. So if I use 8 ounces to a gallon of milk I've spent $2.16. That's $.54 per quart! I used to pay $4 per quart at Whole Foods!<br /><br />Please study hemp and its benefits over dairy.  Of course you may have thought you needed dairy for the protein and calcium.  I grew up in Iowa, I was taught that, I was a huge milk drinker.  I had even seen the reality of dairy/beef processing but ignored it.  When breastfeeding (the best milk I could give my son) he was spitting up/vomiting every feed I realized the urgent need to stop drinking it.  Now at 5 years just a splash of skim milk on his arm will give him red boils and blotches.  Soy milk is out too, even if he could drink it hemp is better.  We do sometimes have homemade organic brown rice milk and organic NON GMO gluten free oat milk.<br /><br />I hope you explore hemp milk yourself!  You will save money, and no driving to the store for every gallon of milk you drink, or recycling or waste, plus think of the health benefits.  Share what you know with others so we can become growers and not just consumers of this wonderful superplant.

review/summary: Nutiva HempSeed is very very good...
review/text: I heard my friend who is a fan of Rocky Mountain say that Nutiva had too many shell pieces in it.  But I tried it anyway, and it doesn't, I think it is the better product though really there isn't a lot of difference in any of the products I tried.  Thing is, 3 bags of Nutiva is a bucket and a half of Rocky Mountain's......so if you buy in 2's like I do, then for $36 or $37 you get 3 buckets worth.  With Rocky, you get 2 buckets for $32 or $33, so the extra bucket is like, only $5.....what I also found was that the packets they send them in are very good/well resealable....so I keep them so I can put about 7 or 8 tablespoon full in one bag, cause it fits so well in my briefcase to take to work, and the spoon fit wholly inside the package too!  It is really convienient.  Anyway....thats it.....=)  Free shipping too....

review/text: I bought these at a health food store because I carelessly ran out of my usual brand and this was the only hemp hearts available. There are too many sharp, crunchy husks in the Nutiva Hemp Hearts. This is not the first time I used them so it probably was not a "one bad package" thing. There are other brands out there which don't have sharp edged husks and which are comparatively priced.

Nutiva is Ok for the price, but I would have to say Manitoba is much better but you pay for it.  I've found in the Nutiva some of the shells are still on the on seeds and the taste is not as fresh or nutty as others.  When buying hempseeds I generally buy Manitoba, but when it comes time to restocking I sometimes get lured by the price of Nutiva.  Nutiva isn't bad, it's pretty good and if you haven't tried Manitoba then you wouldn't even know any better!

review/text: I heard about the benefits of hemp and ordered this pack.  The seeds came right away and were much smaller than I had thought they'd be.  Each seed is about double the size of pinhead.  I've found that they're not something you can really snack on without a spoon handy.  However, they have a great nutty flavor that's a bit difficult to describe, a little like pinenuts but with a touch of the skunky flavor that characterizes a particular herbal medicine in the place of the hint of pine.  Still, absolutely delicious.<br /><br />I started adding them to my smoothies in the morning, and absolutely love it.  I like it much better than flax seeds.  Not just because they're better for you (flaxseed oil can actually increase your risk of liver cysts) but also because they are a softer seed, blend better, and don't get stuck in my teeth as badly.

review/text: Wow, what great tasting seeds.  They remind me of of sunflower seeds but not as "crunchy".  The aroma is pleasant.<br />I will update after consuming them for a couple of weeks.<br />Update 11/2/10: I don't notice anything other than I bought more because I love the taste.<br />I did try making hemp milk per a recipe I saw on a youtube video (1/2 cup hemp seeds, 1 qt purified water (I used 2 cups)and the recipe called for 2 tablespoons raw organic agave nectar and 1 teaspoon of organic vanilla extract but I used neither.  I loathe vanilla flavoring.  Blended on puree for 1 minute, strained through a sprouting bag (note: get a real seed milk bag if you are going to do this regularly ... the sprout bag did NOT want to strain the liquid after 30 seconds).<br />The result looks like whole cow milk but tastes like... white colored water. Maybe this is why the recipe called for "doctoring" the taste with agave and vanilla.  Sure it looks like milk... maybe someone who liked no-fat milk would like this water.  Will I drink what I made? Yes.  Will I make more?  Jury is out. Would I buy it in a store?  Oh h** no!

I tried the Nutiva hemp seeds once and like them enough that I see no reason to try another brand and Amazon has the best price of the places I compared.<br /><br />One serving is 3 tablespoons which is quite a lot, so keep that in mind when figuring cost per serving and when comparing various high Omega 3 products.<br /><br />We use them sprinkled on top of salads or cooked veggies or sometimes I put them in my VitaMix machine along with extra firm tofu to blend them into a smooth paste as the base for a huge mixed fruit breakfast milkshake/smoothie.  They are a very good way to add not only Omega 3's but extra protein to a meal and although the taste is very mild, they are quite good.<br /><br />Do keep the package in the refrigerator after it is opened.

If you are looking to buy high quality organic hemp seeds and save money,  buys these.

I gave a bag to my dad and he likes it best in his yogurt.<br />I guess throwing it in soup would make a nice addition too, but as a very LAST addition once the soup is cooked, so that the heat doesn't kill that much of the nutritional value; raw is best nutritionally... (except for eggs).<br /><br />In short: totally try it, you might love it =)<br /><br />-ALBG

review/text: After tiring of pouring un-used brewed coffee down the drain, I decided to buy some instant and use that for those times when  a whole pot was not needed.  I tried several brands, then stumbled across Community Instant.  I have often bought Community whole bean and ground, so I expected it to be good..... It far exceeded my expectations.  It is a very flavorful coffee, and I expect to be purchasing it again in the near future!

Second, they are easy to handle - I pack them on hiking trips and they almost look good enough for me to eat!<br />Now getting to my dogs. One is a foodie that will eat anything, but she definitely prefers these. The other is a little picky, but she goes nuts for for them. So bottom line, I like them, my dogs love them, and for the quality, the price is reasonable.

review/summary: Great supplement
review/text: I began using this product and another (Harmonic Innerprizes LifeSource Supersprouts powder) at the same time.  I put both products in a fruit smoothie every morning as my breakfast.  I don't know if it's one or the other, or a combination of both products, but since I've started this routine, I finally have the energy to get through the full day!  It's not an "extra energy" feeling, I just finally feel like I have the normal amount of energy that a 30-yr old person in relatively good shape should have.  I exercise regularly and eat well for the most part, and I never knew why I was always feeling run-down.  I even asked my doctor and had bloodwork done, and everything is functioning normally...and also went on an energy drink kick for a while because it seemed the only way to not feel like I could take a nap at any given moment.  I was recommended both products by a local health food store simply for added nutrition and Omega 3 and 6 acids, and the energy benefit was just an added bonus I guess!  Even if you don't need energy, I was told that Hemp oil is the most natural source of Omega 3 & 6 acids, and it is the type of nutritional oil most completely absorbed by the body.  Definitely give it a try, it's a great product!

review/text: I was worried when buying this about the taste.  I absolutely hate the taste of flax seed oil, even in smoothies.  After reading up on the benefits of hemp I decided to give hemp seed oil a try.  This stuff is 100 times better than flax oil.  It has a light nutty taste, almost like the peanut oil in natural peanut butters.  I take 2 tablespoons of this stuff straight every morning.<br /><br />Nutiva Hempseed Oil, along with Nutiva's Hempshakes definitely leave me feeling healthy and energized all day.  I highly recommend this for anyone looking to balance out their Omega 3/Omega 6 ratio and get healthy.

review/summary: Coconut Oil for Pakinson's Treatment
review/text: I have been working as the Treatment Team Co-Ordinator for a 71 year old male who is in the process of recovering from Parkinson's Disease.<br /><br />Since "conventional" medicine does not understand the cause nor the correction for the disease, they do not know how to treat the "disease", and the best they can do is to try to manage the undesired symptoms.  Conventional Medicine's prognosis for the disease is as dismal as the effects of their approach to "managing" the undesirable effects of the disease itself.  Dopamine Replacement Therapy's side-effects can be just as devastating to the patients health as the Parkinson's.<br /><br />Therefore, we have elected to take an Alternative Medical Approach, a wholistic approach, and as part of that alternative medical approach, we have elected to use Coconut Oil as an essential ingrediant for brain health and well-being, as opposed to using Fish Oils.  Coconut Oil is more natural, and better, for the both the brain and body.<br /><br />As a result, we use this product as our source for organically grown, pure, virgin coconut oil.  It's an oustanding product, comes is various sizes, and at an affordable price.  We recommend it, and it is performing an essential part in my client's overall recovery from Parkinson's Disease.

review/summary: love this tea
review/text: I've always purchased this tea in bags. Wanted to see if it tasted the same in the kcups. I really do love this tea but it is economicly better to by it by the bags. kcups are great and convenient but just a bit more than I want to spend right now.....

review/summary: Good, but...
review/text: I like it, but.... there's a little bit too much of a sharp after taste. Even adding a ton of sugar didn't make up for it entirely. The product still has good flavor, but I'd gladly take Lipton Spiced Chai over this, if only the Lipton came in a K-Cup.
