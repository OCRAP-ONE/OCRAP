review/summary: Kettle Chips Make Great Mouse Food
review/text: After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse.  Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch.  When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon.  The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which.  I will never buy these again from Amazon.  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase.  It makes me sick to think about it!<br /><br />I included pictures at the top of the page.  Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.<br /><br />Update:  I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them.

review/text: Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented.  I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice, a veritable cornucopia of flavor.  I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai & Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors, alternating days. I have already lost 5 lbs, not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing. Get your life back - with Kettle Chips.

review/summary: great (hot) new flavor....
review/text: I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food.  I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in.

review/text: Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. I'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now.

review/text: After reading some of the reviews, I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst! No worries here. All bags are in great shape and expiration dates aren't until June. Chips, at least from the first bag, taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world! By the way, fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so, yay team!

review/summary: Kettle Brand Potato Chips - New York Cheddar
review/text: Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.  I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then.  But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me.

review/summary: Great Chip!
review/text: With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: "Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand� Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag"<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: "At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand�  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are "trans fat free" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging."  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.

review/summary: Awesome and delicious!
review/text: These are among the best chips I have ever eaten!  I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasn't a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read "Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!"<br /><br />You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won't be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!  Buy some today, and fall in love like me!

review/summary: One bite and you'll become a "chippoisseur"
review/text: I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

review/text: I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good.  The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!

review/text: When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet.

review/text: These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag.

review/summary: Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .
review/text: My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .

I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon.

review/summary: Kettle Chips, Sea Salt
review/text: There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The "best by" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October.

Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation.

review/summary: Sweet, salty, tangy: the way a snack should be
review/text: Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!).

review/summary: One bite and you'll become a "chippoisseur"
review/text: As an Oregonian, I make a point of sharing these Oregon-made snacks with friends who visit the state. I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>.<br /><br />The Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com.

review/text: These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're "kettle chips" and they're "fried" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!

review/text: I agree with the company motto "A Natural Obsession".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.

review/summary: Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips
review/text: The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed "ginger with attitude" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  "Great Taste Naturally" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!

review/summary: 4 Stars for price and taste
review/text: I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.

review/summary: Things you need to know
review/text: Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

review/text: This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  � homiedog �

review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

review/text: I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

review/text: I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips.  The price per bag can't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated.

review/summary: Should have ordered from another source?????
review/text: It took a month for delivery.  The stated time was 2-9 business days.  The delivery was shipped the day AFTER I complained to the company,(Gristedes in New York),...HMMMM.....UPS couldn't figure out how to deliver to a P.O. Box?????(I have had numerous packages go UPS to USPS to P.O. Box) To make matters worst the shipment was short 2 packages of product.  I think next time I will stay on the West Coast for faster delivery and a little extra $$$$. GOOD LUCK if you order from Gristedes Market in New York!!!! (And, remember to stay on top of the order to make sure that you actually get it.....)The ONE positive note was that the product was AWESOME as far as freshness and presentation!!!

review/summary: Very nice!!
review/text: I have ordered a few different types of truffle butter, (all from amazon).<br /><br />Some of them were sooo small, I couldn't believe how tiny they were.  And another had only a slight truffle flavor.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised when this one arrived.  It was a nice size for the price, with a very bold truffle flavor.<br /><br />I felt I didn't have to use as much, as I would with another brand, because of this it lasted much longer.<br /><br />I am now purchasing two more, I would definitely recommend this brand.  Its the best I have found!!!<br /><br />Hope you enjoy as much as I did!!!

review/text: I have ordered this licorice from another seller several times.  It comes in sweet and fresh and the perfect consistency.  I mistakenly ordered this and was quite miffed when I received it.  It was hard and actually hurt to chew it.  So while the brand itself is the best I have ever found this product is terrible.  I suggest looking for the three pack that comes in plastic rather than this product that comes in a box.  If I had ordered this product first, I would have never ordered this brand again.

They are different from the Australian style red licorice but I like them better... they're lighter, not as oily.

I've never seen my cat react so favorably to a treat before! She goes nuts over this! It's not a soft food, but a freeze dried texture. It is a treat, not a substitute for food. But it's healthy and with no additives! Better value online at Amazon too.

review/summary: Sweet Strawberry
review/text: Matcha where have you been all my life! I mentioned in another review of Red Leaf Tea's Matcha tea that my discovery of tea is a very new adventure for me and that after reading rave reviews on Steepster about Red Leaf's eclectic selection of flavors, I gave it a try. I wonder now how I got along without it. I got my daughter hooked and recently had my son try it. He immediately ordered some for himself. After tasting it, it is not a question of "do I want to order some", it is more like "how much and what flavors should I order"! Trust when you look at all the flavors they have to offer, it is extremely hard to decide!<br />My second order came last week and I could smell the wonderful matcha before I opened the box! First up for testing was the Strawberry flavored match.<br />Sweet and naturally tasting Strawberry flavor. In an effort to lead a healthier lifestyle, I find Matcha tea to be so versatile. I added a teaspoon of Matcha, a half a cup of plain greek yogurt & a few fresh strawberries, a little almond milk & ice in a blender and I had a delicious healthy smoothie!

review/summary: Deliciously strawberry!
review/text: Out of the gold foil package, the matcha smells like juicy strawberry, like smelling strawberry fruit leather or a strawberry flavored candy.<br /><br />Prepared as a traditional cup of hot matcha, 1/4tsp of sifted strawberry matcha whisked in some 175f filtered hot water,  the green tea comes out as deliciously earthy with no bitterness. The strawberry is bright and present, adding a hint of sweetness. The taste combined almost reminds me on when I eat strawberries too fast and I accidentally eat the stem or a leaf, which happens often haha!<br /><br />Now my favorite part, making this matcha into an iced strawberry soy latte! I did about � or 2/3 cup of light soy milk (ran out of milk), bit of sweetener, 1/4tsp of matcha and whisked it. The result: very tasty strawberry balanced with the taste of matcha. Even better than strawberry soy milk as it tastes just like strawberry candy. An amazing treat for under 90 calories!<br /><br />Overall, very delicious if you are into the strawberry candy flavor. As a traditional cup it is pretty good, but even better as a latte. I suggest not to pass this one up.

review/summary: Pure summer bliss!
review/text: Let's get to the good stuff: as always, I fall in love with the first sniff. Cutting open the corner of the gold foil bag was like a flavour overload! The sweet strawberry scent was too good to be true - and happily for me, it tasted just like it smelled!!!<br /><br />That can be rare in a tea, but I've come to learn that Red Leaf Tea sets their bar just as high as I set mine! That leaves me very rarely disappointed, and almost always happily surprised with the quality, scent and flavour! Strawberry was no exception!<br /><br />(Excuse the amount of exclamation marks, I really can't help it)<br /><br />I ordered by my usual parameters: Basic Grade Matcha with Delicate flavouring. One day I will invest in tins, but right now I have a system that keeps my matcha fresh - a mix of the tiny tins from DavidsTea (from their "Wall" teas), and freezer bags kept in a special tin box. It's pretty and I like it! I kind of thrive in a world of controlled chaos - it's either the artist in me, or the lazy in me! Probably both - but I thought I should share my "technique" since the tins are a hot topic these days!<br /><br />On to the taste! I truly was taken by surprise. The flavour is simple but so effective that from this experience, I can't think of a better combination than matcha and strawberries. That's not to say that RLT has amazing flavour combos and super unique matchas - there is something just so simple, comforting and naturally delicious about this Strawberry Matcha. It's tangy and sweet - I prepared it first straight up with a bit of sugar, second as an iced matcha latte. The flavour was a mix between strawberry milk (I used to devour the stuff as a kid) and a melted strawberry milkshake!<br /><br />This inspires me to get some good quality vanilla ice cream and whip it up in my blender with this matcha! I looove matcha icecream and strawberry icecream, so I can't think of a better combo for a homemade matcha shake!

review/text: You know this matcha screams summer and while I have been longing for autumn to get here for the weather this mix makes me feel like going down the street to our local fruit farm and grabbing up a bunch of fresh strawberries! Yes I am lucky to have fruit farms close to my home. The grassy matcha base along with the fresh fruity aroma of strawberries just makes me sit back and appreciate summer a little while longer. This would be SO GOOD mixed with some orange juice in a smoothie. This makes me want to just play around with this flavor and see what all I can come up with! I bet an actual cheesecake made with this matcha would be sinfully divine!

review/text: I love this matcha. I could rave on and on about the multitude of ways it can be served and the multitude of health benefits it offers. First, I tried it in cold water. Delicious. There's a real freshness from the matcha and a strong strawberry aroma and flavor. It tastes like a strawberry juice. Next, strawberry matcha in cold almond milk. Mmmm. This was excellent. It really brought out the strawberry milk flavour I've adored for as long as I've been aware of its existence. Really tastes like a strawberry dessert. Love it! Then, I decided to try it in hot water. It's still great! It seems a bit strange to drink what tastes essentially like hot strawberry juice and like it, but I deceive you not, my palate found it quite appealing. And finally, in hot almond milk? Mmmm. Very comforting. Warm strawberry milk.

review/text: I absolutely love this flavored Matcha.  Why?  Well, first, I love Matcha:  the bittersweet, creamy, vegetative taste with a hint of buttery goodness and all of its delightful nuances.  Second, I love strawberries!<br /><br />This flavored Matcha is a brilliant representation of both strawberries and of Matcha.  Creamy, smooth Matcha with sweet, juicy strawberry taste.  Together, it is a chawan full of berry goodness.  The strawberry is very true to the fruit:  sweet with just a hint of tartness toward the end, all that's missing is the seeds (and I don't really miss those!)<br /><br />A real treat, any time of day.  It's also great as a Matcha Milkshake.  Add some milk and ice cubes to the blender, along with a tablespoon or so of the Matcha (I really just eyeball everything), and blend until smooth.  It's really yummy, cool and refreshing.

review/summary: Strawberry Matcha Forever!
review/text: Mmmm strawberries. I cannot begin to tell you how much of my life has been spent picking strawberries. As a child, I hated it, but now I remember it fondly...isn't it weird how that happens? So good...strawberry shortcake is the most delicious thing in this world. Especially made with fresh, sun ripened strawberries. As long as I can remember, my mom has had a row or two of strawberries in her yard. When we lived in Michigan and we had room to garden (and soil that was more than just clay), we had tons of strawberries. Tons! But then we moved to Tennessee, and the soil there was not as habitable, but she still managed to squeeze some delicious berries out of that red clay. So strawberries and strawberry flavored things that actually taste like strawberries always remind me of her and of that gorgeous garden she kept in Michigan. Of course, they also remind me of the time I was about 7 and picking strawberries in the garden when I felt some grass brush over my foot. I looked down to see a snake slithering over my foot. **shudders** I have never screamed so loud in my life. And thus a lifelong fear of snakes was born.<br /><br />So the real question here is will this matcha be a snake or a shortcake?<br /><br />Shortcake. Oh my goodness, shortcake. This smelled amazing when I opened the package, like creamy, sweet strawberries. Like, well, strawberry shortcake, to be honest. Guh, I just want to dive into it. I took it to work with me and my mind was blown by it. I kept getting distracted by how good it was. I love a good tea. I'm trying to figure out which six I want to keep in stock and this is a definite front runner. I think mixing this with a little French Vanilla would be out of this world. I love berries so most of my smoothies are berry smoothies...this will be an amazing addition to that particular mix. Now, it doesn't have that hint of tartness that fresh strawberries do, but that's okay. I'm in love anyway. It tastes like strawberry candy, but I know Red Leaf Tea doesn't use artificial ingredients, so I'm very excited to have this. Next time I'm craving a bag of strawberry puffs, I'm going to reach for this instead. Mmmm...maybe I'll take some of this to work with me today too!

review/summary: Jasmine matcha - light vegetal flavor - not heavy floral
review/text: This matcha smells like a nice light matcha.  I really love jasmine so I had hoped that the scent would come thru, but it did not.  For those that are not into a strong floral jasmine flavor, this is the jasmine matcha for you!<br />My first impression of this matcha was, "Where is the jasmine?"  I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I was unable to detect a "flavor" in this matcha.  That of course does NOT mean it will taste bad, just not what I expected.<br />I always make sure to warm up my bowl and chasen under a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  My matcha does not cool down as fast when warming the bowl.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha, water and my sifter!  I'm becoming a matcha pro now.  No need to go looking for my tools, they were all handy.  This matcha brings me to a place where I imagine sitting with friends passing around a matcha bowl contemplating our day.  I would love to share this outdoors on a warm spring or summer day.  Today is 60 degrees so I have to use my imagination.<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha. Once that was properly mixed I added a teeny bit of sugar and 6 oz of water.  Last time I had a total of 7 oz and the matcha was bitter.  After going back to my 8 oz I tried the matcha and still felt that it was a touch bitter.  I added 2 more oz of water and a bit more sugar.  I know it's psychological, but I feel healthier drinking this matcha!  It's just so light and fresh and reminds me of a health food drink.<br />The smell of this matcha once mixed with water takes stayed the same, light and vegetal.  I am now curious how the Pure Jasmine Matcha compares to this one.  I was torn between them when placing my order.  The quality of the matcha is very good.<br />I'm not sure if this matcha will make my keep cupboard.  Red Leaf Tea has so many flavor offerings that I think I'll try those before going back to this matcha which doesn't seem far off my normal matcha.  My plan for the rest of Jasmine is to mix it to my health food drink which is a vanilla base.  I ordered the large size so I will save a bit for next spring when I can enjoy it outside.<br />To try Jasmine Matcha from Red Leaf Tea visit here:<br />[...]

review/summary: Making vanilla with great beans
review/text: I had never made vanilla extract before, all the sites said to use madagascar beans. I ordered them, and they are great! Lots of "caviar" in them to make a nice dark vanilla extract.

review/summary: Quick Shipping, Product as Described, Very Happy Customer!
review/text: I found this deal while searching for vanilla beans to make my own extract. I was a little unsure of ordering from them because there were not many reviews and the one bad review made me wonder.<br /><br />A friend of mine and I decided to split a pound of vanilla beans, at that price if there was a problem at least we wouldn't lose a bunch of money. My friend placed the order on Friday afternoon and they arrived Tuesday morning. The beans arrived as described, vacuum sealed, moist and fragrant. Plus, they sent plenty of extra beans! More than I expected, actually. I have a batch of vanilla steeping right now and can't wait for it to be finished. As long as the vanilla extract I make turns out fine, I'm pretty sure we will order from them again.<br /><br />So, to sum up...quick shipping + product exactly as described and pictured + bonus free beans = new loyal customer.<br /><br />It's too bad the other reviewer had a problem with his order. I have to wonder if it had more to do with the International part of the shipping, such as the package being opened for inspection?

review/summary: Lots of beans!!
review/text: I received my vanilla beans promptly a few days after ordering.  I chose to purchase 1 pound of the grade B beans for making vanilla extract. Though I did expect these beans to be a little drier than other beans, I guess I underestimated how dry they would be. It could be that I  just haven't used vanilla beans before, though I have some from another vendor that were not as dry and they were old (maybe not grade B...I don't know). This vendor did include a tips card on making extract which may be handy for those making extract for the first time. I will have to see how my extract turns out as I will allow it to sit for a minimum of 4 months. Then hopefully some nice vanilla extract.

review/summary: Great product from a great suppler.
review/text: While I haven't ordered these beans thru Amazon I have ordered from Vanilla Products USA and will not buy from anyone else! They came in very quickly and are very wonderful to cook with and getting the free beans with every shipment is the best..  If you are not sure what to try, look for their sampler packs.. three different types in shipment.. Planning on buying more soon as I tend to put vanilla in everything now... I will not buy them from the store ever again as Vanilla products USA beats them all in price and freshness.

review/summary: a real bargain
review/text: Shipment was fast!  I ordered on Sunday of a holiday weekend and got them on Thursday.  The bag is huge!  There were 132 beans in my bag and even though they are described as 6-7", mine are more like 8".  Just to do the math; 132 beans @ 31.95  comes out to less than 25cents per bean!  It's crazy that vanilla beans cost like $5 each at the grocery store.  Now I just need lots of ideas to use vanilla beans, as I have many, many more than I anticipated.

review/summary: Great beans - great price
review/text: I ordered these beans to make vanilla extract for holiday gifts.  At the grocery store I literally paid $16 for a single vanilla bean, so this price was amazing.  Additionally, it came with an extra 1/8 lb of vanilla beans as a bonus.  I was able to make over a gallon of extract (using over 150 beans) and I still have 1/5 lb of beans left plus the additional bag.  They were moist and sealed well - in better condition than what I bought at the grocery store.  Shipping was quick and this is a GREAT product for the money.

review/summary: Just like mom used to make
review/text: I used to buy a much more expensive vanilla bean sold here on Amazon, feel free to search for my username and see how much i used to over-spend.<br />I decided to try this option because i would not be in a bind if they were of poor quality or i did not like them.<br /><br />Ordered them up and they arrived in a few days. The smell was wonderful and i am quite pleased with the quality.<br />I will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Awesome Beans
review/text: I ordered my beans on Saturday and got them on Wednesday. I opened them and found the free beans on top and they smelled amazing. I smelled the 1 lb bag and they also were amazing. I look forward to the homemade vanilla extract. I will write again once I am able to have some extract. I am sure it will be just as good as I hope maybe even better.

review/summary: Consistently Excellent
review/text: I have been ordering grade B beans for making extract for several years from Vanilla Products USA.  I used to order from their ebay storefront; this time I had some Amazon giftcards to burn.  In both cases, I received my beans very quickly.  Although these are grade B beans, I've always been very impressed with the quality.  I've had to look hard to find the imperfections that cause the beans to be down-graded.  I will defiantly order this product from this company in the future, and I recommend them to all my friends.

review/summary: Directions leave much to be desired!
review/text: If I buy vanilla extract it is either McCormick or Watkins Double Strength. If you follow the directions sent with the beans your extract will most likely not be as good as those.<br /><br />I made about 20 different batches, all in 50ml bottles, aged 2 months. You need a smooth vodka like, Monopolowa Potato Vodka, to make an excellent basic vanilla extract. Smirnoff Whipped Vodka, Jim Beam Black, and surprisingly, Jim Beam Red Stag, were also among my favorites. Even though I like some of the harsh bourbons in cola they made terrible vanilla extract, as did they very cheap harsh vodkas that seem to be recommended. I only tried 2 types of rum & neither were among my favorites.<br /><br />Also, I let some other batches set for 3 months and they were better than the 2 months ones.<br /><br />Good beans for the price, lousy directions.

review/summary: Smells wonderful, Super fast shipping
review/text: I ordered this product late Wednesday night, it was shipped the following day and I received it today, Tuesday.  I would have received it Saturday though, if I had had it shipped to my home address.  It looks exactly as pictured, smells amazing and I got the extra 1/8th a lb as a free gift (which equals to about 20 extra beans).  I'm making vanilla extract, so I won't know for a couple months how good the beans are, but for right now, I am very happy with this company and their product!
