review/text: These jelly beans will spoil you for ordinary, fat jelly beans. The flavors are even fun to eat. Try to do the impossible and eat one at a time. Very difficult to do. You'll find yourself tossing them into your mouth by the handful, and you deserve to.<br /><br />I have found that the usual fat jelly beans don't really have much taste. They're just something to chew on. These gourmet jelly beans have wonderful flavors. I love them. I think you will, too.

review/summary: Coffee flavored? Ew.
review/text: To begin, let me state that I'm a jelly bean fan. The cheaper and bigger, the better. Gourmet didn't mean anything to me; now it means "tiny and strangely flavored."<br /><br />On opening the package, an unpleasant smell hit my nose.  Later, I was able to determine that a few of the claimed 41 flavors were simply NASTY to my taste and nose.<br /><br />For the first handful, guessing the upcoming flavor was fun. Then that wore off and I just wanted the 35 flavors that tasted good to me. I guess you can't please everyone all the time.  Knowing when a nasty flavor is coming is critical.<br /><br />The blacks were a very rich liquorish, if you like that sort of thing.  There are multiple shades of each of the main standard colors and usually a spotted variety for each too. All of the flavors were unique to me, some were very good.  I missed some of the old standby flavors.<br /><br />On the plus side, they are extremely satisfying. Normally, I could eat a bowl full of other jelly beans. With these, I barely had the top layer and was satiated.<br /><br />I just hope I can figure out the terribly flavored ones and avoid them.

review/summary: Not as good as the other brand
review/text: When I stumbled upon these, I was struck by how much they resembled (in appearance) my favorite candy - Jelly Belly jelly beans.  After I opened them I discovered that the resemblance ended with their appearance.  These have a very harsh chemical flavor and an unpleasant and lingering aftertaste.  I was thoroughly disappointed.

review/text: I bought a bag of these to give to my kids at Easter, but when I tasted them I had to go out and buy some Jelly Belly's. Literally every flavor was just awful, I mean awful. Each one I tried was stranger and more disgusting tasting than the last. I have no idea what flavor any of them were supposed to be. This is not a joke review, they were really that bad. I threw the entire bag in the garbage. Avoid these things at all cost.

review/summary: great alternative for allergic child
review/text: PEANUT FREE!!! Yay for Gimbal's!  Did you know that jelly belly products have a peanut warning? I was saddened to discover that I could no longer buy my favorite candy, jelly belly jelly beans, thanks to my 6 yr old daughter's peanut allergy.<br /><br />Finally, I've found a safe alternative for my kids and will go to the ends of the earth to purchase Gimbal's products.  Gimbal's fine candies print right on the packaging, "Gimbal's facility is proud to be; nut/peanut free, gluten free, trans fat free, dairy free, gelatin free, egg free."<br /><br />Gimbal's candies are a blessing for the allergic child!<br /><br />True, Gimbal's beans do not contain the microscopic amounts of "natural" fruit advertised by Jelly Belly, but I certainly don't miss it.  True, some of the flavors get "muddied" by the strong coffee flavored jelly beans aroma, but this seems to be more of a problem in older/less fresh packs.<br /><br />Neither of these minor faults is enough to make me EVER pass up an opportunity to buy Gimbal's Fine Candies! I love the flavors; I love the fun; I love the low price; but most importantly, I love that my kids can eat them safely.

review/summary: Great, mild decaf flavor!
review/text: We drink about 4-5 K-cups in our house each day, and this one always seems to be a favorite.  It's hard to find decaf flavors that actually taste good, but I really enjoy this one.  It's the same as most flavored coffees, in that it's a mild/lighter brew.  It tastes exactly like you'd expect a standard French Vanilla brew to, and I don't notice any fun aftertaste (like I do with some brands).  If you love dark/bold brews, this one won't do it for you, but if you just like a little after-dinner treat and don't want to be up all night, this is your K-cup.  Oh - and the person who said they sent the wrong product - you need to rate the seller that sent it (in your account/history settings).  It's not right to take it out on the actual product.

I can't find French Vanilla decaf grounds anywhere, much less in pods.<br /><br />When I pack my Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig Brewers with loose grounds I can easily get two cups of full flavor coffee out each fill. Not really so with these prefilled pods. But it's a small price to pay for a good cup of coffee that I can have in the evening.

review/summary: Love This Decaf Coffee
review/text: I have a single cup Keurig coffee machine. I can't have caffenine and I love the French Vanilla Flavor of coffee. I've tried several other K-cups of different French Vanilla and didn't like the taste of any of them. I ended up tossing them all in the trash. When I tried this Green Mountain French Vanilla in K-cups that is Decaf, I can't seem to get enough of it. There's no after taste, which is wonderful. What I do, is make this coffee during the evening (when I crave it the most) and add some cinnamon and stir. Then I add some International French Vanilla Cream for sweetness to my liking, and then add Fat Free milk to finish it off. The flavor for me is absolutely Heaven! Even drinking it in the evening, it doesn't keep me up all night, and when I go to bed, I sleep like a baby and get a good nites rest. I won't be changing to any other brand or flavor. This tastes so incredable! It's just as described being luschously rich and smooth. It's also a Light Roast, so It's perfect for me and I can add any extra flavors (like the cinnamon) I mentioned. I Very higly Recommend this for anyone, especially ones that can't have the caffine! And the price is very reasonable! Love it, Love it, Love it!!!

review/summary: Gevalia coffee is the best; watch for expired dates on your packages
review/text: 1)  Love Gevalia coffee!  I have been drinking this coffee for 20+ years and highly recommend it.  I still have not found anything else that is quite as smooth.<br /><br />2)  When purchasing this coffee, it is important to note that you may or may not be getting the same quality product as you would if purchasing directly from Gevalia.  Several of my boxes of coffee purchased from Amazon have had broken vacuum pack seals or have been expired.

review/summary: Not the best cat treat in my opinion, but they are cat approved
review/text: The only good comment I can give on these treats is that my cat liked them when they were fresh, and they are really inexpensive! I can usually find these treats for under two dollars at the grocery or pet store, and even on occasion at the dollar store. As this treat proves, often with a low price, comes a cheap product.  It would be nice if these pounce treats had healthier ingredients, maybe some vitamins or a dental cleanser, but no, its just junk food and a long list of filler ingredients. They smell really gross to me but my cat seemed to enjoy them. My biggest reason for not liking this treat, aside from the terrible ingredients and smell, is the fact that it is soft and chewy and not crunchy texture. Soft treats reek havoc on pet teeth as the sticky particles just sit on their teeth and gums and just rot there. Crunchy treats at least crunch off and don't stick to their teeth- hopefully crunching off some tarter with it. For a really good dental product, I recommend Crunch N' Clean brand with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have as many beneficial dental ingredients, but they are pretty good as well as they contain vitamins and a little bit of breath freshening ingredients in them, so they are much better than these. Any crunchy treat would be better than these. Even other Pounce varieties are MUCH better than these, such as the Tarter & Plaque control varieties. The Pounce Tarter & Plaque control are a bit more pricey, but still relatively inexpensive and they contain vitamins and are crunchy. Another strange thing about these treats is that the recommended daily allotment is 6-8 treats per day, which is just crazy to me. I only give my cats no more than 1-2 a day of these while I had them. I eventually threw them out as they got hard as rocks and my cats didn't like them anymore anyhow.<br /><br />Pros: cat approved taste while fresh; and very fair price<br />Cons: bad smell, lack of nutrition, terrible texture for teeth

When we get inside, everyone gets a treat and I use these and other flavors by Pounce to give the cats a little something to nibble upon. They have never refused them, they don't get bored with them and they yowl at me if I'm slow in delivering them.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Great salt -- just what I expected.  The care that went into handcrafting this product is clearly evident.  The taste is warm and full-bodied, a perfect balance of sea minerals.  I would like to congratulate the crafts people who are responsible for such a fine salt, made in the time-honored, traditional manner.  It warms my heart to know there are still people who understand and spend their time striving to make such a quality product in the old-fashioned way.  Omodetto, arigato gozaimas.  Please don't stop doing what you are doing.  And when you finally make your last batch, I hope you have trained others to take over and continue to make the same, fine product, in the same time-honored, uncompromising, traditional manner.  Good salt is the basis of our healthy life.  To be the salt of the Earth, we need good salt to nourish our nerves, our bodies and our spirits.  Thank you deeply for providing this essential nutrient.

review/summary: Very Good Product
review/text: You might want to consider this wonderful product.  It is identical to the orange can except that it does not gel, which is perfect if you want to use in any beverage and not have it congeal.  I only bought one can, but noticed the results of less pain in my joints and stronger nails.  I just ordered it in bulk from the website because it's something we plan on taking forever.  The only downside is that you have to cut your nails more often.

review/summary: One of my primary nutrients
review/text: Collegen is central for maintaining a healthy body, particularly as one ages. It is like a glue that holds the body together. It contributes significantly to skin, hair, nail health. As one ages, loss of collegen is evident when you go for a blood test and the technician can't hold the vein in one place long enough to draw blood. In prior times, it was ingested in the organ meats people consumed; but these foods have long since lost their appeal for most people, including myself. So we turn to a more palatable, convenient source: Gelatin. I prefer the hydrolysate form, as it is "predigested", smoother, blends easily with other ingredients (ok, so I'm squeemish). But I do recommend it, having seen and felt good results with it.

I mentioned this product..She experimented with it for Passover, and was so pleased. She spread duck sauce on the breasts and they were a huge success. Well, I decided to try for myself and was very pleased with the result..The only problem is, your product is not available now. Can you give me a source to purchase the Chicken Roasters?

review/text: As a long time licorice fan but recently counting carbs to stave off type II diabetes, I was anxious to try these. To my dismay, I found that one serving contains 110 calories and 22 garms of carbohydrates. My disappointment turned to disgust when I tasted them. There is very little flavor in these. If you are looking for a pleasant tasting treat and cannot have sugar/carbs do not purchase these. There are plenty of other decent tasting sugar free and diabetic friendly treats available other than this product.

I have a machine myself and love it, however, when I first got my machine, it only had 5-6 various sample cups included with the machine itself and it took me a while to get a case.  So, I know how inconvenient it is to not receive a collection kit to start out with.  This collection is really terrific--there a a number of different types of coffee included and with 48 cups per box, it would last most people 2-3 weeks.  I really recommend this as a gift of for yourself to try out different flavors.

review/summary: Who drinks decaf????
review/text: Never really had a problem purchasing k cups, However, I decided I wanted more of a variety, so I went with this product. My wife and I were extremelyl disappointed to say the least. 3/4 of the k cups were different kinds of decaf coffee. I don't know about the rest of you, but I mostly drink coffee as a wake me up in the morning, not for the taste. (which I find bland). Decaf flavors should be sprinkled in here or there, not dominate the entire package.

review/summary: special edition packaging leaves tons to be desired
review/text: I was a little disappointed with this collection.  It came in a shipping box as if the different pods were just thrown in there according to the combination described online.  When I read it was a "collectors" edition, I assumed more care would be taken in the packaging and the packaging itself would be special. Instead it's just a print that they put in with the coffee -- it's a black and white print that isn't any better quality than your regular poster.  The coffee itself is as described (although there are so many "bold" flavors that I'm not sure how they can claim this is a medium roast collection).  If you are looking to sample different brands and types of coffee, this works.  However, being new to Keurig brewing, I'm not sure if this is price comparable and if it costs more for the special "limited edition" package for this collection, I'd skip it as it's not worth the additional cost.

review/summary: Not enough medium roast
review/text: There were at least 10 dark roast cups in the box, which is about a third of the box.  There were also a few flavored cups.  This box was shipped to and arrived in Alaska without problem.  More recently when I attempted to order more K-cup coffee via Amazon, the order was refused with the excuse it couldn't be shipped to Alaska.  So, based on that I won't be buying my coffee from Amazon in the future.  How dumb is that?

review/summary: I Love Cofee and I am Thrifty
review/text: I love my Keurig coffee maker however, I also like saving money and not spending too much on the pods. This is by far my favorite collection of strong coffees. I am so hooked on this specific collection I just don't like any other coffee they way I love the coffee from this collection. For the price if you get Amazon prime I believe this is the best bang for your buck. Please note there are no flavored coffees in this collection, so if you want hazelnut or chocolate this is not the collection for you.

review/summary: Good choices, a little Green Mountain Coffee trigger happy though
review/text: Really good selection and variety, however I only got 20 different favors instead of 24, and they seemed to prefer one brand, instead of evening out the order. 7 out of 35 are decaf, so it's not bad, but not great. And since I am ordering medium roast, chances are I don't want a bold or extra bold flavor and 7 of them were just that. So those are going to have to get a lot of cream.<br /><br />13 Green Mountain Coffee, 2 of them blend over ice. Not sure I am looking forward to that.<br />3 Donut Shop<br />1 Van Houtte =( and it is decaf. I love this brand, and I only got 1<br />4 Caribou<br />7 Wolfgang Puck<br />2 Newman's Own, both extra bold<br />4 Tully's<br />1 Barista Prima Coffeehouse<br /><br />Overall, I would probably order again.

review/summary: Good sampler
review/text: I've tried about half a dozen of the crazy cups samplers.  Except for the chocolate one that was mostly powdered hot chocolate in a cup and very little coffee, they're a great way to experience a wide variety of flavors from different companies without having to buy into a big box full.  I've found flavors and varieties I hadnt seen before that we liked.  What we tend to do is buy the 2-3 varieties we usually use in bulk to keep the cost per cup down, then we salt the collection with one of these variety boxes to spice things up.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I drink medium roast and my hubby likes dark, so this collection was perfect!  The Caribou is now my favorite coffee, I would rather make this at home than go out for coffee at this point.  I recently bought just a whole 48 count of the Caribou because it is so good.  The Green Mountain is not bad either but not as smooth.  And I have had no complaints about the other flavors from the hubby.  At the price we got it for I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Great idea for coffee tasting from Amazon
review/text: This is a great idea when you're new to this whole Keurig thing (which I am) and I wanted to taste and test these brands before buying because this stuff is expensive.  I'm glad I purchased it but I must say that what probably works for most people doesn't work for me.  I like really bold and strong coffee and I found the coffee in this sampler to be "wimpy" which is to say it's probably great coffee for normal drinkers.  However, if you like bold and strong I recommend buying the Green Mountain BOLD or stick with Starbucks BOLD (any flavor) as long as you have the word BOLD.  Every other brand is too weak which is probably "normal".  I did determine in this experiment that I would only buy Green Mountain if I can't get my first choice which is Starbucks brand.

We used to have coffee made in a drip coffee pot but by the time we would have a second cup the coffee lost much of it's taste and at times tasted burnt.  Never happens with Keurig coffee.

review/summary: Not a bad selection.
review/text: This set comes with four different coffees.  Here's my feedback on each.<br /><br />Green Mountain Nantucket Blend: This is probably the best of the bunch.  Just an all around good coffee without being overly rich or laced with any extra flavors.  It smells great and tastes smooth.<br /><br />Newman's Own Organics Special Blend: This is my second favorite.  Paul may be known for his salad dressing, but he also makes a good cuppa.<br /><br />Caribou Blend: No complaints, but it's nothing special.  Just a regular run of the mill coffee.<br /><br />Tully's French Roast: This is my least favorite of the bunch.  The coffee seems a bit watery and bland.  I never have been a fan of French roast so that may weigh in on my opinion.<br /><br />Overall this is a good collection of K-cups for your morning coffee fix.  Perfect for someone who doesn't want any flavored or frilly coffee, just a straight up good cup of Joe.
