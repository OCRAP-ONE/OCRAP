review/summary: NOT WHITE CHOCOLATE!
review/text: Do not be tempted to use these as a substitute for white chocolate just because they're cheaper!  There is a reason they do not use the word "chocolate" on the package, as there is NO cocoa butter in them.  In fact, the only natural ingredient listed is milk.  This is reflected in the taste, which is very artificial.  I tried to use these in a cookie recipe recently and ruined the cookies.  They did not melt properly and every one fell off the top of the cookies.  I will never use this product again and will tell everyone I know not to use them either.

review/summary: Great for Those with Allergies to Chocolate -- Chocolate Free!
review/text: Let me add my outraged voice to the others.  These 'moresells' were re-formulated by Nestle's accountants and they basically went down the list of ingredients and replaced them by something cheaper that would serve the same chemical purpose.<br /><br />Gone is cocoa and chocolate and vanilla and what we have instead is a concoction of unsavory stuff:<br /><br />Sugar<br />Partially Hydrogenated Palm Kernel & Palm oils<br />Milk & Nonfat Milk (less than 1 gram... ie. a few molecules)<br />Soy Lecithin<br />Artificial flavor<br /><br />So per serving that's 9 grams of sugar and 3 grams of Unsaturated-Hydrogenated Trans-Fat (the worst kind), 1 gram of saturated Fat, with a paper-clip sized dose of milk.<br /><br />I can't imagine feeding such junk to my children, any more than I would give it to my husband who'd I'd like to live another 20 years.  Not only are these morsels unhealthy, they don't taste good and are cloying and waxy on the tongue.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/cookie maker

review/summary: AWFUL! Wouldn't even melt!
review/text: Ghirardelli had been my standby for Xmas candy-making since it was the ONLY brand left I could find in my town that made ACTUAL white chocolate chips, but this year they, like everyone else, seem to think that no one will notice the difference if they take out the actual, y'know, chocolate part. (Believe me, manufacturers, we can tell the difference.)<br /><br />So this year, since I couldn't find any white chocolate chips, I just went with the Nestle's, since if Ghirardelli is making the same inferior product I might as well go with the cheaper option, right? Well, I should have just given up on using white coatings on anything, because this stuff is utter crap.  I actually don't think it tastes all that bad - it tastes like the coating on a Zero bar, basically. But if I'm making homemade candy, it's not supposed to taste like a cheap, commercial candy bar - it's supposed to taste like good quality homemade candy! More important than this though is the fact that they didn't even melt, and I couldn't use them. I followed the directions precisely, but I kept stirring and heating in tiny increments and they just. wouldn't. melt!, and then finally, I guess they seized or something, because I was left with an unusable lump of half-melted, weirdly-hardened white chips. I never, ever had this problem with actual white chocolate before, and I've been using it for years and years!<br /><br />This was a complete waste of my money, ugh. GIVE US BACK OUR ACTUAL WHITE CHOCOLATE, CANDY MANUFACTURERS! We DO know the difference! We will pay a little more for the real thing if you would just give us the option of doing so!

I dipped Oreo cookies in them and they were delicious (and they're good straight out of the bag, too). I don't care if they are imitation white chocolate. They are smooth and creamy, melt in my mouth. I love 'em.

review/text: Don't waste your money on these fake white chocolate chips.  They taste terrible and don't even melt correctly.  I bought these to bake cookies for my wife and she always loves the fresh-from-the-oven first cookie.  Well guess what?  Straight out of the oven these chips are still just as solid as when they came out of the package.<br /><br />Next time I will buy real white chocolate from Ghiradelli and will no longer support companies like Nestle who cheap out on their products to make a buck (see Dreyer's with their "Frozen Dairy Dessert" fake ice cream).

I find myself eating handfuls right out of the bag, but they are also great in cookies. They have a buttery, highly vanilla flavor, and a handful of them makes me think instantly of a Dairy Queen ice cream cone. If you love vanilla you should love these just as candy.

review/summary: Nestles White Chips
review/text: I love Nestles Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips, and only use those to bake my chocolate  chip cookies.  Everyone I bake for loves my cookies and says I bake better chocolate chip cookies than Mrs. Fields and Famous Amos combined. I have been baking for over 40 years.<br /><br />I'd give the white chips a -5 if I could. I tried them when they first came out years ago.  I love white chocolate.  I would LOVE to find a good white chocolate chip.  This chip isn't anywhere close.  It had sort of a vanilla flavor instead - except it was more like Dollar Store imitation vanilla.  Nasty.  I tasted three chips and threw the rest of the bag away.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Yes, You add your own mashed sweet potatoes but they're delish!
review/text: I made these for Thanksgiving this year and got rave reviews.  I am not a self-starter when it comes to baking, so unlike another reviewer, I don't mind that the mix does not actually contain the mashed sweet potatoes and I appreciated the pre-measured, pre-mixed dry ingredients and directions (they're really no different than plain old biscuits).<br /><br />I used canned sweet potatoes and mashed them in the food processor.  Trying to do it by hand would have been a LOT of work.  The nature of biscuits is that they're easy. I used a small round cookie cutter to make mini biscuits and they were very popular.  The 3-Pack was perfect for our party of 30 or so guests with enough for leftovers. Turned out a pretty light orange color too.<br /><br />I'll definitely make these again and maybe I'll add some herbs and BACON BITS!!! Yummy! :D

review/summary: Loved it for my child and I
review/text: Okay I am American... but I have eaten homestyle south India food, Goan, Bengali in the kitchens of friends. I do like spicy madras style.  But when it comes to my child, the little one consistently turns her nose up to curry.  This, no. I have made it 3 times. I do not use microwave. When I added  stir fry veggies it was okay nice not great but acceptable. She liked it and I  turned the heat up for me with some Tony Casheries( A creole/cajun spice blend) . However when I added cooked meat  rotisserie chicken or honey marinated chicken kabob pieces it was wonderful. I think accompanied with a salad- a complete meal for two  w/o excessive calories but a satisfying portion.  I love the burn but her system does not and it opens his palate to an array of flavors.  The one with raisins is excellent too. I tried the low sodium one.. It definitely needed some red octane  but my child was good to go.<br />Would I take a Marsala Dosa  and spicy sambar over this yes( In a red hot minute!) but to put together a quick meal out of the cabinet;this is my new favorite flavorful staple.

review/summary: Decent, but not great
review/text: When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me that this flavor, the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

review/summary: Kellog's changed Krusteaz recipe about Fall 2011.
review/text: We used to eat these pancakes every week with fruit instead of syrup.  We have introduced our friends to these.  Amazing that such health and flavor could come from a complete pancake mix.<br /><br />Unfortunately it seems that Kellog's now owns Krusteaz and they changed the recipe approximately in Fall 2011.  Here are some of the changes:<br /><br /> - Sugar almost doubled.<br /> - Fat up by 33%.<br /> - Salt up by 8%.<br /><br />Hmm, so much for my tasty healthy alternative.  Seems like there were plenty of to-sweet pancakes available on the market that appeal to children.<br /><br />The new recipe mix currently says "Improved Taste" on the package.  I wish I could find a source for the old recipe and buy enough to last to the use-by date.  There does not seem to be any way to ask Amazon sellers details like this about what they are selling.<br /><br />The new recipe is still the best tasting pancake mix that we can find, but how can you want that much sugar in something you are going to pour syrup over?  We are looking for an alternative.

review/summary: best wheat pancake - even at 3700 ft!
review/text: We have a great restaurant in town that serves these fabulous granola pancakes; after trying this Krusteaz Wheat and Honey pancake mix I think I have cracked their secret. These cook up tender and fluffy, not too thin or thick when following the directions. They have a hearty balanced wheat taste that is lightly sweet. I would recommend throwing in a small handful of granola once the mix is on the pan; makes a wonderful addition to the pancake, especially when served with real maple syrup.<br /><br />I use this mix at a high altitude and it's the only one so far that comes out right. I've had to discontinue using two old favorites baking mixes (Bisquick and Carbon) because they required too much tweaking to get a good pancake. The Krusteaz mix works well and tastes great. Bonus is that it is usually the cheapest mix on the shelf as well.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: THE BEST and if you miss good, diner coffee, try FOLGERS
review/text: Before my father passed away, we went to the PENN STATE DINER as we loved to call it. When you walk in there the aroma of freshly brewed coffee just hits you!  I asked what brand they served (sound like a commercial here, lol) and the waitress said Folgers. Well, I<br />did take it a step further and ask for one of their coffee cups and now I drink my Folgers out of my diner mug.<br /><br />Folgers has a real coffee flavor. I spent years drinking Maxwell House and now I want them back! If you want real diner coffee, drink Folgers. It's full bodied, not bitter, great with creamers or just black. I love it every way. I will say I do not have the same warm, fuzzy feeling for their decaf which is a shame, but if I'm having regular, this is it.

review/summary: Now Foods Non Fat Dry Milk Powder
review/text: I started using powder milk only recently with great satisfaction.  Store bought milk just stayed in the refrigerator until it was time to be tossed.  I think this was because when I opened the cap, the scent was overwhelming and the taste was just milk. Dry milk in the stores looked unsightly with cheap packaging.  You could see several bags already torn and powder leaking from the bag and onto the shelf. The stores are not pushing powder milk sales.<br /><br />Since I started using dry milk, I found out that I was in control of the amount of water and powder I wanted to use.  I have used more milk in the last few months that I have used in the last 40 years.  My husband and I love it.  No waste and always fresh looking and smelling. Best of all, it is a good source of protein.<br /><br />The Now Foods Non Fat Dry milk powder is easy to use: one cup powder and 4 cups water to make a quart.  I use a four quart cooking pot, pour 2 cups water then 1/2 cup powder and let it settle.  Then 2 cups water and the rest of the powder.  I use a whisk because I don't like using a mixer. I check the whisk frequently for milk clumps.  When done, I let the solution stand for a couple of minutes to let the bubbles settle and then pour the solution into a BPA free container and place it in the refrig.  Don't worry about extra air bubbles as they will disappear when the milk container is cold. Easy and fast cleanup.<br /><br />With gas prices clinbing up, milk prices will rise too.  Don't worry about shortages as you have a supply of milk powder and fresh water to make great tasting milk.  I will never go back to fresh milk.

review/summary: Not my type of sauce - it needed major "repair"
review/text: Wow.  This was awful.<br />You know how some barbeque sauces are sooo good you just can't stop eating.  Even when you're bursting and should stop?  Well, this one isn't it.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this one as we love Stone brewery and there was no high fructose corn syrup or any other unnatural sounding ingredients in it unlike Phil's which was another BBQ sauce sold at Costco - where we bought this jug.<br /><br />I took a chance and bought this to use it to make our 4th of July potluck contribution - shredded bbq chicken in the crock pot.  First I cooked chicken breasts in the slow cooker with chicken broth and then shredded it and put it back in the cooker and was about to add the Stone Levitation Ale Barbeque Sauce to it when I tasted it and thought "Cr*p! This tastes awful and I'm going to have a LOT left over at the potluck."<br /><br />But it gets four stars because it is easily doctored to taste good.  And then you're left with a good tasting sauce with fairly healthy ingredients.<br /><br />For those who, like me, thinks it's missing something and doesn't think it tastes good out of the bottle, my tip is to add sugar.  I added a couple TBS white sugar and about 1/3 cup brown sugar to the half jug of sauce I mixed in with the chicken.  Then I went online to look at bbq sauce recipes to see what else I could put it there.<br /><br />My research on the net got me adding a couple long squeezes of ketchup and about 1/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar.  That did the trick.  It is tasting like a real bbq sauce now.  By the way, each time, I mixed the added ingredients with broth before adding it to the meat.  And of course, add to your taste!<br /><br />4 Stars for the doctored up version.  Next time I'll buy another brand or make my own from scratch.

review/text: *****<br /><br />Temple of Heaven Gunpowder Green Tea is a premium Numi tea. It is a low-caffeine green tea, is certified organic, and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Our whole leaf Temple of Heaven - Gunpowder Green Tea is gently steamed within hours of being plucked, then skillfully hand rolled into small tight pearls. This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas. Steeped in hot water, the leaves unfurl, releasing a well-rounded, full-bodied flavor. Rich in fluoride, calcium, and anti-oxidants - and with very little caffeine - this is a perfect choice to greet the evening."<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love green tea, or want a green tea that you can drink in the evening, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />*****

review/text: Our family loves mustard on sandwiches, and I like to buy different kinds to keep lunches interesting.  Everyone liked this Jack Daniel's Spicy Southwest Mustard.  It has a smoky chipotle-type taste, and some texture to it from the mustard seeds. It doesn't contain Jack Daniels whiskey, only "VINEGAR, MUSTARD SEED, HORSERADISH, SUGAR, SALT, PEPPERS, CAYENNE PEPPER, AND SPICES".  I like that it doesn't contain preservatives or artificial coloring.<br /><br />I plan to use this mustard as a coating/marinade with panko crumbs for pork tenderloin tonight.  And I look forward to trying some of the other Jack Daniel's mustard varieties.

review/text: Remember those snack cracker sandwiches you ate as a kid? "Captain's wafers", cheese crackers with peanut butter filling, Club crakers with cheese filling, etc.? My favorite part had always been the cheese in the middle - the salty, slightly-gritty, artificial, cheese-flavored food product.<br /><br />Well, my wish has been granted!<br /><br />The only thing not misleading about the box is the name: When you bite on the crackers, the "cheese" overflows from the sides. Even though the box has the Ritz logo, the crackers taste absolutely nothing like Ritz crackers (which is fine by me because, personally, I never really cared for them). Also, don't be fooled by its tree-hugger packaging or its claim of "all-natural ingredients" (including hydrogenated oils, high fructuse corn syrup, and cheddar cheese powder). It is what it is, and IT IS junkfood.<br /><br />It's also a fun, tasty snack treat that is very addictive. So, put aside any presumptions you may have about an all-natural, healthy Ritz 2.0. If you want something crunchy, not very salty, and "cheesy" (yes, the quotation marks are intentional), then pick up a box at the store.<br /><br />P.S. As much as I love Crackerfuls, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of this price. Why pay $6.67 per box when you could grab some at the grocery for half that? Pickled E, have a little more respect for the consumer. We're not as stupid as you think we are.

review/summary: High fiber, low calorie and quite tasty to boot
review/text: These are really worth trying if there's a sale, but the Amazon price is way too high. Usually such cheese cracker snacks don't make me feel so good afterward, even after just one - don't know why, they don't set well in my stomach and give me heartburn even though I like them. But when I tried these (coupon plus sale...) - no problem at all even if I ate more than one at a sitting, although they really are quite filling so one is generally enough (big crackers, span the width of the box). Don't know what's different about them that makes them not bother me at all, but that's my experience. They definitely taste very good, much better than the usual ones of this type. I tried the cheddar and also the 4 cheese one, same experience with both although I especially like the cheddar. Definitely a lot more cheese filling than in the typical smaller ones. The crackers themselves are quite tasty also, must be the whole grain included. They actually have a decent amount of fiber, if you're looking for an excuse to eat junk food... One big cracker has only 130 calories but 3 grams fiber, which is a very good fiber-to-calorie ratio (I need a lot of fiber or else my innards self-destruct, so I pay attention) and enough to put them in the high-fiber snack category, and as a bonus they aren't sweet (I hate sweet until evening). I keep looking for more sales and coupons! They're too expensive ordinarily at my local grocery store, too, but not as bad as the Amazon price.

review/text: I have been drinking green tea for some time and this gunpowder green is my favorite of the gunpowder variety.  Yes, it is similar to a grass taste (called vegetal) but I like that as do many green tea drinkers.  Basically Sencha is like spinach, Gunpowder is vegetal and Dragonwell is chestnut like. The differences are as great as Darjeeling is to Assam so a little taste testing and brewing knowledge may be required for optimum enjoyment. I like Gunpowder best with near boiling water and steeped for no longer than 1 min. A teaspoon will do for a regular cup but some people like a little less as gunpowder can be strong.

review/text: This is ok.  It's cheaper than the other Numi teas which I like, and you kind of get what you pay for.  It's not that it's bad... it's just that it's not particularly good.<br /><br />2 pounds of the stuff is a lot.  I ended up going through about half of one of the bags, and then giving the other bag to a friend of mine, because he wanted to try some green tea.  So, I have half a bag left, but I'm bored of it... and back to drinking the Numi Jasmine Pearls instead.<br /><br />One tip:  Don't over-infuse it.  You need some sort of tea bag or infuser or something so you can remove the tea from the water.  I find that it gets overly bitter after about 2 minutes, but you can adjust this time to taste.<br /><br />Another tip: if you can use water that's cooler than boiling, you'll get a better cup.  I find that the water that comes out of the hot water dispensers of water coolers is the perfect temperature.

review/summary: The best Green tea I've found!
review/text: I've tried several green teas, both in bags and loose. Numi Organic Temple of Heaven Gunpowder is by far the best. I like everything about it. The taste, the quality packaging to ensure freshness, the price, and the "Gunpowder" pellets-it is easy to measure and know just how much you are actually using. Two pounds lasts me about a month.<br /><br />I drink green tea mainly for the health benefits, which are too numerous to mention here. I drank white tea for quite a while but don't like full leaves because you have big pieces at the top of the bag and powder at the bottom, very inconsistent-if they made a quality white tea like this in Gunpowder form I would likely alternate between that and this tea.<br /><br />I tried another Gunpowder green tea (in the same price range) and compared it to Numi. It was less densely packed and much darker (indicating older tea or over-processing?) with significant extraneous matter in each one pound bag. I will drink this tea forever unless something better (for the price) comes my way but, after experimenting with different teas for about three years, I haven't felt inclined to find something different for at least a year now...<br /><br />I use the "Subscribe and Save" option so I get two 1 lb bags shipped every month for a 15 % discount and free shipping. There are other shipping options as well-up to once every six months.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL98Q">Numi Organic Tea Gunpowder Green - Full Leaf, Loose Leaf, Temple of Heaven Green Tea, 16 oz bag (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: The Best Bulk Organic Gunpowder Green Tea I've Found So Far
review/text: Numi Organic Gunpowder Green Tea has a good strong flavor with full leaves and a dark color when brewed, everything I could ask for... and it's a reasonable price as well. I've only gotten one order, so I can't speak to consistency (although the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N723Q2">Numi  Organic Emperor's Puerh, Loose Leaf Tea, 16 Ounce Bag</a> is also amazing), but for now I'm a fan of Numi bulk teas! I switched from Davidson's to Numi because of Davidson's quality control issues.

review/summary: Nice for the price.
review/text: This tea is pretty decent. When dry, it is grayish-green and smells a little bit like tobacco. Brewed it's mildly astringent with a light smoky-grassy flavor and is golden-yellow in color. I use about a teaspoon for a regular size cup and can re-brew and get two decent cups from it. Proper water temperature is an absolute must. All-in-all a decent tea on a budget. I gave it four stars because it's what I was looking for and what you'd expect for the price.

review/summary: Excellent "every-day" green tea
review/text: This may not be as subtle and flavorful as some more expensive loose-leaf teas, but it fills my needs exactly. I was looking for a good-tasting tea which was organic, fair trade, loose-leaf, and reasonably priced, and this fits the bill. It tastes better than standard bagged green tea, and is much much cheaper. It can handle two steepings, if you don't over-steep. Four minutes seems to be plenty of time to get a decent flavor.

review/summary: Mild But Muddy
review/text: Like many of you, my budget had taken a hit during the Great Recession.  Aiming to save a few dollars<br />I bought the gunpowder green tea, which is, admittedly, very reasonably priced.  The tea was so muddy<br />in flavor the first time I brewed it, that I ended up changing my water filter.  That helped a little, still<br />the tea remained unusually muddy; despite it being green tea, there was little of the familiar<br />seaweedy, grassy notes and more of a darker, earthier taste, as well as a strong vegetal component.<br /><br />For a few dollars more, the Monkey King Jasmine Green is far superior.  It's clearer in flavor and far<br />more delightful.

review/summary: SMOKY BUT FLAVORFUL
review/text: We had previously purchased a lot of loose oolong tea.  We couldn't wait to use it up.  No matter how strong we made it, it was flavorless.  This green tea (as in very healthy) has a distictive smoky and green flavor.  It is something of an acquired taste, but we enjoy it.  It also unfurls to make a large infuserfull with just about a tablespoon of leaves which can make 4 16 oz mugs of tea.

review/text: Overall, the kit was great and easy to use.  Would have rated it 5 stars except for the casings.  They were very small and almost not useable.  Fortunately, I had other casings and some collagen casings that I was able to use.  The sweet and spicy were good but I like even "more heat" in snack sticks.  The hickory were very good but if I used this kit again, would add more pepper and garlic powder.  Like about a tsp of each.  Depending on the type of meat you use, you need to add some binder like about 2/3 cup of soy protein powder for a 7.5 lb batch (available at Trader Joes).  Definitely would recommend this kit.

review/text: There was much to read as to labels and ingredients of this sausage kit. We were disappointed to find MSG in the Italian sausage mix or else this would have received five stars. Before buying this product I read all I could find on what was in these packages without success. The casings and the instructions for the casings were easy to understand. They were easy to install on the sausage tube of the grinder. But the Italian sausage mix has MSG.

I used to use larger ones that held 3 lbs of meat, but prefer these smaller ones because they fit slightly less than a pound each and you can experiment with smaller amounts of sausage at a time.  Made 20 sausages at this point, with only one casing ever breaking on me (though I admit I may have stuffed it too tightly). I'll definitely buy again.

review/summary: Pretty good for what I needed, as far as I can tell
review/text: My biggest complaint about this product is that they don't give you any guideline as to how many you should give your cat daily. I know that they can't say specifically, because it would probably depend on the issue you are trying to treat, but if they could at least say give anywhere from 10-100000 a day in general that would help out a LOT. The vet I most recently went to was the typical all about the money man who milks every person for every dime he can & quite frankly shouldn't have been working with cats in the first place (he was obviously uncomfortable handling them). When I asked him about fiber options the ONLY thing he recommended was a Science Diet food that he was getting high dollar paid for selling (they are known for pushing that brand at their office) I had to research on my own to find these treats & when I called them about possibly getting an idea of how many to feed daily of course they had no idea. All I can say about most vets these days is one word- GREED!<br /><br />My cat likes the treats- she will eat pretty much any treat though so this was no surprise. I don't know if they are working properly because I got them to help her go to the bathroom more often due to her anal gland issues but so far I haven't noticed if they are doing anything for her.

Within 12 hours of eating the treats, my elderly cat went to the bathroom.  She was like a new cat and was obviously feeling a ton better.  Thank you, Fiber Formula, for helping my poor cat.  I would highly recommend these treats to any cat owner, especially one whose cat is having issues with constipation.

review/summary: Kitty loves these
review/text: Wow, my cat loves these.... well, for a week... hard to say what'll happen next week ;)<br /><br />So on flavor/desire alone this is a winner... as far as results? I've been having broader issues with her constipation which I attributed to her thyroid meds and diet swings (she's suddenly no longer interested in her "favorite" foods so I'm trying to find some new favorites for her but this means she's getting less water, less food, and her poops are therefore rare and dense... working on it!)<br /><br />I'd get these again just on appeal alone!

review/summary: Nutritional
review/text: I asked my Vet if this type of cat treat would be good for my cat, Mischa.  He said it was one of the more nutritional treats to give to cats.<br /><br />Mischa loves his little fishie's.  That is what they look like.  So I would recommend this product for any cat owner.<br /><br />Sharon

review/summary: my cat loves these
review/text: My cat doesn't like any of the typical grocery store type cat treats.  However, I discovered that he just loves these fiber treats. He actually cries for them every morning...now I have to make sure I don't run out of these.  He's 15 years old and I figure the fiber can't hurt either.

review/summary: Great Candy
review/text: The candy was fresh, and tasted great.  I've heard that other sellers are selling stale candy, or candy that has clumped together, but this candy was perfect.  Its not always easy to find this candy in stores, so this is great for anyone who enjoys this treat, and it seems to keep for awhile.  There are six resealable pouches. Each pouch is pretty big.  I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys Reese's Pieces.
