review/text: Mix Carnation Chocolate Malted Milk with a good quality vanilla (not French vanilla)ice cream and whole milk, blend thoroughly and you will be rewarded with the best chocolate malt ever !<br />I will be buying by the case in the future due to the difficulty in finding it on grocery store shelves. Reminds me of the loss of Tang Instant Grapefruit Drink Mix, Birdseye Hawaiian and Japanese International Vegetables and Stouffers Swiss Cheese Crepes. Gone but not forgotten !

review/text: I'd combed every supermarket in reasonable distance from home and could not find the malt I remembered from Carnation to make real malted milks.  Then I saw it on Amazon at a reasonable price.  It's just as I remembered -- my malted milks are smooth and delicious.  Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: The malt shoppe lives
review/text: I assume those readers who enjoyed malted milks in their formative years would jump at the chance to re-create the taste of the drink (any flavor-- you choose) and the feeling of profound nostalgia when you taste that first sip of an ice cream malted milk shake. This drink had magical properties. Individually, there's milk (low-fat or regular), flavored syrup and, of course, the magic Malted Milk that transforms a glass of milk with favoring into a unique concoction that so permeates your youth, it comes back with that first sip. When I ordered a malt from the "malt" shop, I made sure that (1) the soda jerk used real malted milk---not just milk, syrup and ice cream (a mllk shake)==and not the liquid malt which is no doubt cheaper to use but in no way matched the flavor of the real thing. I worked my way through college at a "malt shop" which was the generic term for an ice cream parlor. If my boss didn't use malted milk--Carnation Malted Milk--I heckled him until he did.<br />Thanks to the magic the internet this drink can be reproduced just as I made it back in Frosty Bossy in San Francisco.

review/summary: Same as Grandpa made
review/text: This product is exactly as I remember it from when my father made malted milks for my kids. They are all grown now, but have repeatedly asked if we couldn't please find the powder he used. I looked everywhere, including the company website, without any luck. Only breakfast powder was available, and that definitely wasn't it. When I found this on Amazon I was delighted, and we were all taken back a few decades when we tried it out. The taste is exactly the same(I know this is very subjective but it worked for us, and we added stuff like ice cream and vanilla), it dissolves easily even in cold milk, and makes a very smooth milkshake. A hit in our house.

review/text: I've been looking for malt for a very long time, it is pretty hard to find it stores, so I finally ordered this. My only problem with it is that I have to use a lot if I really want a malty taste. I think next time I might try to get a pure malt rather than a malt/milk mixture but it does taste really nice. I put it on ice cream and in hot chocolate.

review/summary: Good Malt Mix............
review/text: Amazon once again did us good on their part. Now we're making super malts for me, grandma and the grandbabies. The kids absolutely love coming to grandpa's house for malts. Now this is a malted milk mix, not 100% malt. But great malts you'll have with no milk added, vanilla ice cream only, with malt mix, vanilla extract and Hersey's syrup. Milkshakes, add ice cream plus milk and you'll have great milkshakes. We've done vanilla malts & shakes, grandma's favorite. Chocolate malts & shakes, grandpa's favorite. Caramel malts & shakes, my little buddy's favorite and strawberry malts & shakes my little girl's favorite. Oh, we'll be trying other flavors in due time..... We use the best ice cream, Blue Bell... It all works out best with a great blender, a stainless malt jar and using a malt blade. This is some WOW stuff, I tell ya...................

review/text: It used to be, when I was young, that you could go into a local candy store and sit at the counter and get a malted milk shake.  Today, there seems to be no candy stores, just ice cream palaces who make a "milk shake" , which, really, is just glorified chocolate milk.  With the absence of malt powder from the supermarket shelves, I thought that that taste was gone from my mouth forever.  But no!!!  Here it is, available at a good price, waiting to be delivered to, and used by you to bring back the taste and texture of malted milk shakes!  and for those who have never tasted a malted milk shake, well, what are you waiting for?

review/summary: Lots of malted milk powder but the taste?
review/text: My local supermarket in charlotte, NC, used to carry carnation malted milk powder and it could be added to make a great old fashioned milk shake.  But it is not available in charlotte now so I went to Amazon which did have it, in fact 3 large containers for a very reasonable price including shipping.  It looks the same but when I added several spoonfuls to my chocolate shake it did not seem to have the malted milk taste like you get with good quality malted milk balls.  Not sure if the product has changed or my memory thinks it used to taste better.  I did visit my daugher's family in Rhode Island recently and we got malts at the local ice cream shop and that was what got me started on this project.  So that is why I am only rating this 3 starts, not a wow flavor as I had remembered it.  Also I now have a lot of malt powder and would like to send one to my daughter but the US Postal wanted $9 to ship one container so nix that.

Both flavors used to come in glass containers.  Since Carnation switched to plastic, the quantity you get for the money has decreased but that also applies to cereal, snacks, etc.

review/summary: NOT Bread
review/text: This was supposed to be pretzel bread that you can make in your bread machine.  Instead it is pretzel mix, that you can use your bread machine to combine, but then you have to shape the pretzels by hand and finish in your oven.  Very misleading!!!!

review/summary: Won't Buy Again!
review/text: This pretzel mix and its mixing/baking instructions leave a lot to be desired.  The mixing/baking instructions are printed so small that even with good eyesight, I needed a magnifying glass to read them.  Instructions were confusing to say the least in that it talks about pouring the yeast packet into a small bowl and adding a cup of warm water, mix well before adding to dry mix.  There was no yeast package in the box I was working with nor any of the other three boxes that I opened.  Just to confirm that the yeast had not already been added to the dry mix and the instructions had not been updated accordingly, I called the company and asked.  They informed that there should have been a seperate yeast package in each box.  They then offered to send me four packages of yeast to replace what I was obviously going to have to buy before I could make up the mixes.  To date, I've not received anything from this company albeit it has been nearly three weeks since I called them.  Thankfully, I had one package of yeast on hand so that I could continue with my immediate baking project.  There is also no salt in the mix which renders a very bland tasting pretzel notwithstanding the coarse salt sprinkled on the tops.  For those on a low to no sodium diet, this pretzel mix might be ideal for you.  As for brushing the formed pretzel with warm baking soda water after placing on the baking pan, I am convinced this procedure contributed to the burned bottoms.  Yes, the oven temp was exactly as per the baking instructions as was the bake time.  The instructions do not recommend brushing the pretzels with a small amount of lightly beaten egg white which allows the sprinkled on top coarse salt to adhere much better than just brushing with the baking soda water.  I have three more boxes of this mix to use and I intend to modify the mixing/baking instructions to match a much better made from scratch "old world" receipe for pretzels that calls for both a bit of salt and dunking the formed pretzels in near boiling baking soda water for 20 seconds.  Once you lift the pretzels from the water with a slotted spatula or similar utensil, the baking soda water drips from the pretzel.  I've never had burned pretzel bottoms using this method.  The oven temp and bake time will also be adjusted.  Was just trying to find a mix that could reduce the number of ingredients needed to be kept on hand for the "old world" receipe as well as to alleviate some of the mixing since my hands are becoming very arthritic.  Bummer.

review/summary: not pretzel-esque... but AMAZING bread sticks +++
review/text: What we really love about this "soft pretzel bread" mix is its versatility.  It makes great fresh bread sticks... plus "baked surprises"... we roll it out, cut it with a large circle cookie cutter and then fill it with ... well... anything and everything.  and each ball of goodness (we have used a chicken alfredo filling, a mixture of shredded cheeses, as well as an egg salad) comes out fabulous.<br /><br />I tend to crimp the edges to make them more like half moons.. but the grand children bring the sides to the top,  making it a ball with a small ball on top (of the edges that are twisted to seal)... then after baking they (the balls)  end up looking like mini snow men, or ducks (depending on which child created the pop-over)<br /><br />Whenever these are in stock we stock up.

review/text: This would probably be good made as soft pretzels or as per the directions, but it said bread machine friendly, so i assumed it would make a pretzel bread. WRONG. you have to make the dough in the bread machine, then roll out the dough, let it rise, twist into pretzels, soak in baking oda water, then boil and bake. not worth it. go to auntie anne's

review/summary: Excellent base for an amazing (healthy!) meal!
review/text: I love this organic cous cous. We try to only eat organic. This is so quick and easy to prepare - just heat water to boiling (I do it in the microwave in a pyrex measuring cup), stir in the cous cous, cover and let sit for a few minutes. Fluff, done! Our daughter likes it plain with salt and a bit of olive oil blended in. I like adding a nice sauce with vegetables over the cous cous (such as the delicious 5-minute Indian dish, Tasty Bite Jaipur Vegetables, that I also buy on Amazon). Also wonderful with legumes of any kind, or served with chicken or fish as a nice change of pace from rice or pasta. I hope that Amazon carries it again soon. Your get a lot of servings in each box so it is healthy, delicious, and a good value. My only complaint -- and this is not the fault of the product -- is that the case we recently received had an expiration date only 2 months out. Most products are still good past the posted dates, and we like it so I'm sure we will manage to eat it before it goes stale, but Amazon should be more careful with their stock control.

review/text: I find this goes quite well with a bit of lemon juice. The price is surprisingly low and quality seems fine. I'm used to $4 to $15 per ounce for various white teas, never purchasing more than a few ounces at a time. I find myself drinking much more now and will likely be ordering another pound in the next couple weeks. I may order Davidson's silver needles variant at some point to see how it compares to the $200 per pound silver needles I'd grown used to from other sources, but for now I'm quite content with this.<br /><br />March 4, 2011 edit: I just logged on after getting my second shipment to leave a positive review, and noticed that I already had three months ago. I continue to enjoy it on a daily basis, steeping at 160 degrees F for 2 minutes and adding nothing more than perhaps a bit of lemon. I've yet to feel a need to try their more expensive white tea.

review/summary: seems to help avoid hypoglycemia, but cloying! Yuk!
review/text: Although Glucerna seems to help avoid low blood glucose, it is sweet, sweet, sweet! And, ironically, full of things that are otherwise bad for you, like transfat and palm oil, and little that is good. Another brand of diabetic snack bar is not likely to be worse, and almost certainly would be better. The makers of this bar don't care about our health: just our money.

review/text: These are so wonderful, once you have one you'll never forget them.  If you avoid carbs like I do, but miss the crunch of chips, these sesame cheese crisps are the best.  I like the regular parmesan crisps too, but the sesame adds great crunch and texture and fills me up more.  It also mellows out the slight bitterness of the regular parmesan crisps.  I highly recommend these.

review/summary: Could be tastier; cinnamon bunches BAD
review/text: Post Honey Bunches of Oats with Cinnamon Bunches leaves a lot to be desired. The product was shipped in a large box that crammed the many (seven or more) boxes in and in such a way that contents of one box was crushed and the box itself was flattened. I didn't bother to report this as it would take too much time. But maybe I will since the cereal itself is so BLAH. The cinnamon bunches are so tiny I can barely find them and they have NO TASTE.<br /><br />Time to search for another cereal but first I have to eat the seven boxes I purchased. By the way, I understand boxes are packed by weight, but these boxes are larger than anything I've ever purchased and they do not fit in my cabinets. Where to store?<br /><br />Eileen in NYC

review/summary: Best Aspartame-free gum
review/text: This is really the best aspartame-free gum that's out there.  It tastes good.  The flavor lasts a long time.  The biggest thing with this compared to other "natural" gum is that it doesn't disintegrate after 15 minutes.  In fact, I haven't been able to chew it long enough to find the disintegration point.  Two other aspartame-free xylitol gum brands disintegrate after 15 minutes.  I hope they keep making this.  I'll keep looking for it and buying it.

Gjetost is made from a blend of cow's milk and super-nutritious goat milk.<br /><br />It has a slighly sweet disposition which comes from carmelizing the sugars in the blended milks.<br /><br />This cheese is an excellent morning starter. It has a concentration of natural sugars in it (most Norwegian dairy products are organic even if they are not labeled so).<br /><br />My fiance has to go to her Norwegian church in New York to get this delicacy as you usually cannot find it anywhere in the U.S..

review/summary: I liked it at first...
review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/text: This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.
