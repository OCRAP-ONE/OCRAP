review/summary: The best tea that Tao of Tea offers...
review/text: Hands down, this is my favorite tea that Tao of Tea offers.  For those familiar with Pu-erh, it tastes very similar to Xia Guan 2004 100 gram toucha in my opinion.  I love that tea as well.  They both offer a sweet green taste with enough of a "bite" that you notice it.  I would recommend this tea highly to those looking for a really unique green tea experience.  As a side note, it is obviously much cheaper than buying a slightly aged pu-erh toucha.

review/summary: Tastes like an Orange Creme Pop. Without any dripping.
review/text: Since I was a kid, I've been a fan of Stewarts Orange Creme Soda and the real Orange Creme Pops at your local grocer and ice cream truck.<br />So when I saw this, I didn't think twice about buying it.<br /><br />If you're looking for one of the best flavors you can find in a candy gum, without added sugar, try Extra's Dessert Delights Orange Creme Pop flavor. Years ago, the only sugar free flavor was mint. These days, it seems anything is possible with the technology of artificial flavors and man made chemicals. Amazing flavor that brings back great memories of better days. The orange Creme pop flavor is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys the real thing. This is the kind of gum I eat the whole pack of in one mouthful. Delicious.

review/summary: Tastes like a Creamsicle
review/text: For a sugarfree gum, this stuff is really tasty. It has an intense flavor at first that softens into a more subtle orange cream taste. It lasts pretty long, but I've had gum that's lasted longer. It'll definitely make your breath smell good though.<br /><br />This is my favorite, and probably the most accurate, of all the extra dessert flavors. The mint chocolate chip doesn't taste much like mint or chocolate to me although it is refreshing, and the strawberry shortcake is so sweet it hurts my mouth. But they definitely got this one right on the money.

review/summary: Pretty nice!
review/text: I got a pack of these today and I have to say, I'm pretty pleased with this flavor.<br /><br />I'll admit that it's been a long time since I've had a real orange creme pop (milk allergies), so all I have to go on is what I seem to remember them tasting like. For the most part, it resembles a mixture of an orange creme pop and orange Tang. There's more of an orange flavor here than a creamy flavor, with an aftertaste that just reminds me of orange Tang. Since I like Tang, this really isn't that bad.<br /><br />Since the key audience for this will be people on a diet, this will be a well received flavor.It still has a bit of a faint chemical taste to it and the flavor wears off rather quickly, but it's not bad for something to pop in your mouth when you're having a craving.

As a diabetic, this is one of the few gums that I can chew without raising my blood sugar.<br />As with all sugarless gums, if it has xylitol as an ingredient, keep it away from your pets. It is extremely bad for them.<br />This does not, but this is for human consumption. Enjoy it-I do!

review/summary: The best mild curry on the market. Period.
review/text: I have been using Ship brand for a long time. Once I tried it I have never used any other. I find the flavor mild in the sense that it allows the flavor of vegetables to come through...they are not washed out into a single, bland curry flavor. I use this is many stews and soups and I can trust that the quality is consistent. It has the perfect level of spice without going over the top.

review/text: If you're going to buy curry powder in this quantity, and don't plan on opening an Indian restaurant, you can't let the powder be exposed to air or else by the time you get to use it, it's going to taste like sand.  Very disappointed to discover that every single one of the cans in this package was severely dented upon arrival.  Also, the curry powder is really not that great tasting.  I was expecting miracles, I guess.  Come to find out, there is no replacement for toasting your own whole spices and then running them through a spice grinder right before using them (and if there is, Ship Madras Curry Powder is not it).  Curry powder is not really that hard to make anyway.

review/text: These are all natural, gluten free, low in fat and calories (130 calories and 3 grams of fat per serving) and they taste great.  Simply put I love everything about these chips.  The only problem with them is that they're definitely addicting and I want to eat them all the time.  I guess it's a good thing they're such a good deal here on Amazon (much cheaper than at my local grocery store).<br /><br />The texture is somewhat similar to a rice cake, except that it's much thinner so it has a better crunch to it.  They taste like salted popcorn minus the annoying hulls and un-popped kernels.

review/text: We discovered these when my husband bought a bag of the Sea Salt flavor at a convenience store. I loved them so I came to Amazon to get a case. This Butter flavor was a few dollars less than the other flavors so I got it.<br />The flavor is divine at first, but I can only eat about 5 chips before my mouth shrivels up from the overpowering saltiness. I did not experience that when eating the Sea Salt flavor.<br />I will probably order PopCorners again, but DEFINITELY NOT the Butter variety. I will stick with the Sea Salt kind.

These taste great and have a nice satisfying crunch just like chips do but are much better for me.  My only complaint is that the butter flavor sometimes leaves a funny aftertaste in my mouth.  I've also tried the sea salt flavor and the white cheddar flavor.  Neither of those leave an aftertaste.  My favorite is the white cheddar flavor.

review/summary: My new favorite!
review/text: I've tried all the Popcorner flavors, and for a while I was completely addicted to the cheddar ones, but now the Sea Salt ones are my absolute favorites.<br /><br />They taste very similar to tortilla chips or baked corn chips- but with a slightly airy texture. And the salt is divine- I LOVE salty things, so the extra sprinkle of salt is much appreciated. These are light, airy, healthy snacks that pack the same punch as a treat that wouldn't be as kind to your body. They truly satisfy a craving for crispy and salty snacks without making you feel as if you liked a giant crystal of salt and scorched your mouth (the drawback to eating Fritos...)<br /><br />Here's a tip though- since the salt isn't baked into the chip or coated on with oils, it's best to REALLY shake the bag of Popcorners before eating- that way all the salt that had settled on the bottom of the bag get sprinkled back on the chips.<br /><br />Great everyday treat that satisfies and doesn't make you feel parched and guilty for indulging. My whole family loves them.

It always gets stuck in the teeth or in the back of your throat. Not with Pop Corners, here you can eat and eat and never have anything get stuck or choke you. I love it, and I wish I could keep buying it. Sea Salt is my all time favorite and I try to get it as much as I possible can afford it. Buying by the case made it great, having as much as I want, when I want it, but it can get a bit expensive. But when the time is right I will be buying more to enjoy.

review/summary: The only problem is, after the first bite, you cannot stop.
review/text: I'm never a fan of popcorn. Hate the chewiness, grease and the sugary flavors. But this bag of Popcorners is no typical popcorn. First of all, I purchased it on line, attracted by the packaging of course (one really eat with the eyes!), which jumps out of the usual bright pink or yellow colors you see when it comes to popcorns. Also thinking it might be just an alternation of "baked chips," already quite popular in the market. Even after I received it, I still thought "The wrapping's really lovely. But I'm just gonna try out a bite...".<br /><br />The only problem was, I couldn't stop after the first bite. Who knew something so simple, with only three ingredients for this flavor, could be this sensational? It's crispy yet thick in the texture. The size of each piece is not too big nor too small. The natural scent of corn is just delightful to the palate. Don't need to lick the fingers....I'm completely amazed and will be venturing into the other flavors. This is one snack food I'd be munching out. Ditch the bags of chips at lunch, try this!

If it had been one of the others, I may have never eaten them again. I've tried the Butter (way too salty) and Kettle (too sweet). So, I went back to Sea Salt and stayed there. My favorite thing about them is there are only 3 ingredients all of which you can pronounce.

I love popcorn, popcorn regretfully does not return my feelings.Every time my housemate makes popcorn,which is frequently, the smell makes me nuts.

review/summary: Popcorn lovers -- you really should try this
review/text: I love popcorn but after trying these, I don't know if I should ever bother popping corn again.  The taste of these is wonderful and I really like the crunchiness of the chip.  Best of all, however, one can have them anytime by simply opening a bag.  While popcorn can be popped, stored and eaten later, good as it is, it is never quite as good as it is freshly-popped.  These taste great however, and I would rank them very close to freshly popped popcorn -- add convenience and crunch and they pull ahead in my eyes.<br />Note that I am really basing my comparison on the Kettlecorn variety so I, perhaps, shouldn't be comparing it to plain popcorn, but I would rate this against regular kettlecorn similarly, and I suspect that the regular popcorn varieties would hold their own.<br /><br />The additional sugar in the Kettlecorn version weighs in at only 3g in a one-ounce serving so despite the great taste, it isn't exactly drenched in sugar.  If you love Kettlecorn or popcorn, you should give PopCorners a try.

review/text: My family loves Popcorners and the kettle variety has become our favorite movie snack. We think it tastes even better than actual kettle corn.  The serving sizes are fairly small so one bag doesn't go far.  At only 100 calories per serving it is a great, healthy snack. These have become a staple in our gluten free household.

review/text: I have a small single cup coffee maker for those times when I need a quick cup of coffee but don't want a whole pot.  All right, that doesn't happen very often - I can usually handle a whole pot.  But when I want a quick cup, I don't want to be grinding beans, getting out a filter and going through all the same steps as making a whole pot.  These filter packs are the perfect solution at a great price!  The coffee is almost as good as Starbucks for a fraction of the price.

review/summary: Not Stage 3 Quality. Very thin
review/text: I use jar foods when I am on the go or if I did not have time to leave the babysitter food. I made a majority of my twins food from scratch using the baby bullet, a chopper or just by mashing it. Now that my twins are 11months they have been eating table food. I was excited to see that Earth's best made Stage 3 foods.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Particular Stage 3 option (Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Chunky Orchard Fruit, 6-Ounce Jars) is not Stage 3 quality. It is very thin comparable to the Stage 2 food. It does have a few small tiny tiny pieces of fruit in it but nothing compared to the other stage 3 thicknesses. Seeing as my twins are used to have bigger thicker pieces of food they eat the food off the spoon so quickly.<br />As with all Earth's best I love the quality of the food and my twins love the taste. However, I would not have purchased if I knew it would be so thin.

review/text: I love Earth's Best and I was a little weary of ordering it online. But, everything was great and just what I would expect from this brand. I do have to say that it was not as chunky as I thought it would be. My son is almost 10 months old (only has 2 bottom teeth) and he is somewhat picky about textures, so I mix it with oatmeal and he is a happy camper.

She can eat cereal, which she usually has for breakfast with fruit, however she's gotten bored with it. I got her some of these Earth's Best Oatmeals, which adds some variety to her breakfasts. She seems to like it a lot. I heat it up for 20 seconds in the microwave to make it warm oatmeal. I like the fact that this oatmeal has a lot of iron in it, which is necessary for a growing toddler!!

review/summary: Disgusting! :(
review/text: I bought this for my baby (since she didn't have teeth at the time) thinking that it would be a good source of iron. Unfortunately, the ingredients did not mention that there are RAISINS in this product. The combination of apples, raisins and cinnamon is not a good idea at all. My baby actually started gagging when I put a spoonful in her mouth. When I tasted it myself, I felt like doing the same. This mixture is just too sweet because of the raisins. There is also a very strong flavor of cinnamon. I usually add some cinnamon to the food she eats so I know that she likes cinnamon if its in a normal quantity. I tried diluting the flavor in several ways, but it's no use. The cinnamon flavor was still too strong. I still have about 8 more jars to experiment with. I'm thinking I'll give it one more try by mixing apple puree with a little bit of this mixture and see if the baby will take it or not. Otherwise, it's all going in the trash. I hate wasting food but there doesn't seem to be another option.

Remember, like any food product, the liquid separates sometimes and you just have to stir the food.  No big deal.  Problem solved.  If you still have an issue with it, I would recommend adding a few drops of water or formula to the food. Then stir again.

review/summary: Simple, different
review/text: After a weekend of having my new Senseo coffee maker I can report that it is a delight. I certainly do not consider myself a connoisseur of coffee, but spending on average $30 a week at Starbucks makes me at least an average coffee consumer.<br /><br /> To agree with other reviewers, the taste is not comparable to a freshly-made Starbucks. The Senseo is what it is-a home coffee maker under $70. Starbucks not only controls every element of the process, but uses significantly more sophisticated equipment. Importantly, the Senseo is worth the money.<br /><br /> As a work-at-home businessperson I enjoy having a fresh cup on my desk. The frothy result of the Senseo simulates a latte when you add hot milk to the final cup of coffee. (Never put milk in the Senseo!)<br /><br /> The dark roast is my favorite, but I find that I have to switch to the medium roast decaf after the first cup to keep from bouncing off the walls.<br /><br /> As I said, it will not equally substitue for a fresh Starbucks, but it is fast, enjoyable and easy to use. If the cost of the pods is not an issue then it makes perfect sense.

review/summary: Full-flavored Decaf!
review/text: I recently bought a Senseo machine and the Douwe Egberts Coffee pods.  The pods make a full-flavored decaf that is very enjoyable.  I agree the medium roast and mild roast are weak sisters compared to the dark roast.  <p>Medium is what several of my guests prefer, however.  I use the dark for myself and they all make a very good cuppa joe. MUCH better than my drip machine, and a lot easier to use than my espresso maker.

review/summary: Simply Amazing!
review/text: I was so skeptical of this product that I had to write a review for the rest of the skeptics. This is a fabulous way to get a european coffee experience at home. I'm not a huge fan of Starbucks, I find their coffee too bitter, but like everyone else I truck over there spending close to $4.00 a cup on a specialty latte. This is different. This is like the coffee I had every morning in Provence. It has great flavor and the frothy top is something you could never get with your regular coffee maker. I love that I can do one cup at a time, so my coffee isn't sitting on the warming plate losing its flavor until I'm ready for another cup. It froths itself, so you don't have to deal with complicated and hard to clean steaming mechanisms. It takes a minute to boil the water and then less than 30 seconds to fill the cup, which is much quicker than making regular coffee. It is easy to put together, take apart and clean; in fact, when I was comparing the similar-looking Mr. Coffee and Black and Decker brands in the store I couldn't get those two models back together after I looked at the pod holder, which cinched the decision for me on the Senseo (which has a very simple press-down locking mechanism). I'm so glad!!! I haven't tried the dark roast yet, but we love the medium and the decaf, and the mild is nice for afternoon. I was worried about the cost of the pods until I realized that a bag of 18 is under $4.00, which is like 22 cents a pod. When I balance that against $1.00-$4.00 a cup to get anything remotely similar from a coffeehouse, it seems like the bargain of the century. And I don't have to change out of my pjs! If you are a coffee lover I highly recommend this wonderful, unique machine.

review/text: I must respectfully disagree with the other reviewer.  The Medium Roast coffee I received with my Senseo produces a teriffic cup of coffee.  For a coffee shop like taste, go with the dark roast, but the Medium Roast is perfect for an every day morning blend.

review/summary: Great Cup of Coffee - Less Caffeine
review/text: I have had my Senseo for a little over a week.  I agree with most of the other reviewers, that it is the best coffee I have made at home.  I enjoy having several mugs of coffee in the morning, but want to cut back on the caffeine.  I have found that using one pod of medium roast (or dark roast) and one pod of medium roast Decaf together works really well for an 8 oz mug of great tasting coffee.

review/summary: Wow!  Finally coffee I can make!
review/text: Let me just say that I am so impressed with the Senseo machine.  I can never get coffee tasting just right, so the pod system really attracted me.  I kept debating between the Senseo and the HomeCafe.  It was a demo of the senseo that made me decide to go with it.  The Senseo brews a nice small cup of coffee that is nice and frothy.  It gives you the sensation of a cappuccino or latte after adding a little milk.  I adore the mild roast and the decaf roast.  I finally can have a great tasting cup of coffee whenever I want it!  It's perfect if you're a college student!

review/summary: Weak flavored coffee
review/text: Although I love the convenience of this coffee maker, I have been very disappointed by the flavor of the decaf coffee.  The coffee brews beautifully, creating an appealing frothy "crema" at the top.  However, the coffee itself is very bland.<br /><br />I keep hoping that Senseo will introduce a "bold" decaf option.  My husband, who drinks caffeinated coffee, quite enjoys their "bold" coffee pods.  In the meanwhile, I circumvent the problem by using two decaf coffee pods, while selecting the one cup option.  It concentrates the coffee, which significantly improves the flavor.  It bothers me, though, that I'm paying "twice" for one cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the reviews, it seems like a lot of people enjoy the decaf coffee, as it is.  However, if you enjoy a more intense, bold tasting coffee, you will need to use two pods to get some approximation of a distinct coffee flavor.

review/summary: Watered Down Taste
review/text: I recently received my new Senseo single brew coffee machine, and eagerly brewed my first cup using 2 decaf pods, which is the medium roast without the caffeine. Also, because I wanted a full mug, I needed to use 2 pods. I was so disappointed to find it was very weak and tasted so watered down. I like a pretty strong cup of coffee. Definitely not in the espresso range, but this was WEAK and had almost no flavor. So, thanks to Senseo's generosity, to my relief and delight I found a complimentary 18-pod pack of the dark roast inside the box in which the coffee maker came. I took one pod of the dark roast and one pod of the decaf and combined them. This, I was hoping, would taste closer to how I like it while still only getting half the caffeine. And voila! It turned out perfect. Now, just add some hazelnut creamer and enjoy the garden with a great cup of freshly brewed coffee.

review/text: I love the Senseo medium roast coffee.  The decaf was said to be the same only without the caffine.  So I was so excited to receive my order this weekend.  However I was soon disapointed as it had a sort of burnt carmel flavor.  I guess I will have to drink the caffine and limit myself because the whole reason to use coffee pods for me is to get a fresh cup every time; not one that tastes like it has burnt setting on a warmer too long.

review/text: Senseo coffee pods are our favorite because of the coffee fullness and the fact that they are real coffee in paper filter pods vs plastic pods other single serve coffee makers use.  We like the Columbian and Expresso for morning, but late in the day prefer decaf coffee and and the Senseo decaf is as full flavored and pleasing as the caffeine coffee pods.  A nice way to end the day.

Just the right balance in terms of strength -- not so strong that it feels like it dissolving your teeth, but not dishwater either. Just right!<br /><br />Of course, with all pod coffee systems you're paying for the convenience, so the price is higher than conventional blends in a bag. But the subscribe and save program knocks a few bucks off, so I find it to be a decent value for the benefits gained.

review/text: We got our Senseo after having the coffee at a cafe. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but the aroma and flavor really caught me. The dark roast is our fav, but the $$ of the pods is a bit daunting. Went on line looking for a solution. There is a "pod maker" you can purchase, but it's cost doesn't help the cost. I finally found a site that shows you how to "build" your pod using cheap, white coffee filters and the pod holder that comes with the Senseo. Works great and you can find the perfect coffee that fits your taste instead of having to settle for whatever the store has in stock at the moment! Go on line and explore the alternatives. With the Senseo's great brewing method it makes it doubly delightful!
