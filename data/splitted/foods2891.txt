review/summary: The Best Choice
review/text: Our family just loves having Nova-sliced salmon. It is all good, but the ACME brand is your best choice because of the ratio of oil to fish, the delightful smokey taste it offers and the price is certainly competitive too.

review/summary: Good but shipping could make it much cheaper at the grocery store
review/text: Nova salmon is a mild version of lox. Acme is a high quality product and is smooth and delicious on bagels. At the local grocery stores this runs just under six dollars for a four oz bag. This must be packaging four bags together to get to the one pound amount quoted. That makes it a good price at twenty dollars but be sure the shipping charges make it worthwhile.

review/summary: Phenomenal Product
review/text: Since this product's launch my cat has been hooked.  He gets the best of the best and the Fancy Feast Medleys line is most assuredly that (I purchase all but the soufle varieties, which my cat seems to not care for as much).  In my local stores, a 12-pack of this would run me anywhere from $10 - $13.  It was worth that expense, but finding them on Amazon definitely has been a huge savings to me!  the subscribe and save option is perfect - I pay just a few dollars more for 24 cans than I would have for half that!  I won't even consider purchasing these in a store again - so long as Amazon has this phenomenal price and program, they have my business.<br /><br />On a side note - if you haven't ever seen these in person, the food actually looks quasi-edible for humans!  I take pride in serving my cat these, knowing he's getting a tasty and nutrious snack.  Also, though my cat doesn't care for the soufle variety, I know plenty that do.  Try them all and find Your cat's favorites!

review/text: My cats took to this food immediately; all 4 of them basically inhale it whenever I set it out.  I have since started feeding them "all natural" premium wet food, but still keep this around for an occasional treat since they like it so much.  You can actually see the long grain rice in it, and at first I thought my cats would not eat that - but those are the pieces they seem to like best.

review/text: I just cancelled my subscription for this.  The last box I opened did not have the  flavors count the label claims.  Half of the cans were turkey.  The turkey flavor has seemed to be adding up in my cabinet.  Now I suspect it's because I have been receiving more of the turkey flavor than of the tuna and chicken.  If you are going to be buying this, check when you open the box to see if it really is the variety of flavors you wanted to buy.  The cat likes these flavors but I'll be buying individual cans.

review/text: I bought these to put into my 4 year old's lunches since she is not a big eater and she needs the protein.

They kind of have remind me of Humbles Hummus Chips, so not as good as real potato chips, but a passable alternative.

review/summary: Highly recommended
review/text: Ferrara Pan Candy Company was founded in 1900, in Chicago, Illinois. In 1962, the company hit on a new great tasting candy - Lemonheads. Tart and sweet at the same time, it was a huge success, and a staple of the company. Later, the company spread out, making several other flavors of the candy, including Cherryheads (which were originally known as Cherry Chans and then Cherry Clans).<br /><br />Cherryheads are delicious, little red candies that are sweet and tart, and have that great cherry taste. Admittedly they are not as sour as the newer super-sour candies, but too many of those other candies just give you a wave of tasteless super-sour, and then you get to eat the super-sweet candy. With Cherryheads, you get a nice flavor of tart cherries, especially if you chew on them (which I recommend :-).<br /><br />When I was growing up in the Chicagoland area, Ferrara Pan candies were a staple of every kids diet. Now, eating Cherryheads takes me back to my childhood. Buy Cherryheads and enjoy a great candy. I highly recommend them!

review/summary: Only for the strong of heart!
review/text: I was overwhelmed by this tea, it is potent, which is good and bad, the good being the probable high quality and purity of the root used, the bad being that I could not tolerate it, every sip was unpleasant, and I had to force myself to drink even half of the cup thinking I would adjust to the flavor after awhile.  Then I tried some honey in it and it did not help.<br /><br />I love good, strongly brewed tea leaves and do have experience with many different kinds of tea, but this is my first try for valerian root tea and it will be my last.  I have valerian root in capsule form which I take before bed on most nights.  It is well known that its odor is offensive to many people but it never bothered me so I thought I would have no problem with the tea.  As for the effectiveness, I don't think I had enough of the tea to make a fair judgement on that.<br /><br />For those of you who have had valerian root tea before and are just looking for a new brand then I would give it a try.  It is produced by Celebration Herbals, certified organic by Pro-Cert, and contains only valerian root.

review/summary: Mystery of ground-shipped ice cream
review/text: Wow, am I ever intrigued. Schwan shipped my order from their Minnesota headquarters to Florida by ground UPS, and, among other perishables, was included chocolate almond ice cream and strawberry yoghurt. I haven't received the shipment, and I tried to cancel the entire order because I saw that Schwan wasn't taking any action on it, but they pre-empted me by ignoring the cancel request and shipping it UPS ground two day.<br /><br />Actually, what is even more mystifying is that Schwan's knew there are Schwan delivery trucks all over this region of Florida, and I am positive that there is a Schwan delivery route only 3/10 of a mile from where I live. So, they could have been less malicious about this by getting a refrigerated Schwan delivery truck to deliver the goods in the insulated bag with the ice cubes and gel packs that is standard for such deliveries.<br /><br />This is written after I got delivery of the above by UPS ground three days later. Schwan's replied to my requests to cancel two days after I sent them, in other words, on the day I received delivery.<br /><br />Truth to tell, Schwan's was playing a joke, because they use plastic insulated picnic chests full of dry ice to ship their products by UPS ground, and the products all arrive frozen solid, many with nearly quite acceptable wholesome ingredients. They don't mention the dry ice, so wondering how the product would survive shipping is the joke on the customer.<br /><br />So far, I've sampled the ice cream and the strawberry yoghurt, both of which are better quality from a wholesomeness standpoint than available at local markets. The wonton soup with the pork wonton has an ingredients list that is anything except wholesome, almost like a joke on people who eat pork. Undoubtedly, the next Time you read a Schwan's catalog on the Amazon web site, the wonton soup will have fake vegetarian pork in it.<br /><br />So, for the dairy goods sampled so far using my microwave to defrost, like my kids used to say, "Yummy, yummy in the tummy."<br /><br />Oh, and it's a good idea to dispose of the UPS packaging quickly, because the dry ice evaporates into carbon dioxide which is not safe to breathe in quantity in an enclosed area and could become a lawsuit issue of the kind we innocent consumers are so fond of these days.

review/summary: FINALLY, I FOUND IT
review/text: Looked and looked all over for this product in the form of cubes for several years now. Was always able to buy the cube form in the supermarkets until it was discontinued many years ago. I would add some of the fish bouillion cube when making fresh fish broth for fish soup, I would put a little bit of the cube when making white clam sauce and when making fish stews. The bouillion would add more flavor to whatever it was I was cooking. Making stew and clam sauce without the cubes, the flavor wasn't the same, definitely something missing. Because there was no fish cube bouillion to be had anywhere I stayed away from making any of these tasty dishes, knowing that the dishes  would not taste the same. One day I finally had enough, I wanted clam sauce, I decided I would look on Amazon and see if the product would be available there. Why would it, I looked on the Knorr website to see where I could purchase the product in my area, answer.....NO WHERE,  I've also gone to many international markets in and out of my area, and NOTHING. So I was not hopeful I would find it on Amazon. What I did find was the powder form in a large container. I didn't care how large the container,  I know it will last me forever so I will be giving some to family members. After receiving bouillion in the mail, I made white clam sauce with fresh littleneck clams and I couldn't have been happier to add a little of the fish bouillion powder mix to the clam sauce. The clam sauce is once again amazing in flavor, you know, that special little something! FAMILY AND I ARE HAPPY ONCE AGAIN!!!!

This bouillon makes a superb stock for rice, gumbos, bouillebaisse, or whatever "fishy" thing turns you on that day.  Try a limitless sharp mustard sauce,with this in the roux, add a beaten egg for more substance, a touch of lemon some fresh dill or parsley and finish of with a soup�on of white wine. A truly  delicious sauce in minutes for anything that is fried. Anyway, in case you have not noticed - I love it. Makes great paella too. Rosemarie Conover.

review/summary: Not Really...
review/text: Every wannabee cook knows that to make an above average culinary creation 3 things are necessary: Talent and creativity, a good recipe, and most important, great ingredients. If those 3 are in place then the results will be nothing short of outstanding every single time.<br />I have been in love with seafood since a toddler when a mini wave took me up to sea and I was rescued by an aging mermaid. I love all things that come from the sea excepting in sushi form, perhaps some of the sea life in raw form does not agree with my palate. I love making seafood dishes, from soups to main entrees. Soups are my biggest weakness for I use to go to a pier where the seafood would arrive early in the morning hours and right then and there a hot pot with water will be waiting to be filled up with all manners of the daily catch. Mussels, fish heads, shell fish, pieces of fish, oysters, octopus, shrimp, etc etc. These selections would be the leftovers, the ones that did not command a sizable market price, they would end in their own version of the french bouillabaisse, with herbs and spices and the phosphorus of the fish heads, in no time the broth would be bursting with natural flavor right from the ocean. Add some lemon (lime here for the lemon in US is not as pungent), a little home made salsa with onions, chilies and tomatoes, and if you were courageous enough extra heat. By the time you would finish this powerful concoction all the phosphorus of the seafood would command to find the nearest hammock and snore for a couple of hours only to wake up feeling like a million dollars.<br />Enter Knorr Fish Boullion Mix, 32 Ounce Canister: yes, somewhere in its contents there is some vague taste of fish, but it certainly does not taste natural. It seems to be a little on the smoky side, it definitely has its own particular taste but it is way off from an above average fish stock. I have been using Minor's Clam Base (because is the cheapest in price and imparts a delicious total flavor to dishes) and this time I was caught on the curiosity of purchasing this powder form bouillon.  I loved the quantity and the powder form mystified me, what if it works as good as what I had been using? Of course is much more affordable than the clam base I am talking about (that one must be refrigerated and it is semi solid but it does have a truly clam smell) so I bought it and immediately tried it on a seafood chowder cilantro based. A very simple soup that includes hulled barley, onions finely chopped, fresh corn, small diced potatoes and fresh chilies properly sauteed with fresh garlic and olive oil and then blended with the cilantro and a couple of cans of quality diced tomatoes, preferably the ones with a little herbs thrown in. Who am I kidding? The ones they sell at Costco! This soup replaces the hard task of making your own fish stock which requires good fish heads with very clear eyes and all the other ingredients. Too much work for a wannabee cook these days but if done right it is every bit as good as anything you can eat these days. Throw some scallops, different fish, clams (if you can find plump ones), two or three fillets of mahi mahi, large shrimp, etc. But in the end, really, if the broth is good that is all a person would need to enjoy a hot cup or two of fish broth.<br />This one does not quite reach the levels of goodness I am referring to. It does the job but the final product lacks that essence of the sea, it is a little too processed?<br />Please do not get me wrong. I use the Knorr Chicken Powder and it works for me, a great value, so perhaps some people are more than satisfied with this product as well. I give it 3 Stars but that is it and I realize I am deviating from all the other 5 Star ratings, but the thing is, when you had the chance to try a superior product this one just can not compete. My chowder ended tasting okey but not spectacularly good and that hurts for I threw in a whole lot of seafood. Happy to have Albertsons sell this little packages of $1 each that allows for variety even though it is not the best of the catch they do offer bay scallops, different fishes, even shrimp and calamari, so it is not a bad deal. 3 Stars.

review/summary: Perfect addition for your maker!
review/text: I was very skeptical about buying this as I have never been a fan of any tea. I decided to give this a shot as I was looking for some new k-cups for my maker and for a new drink as I was getting tired for my packets of flavor added to water. After reading several review I made the purchase. I am very glad that I did! I make this over ice but have learned by trial and error to find the perfect combination of a 16 oz double walled cut filled to the brim with ice. From there I make it on the middle setting. Some people say you can use the pod twice for tea but I only like to use it once and I like the full flavor.  This is a great drink with a good amount of flavor and taste even if you ate not a tea drinker, it is not too sweet either which I like as well.

review/text: Being a new owner of a Keurig Mini Brewer I'm anxious to try different coffees and teas. I wasn't sure how an Iced Tea would work with a machine meant to make hot coffee, but it works great! I love raspberry tea and this came out with a fantastic, full flavor. I did add a little Splenda to my cup because I like things sweet, but I have no complaints about the end result. I would most definitely purchase these again.

review/text: Just tried these today and they were so good I had to come and write a review... The raspberry flavor is present and light. Not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they claim it is bitter. If you've never drank freshly brewed flavor-infused tea, then yeah it might not be what you expected. This is not tea-flavored fruit juice like Snapple. This is black tea with a raspberry infusion that is brewed hot in your Keurig over ice. Very good and very refreshing! Five stars all around for this one.

I've replaced my morning green tea with this. One thing that should be stated is that this is made from black tea, which is extremely good for you. If you have read SuperFoodRX, Black Tea is a side kick superfood to green tea. Great taste and great for you!

review/summary: Bitter and too tart with artificial taste
review/text: Raspberry Iced Tea is my favorite and I was excited to get this tea for use in my new Keurig brewer.  Unfortunately, no matter what brew option I used it never came out "good".  Use the setting for iced beverages or for a small cup and it turns out bitter, use the large mug or travel mug setting and it isn't as bitter but is watery.  Additionally, I've never before had a raspberry iced tea in which the raspberry flavor was so tart that it bordered on sour.  Instead of a fresh raspberry flavor, it was more artificial tasting.<br /><br />I'll probably use the rest of the box, if or when I get desperate, but I won't order again.

review/summary: Delightful Full Flavor Strength - Perfect for the Afternoon!
review/text: This tea is very unique as a blend of African/Kenyan, Assam, and Ceylon teas. This is definitely "Best enjoyed with milk." as the full-flavor strength balances well even with heaps of milk. This is especially useful if generous with adding milk to hot beverages, as I am! Even without milk, the tea is suprisingly smooth for being a strong tea which makes it unlike many other black teas I've tried.<br /><br />Although it doesn't appear to indicate Full Flavor Strength on the packaging pictured here, the blends are indentical to slightly different packaging by the same brand in Australia. Here they indicate it is Full Flavor Strength with five filled tea leaves on the front of the package.<br /><br />It appears based on the information on Amazon that this tea is a cross between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5GI">Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (Ceylon and Assam)and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F952">Twinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (Kenyan and Assam ) and yet this is an afternoon tea. However not to be confused with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAI">Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count, 1.41 oz. Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (Keemun and Ceylon) which is entirely different and probably tastes different enough too.

review/text: There is no real description, so ....<br /><br />Traditional Afternoon is a blend of Kenyan, Assam, and Ceylon teas from the 'Direct From England' line. It is bright, full-bodied and strong. [It is close to the English Breakfast blend.]<br /> Traditional Afternoon is bold, brisk and refreshing.<br /><br />Twinings Classics line blends Keemun and Ceylon teas for their English Afternoon Tea.<br /><br />Keemun is considered to have the best flavor and one of the best aromas.<br />[It is what the Queen drinks. That's a good thing.]<br /><br />Description:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAI">Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>is a medium-based blend of Keemun and Ceylon black teas and has a medium flavor strength.<br />A brisk and lively black tea with the flavor of smokiness and earthiness combined with elements of sweetness.<br /><br />Both of these teas are excellent, BTW.

review/summary: These all wound up tasting minty.
review/text: First, mine weren't all "shriveled up" and chewy, all Turkish Delights are cut into sort of small cubes.  In any case I really thought these would be good but they all wind up tasting like the mint ones in the variety.  That sort of ruined any hope of tasting any of the other flavors in the variety and frankly, coconut and mint isn't a very good combination.  I am not sure which of the flavors were the ones that contributed to the mintiness since i don't see anything minty in the ingredients, maybe it was a mistake?  Maybe I just don't know everything that tastes or smells minty... All I can say is these really stank and I wound up throwing them in the trash.<br /><br />Here though are some great Turkish Delights with coconut dusting if that is what you are seeking, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NA6QQ8">Mixed Turkish Delight w/ Nuts and Coconut (Pistachio, Almond & Hazelnut)</a>.  These I loved!<br /><br />I do hope this helps people find what they want.

review/text: Green Mountain has a reputation for making great coffee and I routinely have my favorites shipped to me.  But this blend is way too weak for me.<br /><br />My favorite coffee is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLKF6K">Barista Prima Coffeehouse, Italian Roast, 24- Count K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers</a> and when I want something slightly weaker I drink <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZH8NA">Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Box (Pack of 2)</a>.  For the extended family, however, I keep medium, mild, decaf, and flavored coffees available.  The house favorite for medium is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TC7WN4">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Breakfast in Bed (Medium Roast),  24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>.<br /><br />I brewed this k-cup strong and tried it first without cream.  It had a definite coffee aroma but the taste was weak and unusual (not bad but grain?).  I then added 1/2 my usual cream and that actually made it worse.  I suppose if I drank it together with some sweet pastry it would taste fine but, by itself, it's just not appealing to me.<br /><br />I suggest, if you need extra vitamin C and E, you buy a better tasting coffee and drink it with a good multivitamin.

review/text: Picked this up on a whim one time and my husband was hooked. Of course right after that, we could never find it again. Fortunately Amazon has plenty in stock! :)<br /><br />One bottle will cover about 2-2.5 lbs of meat. It has a liquidy consistency, looking almost like french salad dressing. But when cooked down, it gets much thicker and turns into a sauce.<br /><br />We use this for marinading wild game meat. Typically duck from my husbands duck hunting trips. They sit for a night in this marinade and the next day we use the meat for duck fajitas. It does a nice job of ridding meat of it's strong gamey taste.<br /><br />Everyone we know who has tried this marinade has been hooked and is always on a look out for it to be in stock in the grocery store. It gets used enough between all of us that buying it from Amazon in a 6 pack lasts us about 2 months, so it's a great deal.

review/summary: These treats made our dog violently ill; irradiated at too high a level?
review/text: We were looking for a 100% meat treat for our dog, sourced and also made in the USA; this particular Smokehouse USA treat fit the bill (though others under the same label do not).  Initially, we were excited that our dog seemed to love the taste of these treats (she ate the two strips we gave her with gusto), especially since she's very picky about most "healthy" stuff for dogs.<br /><br />However, not long after ingesting these, she became violently ill with gastrointestinal symptoms continuing for days.  Non-stop diarrhea was the worst part of it.  Aside from these treats, nothing else in her diet was different than usual.  Her appetite is still not back to normal, and it's been a month now.  She's listless and just doesn't seem like herself yet, though the GI issues are OK now.<br /><br />I wanted to warn people that these treats are irradiated, since the listing here on Amazon doesn't indicate it.  There's a seal on the back of the package stating, "Treated with radiation for your safety".  Since a number of foods are irradiated for human and pet consumption and thought to be safe, I'm not sure if unsafe levels of radiation was the issue in our case, or if it was simple food poisoning.<br /><br />Either way, I wish I'd known the treats were irradiated before I bought them, especially since the irradiated Orijen cat food imported to Australia in 2008 ended up being the cause of death and illness for many cats.  It's getting harder and harder to stay healthy in this world, but being forewarned of potential issues is better than lack of awareness at all.  And I won't be buying more Smokehouse USA products, regardless of what the source of our issue was.<br /><br />(See article re: feline deaths/illnesses from Orijen cat food irradiated at entry into Australia (2008), here:[...]

review/summary: Small and hard - not like greenies
review/text: The mini chews are SMALL. I was surprised at how small they were, but since we have a 4lb morkie pup, I figured they'd be safe for him to eat under supervision.<br /><br />I expected a generic greenie, but these are much harder and don't have that twizzler type texture that the greenies seem to have. These are a lot cheaper than greenies, so the price is reasonable, especially if you use subscribe and save.<br /><br />My dog seems to like them, but again, because of the teeny size, I wouldn't leave him unattended while eating these for fear he might choke.<br /><br />8/27/2012 UPDATE<br /><br />I've since upped my rating to 4 stars since my dog is now older and REALLY REALLY LOVES these! The vet has told us that they keep plaque from building up on his teeth, so I am diligent about giving him one after each meal. I wish they lasted long. He can finish one in a few seconds, but that's ok. Also, have found these to be a lot cheaper at Petsmart and am able to get twice the amount for the same price as amazon.

review/summary: Good dental treat
review/text: My two maltese and I really like these treats. They both have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents has gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these minichews, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium sized ones after some trial and error. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. I like the smell- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. I like that they have actual ingredients that are "dental" and aren't just calling them a dental treat because of chewing action. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste. The only negatives I have are that these are relatively pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

These do seem to help keep the "doggie breath" problem to a minimum.

review/summary: My Favorite Szechuan sauce!
review/text: I use this every day. I eat plain white jasmine rice with this sauce, and it's delicious. Or I eat coconut rice with it and it's delicious. I eat ramen noodles with this instead of the powdered flavoring and it's delicious. I make my orange tofu with my orange juice/Szechuan sauce marinade, and it's delicious. This is by far my favorite condiment!<br /><br />It's spicy hot, the way I like it, but it's not take-the-back-of-your-head-off hot, not overwhelmingly hot for me. It's good to eat spicy things because it helps keep your blood thin. But, if you can't stand heat of any kind, this sauce is not for you.<br /><br />The only thing I would improve is for it to be made without high fructose corn syrup. That having been said, of the other brands of Szechuan-style sauce out there, House of Tsang has less and tastes the best!

review/summary: Quick and Easy but Not Exactly like Homemade
review/text: If you are looking for a quick dessert and don't mind a slightly artificial flavor then this cheesecake mix might work for you. It isn't exactly like homemade but all you really do is mix up the crust with some butter and sugar and add milk to the cheesecake mix. You simply make the crust and then beat the cheesecake mixture for three minutes. So basically in ten minutes you have a dessert. I found that this sets up quickly. I made the cheesecake and then poured jello over it. You mix up one small packet of raspberry jello with half a cup of boiling water. It sets quickly. You can also add fresh or canned fruit to the jello.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: These taste like Macaroon Cookies because the main ingredient is coconut.  Love the great banana taste and can't wait to try the other flavors. They are about the size of an icecream scoop and very filling.  Noy like other cookies where you eat the whole bag because these really do a great job at making you feel full.  I eat about two a day (one in the afternoon and one in the vening) and it is great.  The price Amazon has is the same as my local health food store, so I wish they would bring the price down a bit.  At the Laughing Giraffe Web page the item is 8.99 plus shipping.  So I guess Amazon has a pretty close price and wish this item was on the subscribe and save plan.

review/summary: terrible, did not taste anything like Indian food
review/text: I am a real Indian Food fan.  I do lots of the store bought meals and have found many of them to be very delightful and some to be as good as a restaurante.  Sadly this meal is not one of them.  It did not taste anything like what I would recognize as an Indian meal.  It was certainly edible.  But I was not looking for edible.  I was looking for a moderately good tasting Indian treat.<br /><br />Preparation is fast, only 2 minutes in the Microwave.  Meal comes half with Chicken fixings and half with rice.  Since they were on sale w/coupon to boot, I got eight of these.  So if my opinion changes after giving it several more attempts, I will update this post.  After all, maybe I just got a bad one.<br /><br />I also have the Chick Pea dinner and the Potatoe/Spinach dinner.  Will create reviews for these later this week.  Hopes are still high.<br /><br />But for now, very dissappointing.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!

Although I think it could use more pieces of chicken. I have indigestion issues and it did not upset my stomach at all, even though it was medium spicy. It's also a great price for a shelf-stable product, around $3 per box. It's very healthy, all natural, no colors or preservatives, 340 calories, 11 grams fat, 400 mg salt, 16 grams protein, 45 grams total carbs. Highly recommend it for eating on the go, which most of us do these days.

It's not sweet etc...."I also had his sister try them too, poor thing was a good sport " this is totally different and interesting..." but wasn't begging for another one. My etire family loves them! We fight over them when they are in goody bag or pinatas.SO there you go a couple of reviews could be upbring, culture, or palate...who knows. I LOVE THEM!!

review/summary: Terrific fish chowder
review/text: Reminds me of my grandmother's fish chowder, a Maine native her whole life.  This is a hearty, flavorful soup with lots of fish and vegetables.  We keep it in the cabinet for chilly nights and Sunday afternoons.

review/text: It's fish chowder, and it taste good.  I was surprised that Amazon could be thought of as a food source, but the cans arrived in perfect condition.  Very happy, and it taste good.  Good price too.

review/summary: Took a gamble and lost
review/text: I saw the line of Bar Harbor products in my local store.  Being an enthusiast of chowder, I bought a can of the Fish Chowder and brought it home to have for supper.  Much to my surprise, the can does not suggest how much milk/cream to mix into the concentrate to get it right.  Instead, the directions say only "...add milk or cream to desired consistency..."  So I followed the suggestion in this Amazon product review (a half-pint:  why not call it a cup instead?)and now have chowder that is thin.  I am wondering how many cans must I buy and waste at $4 per to solve the proper amount of milk or creme to add?<br /><br />Jerry

review/summary: Medjool Dates with no Pesticides or Additives
review/text: These Medjool Dates are well packaged and USDA certified to be "organic" and clearly labeled on the sturdy packaging to be free from pesticides and any food additives. The dates themselves are of good size and still hold pits. Just two dates on a dish are considered a serving. So apparently I am having more than a serving when I consume four or five at a sitting with a tall glass of milk. I purchase a years supply or twelve pounds of Medjool dates at a time and store them in my freezer. I believe that dates grown and shipped from Indio, California, in the Coachella Valley are some of the best in the World.  I plan to order more of these through Amazon.com. next year.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: These pods are delicious, convenient, and inexpensive! I was worried when I bought my husband the Senseo that he would never have enough choices (like the K-cups) but he loves this and many of the other flavours available. Almost as good as Panera Bread's chai and WAY cheaper!
