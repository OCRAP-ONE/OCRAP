review/summary: tasty tea
review/text: When I opened the package, I thought this tea smells exactly like Italian pignoli macaroons.  But, the taste is definitely "darker" and more bitter; perhaps I let it steep too long, or perhaps sweetener would bring out the "cookie" flavor more.  Whatever.  Black, it tastes pretty similar to the Republic of Tea Vanilla Almond flavor, which I also like.<br /><br />This tea seems to have bigger leaf pieces and less fannings than typical for bagged teas, BTW, so it's probably a higher grade of tea underneath the flavorings.

review/summary: So delicate & buttery...YUM!
review/text: I was rummaging through our kitchen's lazy-susan-corner-cabinet, looking for something quick, easy & "of substance" to eat and noticed 1 lone pack, so I decided to try it.  My mother-in-law must've bought it, 'cause I've never seen the brand before.<br /><br />Ingredients are: Brisling Sardines, extra virgin olive oil, garlic powder, black olives & red bell pepper.  I've had some history of eating sardines so I knew what to expect...or so I thought.<br /><br />Opened the can and immediately, I was pleasantly surpised = no outstanding fishy smell.<br /><br />I started eating and man, oh man, I had never had sardines like these before!  They are so delicate & buttery with the perfect amount of saltiness.  Yum, yum and yum.  So much so, I wanted to look this up in Amazon and write a review.  I'll be buying more right this very second!

review/summary: Elegant Product
review/text: I have been eating King Oscar products like sardines and kippered herring for at least 50 years. Made in Norway, they are high quality products and I cannot remember ever being disappointed. These sardines are small sardines, packed in two layers with the tails in the middle, alternating directions. That makes them a pleasure to look at in the can. They are smoked and packed in good Olive Oil, too. If one likes sardines, they are pretty good stuff. My only problem with them is that the can runs out before I want to be through eating and sometimes there seem to be a shortage of this brand.

review/summary: Great sardines and source of omega 3s
review/text: Was delicious as always.  Sardines are the way I like to get my omega-3s -- real fish is the most reliable source and small fish have the least contaminants.  If you like fish, it goes well with toast, in omelets, in salads, or straight from the tin.  King Oscar has both a lighter fish taste and a lighter smoke taste than other top brands, but is more delicate, i.e., breaks apart due to its light texture.

They are delicious, especially when I put one on a cracker, add sweet & spicy mustard on the top and eat one after the other!!!  Not everyone likes sardines, but if you do, then try these.

review/summary: excellent healthy food
review/text: When we first adopted our lab/border collie mix at eight months old, she was extremely underweight and had constant diarrhea. We didn't know what was wrong! We tried science diet and iams, but she wouldn't eat them. Her weight loss and diarrhea continued. We finally got her to start eating Purina with chunks of meat in it, and she finally started gaining weight. Her diarrhea improved a little bit, but her fur was thin and dull and she didn't seem as healthy as she should be. I did some research on grain free foods and switched her over to this formula. Immediately her diarrhea went away! She gained weight even faster, and now instead of skin and bones, she is a beautiful slender dog with tons of energy. The sweet potato acts as a natural stool hardener, and no grain makes it easy to digest. Her fur is thick, shiny, and luxurious like it should be. Wonderful food!

review/summary: Great for asthma!
review/text: The raw cacao nibs are too bitter for me to eat alone, but I like eating them with bananas or strawberries (just grab a handful of nibs and sort of push them into a strawberry or bite-size piece of banana).<br /><br />It's a nice "pick-me-up" snack and is especially helpful when my asthma is bothering me.  I've eaten it in the middle of the night when a nebulizer treatment wasn't enough.  Truly a lifesaver!!!<br /><br />I'm only giving it 4 stars though because their shipping is kind of pricey.  I've since bought the raw cacao powder from Navita's Naturals and they give Super Saving Shipping.  So I'm looking into them as an option for the nibs.  I'll review their's too if I find them.

review/summary: Waaaaay too sour. And too spicy for something called mild.
review/text: This was horribly sour. Face-puckeringly so. All their jars seem to taste the same. A whole block of jaggery  of about an inch by an inch by two inches didn't take down the sourness enough. I am a vegan so I made this using tofu, soy yogurt  and soy cream. If I was forced to use this product again I would NOT add yogurt, who needs even more sourness? I also added Earth Balance soy margarine, which is very buttery, and I even tried adding Taste of Malacca brand tikka masala powder to add some TIKKA taste - which has got a distinctive flavor profile, not generic curry like this Patak's one. Just get their powder <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPLE0">Taste of Malacca, Tikka Masala, 1.2-Ounce Units (Pack of 3)</a> and make your dish according to the instructions on the label, it's better and easier.

review/summary: Best Rub Ever
review/text: I have been using Blues Hog products for years, and recently ran out of rub.  This is what I asked for for Christmas, and was overjoyed when my sister complied with my request.  This rub has the best flavor, and compared to other rubs I have tried, is not salty.  It lays down a perfect complex layer of flavors that are great on their own (if you like your ribs "dry", or complement the Original Sauce perfectly.  The best way I can describe it is "sweet heat", but it is not super sweet like some commercial sauces, nor super hot like hot sauce.  The heat comes on gently and subtly on the back end of the palate.  Honestly, anybody who doesn't like this stuff (or any of the other Blues Hog offerings) should have their head examined!

review/summary: Refuting the 2-Star Review.
review/text: Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked "natural"), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track.

The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep.

review/text: To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

review/summary: It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.
review/text: Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like "chicken" or "chicken meal" and  you do not want things like "meat byproduct."  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the "Holistic"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.

review/summary: For a dog with sensitivity to chicken...
review/text: Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is "bulkier," too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change.

review/summary: Great food for a dog with a sensitive stomach
review/text: My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!

review/summary: Best for my dog, K-9 first responders use this
review/text: I researched for the healthiest, least filler type food.  I live in the Washington, DC area where there are lots of police K-9 dog owners.  They recommend the Holistic.  It turns out that you can serve much less for the same amount of nutrition as all the other popular brands so 30lb. goes for two months for my 45 lb dog!  I keep ordering online from Amazon and my ordering records show an order every two months.  Shows up in two days delivered! The veterinarian always comments on my dog's healthy coat and leanness. I only wish it could be on the subscription feature so that it would automatically be ordered and worry free, but there are more important things in life to worry about, right!?

review/text: I've never used this product before, but had a coupon so thought it would be worth trying, I looked at their site and checked to make sure that the protein was still adequate (which was 28%), when I got to the store, they received new bags, which is now only 22% protein, which is not enough meat to grain ratio. Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from "itchy butt" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.

review/text: Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.

review/summary: Excellent Quality; my dogs LOVE it!
review/text: I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.

review/summary: Works for My Dog and Me and Try Their New Treats
review/text: My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods. After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or "like" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>. The treats I bought are not yet offered on amazon. They are called Holistic Select Wheat Free Holistix with Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples & Blueberries Natural Biscuits for Dogs. They are easy to break in half for using as rewards.

So far I got one for $5 and one for $3. I don't know how (or if) to use them on amazon so sometimes I buy locally.<br /><br />This is small kibble suitable for small dogs. Don't know about big dogs.

I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.

review/summary: Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS
review/text: We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.

Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from "chronic" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!

I buy the large bag and have two dogs that it will feed for almost a month before needing more and both my dogs look and feel healthy and happy. No more chewing paws or stratching like crazy.  Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product. Best thing I've done for my dogs outside of rescuing them :)

review/summary: Content means less than names
review/text: I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, "Holistic",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or "natural" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?

review/summary: Great heat and flavor...
review/text: This is some great hot sauce. A lot of times, you can get a sauce that's high on flavor, but really doesn't offer much in the way of heat. Other times you can grab something that sets off all the alarms in its heat level, but the flavor really doesn't keep you coming back (just when you need a "test of manhood"). El Yucateco's KutBil-Ik XXXtra hot sauce delivers all the heat and flavor you really need. This is honestly one of the hotter standard hot sauces I've had, but the flavor is extremely good, savory and smoky, that I can't help but keep eating it. Honestly, I was more than surprised. I've had El Yucateco's other sauces, and while they're good, there's really nothing about them that seemed all that special to me. I saw this on sale at my local grocery store, so I picked it up (What the heck, always looking for a new hot sauce) and was floored when I tasted it, in more ways than one. It's great on Mexican food, obviously, but you can use it to spice up almost anything, pizza, wings, soup, chili, you name it, El Yucateco will up the taste a few notches and the heat will take off the roof from there. Enjoy...

I felt compelled to post a review however, because the price listed on this page is absolutely bonkers ridiculous? Nearly 10 dollars for a 4 oz bottle? No, no, no. Go find a Mexican grocery.

review/summary: EXTRAORDINARY "hot sauce"
review/text: My husband introduced me to this about 8 yrs. ago now, and it's my absolute favorite!  Local grocery stopped carrying it, altho they continue to have other "El Yucateco" sauces (and they're good too, BUT ...)  However, THIS one really is waaaay above the rest.  As another reviewer said, many times you get hot, but little flavor; or flavor w/not much heat.  This sauce REALLY delivers on both.  We always warn guests -- have to admit to laughing, when my darlin's brother said he could take whatever we served up and THEN some.  He literally drenched his burrito in this sauce (not even I do that, and I can take it pretty dang hot); after his 1st bite, he looked like one of those cartoon characters with red face, steam coming out his ears, and flipping his lid.  And yet, the flavor is so super, he kept eating!  And no, despite the heat, it doesn't numb your tongue so you can't taste anything else. BUT: for heaven's sake, don't drink water! -- use milk, milk products, ice cream, or some kind of alcohol to help stop the flames!  Unfortunately, water just spreads it around and makes your whole mouth on fire (if you don't love this kind of thing to start with ;)

review/text: If you want a very nutritious oil for your cooking and even!!! facial and body oil needs, this is the one to have! (besides Coconut oil, of course). I use them both ways and the results are simply amazing: no more wrinkles, and never hungry! It goes into everything raw, like salads and even smoothies made of veggies. I don't use it for(heat) cooking, it's too precious for that. Use olive oil instead.<br />It's color is deep green, and when you pour some of it into your palm, you can literally see it's smooth and beautiful texture! It has a light nutty taste, and I cannot stress enough how big the health benefits are: I never feel hungry, I don't gain weight! and I have a smooth face at soon 60 years of youth! Don't believe anybody who sells you a non-fat diet! Our body NEEDS fats to be healthy, and the right fats don't make you fat, to the contrary: you have energy, stamina and healthy body cells! This is another item I will continue to use.<br />I just have one wish: I want to see it on the "subscribe and save" list of items, so that I won't have to remember when to order a fresh batch!

review/summary: Skin Care Miracle That's Also Tasty??
review/text: I suffer from Rosacea, which for me, is basically a bumpy rash on my face that burns and itches simultaneously (and looks hideous). I heard that Hemp Oil could help, and for the price was willing to try anything. What I found was astonishing! It was instantly soothing and much of the rash cleared up overnight. It's also a light, non-greasy moisturizer that doesn't make the rest of my skin break out. I have spent hundreds of dollars on prescriptions that did nothing but make my face burn and itch more and in months could not do what this stuff did in days. My rosacea is not completely gone. I still have flare ups, but it is under the best control it has ever been. I am not a doctor and have no idea why this works, but in my opinion its a miracle. Plus, it makes a darned tasty salad dressing too. What other product can do that?

review/summary: Will NOT fail a drug test
review/text: I know a concern of many in consuming hemp oil is failing workplace drug tests. For this reason hemp product manufacturers have started a program called TestPledge to educate consumers in this area. I highly suggest reading this page for an interesting explanation:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Briefly outline:<br /><br />TestPledge requires that pledging companies achieve this goal by committing to the following THC limits:<br /><br />  * Hemp oil: 5.0 parts per million (ppm)<br />  * Hemp nut: 1.5 parts per million (ppm)<br /><br />How much hemp oil and hemp nut can you eat?<br /><br />At the 5 ppm THC TestPledge limit for hemp oil, a person would have to eat in excess of 8 tablespoon servings - half of an 8 oz. bottle - of pure hemp oil per day to ingest 600 �g THC, the dose found not to cause confirmed positive urine tests for marijuana with a wide margin of safety. To increase this margin even further and to address any and all health concerns, setting the daily THC intake at 500 �g per day still allows for slightly over 7 tablespoon servings daily.<br /><br />THC limits for TestPledge were set low enough to allow for the extensive daily consumption of both hemp oil and hemp nut. For example, one can consume 3 tablespoons of hemp oil AND 8.75 ounces (over a half-pound) of hemp nut before reaching the 600 �g daily dose, or 3 tablespoons of hemp oil AND 7 ounces of hemp nut before reaching the more conservative 500 �g daily dose. This example shows that even enthusiastic hemp food consumers will not be able to consume enough hemp nut and oil food products to produce a confirmed positive drug test. It also shows the TestPledge limits are set low enough to provide an ample margin of safety.<br /><br />Nutiva is one of the companies that have taken the pledge that they adhere to the testpledge criteria.

review/summary: THIS CURES ECZEMA! Worth getting for ANY reason!
review/text: __________________________________________________________________________________<br />NOTE: I have left an update on my eczema condition in the comments section of this review. To summarize the update: I tried applying the oil topically to the affected area and it stopped the itch and burn completely! Applying the hemp seed oil directly to the area will cure eczema!!! (8/15/2011)<br />__________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Couldn't be happier with this hemp seed oil. The delicious nutty flavor makes it easy to take this as a daily supplement. The texture will take some getting used to if you're taking it straight as a supplement (it is oil after all). And you can't beat the price here on Amazon. The original price is $20 and here it's half that!<br /><br />I actually decided to get this because I heard an omega6 deficiency causes eczema (a skin disease that I have). I've been taking it for about a week and my skin is showing improvement. I itch less and my skin doesn't inflame as badly. I'm thinking I need to up the dose a little bit. Maybe I'll start taking 1 full tablespoon instead of 2 teaspoons that I'm taking daily. I understand this probably won't be of use to most people simply looking for hemp seed oil, but I will update in the comments of this review about how my eczema curing progress is going. Maybe this can help someone.<br /><br />Nutiva is obviously very passionate and dedicated to the products they sell. The label on this oil is informative and their website is even more informative. By quality of this oil alone I can say I trust this company, and I'll be buying from them in the future.

review/text: To give an honest and fair review, I would have to start by saying that the taste and aftertaste of this product is a bit unbearable at times; definitely ruined my salad. However, I will not refrain from treating this product with its well-deserved 5-stars.<br /><br />Although the taste is not nearly as satisfying as a burger, the benefits far outweigh the "light, nutty," flavor. An immense source of omega-3's (an essential fatty acid the human body does not produce), I chose this product to replace certain fish products that claimed to do the same - I found the Oil to be easier to intake and even experimented cooking with it.<br /><br />I am new to the hemp line of products but can account for the fact that my energy levels have shown a significant increase. Proving to myself the necessity of this products ingredients for my body. All hemp products seem to have the same indescribable after-taste (not so pleasant if i had to describe it), but, I am sure that after a month of using this product my body will begin to enjoy the taste, like anything else.<br /><br />All in all, this product was well worth the buy, especially for the low rate they charge. Shipping was on par. Recommended for anyone.

But that does not matter.  One daughter caught foliculitis.  Hemp oil cured it. (Applied externally, and taken internally.)  One son caught a nasty mrsa staph infection at the local school gym.  Doc put him on antibiotics, which ultimately failed to cure the problem.  After that, we tried hemp oil, and it worked -  quickly.  (Again - internal and external applications, several times a day.)  Experience seems to be that we all need more oil, not less, as long as it is good oil, like this.  Worth every penny.  Will try this brand of hemp oil for any health issue, before ever visiting a doctor again.  Buy extra, and keep a bottle in the freezer for a friend!

review/summary: Better mood and less pain in about a week.
review/text: I bought this oil as a way to get a real effective dose of omega fatty acids into my diet as opposed to taking 1 or 2 grams of fish oil per day which did nothing.  I have come realize that our bodies create about 11 different kinds of omega 3 fatty acid which will not be created if you take fish oil which contains only 2.  There are only 2 essential fatty acids alpha linolenic acid(omega 3), and linoleic acid(omega 6) your body makes what it needs from these if you get enough in your diet.  After about a week of taking this I noticed that my mood that has been fairly depressive for years had improved to the point of wanting to go workout again, this coupled with a significant decrease in overall body pain has allowed me to stake claim to a better life.

review/text: This is the irst bottle of hempseed oil I ever purchased after hearing about the health benefits of it on tv. It seems like a good price for the amount you get and the taste of this oil is delicious. Something I really like about this Nutiva hempseed oil is the bottle they send it in. Its basically spill proof. You can turn the bottle upside down, hold it over a spoon, and nothing will come out until you squeeze the bottle. You have incredibly fine control over the amount you wish to get out of the bottle. After having just purchased a bottle of flax seed oil which pours straight down the side of the bottle instead of onto the spoon like it is supposed to, I was very impressed with this product. Both the taste and spill-proof bottle design are great.

review/summary: Hemp Oil - a great facial product!
review/text: The product arrived in a timely manner. It has a nice flip open cap with a squeeze nozzle type deal similar to mustard or ketchup. The oil is a rich green color. I've used the oil on pasta (it has directions to make a salad dressing on the bottle) and I like the flavor a lot. The flavor is kind of a warm, rich, nutty kind of flavor. What I bought the product for was not for food though. I bought it for my read dry skin on my face. I got really bad sunburn last summer on my face and it's been flaking ever since on my cheeks. So, I squirt a little bit on a sock and rub my face with it! The flakes of skin come right off and it helps my skin. It hasn't given me acne and this oil miraculously does NOT clog pores. I shaved my head and gave myself a mohawk but I noticed I had really bad dry scalp on the sides and it was disgusting. I treated my head with this stuff for about a week and now it doesn't have any flakes and is completely healed... my face is being stubborn though... the sun really cooked it last summer. If you're looking for a healthy product for your face and your food then buy this stuff... it's great!

review/summary: Great Oil, Good For You
review/text: I've purchased a few different types of hempseed oil and hempseed products.  The taste takes a little getting used to, but the benefits are wonderful.  Think flaxseeds, but without the negative side effects--though the flavor is definitely much stronger.  As far as the flavor: I have to say its a bit like melted unsalted high-quality butter (with that almost sweet quality) but also has a nutty taste that reminds me of fresh pine nuts (though a little more bitter and, well, maybe a touch skunky).  The pungency reminds me of sesame oil too, even though it's not nearly that potent a smell/taste nor as deep a flavor.<br /><br />The problem with hempseed oil though is that it has a tendency to go rancid.  I was a little worried ordering this online precisely because of that, but I was pleasantly surprised.  My Amazon.com oil arrived promptly and tasted really fresh.  It kept well in my fridge, and didn't go rancid for quite a while.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying this again!

review/summary: Reverses wrinkles
review/text: Penetrates skin and reverses wrinkles. I spent $15 back in May. I keep it refridgerated and fill up mini bottles for travel or use for when I wash my face. It also helps other oils to be absorbed in the skin like anything with an SPF in it.<br /><br />I use a Clarisonic sporadically and do microdermabrasion a couple of times a week. I am at bare minimum for skin care. I also feel very comfortable with little or no makeup on my face. I put on eyeliner just because.<br /><br />It is liberating to be confident in my own skin!

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: Just make sure you keep this refrigerated so it doesn't spoil, and it has a low burn temperature so it's not recommended for cooking. I love this for vinegar and oil dressing, pasta, and putting it in shakes for my kids (they get the omega 3 and omega 6 benefits without knowing it). There really is no flavor to it so you can put it on a numerous amount of cold foods or already prepared cooked foods. I also got sunburned on my shoulders and back so my husband rubbed some of this on and it really helped relieve the burn and I barely peeled. It soaked in my skin well and wasn't very "oily" at all. The hemp oil I got came with 2 bottles so I gave one to my mother-in-law and she loves it also and asked me to order more. Great product :)

review/summary: Organic Help Seed Oil is GREAT!
review/text: Organic Hemp Seed Oil is very tasty and very good for you.  It is a little pricey, but that is most likely because we have to import it.  It is not legal to grow Hemp in the US.  Don't use it for cooking or you will destroy all the valuable nutrition it provides.  It tastes great on salads or any raw vegetables.  You can also add it to cooked foods after removing them from heat.  Try it!  It's yummy.

review/text: I've been using Hemp Oil for sometime. I put it on my salads and anything that is already cooled down. I eat a vegan, gluten free diet and Hemp Oil is one of the best ways to get Omega 3 into the diet. Between this product walnut oil and flaxseed oil all eaten in oil forms as opposed to pill popping, I've been able to drastically deminish the affects of my asthma. I was using 4 puffs a day on my inhalers and now my down to a couple of puffs a week. Omega 3's decrease inflammation, which is the source of many of the health problems we have today from asthma, arthritis, and even depression. Also this is a good company that puts out an excellent product.

review/summary: Hemp oil 24 oz
review/text: I've been using this stuff for over a year now, probably have gone through six bottles.  I use them solely in Smoothies. I make smoothies every day instead of one of my meals using super food powders Spirulina, Wheatgrass, Chlorella, Superfood Greens, Maca, and bananas, apples, grapes or cantaloupe in season, always add parsley and sometimes other veggies without stems, almonds and pumpkin seeds, recently stopped using flax seeds, a long squirt of Hemp Seed Oil, two heaping teaspoons of Coconut Oil, and couple spoons of Xylitol in place of sugar.  Add plenty of water and blend until smooth.<br />This makes you lose weight and keeps it off. My frayed vertebre is feeling much stronger since last year, and now with ten minutes of exercise each day plus my 2 mile walks 4x a week, at 70 years old I'm feeling better than I have in years, and the bout of sciatica that hit me two years ago is practically gone except for a minor residue - I'm actually healing, my body is improving, rejuvenating.  No drugs thank you, they only mask your symptoms but keep you deteriorating without you noticing until it's too late.<br />Hemp seed oil is an excellent product. It's high in Omega 3 and 6 fatty acid in best ratio available so it says.  I like the squeeze bottle it comes in for smoothies, very convenient.

review/summary: Heard It Shrinks Fibroids, heard it tastes bad.... 1 Confirmation so far!
review/text: When they discovered 2 fibroids in my uterus during this (my first) pregnancy, I started looking into natural alternatives to keep the situation under control until the time comes for medical intervention...or to fend off medical intervention to begin with. Studies have shown that natural hemp oil 2tbsp per day aid in the shrinkage of fibroids as it brings restorative/balancing effects to the uterine lining and female hormones alike. Its safe to take (dr hasnt said NO to it) so I continue. NOW...I think it tastes very close to "wretched". MOST days I only take 1tbsp.  But my fibroids have not grown since their discover in week 18 (am 25weeks now) and infact they ARE getting smaller. I am now tolerating the taste too!<br /><br />PS: my cap was BROKEN on arrival. Not sure whats up with the company but you guys have GOT to get more sturdy material as I am not the only one with this complaint. No spillage though!

review/summary: Excellent Oil for Heart
review/text: One of the questions that people are sure to ask about hemp oil is whether it has any psychoactivity. The answer is no.<br />Hemp oil contains 57% linoleic (LA) and 19% linolenic (LNA) acids, in the three-to-one ratio that matches our nutritional needs. These are the essential fatty acids (EFAs)-so called because the body cannot make them and must get them from external sources.<br />I use hemp oil in salad dressings, give it to my puppy with his food, and just drink it from the bottle with my vit E, CoQ10, Selenium, ALA, & a-d cocktail. Doesn't taste that bad either, didn't notice any nutty flavor or get high. But we don't go there anymore.<br />Amazon.com has a great price on the 24oz. bottles (Nutivia Organic)

review/summary: This product is great for your hair.
review/text: I use this product directly on my hair because my hair loses protein and gets very frizzy and dry.I have tried many other natural products to help this problem, but none of them worked and neither did the expensive hair salon products or the over the counter products. So when I finally tried hemp seed oil, I was amazed from it's results. I use this product every day after I shower and after my hair dries it is so soft and manageable and so much easier to style because of that. For those of you who don't have frizzy or dry hair can still use this as a treatment or add some of the product to your shampoo or conditioner for added moisture. I researched the benefits that hemp seed oil has for your hair, and it has a lot of benefits. If you don't believe me look it up online yourself or just try it. I was buying the brand name "Natures Alchemy" from www.healthdesigns.com because it states that it is only for cosmetic use- not for food. I was wary if there was a difference of effectiveness from the other hemp seed oil brands that state they are for food. Well I tried it, and there is no difference. Hemp seed oil is hemp seed oil. They probably put another ingredient in the cosmetic one that you shouldn't eat-that's probably the only difference. But the Natures Alchemy brand for the cosmetic use only is a lot more expensive and you only get a small amount. So don't waste your money and just buy this one because it will last a lot longer and it is worth it.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I am always looking for new "healthy" products to add to my diet and this one is a definite "keeper". I have tried flax seed oil and it is OK but I switched to the capsules because the taste was not something I would classify as that great. I read the reviews on this Product before I purchased it and so decided to try it. I eat a salad almost daily and I am a straight oil and vinegar gal with a little seasoning salt plus coarse black pepper. The first time I tasted this Hempseed oil I was a little disappointed and thought it tasted like fresh green grass. Since I am not one to taste once and then pitch it I kept putting it one my salad. Now I can't imagine using any other oil (I am so addicted to this oil and I love the taste)I am on my second bottle and will continue to buy it. Others say it has a nutty taste but I don't think so. I don't know what to compare it with but It is just plain delicious and I am getting my Omega-3's. Nutiva thanks for a great product. Next I plan to try the seeds which others recommend.

review/summary: Oil of the Seed of the Hemp
review/text: Hemp seed oil is good for you, but I eat it anyway. I like the taste, much like an aged extra virgin olive oil. I particularly like it on popcorn and in salads. Unlike olive oil, keeping it in the refrigerator doesn't turn it into a yellowish lard-like solid; it remains liquid. It is too delicate to fry things with, but most of the things I eat aren't fried anyway. I don't slather it on bread because I'm allergic to gluten and have to avoid bread, but alone or mixed with balsamic vinegar it should be good for dipping bread. I think it has all of those Omega threes and sixes that everybody raves about, but it is an acquired taste that I'm glad to have acquired.
