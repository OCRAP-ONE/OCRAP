review/summary: Daughter doesn't like it
review/text: I bought this for my daughter but she doesn't like it.  She says it doesn't taste like chocolate.  I would say it's more sugary then chocolate.  I've even tried adding an extra scoop but she still doesn't think it taste right.  Maybe she's too use to Swiss Miss.

review/summary: a good white tea
review/text: Good flavor.  Small, needle like leaves occasionally turn up in your cup (hence the lower rating than the other teas I've reviewed) if you don't use a good strainer when you pour it out of the teapot (it, like all looseleaf teas, works best in a teapot or infuser mug).  A very good tea, nice and mild.

Price is a little higher than a store bought ham, but well worth the home delivery and lean, trimmed texture and the spiral cut is a blessing to portion at the table. I always have thick slabs and shaved looking portions, when I try to cut to serve.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001269GT2">City Ham 5.5 to 7 lbs. (when avail.)</a>

review/summary: Great Beans
review/text: These beans are perfect. They roasted well and evenly.<br />THe taste is devine. Of course I love coffee so a fresh roasted coffee bean is going to always be pleasing. I roast these beans dark and they do not taste over roasted at all. More like a smooth French roast. You can also roast them medium and get great results. Happy roasting!!!

review/summary: PURINA BEGGIN STRIPS
review/text: I absolutely love Amazon !  After buying PURINA BEGGIN STRIPS from Pubix for years @ $12 per bag I thought to myself," I wonder if Amazon has these and if so,at a better price ? " Sure enough there were plenty of vendors ..... plus some PRIME vendors @ $10 per bag. Of course what I love MOST about Amazon are the REVIEWS !  In this case,most all of the reviews were FIVE STARS !  Had I signed up for AUTOMATIC DELIVERY every other month I could have saved a few cents more per bag ........ BUT there were quite a few NEGATIVE REVIEWS about glitches in the delivery system with those who had signed up. So now I simply order my TWO 25oz BAGS every other month SAVING $2.00 PER BAG or about $24 PER YR ...... and that's with PRIME which means FREE SHIPPING and @ MY DOOR in TWO DAYS !  ..... PS , I originally signed up for PRIME ( only $79 per YR ) thinking it was only for books.Little did I know ! For those of you who have not yet done so I HIGHLY recommend it ! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT !

review/text: When I used to have cable TV I seem to remember seeing the Beggin' strips commercial where the dog goes crazy for what he thinks is bacon. For some reason I've never forgotten that commercial. Then my husband started buying this treat for his mom's dog. She would go crazy each time she saw him because she knew she was getting a delicious treat. Soon we were buying more and more of this treat. I however never thought to look at the ingredients which include bacon fat and sugar. No wonders dogs love this treat - it is addictive. I think it is OK for an occassional "drive your dog wild" treat but I would not feed a dog this treat daily.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: My husband and I have tried several different drinks and pills to enhance our love life and spice things up. All of which to no avail. None of them ever really did anything for us. I picked up a couple of these Neurogasms at the grocery store. The bottle caught my eye. And though for a drink they keep in the section with bottled water and soda....I had NO expectations for these what so ever. I just thought they were kinda funny.... unexpectedly, these little babies work AWESOME. Lets just say we notice a BIG difference ;) Weve since bought several more... and again, it wasnt a fluke! These really work. They taste great. They arent expensive. I have since tried other Neuro drinks, like Neurosleep.....which is as effective as Neurogasm. Now Id just like to see these drinks in more places, so theyre easier to find.

This tastes strange and I don't see any effects of what its supposed to do... That is all I am going to say about that~ Didn't work for me or even give me energy- Neuro has some great drinks, this isn't one of them for me..<br /><br />New Review: Ok so I was reading up on this, it says mixed with alcohol it works well.. There is no disclaimer on the bottle, so I figured what the heck! I mixed with some vodka, and felt good all night! Didn't need more then a couple shots, one bottle of Gasm, it really made me feel good- Now I didn't do what the bottom line is about this drink ( I don't have to say it do I ? ) But it gave me energy, made me relaxed and I slept great- Woke up feeling good as well!  Not sure if this is my new alcohol companion but it works well with drinks! :) Even better with Champagne! ;)

review/summary: Never thought a drink like this could make you feel so good.
review/text: I've always been skeptical of drinks like this. Especially energy drinks. They have too much sugar and make you jittery. There's just something about this drink that tastes like vitamins. I personally like the taste of vitamins mixed with this slightly carbonated, strawberry/fruit type of flavor. Most importantly though, every time I've had one of these, I manage to really be able to concentrate on my work. I work from home so it is hard to focus thanks to distractions. But this stuff really helps me zone in and generally makes me feel good. Like it is supplying my body with necessary nutrients. Only 35 calories too. Can't beat that. Definitely going to need to buy a case of this stuff. It definitely seems to help my brain function. I'm seriously not joking. This stuff is great.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I got this drink after my brother had one and said it was amazing. I believe his words were "viagra in a cup" lol. He said that it made his sex life amazing. I was curious to try one, but no stores will carry something with the word "gasm" in the tile. The day it arrived it just so happened I hadn't eaten at all since early that morning and it was about dinner time. I had one, which tasted great, a nice little buzz in the brain came on after a couple sips. I didn't notice anything after that so I immediately had another one. I didn't realize it takes a few minutes for these to take affect. I was seriously sceptical about these but a few minutes after after my second something happend. BAM, this stuff had a major affect on me. I have a high libito to begin with, but after taking two of these, OH MY GOSH! I've never had sex before or anything like it because I'm waiting to with my wife, so believe me when I tell you this stuff does not help when living an abstinence lifestyle lol. I had to go workout for 2.5 hours to work off the amount of "energy" this stuff gave me. This is not a placebo affect I assure you haha. For this to work best you have to take it on an empty stomach and it really does work. Hope this helped!

Neurogasm is not just for sexual health, it's great for focus, energy and going about your day. Neurogasm is in my opinion easily the best energy drink on the market and as for its regular properties...well, they work just fine. Much better than Neurosun and Neurosonic.

review/summary: It works...whether you want it to or not!
review/text: Let's get the simple stuff out of the way. All around, I like Neuro Passion (or NeuroGasm as it was apparently originally named). It's attractively designed, it tastes fruity with a sharp but pleasant vitamin-like edge. I normally don't like carbonation, but this had a very slight level, which was actually quite nice and fit with the flavor. My two simplest complaints are a) it's rather pricey and b) you can tell by the taste that it's artificially sweetened; it's very saccharine. This might not bother some people, but I'm a stage actor and a singer and I don't usually consume artificial sweeteners because it isn't at all good for my voice or throat. I guess there's a third, c) it's not very hydrating.<br /><br />Other people have noted that, as Neuro products are technically nutritional supplements, it may have different effects on different bodies. I'm a 6'4" male, with football-player build but skeletally thin (I'm one of those very few people whom doctors tell to GAIN weight). I'm effectively 17 (a week from being so at the time of this review). I'm not athletic at all; on the contrary, I get almost no exercise. My diet is generally healthy, plus I'm making an effort to actively consume more fruit, veggies ect. Also relevant to this review, I am completely scatterbrained and probably have ADHD.<br /><br />Here's the situation I took this in: I'd had Neruo Bliss the previous day and it had been a pleasant experience. In the morning I was giving a major speech at school for a rather large audience. I hate public speaking and I was giving the speech from an outline, so I was extremely nervous. I decided to stop and pick up a Neuro because all of the ones I'd seen claimed to enhance your concentration. I drank the thing gradually from the time I got to school to the time I got up to give the speech, which was about two hours later.<br /><br />First off, know that Neuro Passion is NOT designed to help you concentrate. I had assumed that from it saying it "enhanced cognitive ability". What other reviews on the web have said is that Passion is supposed to enhance your blood flow, giving you a general boost to improve your body's overall performance.<br /><br />The drink kicks in pretty quickly. You feel a nice, somewhat subtle boost similar to what Bliss does for most people. It's less of a "kick" than your typical energy drink but it can get you going. This strengthened as I consumed more of the drink - my heart rate increased somewhat and I felt like I was running at 125%. I felt confident about the speech as it drew nearer.<br /><br />However, in the moments leading up to the speech, my nerves intensified, and I am absolutely certain that Passion fueled that fire. DO NOT drink this during stressful situations; I have learned that Passion intensifies whatever sensations you are having at the time.<br /><br />I felt bad about my speech. People said afterwards that it had been good, but to me it had come out jumbled and inadequate. I'm normally not too shabby at giving speeches from an outline, in fact I'd done so twice on this particular assignment, but (and I think Passion was partly responsible for this) I had supreme difficulty.<br /><br />In short, Passion heightens whatever you're feeling already. Like a legal version of some sort of stimulant drug. Thus, use it to amplify already good vibes. (That's probably why the original marketing campaign suggested it as some sort of Viagra alternative). DO NOT (I repeat DO NOT) use Passion when you are nervous or tense.

review/text: The first time I tried Neurogasm, I had purchased it in a store.  I was a bit embarassed by the name and hid it from my 17 yr old daughter.  After my experience with the first bottle I looked for it in my home town and could not locate, so now I order by the case!!!  I use a lot of vitamins and have never had such help with my lowered libido.  I also like the NeuroTrim.

review/text: Well the effects of drinking this has yet to be determined, but the taste?  It's lightly cabonated as stated on the bottle, which I still think looks like a shampoo bottle, and tastes like someone flavored it with a bunch of ground up kid's chewable vitamins...remember what those Flinstone chewables tasted like...yes, like that.  So, a little wierd flavor, but not necessarily bad.

review/summary: Nice kick, great flavor, good on anything.
review/text: I love hot sauce.  I have been a big fan of other "insane" hot sauces, but the problem with them is that for the most part, they cannot be put directly on food, instead, they need to be diluted before they're okay for consumption.<br /><br />Not this hot sauce.  It's perfectly hot enough, yet not too hot to eat straight out of the bottle.  I put it on everything:  Burger too blah with the normal condiments, El Yucateco can fix it!  Shrimp cocktail not kicking, El Yucateco will show those shrimp who's boss.  I even use it to bring salsas up to the proper level of heat.<br /><br />It's definitely hot.  If all you're used to is normal, red-colored vinegar water, this hot sauce will open your eyes and set your mouth on fire.  But, if you're looking for something with good flavor that'll keep you coming back for more, this is the stuff.

review/text: it's true.  El Yucateco is the best hot sauce money can buy.  No gimmicks about how "insane" it is, and no suggestive catch phrases or clever names relating to how the heat will effect your digestive track.<br /><br />Tomatos and Haberneros.  End of Story.<br /><br />It is a very hot sauce,  but it also has a very good flavor that comes with the heat.  mmmmm.<br /><br />Lately I've seen it get redder.  I think they've added some food coloring.  That's weird and unnecessary,  but it tastes the same so I will not downgrade from the full 5 start rating.

review/summary: Servings Per Bottle = Greater Than One, Apparently
review/text: This New England winter is brutal. The winds keep howling, the temps keep dropping and the snow is pounding us like we owe the clouds money. Every day I'm bundling up and shoveling four feet of something -- snow, ice, stranded hybrids, Kennedys -- and I'm done with it. I just wanted to find some way to warm up.<br /><br />Also, to feel my toes again and have my [...] crawl back out of my rib cage. But I settled for trying to warm up.<br /><br />I've always heard that if you warm up on the inside, then the outside will follow. So I bought this bottle of El Yucateco and saved it for the next inevitable snowstorm. When I was done shoveling and still shivering, I opened it up and slammed it down the hatch -- all eight ounces.<br /><br />First, a few words about the taste: El Yucateco red has a nice tangy element, lingering through the forward habanero kick and beyond. The additional spices play well with the primary pepper, adding a savory depth that's more than just pure heat or capsaicin jolt. The tomato base and hearty thick texture promise a richness and complexity of flavor that is delivered quite nicely to the palate.<br /><br />And now, a few words about the unrelenting napalm burn that traveled around my mouth, down my gullet and -- over the next twelve hours or so -- into, through, and out my intestines, scorching and defiling every square millimeter of delicate insides that it touched: [...]<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this would make a very nice complement to a variety of Mexican or South American dishes, as well as grilled meats, starchy vegetables or as an extra kick to, say, garlicky green veggie side dishes. Also, it's unlikely that I'll be able to sit down without searing pain for at least a month. So 'use in moderation' is the take-home message, I suppose.

review/text: For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, El Yucateco has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not care for.  It is overpoweringly hot--with a searing heat--and has an odd, unenjoyable flavor.  Although not a terrible hot sauce--I consumed the entire bottle--El Yucateco is a hot sauce that I am glad that I tried, but it just is not my thing.

review/summary: Favorite all around hto sauce
review/text: If you like drenching you food with hot sauce I recommend this. It has a low sodium content so you can really poor it on and not worry about the negative impacts of high sodium intake. Its flavor is mostly hotness. This is great because you can add it to anything without compromising the initial flavor of the dish. Your essentially just adding some spice. If you haven't had this sauce try it!<br /><br />In summary, it is a great everyday hot sauce, more spice then flavor, goes on anything, is relatively inexpensive compared to other hot sauces. My favorite and go to hot sauce.<br /><br />P.S. for you skeptics I consider myself somewhat of a pepper head. I eat spicy level 10s with no problem, and I know the secret to prevent spice stomach aches... milk. I believe that validates my opinion.

review/text: Truly one of the best Mexican hot sauces available.  A refreshing change from the  "Coors light" hot sauces available.  I wouldn't lump it into the "insane" category at all.  It's just a good quality hot sauce and most of us are used to consuming weak, flavorless vinegar-downed sauces.  It does have heat, it's Habanero so you should expect that.<br /><br />Truly a great for any kind of Mexican or Central/South American food.  The tangy flavor and heat will make any food item more exciting.  And yes, you may sweat a little but that's to point of using hot sauce in the first place.  To add flavor and heat.

review/summary: Best flavor EVER!
review/text: I came across a bottle of this sauce and picked it up because my husband loves hot sauces. I don't like sauces that are so hot that you can't really taste the sauce. If I want to burn my tongue I'll use a lighter! I was pleasantly surprised at how much flavor this has. It is very hot right out of the bottle but not so hot that you can't enjoy the flavor. I add a little bit almost everything.<br /> I am almost out and can't find it again locally. I am so glad that Amazon carries it. Try mixing and heating a can of jellied cranberry sauce, a jar of chile sauce and about a TBSP of this sauce. Pour it over cooked meatballs and simmer in a crock pot. Great for parties. This sauce puts it over the top. Want to kick up hot wings? Add some of this to wimpy Tabasco sauce! This is hands down the best hot sauce I have ever tried. You cannot lose with this one!

Try this mixed with a bit of mustard or A1 to dip your steak in.  Or put it on any sandwich.  Must be used sparingly in liquid foods (soups, stews) as it is very hot.

review/summary: All three of my cat's rate it a BIG 10! 10! 10!
review/text: Simon, about 7 years old has some kind of adversity to most foods and throws up shortly after eating canned or dry cat food and nearly died from, can you believe, bronchitis? ...2 years ago. We have gone through many foods, dry and canned until I found Holistic Select canned cat food(He gets the Salmon or Ocean Fish). He loves it...and does NOT throw it up!!! ...even tho he only gets about 2-3 teaspoons morning and night and not a lot of dry, 2 x's day. He somehow still manages to weigh 14 pounds.<br /><br />Bella, a mostly gray with white chest and paws, about 10 years old would most likely fit within the widest part of a 16 oz soda bottle, in other words she is soooo skinny ...and might I mention FINICKY!  Her biggest nick name is Princess. She "cautiously" walks up to a new food I put down, sniff's it and IF she likes it, adjusts her sitting position, sometimes moving to a different angle before she slowwwly starts nibbling. She USUALLY does NOT like them and has this look on her face that says "You've GOT to be kidding me if you think I will EAAAAT THAAAAT!!!!! EWWWWWW!!!". She stands back up, shakes her paw and glances at me as she runs/hops off like a deer into the woods. Bella IS the reason I tried the Holistic Select. When I put the HS down for her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. She QUITE eagerly, without hesitation or any adjustment to her seating spot or angle dove in as if she had not eaten in a week or more. She will only eat the Salmon or Ocean Fish. I have tried the Duck and the turkey and "no way!" I would so like for her to gain at least one pound! I think she still weighs about SIX pounds and eats as much as a fly. To make sure she is the only one eating her food, I bought her a bird cage "dining room". She is the only one of the three cats that fits thru the entrance.<br /><br />Then there's Bob, a brown tabby! What about Bob is what we always say. Bob doesn't run from much and eats more than he runs from. The least picky, doesn't throw up and is, like Simon about 7 years old. They're best buds, btw. (Bob also nearly died about 2 years ago from liver disease.) Usually, Bob quietly hangs out by his bowl near the stove, tripping us or getting stepped on. Knowing he is going to get HS, he has frequently becomes quite vocal in anticipation of his "Happy" meal.<br /><br />I, THE cats so recommend trying Holistic Select. Petco, when they kept it ON their shelves, sold it for $2.49 a can(even if you buy a case of it!). They said they did not sell enough for them to stock it and encouraged me to order it thru their website. I always have to "shop around" and found it on Amazon for $1.90 a can. I'm IN and Petco is losing OUT! (Initially, I would encourage buying a can, if you can find it at petco to see if your cat will eat it. They will order some for you but u have to check back &lt;they don't call you when it arrives!>, they just put it on the shelf and it disappears FAST). Once you know it's good to go, order online. If you do the Prime shipping thing on Amazon, most everything you buy is shipped free.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br />~Yvonne

review/text: Desperation led me to try this food although I wasn't crazy about the brewers dried yeast or potatoes. I needed to try something without fish in it for my kitties when 2 of my 3 cats started to get flaky skin from food that did contain fish. I found it quite a challenge to find a good food that doesn't include some type of seafood.  As this one did not, I reluctantly decided to give it a try.  All 3 cats seemed to enjoy it, but I will not be buying it again.  Even though the moisture is only the usual 78%, it is so mushy and just awful to work with.  My girls didn't seem to mind, but between the consistency, yeast and potatoes this just doesn't cut it for my cats.  I'll have to be satisfied with fewer foods in their rotation.

review/text: I am sort of a chocolate snob but these are pretty tasty, especially since they are low-carb.<br />Prefect as a treat for diabetics and those on ketogenic or CKD diets.<br /><br />Just watch the weather when you order them - they are chocolate so of course they will melt real quickly if UPS leaves them on your doorstep in the heat.<br /><br />Problem is that sometimes Amazon seems to stop carrying them for a while.<br />I occasionally order them and keep them on-hand in case I want a treat when I see them listed with free shipping.

review/text: First let me say that I was highly skeptical of no sugar added chocolate, having never tried it before.  After one bite of this though, I'm a reformed skeptic forever.  These Ross chocolate bars are AMAZING and I had to check the packaging again to make sure they didn't ship me the wrong item...THAT'S how good they are! I will certainoly buy them again!

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/summary: Good bye to Amazon
review/text: I first fretted that we would not receive the flowers for Mother's day. We received them today and I wish we had not been so fortunate. The flowers are absolutely disgusting to the point my wife threw them at me when I walked in the door. The roses were brown alround the base pink and the foilage was all brown and quite dead. The baby's breath was also dead on arrival. I have never been so disgusted in my life and I will be paying for this for a long time. Speaking of paying I would have been far better off going to a local florist or even a super market.<br /><br />I have been buying from Amazon for years but this ends it. Please be so kind to remove my name from your rolls. I will do my very best to talk 10 persons a day to stay away from Amazon and a 100 persons a day to stay away from "PRO FLOWERS".<br /><br />John W. Hall

review/summary: 7 cats are rating 7 paws up
review/text: I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in p�t&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.

review/text: These cans do not have an easy "pop top" to remove the lid.  As a result you have to use a can opener.  Beware the sharp edges on the lid!  As for the product itself, our cats seem to like it, but I did notice a number of very small bones in each can.  Although I'm sure this is fine for the cats, it is a bit disconcerting for humans to see!

review/summary: Works for me 100%
review/text: I've used the full line; shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner and on days I don't wash my hair, I use the spray leave in conditioner.<br />I had permed my hair which dried it tremendously. I noticed the split ends and knew I had to find something better than what I was currently using (shampoo and conditioner for curly hair). I tried this line and I noticed a significant difference in the texture of my hair after just one use. My hair was conditioned but not weighed down and it didn't frizz like it normally did. It worked better than using actual styling products. I could actually shower and go when normally I couldn't because my hair always frizzed and puffed, especially at the ends where it was dry.<br />So I visited my hair dresser for a trim and she said I had NO split ends and whatever I was using is working and to keep using it. What a relief to hear. It validated this product because my hair dresser notices EVERYTHING. She'll be the first to tell me which side I sleep on because it's wearing on my hair more on one side than the other.<br />I don't ever blow dry my hair, ever. I let it air dry because it doesn't flatten out like if it was blow dried. I like body, not stick straight.<br />For the price of these products, I know it's a steal for me. $4 per large bottle that'll last a few months or longer depending on how often you wash your hair, I can't beat that! I paid a clearance sale price of $15 per bottle for salon brands that didn't work half as well. Now it's just sitting there going to waste because I'm not using anymore since I have found the right, perfect product for me. Thank goodness. I am grateful.

review/text: I tried this shampoo (as well as conditioner) and it was pretty pricy for shampoo so you'd think for the prices, it would work. But, it didn't. It gave me a little bit of shiny hair and a little bit of less split ends but it did NOT get rid of 80% of them in 3 days. It didn't get rid of 80% of them in 2 months!<br /><br /> It may work better for those who have thick hair, but I have fine, thin hair that I blow-dry and straighten every morning, so I have a TON of split ends. I needed fixing and this product was not my solution. I would not recommend this to anyone. Buy a cheaper shampoo that will actually do its job.

review/summary: I softened it in water for 6 min. & it still felt like straw.
review/text: The good things about brown rice vermicelli is that it's gluten free, cholesterol free, nearly fat free, very low in sodium, low in sugar, & had a nice amount of protein.  However, there are almost no detailed preparation directions.  Instructions on the bag say to soften the brown rice vermicelli in water at room temperature for 1 minute prior to cooking.  I did it for over 6 minutes & it still felt like straw.  I did heat olive oil & garlic over medium fire in a frying pan & added steamed veggies in with the vermicelli.  I stirred well & added mozzarella & marinara sauce.  No instructions are given as to how long you need to keep heating this mixture, so I played it by ear.  I stirred it often & when the vermicelli no longer felt like straw, the dish was finished.  It was quite tasty because of all the additions I made to this dish, but I'm not sure if I'll bother to look for this product again.  Portion size is my big bugaboo on all labels.  The portions always seemed to be sized for skinny fashion models.  In this bag of just 7 oz., there are supposedly 3.5 portions.  Laughable.  The entire bag contains 731.5 calories & that's before anything is added, to give it flavor.  The cover states that this is "naturally fat free."  Well, the bag contains 2.8 g of total fat, including over 1g of saturated fat; so while the fat content is very low - it is still not fat free.  It does include 11.2g of protein.  To me a logical portion would be half the bag, so you can cut these numbers in half.  I guess it makes for a healthy meal.  I'd give it 3.5 stars, but one can only give whole numbers here.

review/summary: good gluten free alternative
review/text: Following directions, I soaked the vermicelli in warm water at room temperature for over minute prior to cooking. I then stir fried (heated olive oil and garlic over medium fire in a frying pan) the vermicelli with parsley and veggies.<br /><br />The vermicelli has a very distinct taste that's crunchy and seaweed-like at the same time.<br /><br />The package comes with two recipes, and I didn't have enough vermicelli to try both recipes, choosing to try only the first recipe on the package.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good alternative to TV dinners and fast food, but it didn't taste as delicious as regular wheat pasta.<br /><br />If you are eating gluten free and looking for an alternative to wheat pasta, however, I'd recommend you give this product a try. It is not a significant source of any nutrients.

review/summary: Give it a couple tries.
review/text: I almost wrote a review for this product after using it only once.  I was not impressed with it at all.  In fact, this would have been a very negative review had I not tried it again.  The first time I soaked it for a minute like the directions said and then cooked it.  It tasted like straw!  I felt like throwing the rest of the package in the trash!  But, I decided to give it another try.  I soaked it for about ten minutes and then drained.  I used the recipe on the package called "Aglio Olio  Style".  Basically, it's stir fried vegetables.  I used red bell peppers, onions and shrimp.  I added creole seasoning and then the Brown Rice Vermicelli and some olive oil.  Stirred it off and on until the shrimp were cooked.  The vermicelli was very moist and soft.  It was delicious!  It actually came out like angel hair pasta.  I will be buying this again!<br /><br />On a side note, I was a little disappointed to note that the fiber count was not very high.  One of the reasons I like brown rice is for the higher fiber content. The total fat grams are very low.  The sugars are 2.2g and the protein is 3.2 grams.  Total carbohydrates are 47.1 grams.  It is cholesterol and gluten free.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious and how incredibly convenient
review/text: I am thoroughly impressed by this product.<br />Where to start?<br /><br />1. Brown rice based (healthier alternative to regular pasta)<br />2. Convenient - put in warm water for 1 minute and it's ready to cook? Amazing.<br />3. Absorbs flavors wonderfully (suggestion: try cooking it with a sauce based on balsamic vinegar)<br />4. It's like super angel hair pasta (very thin)<br />5. Easy to chew<br /><br />I made a stir fry with a sesame/balsamic vinegar sauce, chicken, onions, carrots and broccoli - it was delicious.<br /><br />The only problem, is that the package is 7 ounces (good for a 4-6 person meal) and it costs over 2 dollars each. If it was closer to $1 per packet, I would buy these regularly. I haven't seen this at food stores nearby, so I can't compare local prices..

review/summary: Very easy to prepare, fine taste, grainy texture
review/text: Comparing these noodles to regular vermicelli noodles is kinda like comparing brown rice to white rice.  These noodles have more flavor and more texture.  Regarding the texture, it is a bit grainy - very similar to any noodle made from a less processed grain.  So, these noodles will need a few chews before swallowing.<br /><br />As for taste, they taste a bit like brown rice.  No surprise.  A heavy sauce can mask the flavor.  More properly though, if you don't like brown rice you won't like these noodles.<br /><br />Prep was super easy.  Not as easy as indicated on the packaging though.  The package suggests a couple minutes in warm water.  It actually took 5ish minutes in hot water.  Just a soak and they were done.<br /><br />I tried two dishes with these noodles, both basically pesto.  The first one was:<br /><br />put hot tap water in a bowl, add noodles;<br />wait 5ish minutes, grab noodles and pour water out of bowl;<br />stir in olive oil, basil, salt, and garlic salt.<br /><br />No cooking, one bowl, one fork.  Not a gourmet recipe, but good enough for most.<br /><br />The second recipe was about the same as the first but I minced some garlic and cooked it in olive oil, then stirred the noodles and other ingredients (without garlic salt) together in the pan to get a bit of the fried noodle thing going.  It tasted fine but it isn't easy to stir fry these noodles.

review/summary: Ok, not that easy to work with really
review/text: I have tried cooking with this in a number of dishes now, almost all involving fish.  The first thing I noticed is that the package is not resealable, this is a downside to me as I only cook single or double servings, so I will not be using a whole package.  2.  Related to the serving size, this stuff is really hard to rip or tear to extract a portion of it rather than the whole package.  3.  The 1 minute soak in water before cooking might need tweaking.  The first few time I used it, 1 minute did not seem long enough for soaking and I was left with chewy vermicelli.  I went up to about 2 minutes and that seemed to work fine for me.  The stuff really has no really flavor of its own, but it does do a good job of picking up flavors of the food its cooked with.<br />Not bad all in all but for me personally, this stuff is a little bit more trouble than the payoff.  Its much easier for me to just buy a bag of steamable brown rice at the grocery store.  It does however have potential.

review/summary: Natural, But Is It Organic
review/text: The packaging description ,like many others are deceptive. Natural,but is it Organic I would be a regular buyer of this product, if it is Organic.<br /><br />The Vermicelli was easy to cook, My wife and kids liked it. I , frankly did not feel much different except that it was little more crispier and thinner than the store brand I used to get from grocery stores.( That is not the problem with this product, but in general of most gluten free products) . So it makes me think it is better served fried than making  water rich noodles. But again , why pay more to get a product which is only best served fried. Unless you have gluten allergy, safe to pass it on.

review/text: Good product, decent value and not low quality. The only reason I did  not give it five stars is that I dont eat alot of this rice so I want to be fair about my review. I cant' say its the best out there but I can tell you I've definetly had worse. It was a enjoyable accent to the meal I made.

review/summary: Good texture and taste, hard to handle
review/text: Having once lived in Japan for almost ten years, I'm a bit of a noodle freak. Ramen, soba, rice, glass, pasta, every kind of noodle is my friend. These noodles looked to be a promising candidate to join my circle of noodle friends. Unfortunately, these were a bit harder to get to know than most noodles.<br /><br />First of all, there is nothing on the package that tells you how to cook the noodles. There is an unhelpful (but critical) suggestion to soak the noodles in water for one minute (to soften them up), followed by two recipes. I'm assuming the recipes are a good way to enjoy the noodles (I didn't try them, however), but I just wanted to add them to some chicken soup I'd made. After soaking the noodles, I noticed that they had not gotten noticeably softer, and they were still quite bland. I decided to put them in a fry pan with some butter, and that did the trick. They softened up nicely as they absorbed the oil, and they were quite tasty after that. They were great in the soup, too. So with the preparation mystery solved, my second complaint is that the noodles are dry and very fragile coming out of the bag, and it was next to impossible to pull off a reasonable sized portion from the massive woven nest of noodles. Attempts at breaking them by hand ended with a flurry of noodle fragments all over the counter and floor (and probably the bottom of the bag of noodles, too). Same result with a knife. I suppose you could crush the bag before opening it to break up the noodles, but then where's the fun of the long, slender, slurpable noodle? I suffered through carefully pulling them apart and brushing the fragments into the pan to cook (and vacuuming the rest off the floor). But I say again, these were delicious noodles.<br /><br />So here's what you've got: very tasty noodles with great texture and flavor that require experimentation to figure out how to cook and that make a mess during preparation (unless you plan to eat the whole bag all at once). I'll sum them up as "clumsily delicious" and worth three and a half, okay four, stars.

review/summary: Bland But Easy to Prepare
review/text: The vermicelli is made from brown rice but doesn't have a heartier flavor than regular white vermicelli. When you think "brown rice" you would think it would be thicker, but it isn't. It has the flavor of tofu, which means it has no taste. Each noodle is thin, hair-like, and breaks off easily. When cooked it tends to melt and clump together. I used the recipe on the back of the package and substituted imitation crabmeat instead. The dish turned out OK, but the noodles are very bland tasting and I can see why chili sauce was recommended.<br /><br />My main issue is with the packaging. It's hard to measure how much noodles you need for 2 or more people. It's hard to open the package without tearing it - when I did the noodles spilled out all over the place. I soaked the first batch in cold water for a minute as directed and it was fine; however, when I realized I needed more noodles, it was hard to get them to soften quickly just by running the second batch under cold water - you really have to soak them.<br /><br />I can eat gluten so that wasn't as issue for me. It tasted OK but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy more.

review/text: My wife prepared the Brown Rice vermicelli to have with Spaghetti sauce in place of our normal angel hair pasta. The package came with easy-to-follow preparation instructions and she cooked the product accordingly.<br /><br />I tried the cooked Vermicelli before adding the sauce and found that it did not have much taste at all.<br /><br />I found it to be a little bit sticky and clumpy, but I honestly do not have a lot of experience with Vermicelli...<br /><br />I'm sorry but I'd not buy it again.

review/summary: A Delicious Addition!
review/text: When the noodles arrived, we had no idea how to cook them. The directions were very vague at best, so I went online to get an idea of exactly how to prepare and use them. The package says to soak in room temp. water for one minute, but that wasn't long enough to separate the noodles. I let them sit longer and used my fingers poke and wiggle apart the straw-like noodles. They did soften up, but before they were at a texture I thought I'd like, I drained them and then added them to my basic stir-fry, using the noodles in place of the rice. I just stirred them in the meat/veggie mix and let them cook a little. This made for a very delicious dinner - enough for 2-4 adult servings (depending on appetite).<br /><br />Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli makes a delicious addition to your Asian cuisine.

review/summary: ok
review/text: I made these noodles with the classic pho (soup). They were just fine, but nothing to rave about. Yes, they are made with brown rice, and somewhat healthier, but I wasn't enamored enough to buy them again.<br />Frankly, if I have a hankering for non-wheat noodles, there are always pure buckwheat, or white rice vermicelli. With enough vegetables and protein, you don't need the added little boost of brown rice noodles.

review/summary: Asian brown rice vermicelli
review/text: I admit it-when I ordered this item initially, I did not look at the package in great detail.  If I had, I would have noticed that the product is asian, not italian which I initally thought.  I thought I was going to get a box of italian vermicelli, ideal for a red spaghetti or a white wine sauce. Instead, I got a product that is ideal for someone who likes asian food, who is watching their cholesterol and their gluten intake.<br /><br />I prepared the noodles as advertised on the back of the package. I pre-soaked them, and heated them in olive oil and garlic.  Instead of serving them with red chilli, I put them with bell pepper and beef strips and added soy sauce at the end.  They were good-I thought they tasted a little tough, but that could be the noodle style.  I have never had noodles like these before.  They were different, but exciting, and I would try them again.

review/summary: Some technical difficulty, but in the end it all works out...
review/text: I was excited to try these noodles.  I love Tai food and these Singapore noodles strongly resembled glass noodles used in Taiwanese cooking.  That is something to keep in mind, considering that these are packaged as Vermicelli (which is another word for Angel Hair) and it is far more reminiscent of glass noodles.<br /><br />When cooking this product I found immediate detractors, and upon eating it I found immediate plusses.  It's kind of a mixed bag that could easily be tweaked to a perfected product.<br /><br />Cooking this Brown Rice Vermicelli is a bit difficult.  The main problem is that the packaging instructions are vague and don't really help you much.  Soaking this product for a minute doesn't do anything.  Soaking it for five minutes also doesn't really do anything.  It takes much longer to soften.  I eventually had to just take it out of the water and toss it in the frying pan in order to get it to soften.  The noodles have a hard time separating from one another and so it gets clumpy and you have to work with it a lot in order to get it apart, which causes many of the noodles to break.  Eventually, they do get to that required texture and you're ready to eat.  The first thing I noticed when eating this product is that it absorbs flavor really well.  Some pastas retain their starchy flavor even after mixing in with a sauce or vegetables, but this product soaked in rich flavors with ease and maintained those flavors.  The texture, once softened, is quite wonderful.  While the package states that there are only about three servings here, there is more than enough to eat once it is cooked up.  We have a family of four, and we all ate till we were full and had leftovers (granted, we made a meat to go along with our pasta, but most people do).<br /><br />So, despite some cooking issues, this is a tasty product.  It is also quite healthy.  Not only is this product Gluten, Fat and Cholesterol free, but the entire package is only about 600 calories.  I will mention price, which can always be an issue.  You're looking at a little over $2 a package if you purchase it at this site.  That is obviously more expensive than your usual box of pasta.  Even whole grain spaghetti (which is what we usually buy) is slightly less expensive (still in the $1+ area), but at the end of the day, $2 isn't a whole lot to spend on a tasty product that can feed your whole family.<br /><br />This is a product that requires a simple preparation.  Heavy handed sauces would overwhelm these tiny noodles.  Some vegetables, oil and herbs will do the trick; which is also a favor to your wallet.<br /><br />If the package instructions were clearer and more informative, I'd give this a higher rating, but cooking should never be a frustration.  At least the eating is very good!

review/summary: Poor cooking instructions and bland taste
review/text: This product really sounds like a healthy alternative to a dinner side dish. I was very excited to try it. But the instructions are very poor. As this is a new item for me, I tried my best to prepare the vermicelli per the package directions, and added some parsley, hot pepper, garlic and shrimp to jazz it up a bit. It came out very dry and tasteless.<br /><br />For those thinking of trying this, I hope you are very creative. Don't do what I did. Check online for a recipe or instructions that will make this a great meal addition.

review/text: Brown rice?  That's what my doctor suggested rather than white rice, bread, etc.  So, when this product was promoted the very next day, I figured i'd better order it.  It arrived promptly in good packaging.  7 ounces of pre-cooked rice is more than enough for a large meal for 1 or a side dish for a family.  I decided to experiment.  I tried the rice with and without mixed vegetables with a splash of soy sauce.  This rice is healthy AND it tastes very good.  I highly recommend it, for its flavor.  At about $2 a meal, it's very affordable.
