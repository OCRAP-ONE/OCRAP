review/summary: Product awesome, but 70% of the cans dented
review/text: 7 of 12 cans were bent significantly.  I believe it is due to no barries between cans.  I love, love, love amazon subscribe and save, but I have found that canned items and sometimes boxed liquids do fare well.  I don't hesitate to order papers goods, electronices, clothes, etc. but I wouldn't order anything canned if it weren't for Amazon's excellent policy on credits for damaged goods.  Will try this product again and update if 12 cans show up not dented.

review/summary: How many tomatoes in that itty bitty can?
review/text: Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes are excellent! Usually, one chooses between diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste--but these are fire roasted tomatoes. Muir Glen used to make fire roasted tomatoes in adobo sauce, luckily there's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011T8XGW">La Costena Chipotle Adobo Sauce, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> For adobo clarification, it's the Latin American kind, not the Filipino vinegar-based kind.<br /><br />These tomatoes are delicious in the Mexican breakfast eggs in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140132360X">Jamie's America: Easy Twists on Great American Classics, and More</a>, the chocolate/coffee chili at the website for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AFQRG">VegNews</a> They are quite versatile.

Fire roasted and fiery! They taste good... and are good for you.

review/summary: Change your can.
review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: should not be eaten
review/text: These are organic and taste good but the can is lined with bisphenol A (BPA) which leaches into the food. I hated wasting food but when I found out about BPA  I destroyed my remaining cans. I now use only glass jars or tetrapaks of tomatoes and Eden Foods BPA free canned beans. These may be organic but the can lining is especially harmful to young children and people of child bearing age.

review/text: I just love cinnamon flavor on certain foods. I bought this to add to ice cream - as a topping. Goes great with coconut - pineapple ice cream. I keep it at room temps for easing pouring. Also works great on sliced apples from our trees which I fry in a pan in butter and then pour a little bit of this over the apples. Yummy! It's a little thick but still pours easily. Do not microwave the bottle - the label gets too hot and bubbles up.

review/summary: Contains wheat!
review/text: The listing didn't list any other ingredients, so I thought I was buying asafoetida.  As it turns out, it is a compounded substance that lists asafoetida after rice flour and gum arabic and before turmeric and wheat flour.  Not only was this a surprise because I had no idea that there were fillers, but I have celiac disease, so the stuff is actually toxic for me.

review/summary: Packaged for export market.
review/text: Be forewarned.  This is not the pure spice but a watered down mix for the export market.  I suppose I can live with that but I would have liked to have known it when I purchased it.  I had never heard of this Indian spice before until a recent recipe book by Madhur Jaffrey kept demanding its use.  I guess it adds a certain subtle flavoring to the dishes but my palate really isn't that discerning.  I think you have to use more than the recipes demand since this is adulterated with a filler.

It also isn't pure asafoetida---I should have read the other reviews. Also the bottle is about 1/4th empty. Hopefully it will work for my recipes though.

review/summary: great addition to recipes
review/text: i have been cooking indian food for almost three years now and i always used to substitute for this unique spice that i can never get in local groceries. my recipes are much better with it however, once you get the spice you should transfer it to a glass jar with a tight fitting lid because the spice does have a powerful sulfer smell before it is cooked. adds depth and complexity to dishes. WARNING: the manufacturers add a lot of filler to this asafoetida like rice flour, gum arabic, turmeric and wheat flour.<br /><br />i will likely try to find a purer source next time i purchase this spice.

review/summary: Stinky but makes the dish
review/text: Yes, this spice smells bad! Yes, you do have to keep it separated from your other spices, but, it adds so much flavor and new depth to your Indian dishes that it's so worth the initial odor. Once this spice is added to your pan, it takes on an entire new smell unlike what it is in the container. I use this in my Sambar and have even used a bit in my potatoes and bell peppers for added flavor. You only need about a half a teaspoon because it is strong. Wonderful addition to the Indian spice rack!

review/summary: Deliciously different little wafer cookies
review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies.

review/text: Once you try this piece of chocolate you will fall in love with it. Probably one of the best nonbar chocolates produced in Switzerland and Europe as a whole. And I think it is rather cheap for the quality you get.

review/summary: Amazingly light & Delicately sweet
review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: The Best Cookies!
review/text: My husband and I have been buying these cookies locally for years because we love them so much; they are far better than the milk chocolate version (but then, we love DARK chocolate!). In the past couple of years, our local grocer has stopped carrying them, we would request them, they would get them for a few months, and then they would stop carrying them again. I am so glad to see that I can get them via amazon.com! These are wonderful cookies with warm milk, cold milk, or a little Scotch . . . mmmmmmm!

review/summary: Great cookies--don't buy in the summer
review/text: These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive, but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/summary: Absolutely Wonderful!
review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

review/text: If you've had these cookies already - no one needs to sell them to you. I would just recommend that you keep them in the freezer. That way they're sort of hidden from you (and others) but for some reason freezing them brings out the taste and consistency of the chocolate. Try it!

review/text: I don't know what Bahlsen was thinking over the last several months, but I looked high and low for these cookies in supermarkets and specialty stores...none were to be found. Then, after checking with Amazon (and its tracking mechanisms), Voila! I ordered a whole case and that should satisfy our deep appreciation of these cookies... a perfect blend of high quality dark chocolate and a crisp, thin "chocolate vehicle"--i.e., cookie.

review/summary: Good with coffee
review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.

They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.

When I told him it was Pro Flowers, he said he'd had a negative experience with them and wouldn't use them again.<br /><br />When his flowers arrived, they were wilted.  Expedited meant that it took  from Thursday to Tuesday to have the flowers delivered.<br /><br />He was expecting the worst, and I guess he was right. As usual.

review/text: The flowers were delivered on-time and my ("sender") name and other details were not shared to person whom I sent the flowers was ensured ,which is appreciated. Very pleased with the effeciency demonstrated by the vendors promoted through Amazan. Their rating also helps in selecting the vendor. Thanks very much. If possible, enable us to make payment in our countries' currency rather than in dollars. It make the entire puchasing even more hassle free.

review/summary: Wilted dead Tulips_spoiled my wife's day
review/text: I ordered these Tulips for $40 from Amazon. These were delivered in a box and when my wife opened them we were disappointed because several flowers were broken and all were wilted. I could have bought $10 worth of fresh flowers from WALMART/Schnuck's and had a better birthday surprise. Never buy flowers from Proflowers people.

review/text: I had this arrangement sent to my mother for her birthday in February. She's the type that you never know what to get her because she already has everything shd could possibly want or need, and she doesn't want you to spend any money.  This purchase was a home run.  She really, really loved it.  The price was excellent.

review/summary: Best I've had so Far
review/text: These bars have good nutritional value with some unsaturated fats a decent amount of carbs and protein and a 100% daily value of I think every B vitamin. It'd be nice if it had a little more protein, but for the price it does have a fair amount and it has a substantial amount of B vitamins.  It tastes good, unlike most protein bars, and is a great quick snack to keep me going.  I generally have one about two hours into my 11 hour shifts at work sometimes 15 hour shifts and I always finish the day off well.  I'd still like to try some of the Snickers Marathon bars, but so far this is the best I've had.  Oh yeah and the price is great considering the quality and market that it competes with, I generally buy these at Speedway for $1.79 a bar compared to others that go for $3-4. I've found some that go a little cheaper, but they haven't had as good nutritional value and they've tasted terrible.

review/text: We use this product all the time.  It's one of the best coating mixes ever made.  The meat stays moist while the coating gets nice and crispy.  It's also great as topping on casseroles instead of bread crumbs.  This is the best price I've ever seen. It rarely if ever goes on sale in the supermarket, so if you use this product with any regularity, this is the place to buy it!!

The average price at the local stores in my area is 1.59 and you multiply that by 8 and its less than 13 dollars at retail.

review/summary: If you like Cream of Wheat you'll like this cereal.
review/text: First let me say, to counter the other review on this page saying that the mixture is mostly "corn and rice", that the grain mixture per the label on the bag is as follows:<br /><br />Organic corn, rice, wheat, rye, millet, oats and barley<br /><br />Yes, you can taste the corn but you can also taste the wheat over tones along with the other grains.  This is not a bland mush with no flavor.  If a person has never cooked whole wheat grains or cooked cracked wheat they might not recognize the flavorful taste and smell of wheat plus the other grains.  If you are still unsure about buying then check to see if you can buy a smaller bag of this combination before springing for a 25 pound bag - a lot of cereal grain to wind up unhappy with.<br /><br />Great change of pace from hot oatmeal and cream of wheat.  A couple of recommendations:  Use a teflon coated sauce pan, keep fire as low as you can get it and stir frequently.  If you use a regular pan, cover and walk away fixing other things for breakfast you're libel to come back to a stuck mess in the bottom of your pan. Just don't forget or ignore. The flavor is very much like a "punched up" Cream of Wheat.  A hearty breakfast with a variety of flavors.  This grain is also ideal for sprinkling over bread dough before popping into the oven - gives a great crust to peasant style breads.  I make a nice "no knead" bread dough that is oily and somewhat wet when turned out of the dough pan and the grains stick nicely.  This bread is plopped into an already heating (500-515 degree oven) cast iron casserole, lid replaced and baked 30 minutes with lid on and 10 minutes w/o lid to brown.  Terrific bread - see video for this recipe on Mark Bittman's site at the New York Times for "No Knead Bread."  Great cereal and will buy again!

review/summary: Mainly Rice and Corn  -- disappointed
review/text: The product is mainly rice, and not very well milled rice at that.  Second Ingredient is corn, I found whole corn kernels in the bag.<br /><br />It does have rye etc. but the rice is overpowering, and considering that you can get 20lbs of rice for $7-8 at an asian market, this product seems overpriced.<br /><br />I thought this was going to be comparable to the traditional muslix type breakfast cereals (oats, rye, barley, wheat) but it is corn,rice, barley, millet etc and tastes pretty bad -- If you want the experience of this cereal, overcook some rice, and throw some oatmeal + bird seed into it...<br /><br />I tried to eat this for 4 days,  decided well if its not that healthy, and taste bad, why am I even bothering.  the birds in the back yard can enjoy it, because i didn't.
