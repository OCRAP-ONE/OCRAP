review/summary: Green Apple Gum
review/text: I am so happy to have found this gum that I so fondly remember from my past.  This is the gum that was 2 cents at some drug stores, maybe 5 cents at others.  I love the flavor although it doesn't last more than a few minutes.  It will bring you back to those good old days where Grandma gave you a nickel and you had to choose wisely.  This green apple gum was almost always the way I spent my nickel...and worth every penny!

It is green in the wrapper and turns blue in your mouth! So cool and so yummy! Blows big bubbles!

review/text: I BBQ quite a bit w/a real emphasis on Chicken & Pork.  I'm guessing that the Korean culture perfected BBQ sauces when the USA was a dream some thousand years away.  Give this stuff a shot on chicken, ribs or tenderloin.  I was skeptical but thouroghly rewarded upon my first use.  You can use this as a marinade as well as a mop/baste with great results.  Not a great dipping sauce on a standalone basis but it's strength is when heat is applied.

review/summary: A Good, Basic Seltzer
review/text: I've been buying this brand of seltzer water from my local grocer for many years.  In fact, I have a bottle of this next to me on the desk right now to sip as I surf.  I wasn't even looking for this, in particular.  Coincidence? In my case, probably not.<br /><br />Something about the bubbles settles my stomach.  (I weaned myself off of Coke and the like years ago, but I still want my fizz!)<br /><br />This has been a good and dependable brand as long as I have known it, and that's a long time.  My only caution, and this is important, is to unscrew the cap SLOWLY the first time, because otherwise, you may get an unexpected baptism.  It doesn't happen every time, but it's happened aften enough to make me very careful!<br /><br />If you like seltzer, you'll like this.  I also recommend the lemon-lime flavor as well as the orange and raspberry varieties.  I'm not wild about the cherry.  I'd rather drink the plain than the cherry, but that's a personal thing.  I also use this product to top up my Crystal Light type drinks to give them a little "pop."  Pun intended.<br /><br />Oh, and in answer to the other reviewer, it's one liter bottles, 12 of them to a case. I drink it warm, I drink it cold.  I just like it.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: I usually like Stonewall Kitchen products, so I was excited to see one of my favorite recipe book author lending her name to a product.  I finally bit the bullet and shelled out $10+ for a boxed mix and I was SOOOO disappointed!  The box comes with three packets - the cake mix, coconut, & "frosting mix" (which is just powdered sugar).  The cupcakes were okay - they were pretty moist, but I used all the coconut in the cake rather then reserving 1/3 for the topping (I used additional store-bought coconut for the topping).  The "frosting" was awful - it's the packet of sugar mixed with butter and cream cheese and it was very bad when made as directed.  I added in about another cup of powered sugar to make the constancy spreadable and taste right.<br /><br />Over all, the cupcakes were a hit, but for a $10+ mix that makes 12 cupcakes I shouldn't have to buy and add my own ingredients!  I could have easily done this from scratch for the same or less money and it would have been just as simple!

I couldn't wait for them to cool to frost them and the top of the little cupcakes were nice and crunchy (I may have baked them for a couple of minuted too long). They were fantastic with and without the frosting! I got the original recipe off of Food TV's website, made it and the end product tasted exactly the same as the boxed one I'd made. I will probably not buy the box again since I have the recipe and can make more with less money from that. I do highly recommand this though!

review/text: Very tasty. We eat them in place of a candy bar. I do not know if you could say these are really healthy but they taste really yummy and I am sure they are much healthier than a candy bar. Full of nuts and little chunks of dark chocolate. The chocolate has a good flavor, not bitter. So if you get a craving for a candy bar just reach into your brief case or purse and eat one of these instead. These are sweet but they don't set my teeth on edge like a candy bar does. Ours were fresh and chewy, I wonder if the other reviewer might have got an old batch or something. These are wrapped individually and are great to throw in a back pack, purse or in the car for a snack on the run.

review/summary: I used to absolutely love this!-EDIT
review/text: (Update on May 22, 2012) I used to absolutely love this granola bar! One problem, in the last 2 batches of subcription I received, I've noticed they changed the recipe! Bad mistake, General Mills! The current variation is now more sticky and tougher to chew. The taste is not as balanced as before either, and the nutritional value is different.<br /><br />Calories are the same, but the Total Fat is increased. Saturated Fat is decreased, but the Sodium increased, carbs is increased. Fiber is DECREASED with Sugars INCREASED! What this means for me is what used to be a 4 Weight Watchers Points Plus breakfast, is now 5 points. Sure it's only 1 points, but the taste isn't as good any more.<br />In the ingredients list one notable difference is that there is now less dark chocolate chunks, but more sugar.<br /><br />All in all, I wish they would go back to the old recipe. It's still good, but not as great as before.<br /><br />---- Earlier review: (5/9/11) ----<br />This is a chewy delicious granola bar that is pretty sweet but not overly so because it has dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate.<br />The almonds give it a nice crunch, and there is a peanut-butter-like layer on the bottom, and I dont even like peanut butter that much and I love it.<br /><br />I'm on the Weight Watcher Points Plus and I was looking for a nice filling granola bar that I can either eat as a breakfast bar, or as dessert, and it fits both perfectly, and at 4 points per bar, I still have enough points to eat a good portion lunch or dinner.<br /><br />I highly recommend it so much that I'm going to get an amazon subscription for it!

review/summary: Nature Valley Sweet & Salty Nut
review/text: So far, Nature Valley Sweet & Salty Nut is the best bar for my use.  I carry them on my motorcycle for a quick and easy snack on the road.  They work well for me because they don't crumble or get sticky goo on my hands.  Easy to eat and handle is a big deal when there are no clean-up facilities.  Oh, yeah, they taste great too.

review/summary: Good Tasting Granola Bars - Recommended
review/text: These Nature Valley "Sweet & Salty Nut Granola Bars" are good for between meal snacks and are fairly filling. While not very big, these bars pack a lot of flavor and energy that make them a real treat and I like that my kids will eat these in place of a candy bar.<br /><br />The only issue with these is that the bottom peanut butter layer can be come very soft and messy when heated up by a warm day of from being held in the hand too long, but I have learned to eat these held in the open wrapper to avoid the problem.<br /><br />My family also enjoys <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMOCDA">Nature Valley Sweet & Salty Nut Granola Bars, Peanut, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Fresh and Yummy
review/text: Worth every penny - fresh and well packed from Maine to Seattle in one day.  Packed in 2 pound "netted" packages surrounded with "blue ice" packages for refrigeration. All in a sturdy styrofoam container and boxed. Out of my 4 pound order, only 3 of the clams were broken and had to be thrown away. All the others were fresh and "closed". Cleaning and cooking instuctions included. Maine steamed clams are one of the most tender varieties - not chewy like little necks or other varieties.  Steam 10 minutes, take beard off neck, dip in butter and arrive in Heaven.

review/summary: fine pasta, but beware the size
review/text: FYI this alphabet pasta is called "soup cut" size, but a better description would be 'teeny-tiny'.  It is much smaller than the alphabet pasta in canned soups, which is the size I thought I'd be getting.  I have a son who, oddly, will try anything in ABC/123 form, so I thought I'd try to get him to eat pasta with these, and I couldn't find them in any store locally.<br />These letters are so small, I had to put the meat sauce on the plate and then the letters on top, just so the kids would see what they are.  They'd be completely lost under a ladle of sauce.  To give you an idea, I'm guessing a bowl of alphabet soup has MAYBE 50-75 letters in it?  A child would have to eat hundreds of these letters to equate one meal.  There must be well over 1000 in a small package.<br />I also used them to make "frog-eye salad,' which it was a good size for.  But now I have several bags left over I'm tempted to hand out to friends for free!  Come to think of it, maybe I'll let the kids use some for arts/crafts.  But they could write an entire book with just one bag!

The box of 12 packages cost a little more than when available in local store, but the look on my grandchildren's faces and the fun they had with their dinner, made it well worth the expense. It also pleased an eighty-six year old mother-in-law who also had not been able to find alphabet pasta for many years. The pasta was well-packaged, fresh and cooked up very well.

review/text: I have been looking for healthier sweeteners.  Coconut sugar is supposed to be less processed and I do like the taste.  It is fragrant, with subtle layers of coconut flavour, so if you don't want your beverage to acquire any additional flavour then this is not for you.  It is also less sweet than regular white sugar, which is good.  Overall, I think the flavour is lovely and it doesn't bother me even in teas like Earl Grey.

review/summary: Great item but not a great price!
review/text: My children (almost 3 & 1-1/2) love squeezable fruit & veggie pouches.  This product is a great way to sneak in veggies for picky eaters and a great way to have variety and meet your daily values when out and about; I also find them to be a great snack. However, it is very difficult to find pouches with veggies at the local stores; mostly fruit pouches are sold, not many organic ones.  So I went to Amazon.  While I was happy to find Happy Tots by Happy baby (one of my favorite brands) the price was not that great.  I later found it for substantially less ($2 less) at a local organic market.  As to taste, while i've tried all other flavors and levels/stages, I will say that there is a particular taste to the Happy Tots because of the addition of a particular grain (Salba).  Give this product a try and see if your kids like it.

review/summary: Ganocafe Classic
review/text: Ganocafe is a product derived from coffee, so it retains the flavor of coffee, but the Reishi mushroom is what I enjoy most about this product. Reishi mushroom is not an easy ingredient to find and has been touted as a wonderdrug for hundreds of ailments and preventative for even more, including many forms of cancer.<br />I'm unable to consume caffeine, so I had to find alternatives. Many coffee alternatives taste too "earthy" or "forest-y" and not much like coffee at all.<br />This is the best that I've found.<br />The classic style is no cream, no sugar, just a plain old cup of coffee and while it's not exactly like coffee, it's the closest to the real flavor.<br />For all the people out there who can't drink coffee, enjoy!

review/text: Does ganoderma do all it's said to do?  Heck, I don't know.  I do know that when I drink it in the morning, I seem to think more clearly throughout the day.  At 60, this is a good thing.  I also doubt it's the placebo effect, or the green tea I drank for years would have done the same thing.  So I think it must have at least some of the health benefits it's touted to have.<br /><br />That said, even without the ganoderma, this is just plain good coffee and for far less than running through the local Starbucks (more convenient too).  So there's really not much to lose in trying it.<br /><br />This vendor is very fast and attentive.  Nice job!

review/summary: Surprisingly Economical, Convenient, Healthy
review/text: My husband and I have been pleasantly surprised by how much we've come to love this product. We tried Ganocafe because a friend gave us a sample. At first it seemed a little pricey to use the individually packaged servings. But once I realized how often we were throwing out a half-drunk pot of coffee, or all the times I used to run by a drive-thru for a cup of coffee I didn't have time to brew, it makes more sense to use the individual packet with hot water from our dispenser. We buy the regular flavor, and it compares well with freshly brewed. My husband prefers Ganocafe to brewed coffee, because the Ganocafe doesn't bother his stomach the way regular coffee does. That might be explained by our distributor friend's assertion that the Ganocafe doesn't contain the acid of regular coffee (I've never researched that claim). I also notice that regular coffee can give me a little tickle in my throat, but I don't experience that with Ganocafe. I always keep a packet of Ganocafe in my purse, and when I'm really desperate for coffee and can't get to hot water, I've even been known to pour Ganocafe into a chilled water bottle, shake well, and drink it as a cold beverage. I've lost count of how many times we've reordered this product, which is now a staple in our cupboard.

review/summary: Stuff ain't bad.
review/text: I know a couple people who rep for Gano USA. I was recently given a small sampler pack that had two of each of their coffee's in it. I usually don't drink coffee on a regular basis as most brands make me feel like I dropped an acid bomb in my tummy (Starbucks is like an acid neutron bomb to the gut). Ganocafe Classic is pretty good stuff especially if you like your coffee black. Low acidity and a great taste and it doesn't give you the jitters like a lot of those energy drinks on the market. I know some of you that rely on western culture might think the red mushroom and it's healing properties is a gimmick but I believe it really works. My dad swears by this stuff and it even helped him take positive steps to get over the bottle and some of the long term effects that my pops was suffering from due to overuse of the bottle. Now I'm not saying this is the be all and end all cure to everything including cancer and aids but I will say that this stuff does work. I feel like I got more pep in my step and can't recall feeling that crashing feeling from it. I will be ordering a box or two of the classic for the office. As a matter fact all the flavors I have tried so far are pretty darn good (Ganocafe Mocha, 3-in-1 and the classic).

review/summary: I've become a coffee snob since trying this
review/text: My reaction to my first sip was, wow, that is the smoothest coffee I've ever had.  That was a little over a year ago, and I haven't been able to drink a "regular" cup of coffee since then. My boyfriend and I have been called coffee snobs because we won't drink any other coffee!<br /><br />Because it's instant, you can adjust the strength to your taste. We have found that one packet makes two cups of coffee for us.  One packet to one cup of water was way too strong, so we doubled the water and now it's perfect for us.  It doesn't have any added sweeteners or creamers like some of the others, so you can add whatever you want or nothing at all.  I usually like a little agave and almond milk in mine, but this is actually the only coffee I've ever had that I can drink black and not gag.<br /><br />One nice thing is that it's in packets, so it travels well.  I keep one in my purse, take some to work, and we pack some when we travel.  I can always have "my" coffee wherever I go.  Added BONUS that it's non-acidic and very low caffeine.  I'm hooked!

review/text: Even though I'm not supposed to be drinking coffee due to my UC condition and low vitamin absorption problem I started getting hooked, especially since it was the only thing that took care of my migraines. My doctor recommended I try Gano Cafe instead. I was very skeptical at first and worried about the taste because despite my body getting used to caffeine I really liked the taste of coffee. The first time I tried Gano Cafe I couldn't believe how delicious it was! I dare to even say it tastes better than regular coffee! I have never been able to drink my coffee black so I do add some creamer and a little bit of brown cane sugar. It's so smooth and creamy. I like the fact that it has antioxidants, or so it says...I looked up this Reishi mushroom extract stuff and was amazed at all the health benefits. Some reviews report feeling better but the only difference I notice right after drinking this is experiencing a slight feeling of mellowness, which I'm not sure if it's a good thing because I've never been a morning person and feeling sleepy while working isn't ideal for me.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike about Gano Cafe is the smell when first mixing it in. Can't describe it but to me it definitely doesn't smell like regular coffee. At first I was disappointed that it came in individual packets like the instant coffees but after seeing how much coffee it makes and how amazing it tastes I was fine with that. Plus this way I can keep some in my purse. Overall I'm very glad I made the switch.

In my opinion it must be providing some benefits, I haven't had even one cold or any flu in that time. At age 71 years my blood pressure is lower than my doctor's nurse. I actually generally just feel better all around than I have in years. A daily 1 mile walk and an hour exercising in the pool could have some bearing on my general health. I recommend trying Ganocafe Classic, you will probably see a difference.

review/summary: great pepper blend, too light on the Lime
review/text: The pepper blend was exceptionally good.  The lime flavoring was very light and got lost.  With a little tinkering and experimenting (infusing with lime juice, or just dousing the food with extra lime juice), we made it work. But as the man said, "close, but no cigar".

review/text: I've always loved tic tacs and fruit-flavored candies so when I spotted these "new" fruit adventure flavored tic tacs, I just had to try them. And they did not disappoint. The fruit flavors are intense and tangy. I'm a fan of orange tic tacs, but these are my new favorites. Now I just have to hide them from the others in my household, who also seem to love them!

review/text: These treats are a hit with my two med-lg dogs ( 45 and 80 lbs). I buy the small-medium size dog treats for them, though and I find that size to be perfect. They would be a bit large for a smaller dog. My two are so enamored of them that al I have to say is "Scooby-Doo" and they come running. A-One in Our Book!

review/summary: My dog's preferred snack.
review/text: My picky Italian Greyhound goes crazy for these!  Definitely his favorite snack of many.  There are four distinct flavors and the dog even gets more excited for some over others.  Firm/dense but not rock hard.  Enough to give a decent teeth cleaning but little dogs can still break them apart.  They crumble when chewed but not particularly messy like some dry snacks.  I was really disappointed to not find them locally anymore but at least we can get them online.

review/text: These premo treats are getting harder to find locally, and the dog loves them. Supplier got them to us fast with a great price. The product is good for large dogs and smaller dogs, but probably not under 20 lbs.; the treat size might be too generous for little guys.<br /><br />Big dogs love the great portion size. Both treats for small and large dogs are appropriate for most dogs. Large treats are especially grand for big dogs since many treats on the market rarely meet their requirements for  satisfaction. One large Scooby Snack will be very well received by the biggest dogs, saving you $$$.

review/summary: Perfect for stuffing them into kongs and other toys!
review/text: These are perfect for stuffing toys, like kongs and other types with smaller holes.<br /><br />I put round and square ones into my Aussie's large regularly shaped kong, and the biscuit-looking ones into my rat terrier's stuffable chew toys. She doesn't get the regularly shaped kong, because her jaw is smaller than the kong's opening, so she fishes the cookies out very easily. She gets other toys (from Petsmart) which are very tough as well, but have smaller openings, like KONG Stuff-A-Ball. It takes her over 20 minutes to get them out.  These cookies are much harder than regular biscuits. It takes her 5 minutes to get the regular biscuits and snaps out of any toy.<br /><br />my rat terrier is a very powerful chewer...

She loves taking people over to where the Scooby Snacks are, and show them, so she can get a snack.<br /><br />But....holy yikes the price. It would be five star if not for the price. It's easily double, more like triple the price of other vendors. Amazon, do you really expect us to pay 11$ a box? It was bad enough when they were 7$ a box. You are only inspiring me to look elsewhere. That makes me sad. It's so much easier to order from Amazon, but not at that price.

Then I saw on Food Network Brian Boitano cooking (who knew he could cook?) and he used a tube of tomato paste. I ordered two tubes of Amore Italian Tomato Paste, it was exactly what I wanted. I used 3 tablespoons, put the rest in the fridge and the dish tasted great. I highly recommend Amore Italian Tomato Paste in a tube.

review/text: I read in an Italian cookbook that this was the best widely available tomato paste. It is.<br /><br />A taste-test alone confirms that this is a robust, full, tomato-tasting paste. I've used it in spaghetti sauce, pizza sauce, and various red sauces, casseroles, stews, soups, crock-pot recipes, and potroasts.<br /><br />It's also economical. Though it's more expensive than the can of generic tomato paste, it comes in a resealable tube. You never have to throw any out!<br /><br />It's the little things that make a good recipe great. This paste is one of those little things.

review/text: The tomato flavor is inferior, the taste is extremely acidic compared to others, and there is a weird, sweet-metallic aftertaste. Even a small amount taints everything it is used in with the odd aftertaste, which I assume comes from the packaging. I am throwing the remainder of the tube away and using a canned brand from now on. Even if I throw away half the can, it would be less expensive, and more edible. When compared to home-made tomato paste, or even cheap canned brands, this product simply doesn't measure up.

review/summary: Contains GMOs! We say NO!
review/text: Kellogg's Corn Flakes cereal contains genetically modified organisms which have been patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in this product. They are also made to be resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate, an herbicide, which is linked to birth defects, cancer, organ damage and inflammatory bowel disease. It also has insecticidal properties and kills off beneficial gut flora. These GMOs have not been subjected to independent, long term, peer reviewed studies to prove that they are safe. These GMOs make my family sick. We do not pour pesticides on our food and we no longer eat anything that is an EPA registered pesticide.  GMOs are linked to organ damage, faulty insulin regulation and obesity, autoimmune disease, autism and a whole host of other health and environmental problems. Kellogg has contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California which is spreading lies to convince people that they should vote again GMO Labeling (prop. 37) in California on Nov. 6th because they don't want you to know that Corn Flakes contain GMOs. Corn Flakes are NO LONGER G-R-RRREAT. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled. Kellogg does not use GMOs in these countries. We are boycotting all Kellogg's products. Join GMO Free USA, a grassroots consumer email initiative that is contacting Kellogg en masse with emails to tell them to Just Label It or remove it. Americans have the right to know what's in their food! [...]

review/text: Kellogg's does not disclose that the ingredients in their cereals contain GMO's. That means the corn and sugar have had their DNA spliced with another species, usually a toxin or a bacteria. Kellogg's has contributed over 600,000 dollars to prevent laws that would require labeling of GMO's. But most Americans agree that they have a right to know what is in the food they are buying and feeding to their children.

review/summary: Unacceptable ingredients
review/text: I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason:<br />Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels.  There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers.
