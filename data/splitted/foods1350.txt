review/summary: DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN
review/text: While I have not had the privilege to taste home-made, micro-brewed root beer made with the real thing (meaning sasaparilla), this packaged brand is in a class by itself.  Taste-test it next to the popular brands--no challenge.<br /><br />In my area (NJ/NY metro), there are two versions of VIRGIL'S ROOT BEER available: the standard 12 oz bottle, usually sold in a 4-pk and the BAVARIAN LIMITED.  Both are sweetened with unrefined cane, an improvement over refined white sugar. So much for the health claims, now onto the important part:<br /><br />The taste is authentic--real sasaparilla.  The BAVARIAN type, with a cork-metal clasp bottle similar to Grolsch Beer, has augmented herbs, particularly nutmeg.<br /><br />It is the best root beer I have ever sampled.  Period. Final answer. No challenge.

review/summary: Virgil's Special Edition Bavarian Nutmeg Root Beer! :)
review/text: My sister brought home one bottle (1 Pint .8 oz (500 mL)) of Virgil's Special Edition Bavarian Nutmeg Root Beer last week. We shared the bottle. This root beer comes in a unique bottle with a flip cap. This bottle is so nice that most people would keep this as a collector's/souvenir item - my sister is keeping this bottle. On the label, it says that this root beer won an award for "Outstanding Beverage". It's micro-brewed with 100% natural ingredients including: anise, honey, licorice, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, wintergreen, cassia oil, sweet birch, molasses, carbonated water, natural caramel color, and unbleached cane sugar. This special edition root beer uses well water from the Bohemian Forest region of Bavaria. Virgil's say on their bottle that Bavaria is one of the purest sources in the world for water. I've actually visited part of the Bavarian region in the past, and I have to agree with Virgil's in terms of excellent water and brewing coming from the Bavarian region (I highly recommend visiting Munich's Hofbrauhaus brewery, Munich's Marienplatz to view the Glockenspiel, Munich's Frauenkirche and then the next day taking a train from Munich to Fussen, and then a bus to Schwangau where you can explore two awesome Bavarian castles - Schloss Hohenschwangau with an overview of Lake Alpsee and Schloss Neuschwanstein (the long hike to this magnificent castle is worth it!)). That's great if you can buy 16 bottles of Virgil's Special Edition Bavarian Nutmeg Root Beer on Amazon, but if you're on a budget and could only afford to buy one or two bottles, there are two places on the Internet where you can buy a bottle - Hi Time Wine and Munchies Sweets and Treats. Hi Time Wine sell a bottle for $4.99, and Munchies Sweets and Treats sell a bottle for $6.75. I checked the official Virgil's website and they sell most of their other products except the Virgil's Special Edition Bavarian Nutmeg Root Beer. If you stumble upon this special edition root beer when you're doing your grocery shopping in person, I highly suggest that you buy a bottle or two right away - because this special edition root beer is not an easy product to find. And if you're a root beer fan, this is something you must try. This would make a highly appreciated gift for those you know who are fans of root beer.

review/text: I discovered Virgil's Special Edition about six years ago and haven't looked back. Their regular root beer is not quite as good as their special edition (but still tasty), so I always go for the special edition when I can find it. Virgil's black cherry creme is also exceptionally good.

review/summary: great coffee, little bacon
review/text: Just bought a french press so went looking for some coffee to use in it.  Found Fool's coffee and liked that they had all sorts of flavors.  Came across the Bacon coffee and thought it sounded interesting.<br />The coffee smells great when you open the bag.  Perfect grind for the french press.  Made a batch and it is really good quality/tasting coffee.  My girlfriend even liked it and she had her reservations about it.  Only negative for me personally was that the bacon flavor was extremely subtle.  It was there but subtle.<br />My girlfriend thought is was a great delicious cup of coffee.<br />I thought the same but thought it needed more bacon flavor thus the 4 stars

review/summary: Do not buy
review/text: Supposedly a variety pack, but I couldn't tell the difference between "Peach Caramel" and "Raspberry Cream."  I actually thought that maybe one of them was mislabeled, but then I read the ingredients.  All of them have an herbal blend base that is supposed to simulate black tea, with a bit of fruit flavor added to make each one "different."  Well, I didn't think much of the herbal base, so I didn't like a single one of the teas.<br /><br />Also, the teas are contained in paper filter bags and then wrapped in a paper wrapper.  They are not sealed.  If I DID like them it would be nice if the bags were air tight since it would still take me a long time to drink 80 bags of tea.

review/text: I cannot believed that they sell Kinder delice coconut..It is one of my favorite snacks when I used to live in France. You really have to give a try to this delicious snacks. I've always complained to my husband that here in US they do not sell much snacks in separate wrappers. I've always find convenient that when its in a wrapper you can carry or pack it for your kids when going somewhere, without carrying the whole pack.<br /><br />The  chocolate cake is  delicious, in the middle there is a light layer of coconut cream and the whole cake is covered with chocolate. It melt in your mouth..It's so soft! Delicious..My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I usually buy and bring them back when I go back to visit my family in France. For Christmas, my parents always sent me those..for the kids..but I end-up eating most of them..LOL! My kids also loves those, either the Kinder delice coconut or the other one without, and all the kinder chocolate kinds. They make the best buttery, delicious chocolate.  I will definitely tried to buy them from this seller. Thanks for selling those!

review/summary: Perhaps my favorite Nature Valley product so far, tasty oat flavor
review/text: Making oat bars is apparently a pretty hard thing to get right. Over the years I have tried a lot of different brands and they are often too dry, tasteless, or just plain bad tasting. But this is one good tasting whole grain (very nice that they use whole grain) oats bar.<br /><br />While you probably want to have some liquid available when you eat these they are not too dry. The taste is wholesome and flavorable. And they are not too sweet at all, just perfect for me, more of a hint of sweetness. Pretty good value as well, recommended.

review/text: These bars are very good and tasty, with the right texture, and with delicious oatmeal with honey touches. They came as a surprise for me, as i'm used to eat the generic energetic bars from the vending machine at work, that usually taste like cardboard and corn syrup.<br /><br />These aren't like that. They are sweet but not overwhelmingly so, with the taste of honey being very perceptible. The bars aren't "honey golden" in color as many supposedly honey products tend to be nowadays, but I see that as a good thing, because that color usually comes from caramel and burned sugar, not honey. Very good bars, in general.

review/summary: Tasty, Crunchy, Filling Snack Bar
review/text: An immediate benefit is that there are 2 bars, each about one-quarter inch think or so, instead of one big thick one.  The consistency is that they are crunchy, but break apart easily.  They are NOT those hard fiber-board bars that make you feel like you are breaking your teeth.  They kind of remind you of a graham cracker pie crust in taste, but with honey and oats.  They are quite tasty, just sweet enough (without being sickening sweet), and they seem to be somewhat filling, enough for a mid-afternoon snack, especially with some water or tea.  So, we have tasty, easy to chew, filling.<br /><br />180 calories in a 2-bar, individually wrapped 1.5 oz. package, the label says the package contains 16g whole grain (of the recommended daily 48g), also contains 6g total fat, 160 mg sodium, 29 g carbs, 4 g protein, 11g sugars, 6% iron, and measures as 2 carbohydrate choices. (I believe that's for a special type diet program).  Sounds like it is relatively healthy<br /><br />Ingredients, listed in the following order:  whole grain rolled oats, sugar, canola oil, crisp rice with soy protein (rice flour, soy protein concentrate, sugar, malt, salt), honey, salt, soy lecithin, baking soda, natural flavor, peanut flour, almond flour, pecan flour.  Contains soy, peanut, almond, and pecan ingredients (for those with allergies.)<br /><br />Update 3/28/10:  Another good thing about these-- I kept a big box of these in the car for a couple of months for anytime I am on the road and need a snack.  Through the temperature changes, they stayed in tact.  Unlike chocolate covered bars, there was nothing to melt.  (I keep these bars and some special tea bags in the car for wherever I am.)

review/summary: Disturbingly addictive
review/text: You don't expect healthy food to be addictive, you certainly don't expect to consider making a special run to the grocery store for granola bars... but these granola bars will do it to you.<br /><br />Now sure I love my chocolate chip granola bars as much as the next person, but one day someone handed me one of these and I've been sold ever since.  I don't know why... maybe the toasty oats and grains, or the honey or maybe its just the fun crunchyness of it all.  All I know is that after eating one, I thank whoever decided to put two in a packet for their genius.  I can easily sit and eat an entire box of these while watching a movie.  If you're trying to be healthy remember - all things in moderation, even these granola bars.<br /><br />The only negative I can see is that with them being so firm and crunchy, there WILL be crumbs, and if you are eating them on the road (replacing breakfast while driving to work) you will need to brush yourself off before striding into the office.<br /><br />PS- The Brown Sugar ones are AWESOME

review/summary: Yummy breakfast on the go!
review/text: These granola bars are one of my favorite things to grab on the go when I am rushing around and don't have time for breakfast before work.  The reason I say "one of my favorite" and not "my favorite" is because they take a backseat the Nature Valley's other flavor of crunchy granola bars, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6IULK">Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars, Peanut Butter, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  The Oats n' Honey variety takes a very close second and I actually prefer the Oats n' Honey variety in certain situations.  Particularly when I am taking the granola bars in my purse for the day or to the beach on a hot day because the Peanut Butter variety gets gooey and melty (not good for sandy hands or a quick snack between appointments without a wet towel or sink nearby).<br /><br />Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars have been a go-to snack for years in my family (ate them all the time growing up) and still remain a favorite.  I am sure that some may find them too crunchy/hard but I prefer the texture and crunch over other brands.<br /><br />Final note, these came shipped from Amazon in perfect condition.  I was unsure as my delivery guy loves to play "kick the box" but the granola bars held up just as nicely as they do in a brick and mortar.

review/text: I have loved Nature Valley Crunchy granola bars for many years. They taste great and are perfect for when hunger stricks and the next meal is still a couple hours away.<br />They satisfy hunger and get you some of the fiber you need each day. I love the texture and the large whole oats.<br />A great granola bar!

review/summary: Crunchy Goodness! Old fashioned Wholesome Oatey flavor
review/text: These were just what I expected them to be. A nice crunchy oat bar. Like an oatmeal cookie. Even though I LOVE raisins, dates etc.... there are times when you don't want bits of sticky fruit stuck in your teeth all day!<br /><br />these are great for leaving in the car as they do not melt or get goey, are nice & neat to eat (although they can crumble a bit!) No stains or dirty fingers! Can you tell I have kids LOL!!<br /><br />Anywways..........we like them plain with a glass of milk or better yet crumbled on top of ice cream or yogurt MmmmmmmmmmmmmmmDelish!<br /><br />So IF crunchy granola is what you crave buy these & you will be delighted!<br />As for nutritional data you can click on Amazon's handy link by the product, but these are NOT for people on a Low carb/Low glycemic diet, unless they are taking a little "sabbatical"! LOL :)

review/summary: Crunchy, Tasty
review/text: These bars are perfect to slip in a pocket or bag to take to work, workout, hike, roadtrip, whatever. I don't know anybody who doesn't love them. They are hard and crunchy, 100% natural, and taste a lot less like a candy-bar than traditional soft and gooey granola bars. Buying in bulk here on Amazon, makes a lot of sense, as they price very competitively when I compared the price to my local grocery store.

review/summary: Whole grain goodness.
review/text: Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars are delicious and are my treat of choice when serving my grandchildren, instead of other snacks without any nutritional value. The Oats 'N Honey version seems to work best for those under 5 years old, as there are no nuts, which, for some reason, offends my 4 year old granddaughter (she will eat around pieces of almond and the like!). Perhaps it is just something difficult for her to chew.<br /><br />Yes, these bars do contain some processed sugar, however, they are definitely a healthier alternative to cookies, cakes, and rice crispies treats. Oh yes, and I like them, too! They are quite good with a cup of coffee or tea.

review/summary: Tasty and Crunchy
review/text: Not much to say here except these bars are hard and crunchy with a very nice nutty, whole grain flavor.  Two come in each packet.  They are rather small so one tends to eat both bars in the packet.  My three boys, aged six and under love them.  They are, however, a bit messy to eat, as they tend to fall apart as one bites into them.  Nature Valley is part of big corporate America.  If you judge a granola bar by its taste, though, you should consider these ones.

They are also great for snacks, while hiking or out and about.<br /><br />My kids love them as a quick breakfast before school.  Maybe not the healthiest breakfast, but better than none at all.

review/text: These bars are very crunchy so you won't feel cheated in the chewing department.  They do crumble a lot so you will make a big mess eating them, it's unavoidable.  the only complaint is they can't keep them together.  They begin crumbling before you even touch the package.  They taste good for Granola and if it not for the mess I would prefer them over other bars.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I don't like granola, I really dislike granola bars, and my family LOVES these.  Unlike other bars, they are crispy instead of soft and gooey, so they are more like a crunchy cookie.  The honey flavor comes through, which is something I like.  A package containing two bars is 180 calories, with about 6 grams of fat and over 20 grams of carbs - - so, not health food, but very good as an occasional treat.

review/text: I am normally not a great fan of such bars, because despite all the healthy ingredients they contain hydrogentated corn syrup.  Horray,this product contains no such awful ingredient.  And they are very delicious. Crunchy oat with a lovely honey taste - not overtly sweet - just right.  there are two servings per packet totalling 180 calories.  This is a great little snack and quite filling.  Although it is very moorish- so you have better have great self-control!<br /><br />PS: we now order it on a regular basis, which does make it cheaper by at least $1 savings per box.

review/text: These are different from your average packaged bar. Each individual package contains two thin, crunchy bars as opposed to the standard one sticky, chewy bar.<br /><br />They have a great nutty taste, and are not too sweet. Perfect with a cup of tea, and one is enough... which is good, because it makes for a satisfying yet not-fattening snack.<br /><br />HOWEVER, to call them "high-fiber" is beyond misleading. Each individual bar contains 1 (ONE) gram of fiber.

review/summary: Mostly healthy and widely available.
review/text: One of the original "healthy" mass market bars and perhaps still one of the healthiest and tasiest despite the High Fructose Corn Syrup.<br /><br />Prepackaged granola bars are convenient: they are neatly packaged in a wrapping that keeps your hands clean and the bar from melting into your bag. Plus, they keep longer than a homemade bar.  The Nature Valley Oats 'n Honey bar is still one of our backpacking and snack-on-the-go staples for this reason.  We also like that they are all oat and have no crisped rice fillers that many other bars have. We also use this broken up over yoghurt or over cooked fruit to add variety when camping.<br /><br />One thing we did notice recently is that the ingredients list is different for same product in different packaging.  Some list pecan flour and other nut flours while others dont.  While all their different products may be manufactured in the same facility and cross contamination is expected, there IS a big difference as to whether actual ingredients are added to the mix.<br /><br />While there may be tastier options out there and healthier options, the Nature Valley line is the most widely available and the most versatile bar.

review/summary: good crunch, a bit sweet
review/text: These have a denser oatmeal flavor than most granola bars - in a good way.  The first bite makes it seem that they are not sweet enough but then that is followed up with an almost too sweet after-flavor.  There is good flavor separation between the honey and the brown sugar (syrup) that is used.  There are two bars in each foil and that is the serving size so you seem to get a lot of bang for the buck (180 calories). I bet it would make a great topping for baked apples . . . . .

review/summary: Awesome wholesome, healthy treats
review/text: These granola bars are the best! Where do I begin? Nature Valley bars are 100% natural, include no high fructose corn syrup, contain a good source of whole grain, include no trans fat, and total caloric and carbohydrate intake are relatively low. These bars are perfect for breakfast or can be consumed as a snack. I'm a health nut and I approve these bars without question [and I'm pretty picky about all the information I have posted above)!!<br />The only minus (if anything) is that the bars are quite crunchy/hard; therefore, if you are one with sensitive teeth, you might want to break down the bars into bite size pieces or soak the bars in yogurt or milk [if necessary]. But, do yourself a favor and try Nature Valley crunchy granola bars!!

review/text: I've been eating these NV Granola Bars since I was but a lad, munching away on them with orange slices at soccer games.  They're timeless, and a sweet treat.  Yes, they're probably not too healthy considering they have a fair bit of sugar.  But in this economic climate, they're cheaper than say a Clif bar, and no less tasty.<br /><br />I rarely eat these bars plain- usually I break it up into my plain yogurt with fresh fruits, or into my cereal. 5 thumbs up for a nice snack.

review/summary: Oats: A grain ... to support the people
review/text: I have been a fan of Nature Valley granola bars for years.  They come in many varieties.  My favorites lately have been the Pecan Crunch and Peanut Butter bars.  So, I was pleased to learn that Amazon now offers the bars in their many different types.<br /><br />Certainly, Oats and Honey are a classic combination. Oats go way back. Samuel Johnson included a definition of oats in his 1755 Dictionary of the English Language.  I have adapted liberally from his definition for my title.  Actually, Samuel Johnson said: "Oats: A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland appears to support the people."  Little did he know that two and a half centuries later, England's colonial offspring would enthusiastically endorse oats as a food for people.<br /><br />Earlier this month, I spent a week skiing in Colorado at Vail, The ticket counters were equipped with baskets of the Oats and Honey bars provided free of charge.  It was a nice gesture considering the almost $100 daily ticket price.  The granola bars pack nearly 100 calories for a single bar, and obviously double that for a two-bar pack.<br /><br />I took the Oats bars with me skiing, but I also depend on them for hiking.  An extra 200 calories is what you may need to give you enough energy to get up the last 200 feet to a mountain summit.  The taste is good.  They do not melt.  If you get tired of the Oats, there is always a choice: Pecan, Almond, or Peanut Butter, to provide variety.<br /><br />PS: Despite an assertion that the Oats and Honey bars contain high fructose corn syrup, it is not on the list of ingredients for my bars

review/text: The package is 12 packages of 6 Pouches.  In each pouch, there is two bars.  But who cares how many bars in each pouch?  The weigh of each pocuch matters, but not how manufacturer package the each pouch.  If manufaturer decides to package each pouch with 8 small tiny bars, it does not make the package more valuable.  In short, I thought it is 12 x 12 snacks for me, which is good price.  It ended up 12 X 6 snacks for me, which is not so good price.  I can buy the same product at local stores cheaper and at smaller quarntity.  Why shall I order online and buy large quantity if there is no saving?  Disappointed.

review/summary: High Fructose Corn Syrup
review/text: This is a great tasting product, however, it is unfortunately NOT an all natural product as they would lead you to believe. It is a shame that so many manufacturers have started using high fructose corn syrup in their products. Any nutritionist, particularly those dealing with diabetics, will tell you without exception what high fructose corn syrup does to  elevate your blood sugar. It is a manufactured product they would have you believe is completely safe, but look at the incidence of diabetes in this country. Why is the the first ingredient the nutritionist say to completely avoid. It is worse than sugar in what it does to the blood sugar and I can't even get into the ways it helps to create obesity. Too bad, I also stopped drinking Arizona and Lipton iced tea product for the same reason. Hello, out there!! There are natural sweeteners like stevia and xlitol that are truly GOOD for you!!! Why is high fructose corn syrup actual banned in several countries, including Canada? Could it be that the pharmaceutical companies helped to develop and expand the use of this product so they could sell more drugs????? Many foreign countries that pay for universal healthcare must think so. Why else would they ban it to reduce their medical costs?? Hello FDA. Where the heck are you???

review/summary: Nice snack inbetween meals
review/text: I'm afraid I don't have a lot of experience with granola bars. I did want something to take the edge off my hunger between meals that wasn't heavy. These are a bit dry, but very sweet.<br /><br />I can understand the attraction because these contain so much fiber. The issue is that they taste so much more like candy. The amount of sugar in them worries me. There doesn't appear to be much more to these than oats.<br /><br />There are two bars inside the foil. They break quite easily and have a tendency to go crumbly. I found that one packet really wasn't very satisfying. The portion is quite small. For an adult I would say two or three of these would suffice with a large glass of water.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't find anything particularly attractive about this brand. I would have preferred something with a little more volume and taste other than over powering sugar.

review/summary: Great price for 72 count box & you get 2 boxes of decaf tea!
review/text: I love Lipton decaf tea and so does my entire family.  The price on this one is excellent for the 72 count box and you get 2 boxes for the price! (72 bags per box is also difficult to find in our local stores).  Ordering through Amazon saves me the long drive to the store as it is delivered directly to me.  This is very convenient and also saves us money in gas money and product pricing.  I use subscribe and save on this item and also order for my mom as well.  We drink a lot of iced tea and this is our favorite (and it makes a decent cup of hot tea though usually we do get flavored tea for hot tea).  We use 3 bags to make a large pitcher of ice tea and we use 4 bags for making sun tea, which is a larger container.  Either way, it tastes wonderful with no bitterness at all, which is one of the reasons we like Lipton decaf.  So, it not only tastes good, it saves money, plus it is convenient -- can't beat that!

review/summary: Great for iced tea!
review/text: We love to drink iced tea and recently found some pre-made stuff at the local store. We soon became addicted to the stuff and it quickly became an expensive habit (haha). So we decided to try to make our own. There was a recent sale on these Lipton tea bags so we decided to try and make our own. Wow, there is a lot of sugar that goes into store-bought iced tea! It was nice to control the amount of sugar that went into the tea AND this package made four times what we got from the store and at a quarter of the price! Oh, and the taste was still great :-)

review/summary: Very nice light tea, good cold, not so good hot
review/text: Makes a great light and refreshing iced tea since the sugar and lemon carries the tea nicely but it doesn't work well with a hot tea, especially if you're drinking it plain.  I am not a big fan of caffeine so I just make a hot cup of tea with 3 of these bags for some robust tea flavor.  You have to sacrifice flavor for lack of caffeine.  Overall it's a nice tea to drink.

review/summary: Hey, it's Lipton, right!
review/text: I was using the Walmart brand "Great Value" tea bags for my ice tea, which we drink EVERYDAY since we live in the deep HOT SOUTH. These bags are very good tasting and the bags hold up better in hot water than the great value brand, not that great value was bad by no means in taste, but their bags leak like a sift in hot water and you get LOADS of tea flakes in your ice tea, who likes that!. We tried these as we are as said, everyday tea drinkers and we like them, hope this helps make your choice of purchasing easier. P.S. yes, we make our tea the old fashion way, we boil the water first, then throw the bags in and let them soak for a while, tastes awesome and you have sterile water which is best on taste and for your health.

review/summary: Try with Chicken -- It's Delicious!!
review/text: I have tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0075AEMUW">Kraft Velveeta Chicken & Broccoli Cheesy Skillets Dinner Kit 14.64 oz (Pack of 6)</a> and found it to be pretty decent, despite some of the bad reviews. However, I would agree that the pasta wasn't quite my style...like a strange hybrid between rice and pasta, it does sort of create a strange texture for the dish.<br /><br />So, I decided to try the Tuna Melt instead. Tuna kinda skeezes me out, so I added a 10oz can of chunk chicken breast instead of the 2 cans of tuna that the box calls for. I spiced it up with a bit of black pepper, and it turned out great! Cheesy and tasty, this dish hit the spot, and it was ready in like 15 minutes.<br /><br />For vegetable snobs, I will go ahead and tell you that the veggies that are included in this pack are minimal. It's a great choice for families with kids who are a bit picky about their veggies, though. Next time, I might add a drained can of peas or some frozen broccoli florets for a bit of added nutrition and flavor, but this dish is perfect without. I'm sure those who like tuna would enjoy it as directed as well.

Years ago I read that chewing gum after meals was a good idea because it gets down in the nooks and crannies of your teeth and cleans out whatever is stuck in there better than brushing or flossing.  So that's what I always do.  I like an orange flavor best, and this one has the bonus of giving you your daily Vitamin C.  Also, it has that great crunch from the candy coat.

The box claims that the noodles are hot and spicy, and they are!  Very tasty, very spicy.  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, the portion isn't huge so you should pack a salad or some fruits or veggies to round out your meal.  As prepared, the meal has 300 calories and 4.5g of fat.  Not too bad for a quick, easy, cheap, tasty microwavable meal!

review/summary: Great stuff for hiking/backpacking! Here's a recipe...
review/text: For backpacking, using the "Pack it in, pack it out" and "Leave no trace" frames of mind, I do admit that the packaging requires some re-packaging to reduce the amount of garbage you'd want to deal with.  Unless you have a Sherpa (and I don't) - Lose the exterior plastic wrapping on the package, the carboard box, plastic fork (if you have an alternative - like a spork, which I'm assuming you do), and also lose the plastic tray container with lid.  (I use a Jetboil stove, and the cup and lid serve me just fine as an alternative).  You'll be left with a small plastic bag of noodles (break them if you have to), a small plastic envelope of oil (which could be omitted if you carry a small squeeze bottle of oil), and an envelope of their spices/magic ingredients that make this taste as good as it does.<br /><br />The addition of some chicken in a foil envelope or can makes this dish better in all respects (except for perhaps, sodium).<br /><br />Foil envelopes obviously pack out out better than cans, but you probably already know that if you've read this far.  :-)  Boil up some water (about 12 oz.) in your stove, add the noodles and let that soak for about 5 minutes with the lid on (I think 7 minutes works best for me).  Drain out the water, and then stir in the oil, spices, and then the optional chicken.  Mix well, and enjoy!<br /><br />Really hungry? Eat two!  The calories wouldn't be a concern when hiking.  You can always divide the chicken in one package (if used) into two portions, and that works well.  My local supermarket has this item for a little under two dollars per package (one cent less) each.  More expensive (but tastes a LOT better) than Ramen noodles - you get what you pay for...  If you're thru-hiking the AT on a budget vs. a weekend getaway, this is a no-brainer to me.  These are available in both a regular and spicy variety.  I like both.  Light, easy, taste good, pack in and out well, and a great alternative to some other "staple" trail meals I've dealt with.  Happy trails!  JimiH

review/summary: Thai Pavilion Single Serve Spicy Pad Thai
review/text: I have never tried this brand of food before I ordered this. Nonetheless, I love spicy foods and especially oriental. The directions on the package are easy to follow and the packaging itself is awesome because it includes a fork! Also, there is no way the rice noodles can break unless someone perhaps sat on the packaging. Having tried this just by itself there is NOT a whole lot of flavor going on, spicy flavor especially. There is at most a strong peanut flavor. I squirted a ton of Sriracha Hot Sauce on this and that helped a ton in the flavor department. Next time I'm going to make a stir fry with them which will just add more flavor and fill me up even more! Suprisingly, despite the lacking flavor, this is quite filling given the portion size. I don't know how much they cost in a grocery store because I've never saw them even while I worked in a grocery store for almost three years, but I say its worth it if you want to throw a curve ball in your home meals.

I bought it because we had a camp out coming up and stores had already put away the sunblock/insect repellent sections. I paid $8 for this on Amazon, and the very next day saw it in Walmart's camping aisle for $4 - same size, same product. So check the camping section of your store before ordering here.

review/summary: Repellent that Delivers
review/text: Used this during my summer trip to several South East Asian countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos...). We did quite a bit of outdoors hiking, especially in heavily forested regions, and some of the regions were known to have malaria-carrying mosquitoes. I was recommended this by a friend who spent time in the Amazon, and I'm glad I took his advice. Compared to my tripmates who had the aerosol sprays (even the "outdoors" stuff), I was not bitten at all where the lotion was applied, which was great since it's such a pain to wear long-sleeves and long pants in the humidity. The mosquitoes will still try to bite through clothes, and though I think the lotion had a repelling effect, I'm going to coat my clothes in permethrin next time.<br /><br />Lotion dried well, wasn't greasy, didn't cause any break outs, so I don't think I'll be switching back to the spray even now that I'm back home.

I attach sunscreen and bug repellent to my kayak, backpack, etc.  I didn't expect the carabiner to be load bearing but I did expect it to be sturdy enough to keep the lotion secure.  This is the only product I've seen with a carabiner so I will order it again and replace the carabiner.  Oh, one more thing - the cap broke off the first time I used the lotion.

review/summary: Really works against mosquitos
review/text: Although we're not quite in a tropical zone, spending two months in Puerto Vallarta during the rainy season gave Repel Sportsman Max with 40% DEET a pretty good test. This stuff works. We'd tried Cutter Advanced with Picaridin, OFF Family, Bye Bye and some other brands while our bodies turned into bloody pincushions from those relentless buggers. Then a friend brought us some Repel and within a day of use, we were bite free. In the past, I've used the 98-100% DEET but it's oily base and gasoline-like smell is offensive. This Repel creme is non-greasy and fragrance free. Can't beat it.

review/summary: Won't believe it until you use it!
review/text: I picked this repellent on clearance from a local store mainly for the D-clip the came with it.  Had it sitting around for a couple of years until I used it.<br /><br />What a mistake, not the using it, but waiting around for so long to use it.  This is by far the best repellent I have ever used and I have used a few.  I have worked in the conservation field for over 7 years now, everywhere from Louisiana to Montana to Minnesota, so I know my repellents.<br /><br />This lotion does not have the greasy feeling that come with most sprays, in fact once its on, you don't even feel it.  This lotion does not burn when you apply it after working up a sweating.<br /><br />You also avoid two of the major problems over application, it takes very little to get good protection, and breathing in spray fumes.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this insect repellent the guys I work with love it.

review/summary: Kept the mosquito's away!
review/text: Worked great against mosquito's while I was in Maine. I prefer lotions rather than sprays, but lotions are harder to find so I was glad to see this product on the market. Repel did the job.

review/summary: long lasting and effective
review/text: I like this cream style product over the spray. You can apply it to your skin easily and very effectively repel bugs. You only need to apply a very small amount of the cream evenly on your skin and you are protected pretty much through out the day.

review/summary: Products works great, very strong
review/text: I read all these reviews and purchased this for my daughter and I to use when we went to the poconos for a week.  The first day we did not put anything on and took a walk...big mistake.  came back and we got eaten up by horse flys.  We then learned from out mistake and put on this product.  You do not need a lot it is very strong and last all day.  We did not get bit once and when we were in trails in the woods insects flew towards us but always swerved away.  we did not have one insect even on our clothes was great.  Just need to remember when you get back take a shower, you need to wash this stuff off can not let that sit..again another mistake I learned from...lol.  Great product will purchase again when I am done with this no question.

review/summary: Not as effective on biting mites.
review/text: I bought this product specifically to repel biting mites that have invaded my home and vehicles.  It works for maybe an hour for mites.  Unfortunately, products with deet that are effective for mosquitoes and ticks are not as effective for repelling biting mites.

review/summary: no outer package so no expiration date in view
review/text: I am in MOSQUITO CENTRAL...with West Nile Virus at the peak of its season & when I applied this, I was bitten at least 20 times in 10 minutes.<br />I looked for a expiration date but there was not one.<br />I am sure this is expired or it would have worked.<br />This was a waste of money & now I have to pray those bites are not from infected mosquitos.<br />West Nile is DEADLY!!!!

review/text: Product worked well.  No mosquito bites.  Rubbed lightly on skin and clothing.  Pump spray would probably work well also.
