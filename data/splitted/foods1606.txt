review/summary: Half a Zing, Mr. Greed!
review/text: It's been some time since I've bought these, and saw them on sale 2-4-1 at a local store. The box seems about the same size as always, but the tiny little downsized cakes just shake around in it. I hope the stock holders are happy this year, because this is the last box I will ever buy. Even at two boxes for the price of one, these pint-sized cakes are no bargain. If they down-size them again, shoppers will have to buy two boxes to put together one little cake. The cakes are delicious, but barely big enough to taste anymore. There are still some generic companies out there making full-sized cakes, and, in light of this ridiculous miniaturizing, I would wholeheartedly recommend them over Hostess.

review/text: I live in France and ordered these flowers to be delivered to my grandmother in the U.S. They arrived the day after I placed my order as I requested by using the "schedule a delivery" option above the "add to cart" button. I called her a week later and she said that the flowers were still fresh and some were still opening. No sender name was provided to her but she knew the flowers were from me by my wording in the note enclosed, so if anyone is considering sending these as a gift be sure to check the "gift" option and include a name in the wording of the note. She thought the bouquet was beautiful and it made her really happy. All in all I'm very pleased with this service and would order from this company again.

review/text: I have trouble finding this particular tea in non-health-food stores. This tea is caffeine-free, so it's ideal for unwinding at the end of the day or for a quiet escape during a stressful work day. The tea has a strong aroma and flavor, a little bit spicy so not for everyone, but I find the scent irresistable and calming on its own. The flavor is a touch of sweet, a touch of tingle on the tongue. And as a bonus, each tea bag label has an inspirational saying on it. Even if you find the quotations silly, they're at least good for a giggle.

review/text: This is a good product (good quality Kava root - no stems or leaves - and nice tasting), but you have to use at least 2 tea bags to get the feeling you would get from traditional Kava (relaxing and elated feeling).  As far as convenience goes this is an easy way to get Kava but the increased number of bags used factors into the cost.

review/summary: Delicious, Yes, May Help With Stress Relief
review/text: ****<br /><br />This Kava Stress Relief Tea from Yogi Tea is for anxiety relief. It's an unusual tea, slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. The bad news is that I can't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea, although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. Still, it's a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however, I even tried four bags once, but still didn't notice a relaxing effect. I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway, so this is something to be aware of. Your experience of the tea may be different.<br /><br />Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are: kava root extract, carob pod, Indian sarsaparilla root, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, stevia leaf, barley malt, natural hazelnut flavor, natural cinnamon flavor, and natural licorice flavor. Amazingly, I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness.<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, "Your breath is the voice of your soul" and "Your head must bow to your heart".<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. "Kava-kava," native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night's sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of "relaxed unconcern" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax."<br /><br />In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, "Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment."<br /><br />Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.<br /><br />I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn't really work for me. Still, it is a wonderful and recommended tea, and may work for you!<br /><br />****

review/text: I was introduced to Kava or AWA drink in Maui.  The first cup is like drinking liquid earth, but I developed a taste for it.  It really works to help relax aching muscles.  I can make my own AWA, but it is time consuming.  I tried this tea and with the carob and cinnamon it is delicious.  I love it.  I buy it from Amazon in the larger quantity because it is cheaper, even with shipping, than buying in a health food or grocery store if they even have it.

review/text: Yogi carries a number of teas that are good for something specific. I'm skeptical of most, but I have to say that I always feel a little more calm after a cup of Kava tea. It is difficult to describe how this tea feels in your mouth, but it is something close to the feeling of putting lotion on after a long day. Some teas leave my mouth feeling dry, others make me want to brush my teeth, but this tea winds me down for cozying up in bed. I wouldn't let it steep for too long because it can be very strong and be ready to relax!

review/summary: Do Not Drink Kava tea if you are on any anti seizure or anxiety Medcation!
review/text: I'm currently taking Klonopin 1mg because I have a mild case of epliepsy.  My seizures are triggered when I'm under a tremendous amount of stress.  So I decided to go get the Yogi Kava Stress relief tea and used 2 bags then I took the Klonopin maybe 10 mins later.  When I tell you I was high as a kite I couldn't even walk to the restroom!  My husband had to help me to get around, and my body was sooo relaxed (too relaxed) when I would try to dose off to sleep it felt like I was going to die because my muscles felt like they were melting and I felt way too relaxed and high.  I drinked alot of water to flush the tea out then about 3-4 hours later I was able to get some rest. Mind you by the time I finally went to sleep it was 2:00 am and my husband was getting cranky because he had to be to work early the next morning. Here is a link from webmd.com that I found the next day...<br />[...]<br /><br />I believe it would have worked fine with one tea bag without the seizure meds.  It did its' job alright!  But my mistake was not check what herbal supplements interact with certain medications.<br /><br />So be warned do NOT drink this tea if you are taking any of the medications listed on the link above.

I dont know about the Kava part as have not used Kava before , but the tea is relaxing in its ability to take your senses in with its very rich flavor blend . I have never tasted a tea this rich with flavor and I have fallen in love with this after just one cup .  The Name Yogi for this tea may just be indication of why this tea is so good , they have mastered the art of blending flavor .<br />  I also Love the tags with the sayings , the one I opened today said :<br />  " When ego is lost limit is lost , You become infinite, Kind and Beautiful . "<br /><br />Some very deep and beautiful thoughts to accompany you in your tea time, what a lovely idea to put those sayings in there .  Discovering  that this company also is using ethical, honorable and  kind values in producing this product just adds to the Good Feeling you get when you drink this wonderful tea .<br />Amazon is amazing delivering this product to your door in just two days with Prime shipping , and Every product I have ordered thus far has been fresh and of high Quality.

Didn't notice any dramatic results but I will keep drinking it to see how it turns out.  I even added a bit of honey since I enjoy that in my tea/coffee.  But you almost don't need to add any sweetener.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have been drinking this for about five days and sometimes using two teabags at a time.  I don't really notice anything.  Maybe I need something more potent.  But I will continue to use the teabags until they're gone.  Then I'll move on and try Yogi St. John's Wort Blues Away.

The tea it's self doesn't taste as strong as it did when I had it a few years ago and I feel virtually nothing from it now, just a little drowsy, if I drink a lot of it before sleeping I'll wake up extremely thirsty as if I had drank alcohol. I've heard people complain about the taste but it never tasted all that bad to me, I actually enjoy it.

review/summary: Handcrafted by Hippies
review/text: Yogi Kava Stress Relief is one of the best relaxation teas on the market. It's a three-way with kava, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKUTB4">Alvita Herbal Teas, Valerian Mint (Peppermint), 24-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E671X4">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Sleepytime, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>. Valerian, kava, and chamomile are natural stress relievers and relaxants. I was first introduced to kava kava tea in New Mexico, when a hippie was carting it around the dorms. It looked like dirty water, and he gushed about its healing properties. Kava is traditionally served in the Pacific/Oceania, so drinking this is perfectly accompanied by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00063MC0W">South Pacific Islands</a>.<br /><br />Kava Kava Stress Relief has a pleasant, spicy cinnamon flavor slightly sweetened with stevia. It has the flavor of a black tea, not so much as an Earl Grey but a Hippie Grey. It's almost like chai... but more relaxing. Chai tends to be caffeinated, after all! Kava is reverse caffeine. With the second cup, one's lips might feel slightly numb. Kava is NOT to be combined with alcohol. Be careful when you're drinking it. The warning label is there for a reason. Kava is STRONG. It is NOT FOR THE WEAK. Kava is a delicious Pacific cup for a pacific sleep.

review/summary: My new daily drink...
review/text: This tea does take getting used to...the sweetness is sloghtly odd at first. After getting really anxious during the day at work I decided to give up coffee (was on around 6 cups a day). I decided to try Kava tea as I've read a lot of literature on the relaxing effects of Kava...hard to separate it from removing the vast amounts of caffeine from my day but I feel more relaxed and less anxious.<br />Also really like the taste now...also makes my office smell nice which is an added benefit!

review/summary: Tastes Great - Less Filling
review/text: At first upon reading about kava, I had my doubts.  After my first week of having at least 2 cups every night, I felt better during the day.  I slept a little better at night but the biggest thing was how I was able to take on stress.  This tea tastes sweet and soothing.  I use 2 bags in each cup, use a smaller teacup.  I find it tastes much better when pouring in hot but not boiling water.  I don't think there are many calories from this tea, I have lost a pound or 2 and feel less bloated.  I've been drinking this tea everyday for 2 months.  3 or 4 cups a night.  No side effects, no tolerance change or addiction.<br /><br />I used to drink vodka everyday but now I just drink this kava tea.  It tastes almost as good as the alcoholic drinks but the tea is less filling and doesn't make me feel all jumpy the next day like vodka did.<br /><br />There isn't much actual kava in this tea but it's enough to keep me warm and happy.  It's not as expensive as alcohol (woohoo more money in my pocket).  Plus I don't usually feel tired in the morning (bring it on!).  I don't feel the need for energy drinks in the morning or coffee.  Thanks Yogi !<br /><br />This stuff worked for me!

review/text: I've been drinking Kava tea by Yogi for years, now.  I actually suffer from clinical anxiety and depression, but prefer more natural methods rather than taking medication.  Whether I am feeling under the weather, or I have anxiety or just feeling blue, Kava tea is so calming and helpful.  I highly recommend it to anyone whether they have anxiety or not.  My anxiety free husband just loves the taste of it :)<br /><br />This retails 6.00+ for one box at my local Ralphs so this is really a fantastic deal!

review/summary: accumulated deit pill/Caffeine stress relief
review/text: I have for years taken lots of caffeine, in the form of stay awake kind of pills, and in the form of Strong coffee.  It has created stress that just stopping would not erase.  I noticed when I bought Kava coffee I had way less jittery feeling.  So naturally I tried this.  I wasted my money, NOT because it didn't work but because the first two bags in one cup of water did the trick!  Like a load off my shoulder.  I have all these bags in case it comes back but boy am I glad I tried this!  Now I cant wait to try the other kinds of tea from yogi.

review/summary: Great tea but...
review/text: This tea has a very nice fragrance because of the cinnamon. At first when I tried the tea, I didn't really like the taste. It took me like 2 days to get used to it. Adding honey helps adjust the taste, especially the ones with fruit flavors. If you don't like the cinnamon smell you can try adding berries mixed from the mixer, it gives off a nice aroma. Although I enjoy the tea, it just didn't seem to have that "stress relief" effect for me. It was one of the very reason I purchased this tea. Even so, I did not regret buying it.

review/summary: Good tea, but kava content is quite low.
review/text: If you are just looking for a tea, the flavor is nice, but each bag contains only 20mg of kavalactones, which makes this a very economically unsound source of kavalactones, the stress-relieving chemicals in kava. I have tried this using 4 bags, and the effect was negligible. You may have better luck with this product than I did, but just don't have high hopes of the effect being akin to that of traditionally prepared kava or quality kava extract like Gaia kava.

review/summary: Great night's sleep but....
review/text: First off I bought a single box at a local health food store to see if I liked it before buying 6-boxes worth from Amazon. So far so good! I actually enjoy the flavor. I prepared it per the instructions on the box and let a single bag steep for 10 minutes. While I was drinking it I noticed a pleasant sense of relaxation, some drowsiness, my breathing slowed a bit, and a little bit of tingling in my lips. I've always been one of those people who have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep throughout the night, waking up at least 2 or more times to go to the bathroom, etc. and then have to read myself back to sleep with a booklight because I can't get back to sleep (stress, body pain, anxiety, etc.). I've been averaging about 4-5 hours total sleep for ages now. I don't like taking medications unless I absolutely have to (too expensive and it can be a slippery slope of more and more medications to deal with the side effects of your original meds). For the first time in I can't remember when I only awoke ONCE (to use the bathroom) and then went right back to sleep, for a net total of about 7 1/2 hours sleep! This is the first time in ages that I awoke feeling completely rested. Yipee!<br /><br />The only downside was that at first as my breathing was slowing I got a bit nervous because I was afraid it would slow TOO much. I have an adjustable bed, so I adjusted the bed a little higher at the head to make it easier for me to breathe and that helped, although I don't know if the product would have a bad effect with someone who has asthma, sleep apnea, heart rhythm problems, etc. So someone with those problems probably want to check with a doctor first.

I've found that two bags of this with a bag of peppermint steeped together is almost exactly like that expensive "natural" beauty care brand that is more than $2/serving.<br /><br />It is a little bit sweet, and per the other reviews, I steep it in water that's just off a boil for 10 minutes.  It's just the right strength, and a bit spicy, but the flavor is really enjoyable.  It's just the little bit of relaxation I need to be able to get ready to get some rest.  This will be on my grocery list for a long time.

review/summary: Sleepytime Tea with One Major Drawback.
review/text: I happen to love the effects of this tea. I am an insomniac and all my medicine without my sleeping pill cannot help me sleep. This with my meds (sans sleeping pill) will allow me to sleep-- which is great. The flavor is sweet and mild, however even in the 2nd sip of tea it produces this weird numb, tingling sensation. It's very bothersome to me. I'm assuming that is telling me the Kava is working, which is why I keep downing the cup-- however it stops me from enjoying it too much.<br /><br />However, I'm keeping it around for when I'm having trouble sleeping, run out of sleeping pills, or have a really rough day/bad pain (I also have chronic pain, and it seems to relax me a bit, which helps.)<br /><br />Since most people don't even note this in their reviews, I'm probably just extra sensitive to this effect.

Not to mention is it DELISH, unique but smooth and good, not offensive like some teas that claim to do things for the body. It's very affordable! And I like the little sayings on the tags too.

Looking at the ingredients list, I think carob, chocolate's oft lackluster understudy, is to blame.

You've likely heard that too much Kava Kava could possibly damage your liver, if that's the case ( that you are considering same as a reason to not try Kava Kava ) and you currently have a health liver, then you might consider taking a good form of Milk Thistle extract ( Silymarin, NOW Foods brand is my preference ) 3 times a day, for a couple of months at a time perhaps bi-annually.  Taking this simple precaution is a possible way to keep your liver safe enough to enjoy a couple cups or so of Kava Kava a week.

review/text: First of all, make sure you really like the taste of licorice. The licorice flavor is very strong in this, easily overpowering everything else. I could barely choke down a cup. Also, Stevia has an after taste to me. Always has, and this was no exception. Admittedly, I was hoping with all the other herbs--i.e. cinnamon and ginger amongst others--in here, those two flavors would be overpowered. I was wrong. Did this product work after I forced it down my throat? No! What worked was the two capsules I took of kava kava liquid phyto-caps from Gaia Herbs. I'll also be trying their liquid extract--in a cup of chai latte tea I make myself.

review/summary: Not all sweetness and light
review/text: Over the years, I have been served honey in packets and cups at diners and restaurants many, many times, just as have most Americans. I've enjoyed it in tea, on biscuits, and on yummy sopaipillas. Honey really seems to bring out the wonderful flavor of good buttermilk biscuits and sopaipillas. (And if you've never had sopaipillas, RUN, don't walk to the Great Southwest and try them. They make your eyes roll back they are so good) ... but I digress.<br /><br />The key to honey on these great American foods is that it has to be a delicate flavored honey to complement rather than overpower them...which is what I have always experienced with these little single-serve packets of honey ... a lovely golden liquid that melts in your mouth, and is chosen for its mild flavor for exactly the use I have described. But, to put it in the vernacular, this ain't that. This honey is dark, and VERY strong. When the box arrived from Amazon today, I made a batch of buttermilk biscuits and sat down to enjoy a real treat. Unfortunately, it was no treat at all. The strong flavor of this honey overpowered the delicate flavor of the biscuits. It was very disappointing.<br /><br />So, if like me, you are hoping for the light golden sweetness usually provided by these little cups, look elsewhere, lest you be disappointed too. But if you like strong honey, like say, buckwheat, and you want the convenience of single serving cups, then this is for you.

He put his foot down on Wheat Pasta in Spagetti, so after hearing Dr. Oz mention this is the Pasta they use at home, I decided to try it and immediately We both were sold, no more white flour for us!!! It's great, light tasting. My only suggestion is the cooking instruction time is a little off. For me it's done at 8 minutes, so the first time you make it keep an eye and check for your desired doneness. I highly recommend this product!!!

review/summary: This Pasta Queen Loves It!
review/text: I was watching Dr. Oz on TV and saw that a person who loves pasta didn't want to give it up in order to loose weight.  Dr. Oz said that his family eats Artichoke Pasta and he thinks is a great alternative to regular Semolina pasta.  The woman who loves eating pasta said that it was very good and that she would start eating the Artichoke pasta instead of the Semolina pasta due to the nutritional value of the Artichoke pasta.  I have to agree that I could NOT taste a difference!  This review is coming from and Italian woman.  I have been eating pasta since before I could talk so I am not pulling your leg that this stuff is good.  It is expensive so I will use it as much as I can afford to but if you want a great alternative to regular Semolina pasta that you and your family will like, buy some Artichoke Pasta!  I think you will be surprised at how it taste nearly identical to your regular store bought pasta but with much more nutritional value.

review/summary: Zapata - Fire Roasted Salsas (Hot, Med. Mild & Green)
review/text: First off, I greatly enjoy these salsas as my everyday salsas, especially for cooking.  We have a store in the local Cleveland area that sells them for $3.29 a jar (as of Oct. 22, 2011) ... previously they held at $2.99 for the longest time (years).  The hot is not overly hot, and the medium fits the bill for family recipes.  The green is equally enjoyable.  The mild, while good just doesn't have the bite I look for in salsa however, I could understand many friends would find this their favorite.<br /><br />Now, my bone of contention is with the price listed here (and elsewhere on the web) for sale - $14 for a jar of processed salsa.  Even local producers who produce a fresh product max out at $6/16 oz.  For $14, I would say run away fast ... it's good stuff, however no way is it worth $14/jar.

review/text: This is my prime seasoning for not only pork dishes, but, beef and chicken as well. I bought this seasoning to try something new for BBQ dishes beyond the typical rubs. I expanded to using it for stews. This does not have salt in it which means I can add salt to my taste. I was blown away by the fresh black pepper scent upon opening the package and the rich smoked paprika flavorings as my dishes cook. All the spices are well blended. Buying the larger version next time!<br />Updated 7/2012: I've been using the seasoning almost two years and I'm still very pleased with the results in dishes!

review/summary: Exact popcorn from the movies-Nothing else needed!
review/text: I bought this in the 6 ounce when Amazon offered it for my 6 ounce machine.  Anyway this comes with the popcorn, oil and the salt flavoring which includes Flavacol (that secret movie theater ingredient).  I also bought extra butter topping and salt but that was a waste of money because this popcorn kit is all you need.  Any more salt is too much and the butter is perfect.  After I made it no one wanted anything extra on theirs and said it was perfect.  Also follow the directions on the popcorn package and not your machine to get the most kernels popped.  I know my 6 ounce in this popcorn made 7 small square boxes of popcorn so this makes more than that but keep in mind this popcorn tastes awesome cold too.  Keep it in a cool area so the oil side does not melt (easier to handle not messy).  It seems the first 1/3 that pops is the most buttery so after it all pops stir it up in your machine to even that out.  You will love this product if you want that perfect movie theater popcorn that is yellow, buttery, salty and flavorful.  No need to buy anything else.  I did a lot of searching on the internet to find "that" taste and now that I found it I wanted to share it with you to save you time and worry if you are getting the right thing.  So enjoy.

review/text: Recently purchased the 6 Oz. Paramount popcorn machine along with the Mega-Pop popcorn kits for my husbands 50th birthday...and he couldn't be happier!  We've only had it for about a month but are going through 3-4 packs of Mega-Pop a week.  Our Monday night football group (5 couples, not just guys!) chose this popcorn over strawberry cheesecake for dessert, and we've been put in charge of supplying the popcorn for our montly movie night.  The kids just arrived for Christmas and can't stop eating it.  Not only does this taste like real movie popcorn, it's good for a couple days after popping.  We just turn on the heat lamp in the popcorn machine and it tastes as fresh as when it was first popped.  Thank you to all who posted reviews prior to my purchase...you helped me choose a delicious and entertaining birthday present for my "hard to buy for husband!"

review/summary: Mmmm... Pretty damn good for frozen cheesesteaks
review/text: These are pretty good and close to the real deal for frozen cheesesteaks. I live in South Philly, very close to Pat's and Geno's actually, and have eaten them both, in addition to Jim's on South.  While I unfortunately haven't been to Tony Luke's on Oregon, I purchased these as a gift for my father in FL to have authentic South Philly cheesesteaks.  None of the other native South Philly cheesesteakers offer their product through mail order, so Tony Luke's was it. and honestly, I enjoyed these better, or at the very least n par with the unfrozen fresh versions that I've tried.  In fact, these now have me wanting to try a fresh Tony Luke version as well just for comparative purposes.<br />The steaks arrived pretty quickly. They are fulfilled through Rastelli, the frozen meat cataloguers.  And lucky for me, they accidentally sent me two.  The boxes they arrive in are pretty big, but that's to ensure that's to fit the styrofoam and dry ice to keep the product cold and frozen.  Beyond that, the rolls are individually packaged separately from the individual vac packs of meat and cheese. Rolls are heated in the oven and meat packs are boiled up to heat.  Put 'em together and it's as fresh as you'll get.<br />One cautionary note, when adding the meat to roll, make sure to drain liquid from the pack before, as to not soggify the roll. Learned my lesson. Otherwise mmmm... Pretty damn good.  Add fried onions for that extra authentic add.

review/summary: Tides me over until I can get back to Philly!
review/text: I'm originally from Philly, now living in the Northwest. I can't find a decent cheesesteak to save my life out here. After reading the positive reviews, I decided to give Tony Luke's a try. It was AMAZING. Even frozen, Tony Luke's is better than anything similar I can get in the Northwest.<br /><br />The food was property packaged in a cooler filled with dry ice. Cooking and assembly are a snap. I'm about to place my second order, since the first one was so great!

review/summary: Fantastic flavor.  My favorite.
review/text: I love the truly unique flavor of Pickapeppa.  Its relatively mild, perhaps 5/10, but it more than makes up for it with outstanding flavor.  The unique flavor comes from the mangoes, but the combination of other spices is exquisite.<br /><br />It's similar to A1 in thickness but VASTLY tastier.<br /><br />I'm a fan and I buy this by the gallon thru Pickapeppa's website.<br /><br />As for their other sauces, give 'em a pass.  All are too sweet for my taste, particularly their "hot" sauce.

review/summary: Pickapeppa's pick-a-perfect
review/text: Since trying this sauce a couple years ago I have fallen in love with it. So many flavors combined... the sweetness of the sugar and raisins, the tangy tamarind, mango, and onion, the little bit of heat from peppers... all combine for a versatile and delicious sauce. Use it alone as a condiment or steak sauce, or try blending it with other sauces. I love adding a couple tablespoons of Pickapeppa Sauce to a small jar of chunky salsa for chicken tacos, adding it ground beef before making meat loaf, or even adding it to overly sweet spaghetti sauce to mellow it out and add extra layers of flavor. Put simply, Pickapeppa is a must for my kitchen and I heartily recommend it !

review/summary: a favorite for years
review/text: I couldn't count the number of bottles of Pickapeppa original I've been though over the past dozen years -- it's that good. It's one part of day that is never boring, one part of a dish that is always delicious. Flavourful without overwhelming everything else, spicy without being relying too much on the peppers that are part of the recipe.

review/summary: Fabulous sauce. Must have for the pantry.
review/text: I used this sauce with some green cabbage and polish sausage a while back and it really brought out the fantastic flavors of the kielbasa! It's like no other bottled sauce I've tried.

review/summary: Pickapeppa has grit in it
review/text: I am a huge fan of Pickapeppa sauce. Use it on everything. However, the last three bottles I have purchased contained some kind of grit in it. It looks like black sand. Hope they fix this problem, and it goes back to its usual high quality. Won't eat it until then.

review/summary: Pickapeppa is so fantastic!
review/text: Growing up in the South, this sauce is a staple in the fridge; however, after moving off, it's been a struggle to find it.  Everytime we go home, my husband and I buy 4 or 5 bottles to hold us over until our next trip home.  I was super excited to see it available through Amazon.  A versatile sauce: it can be used in gumbos, soups, casseroles, and my personal favorite, poured over cream cheese and scooped with a cracker!  Yum!

review/text: Love the taste, especially the mango flavour. This sauce can go on any meat. Will do nicely on hot dogs - a completely different but spicy taste compared to the usual ketchup and or mustard. It's worth its price
