review/text: very disappointed with this brand and was indeed shocked to see some of the raving reviews turn out to be sooo wrong. Makes me want to believe that reviews are not really written by real people. Where can I start? it is a very dry and bland recipe with no taste, that did not cook right at all. We used to purchase and cook Flappin Jack Pancakes, and it was wonderful. This thing just tasted downright horribly bland. Our first attempt of following directions and using Buttermilk yielded nothing shy of gross pancakes - we tried it with regular milk and butter and that was not much better. I am sad to say that I bought 3 of these and should have never wasted my money. So, if you like fluffy, buttery taste pancakes that melts in your mouth, do not waste money on this piece of junk recipe.

review/summary: Best Pancakes!
review/text: We had Robby's pancakes at the restaurant near St Petersburg, some years ago.  We were disappointed to find out the restaurant had closed, but then we found that the pancake mix was still available, from "Golden Malted".  This is our second order, and the pancakes are almost as good as if we were at Robby's Pancake house.  Of course,there's more work involved.  The order was easy to deal with, and delivered quickly.  What more could we ask?

review/summary: Not the BEST $$ can buy but the best all-over Bittersweet Chocolate in THIS price range: Great for Cooking & Snacking
review/text: While it is certainly true that there are other superb Bitterwseet chocolates out there that can outshine Scharffen Berger in a one on one taste test, I have yet to find one that could consistantly deliver this same level of quality at this price point and still achieve all the things we look for in a very, very dark chocolate.  One would have to have access to a dependable Artisanal Chocolatier to find that and even then, I doubt they could came in at even less than twice the price.<br /><br />This is why Sharffen berger is the preferred chocolate of both home and professional bakers at this busy time of year.  We know it will deliver to us a nice evenly noted Bittwersweet taste not too waxy nor overly creamy in texture and that this 70% Cacao bar can be easily incorporated into ganaches, used to melt and then coat dried fruits for Holiday platters, serve as the basis of a decadedent Southern Chocolate layer cake 6 layers high or, be snapped off into the scored triangles and enjoyed by the cook as a not-too-guilty indulgence full of flavinoids and anti-oxidants your store-bought candybar has long abandoned in the name of cheap, artificial vanillas and tropical fats to replace to Coco butter.<br /><br />Some people I tried to tempt with a small serving of the bar, snapped off and offered as the perfect marriage of bitter and sweet just couldn't get over their love of rich Milk Chocolate but if you make sure the bar is warmed to at least 78 to 80 degrees, very gently on a plate, it melts a little eaiser in the mouth as it warms up to body temperature and loses the waxy sensation that people eating it at a colder 65 degrees tend to report.  So if you plan to serve the bar or eat the bar on it's own, respect the coco butter's richeness and the fact that there is less of it in this dark bar.  Give the bar the time and environment it needs to warm up.  I put my oven on 100 degrees, open the door until the interior temp goes down to 80 and then slide the prepared triangles on a serving plate onto the top rack sitting on a cookie rack and leave them there until I can see the chocolate loosen up just a bit.. maybe 10 minutes at best.<br /><br />For cooking, well - you simply can't beat this bar.  it grates well with a microplane, easier if warmed a little, and it incorporates well into nbatters.  it melts well but make sure your recipe actually CALLS FOR a 70% Cacao bar or you may need to add some fat to get the correct texture.  Use a reliable recipe or recipe book author and do a test run if you've never cooked with this before.  I would say to save this deliciously bittersweet chocolate for your company who know a good brand when they taste it and incoprate it into the frosting of a centerpiece cake or use it in one of my favorite recipes, the Wlanut Dark Chocolate Bourbon Pie , also known as the Kentucky Derby Pie or a Christmas Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie.  The intesnity of the chocolate matches up well with a good aged Bourbon in a dessert.  In fact a good, rich yellow caked soaked with bourbon, layered with wet walnuts ( or candied Black Walnuts) between and then spread with a Bittersweet Chocolate frosting  is a grandstanding finish to any Holiday party.<br /><br />Viva le Sharffen Berger!  An indulgence we can all afford.  You can find a decent recipefor the aforementioned Derby Pie in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579654347">Desserts from the Famous Loveless Cafe: Simple Southern Pies, Puddings, Cakes, and Cobblers from Nashville's Landmark Restaurant</a> and find excellent Bittersweet chocolate dessrt recipes that uses this kind of quality chocolate in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904456863">The Bittersweet World of Chocolate: Sumptuous recipes using fair trade chocolate</a>.

The nice thing about 70% Cacao Chocolate bars is that they do not melt quite so easily as Milk Chocolate so they work well in the summer recipes as well.

There's also  slight notes of fruitiness.<br /><br />This would actually be good for those on a diet. The flavour is so rich, intense and satisfying, that I can only eat a little at a time, whereas I can (and have) easily consume a entire milk chocolate bar in a manner of mere minutes.<br /><br />And, on that note- dark chocolate actually has health benefits!

review/summary: Very good but not great
review/text: Today three of us (all of whom believe that we love dark, bittersweet chocolate) taste-tested Sharffen Berger Bittersweet Dark Chocolate against Lindt bittersweet, Ritter Sport Dark Chocolate a la Mousse au Chocolate, Krause's dark chocolate (from a local handmade chocolate shop), and Trader Joe's dark chocolate.  Trader Joe's failed -- it had no vanilla or other flavorings and was hard, almost crunchy, seemingly lacking in sufficient cocoa butter.  The Lindt chocolate was fine-textured, full-flavored, and somewhat creamy.  It contained vanillin, an artificial vanilla flavoring, rather than real vanilla.  The Scharffen Berger was less sweet, but also creamy, smooth, with a nice color and sheen, broke nicely, and was rich and full-flavored, with notes of vanilla (it has the real thing) and citrus.  The Ritter was very creamy and much sweeter and much less complex in flavor.  The Krause's was also quite sweet, full-flavored, smooth, and creamy.<br /><br />All three of us liked the Krause's chocolate best, then the Lindt, then the Scharffen Berger, then the Ritter, and none of us liked the Trader Joe's.  I've always thought I liked chocolate just as bitter as possible without being hard like unsweetened baker's chocolate, but this taste test suggests that Sharffen Berger's was perhaps not sweet enough for us, although it was excellent in texture and had a complex flavor.<br /><br />The Sharffen Berger's claimed to be gluten-free.  Only the Ritter claimed to contact milk products.<br /><br />I plan to repeat this process, adding Godiva and chocolate from<br />Hotel Chocolat.  I'll report back.

review/text: This sleek, thin chocolate bar has a strong bouquet and is fairly complex. Most notable are the vivid berry and earthy notes. The chocolate is smooth with just the right amount of sweetness to temper the cacao's bitterness. Only a small quantity is necessary, as this one packs a great punch and lingers long in the mouth. Highly recommended.

review/text: Not me. This wasn't overly strong, for being a 70% bar, frankly I expected more. It was pleasantly fruity-flavored, but that's where it ended. I've had 70% bars that had a much brighter, sharper flavor, and that's what I happen to like in chocolate. This was kind of chalky and dull. Perhaps the 80% is a better option.

review/summary: Does not taste like 70% Cacao
review/text: After reading all of these positive reviews, I thought the Amazon Gold Box deal on these bars of chocolate would be a winner! Boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />For one as myself, who enjoys dark chocolate taste, one bite into this chocolate and all I could taste was SUGAR. Yes, SUGAR taste with 70%??<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, and the amount of sugar and fats looks comparable to my other 70% chocolate bars, but the taste is far off.  If I were to guess the percentage, I would guess 50-55%.  This tastes much more like semi-sweet chocolate chips than fine chocolate... and chocolate chips are MUCH cheaper!<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this brand of chocolate.... unless you are used to Hershey's style and want something only slightly higher in quality.

review/text: This is an excellent chocolate. It isn't too sweet as many are for me.<br /><br />I like the idea of eating the 70% Cacao dark chocolate, which is supposed to be healthy for us, as long as we don't eat too much of it. Speaking of which, you will definitely not need more than a fraction of a bar at one sitting. As a chocolate fanatic, I could eat the whole bar, but I really don't 'require' it with this. A moderate piece works just fine, a little bit like an after-dinner chocolate. You don't have to eat the whole thing at once. After thinking about it, I think I may chop up a little and put it over ice cream. Yum!<br /><br />Moderation in all things, right?

review/text: Scharffen Berger Bittersweet Dark Chocolate Bar, 70% Cacao is one of the better dark chocolates I've tried. It's not too bitter, and not too sweet. My normal preference is "semi-sweet" chocolate containing around 60% Cacao, but I enjoyed the 70% "bittersweet". It was just sweet enough for me. The chocolate is definitely better quality than the average mass market store shelf brands, and I recommend it.

review/summary: really bittersweet!!
review/text: I am, undoubtedly, a lover of dark chocolate, and I am known to try any dark chocolate bar in any variation/concoction I can get my hands on, regardless of the brand, so long as it does not have high fructose corn syrup in its ingredients. Having never tried Scharffen Berger chocolate products before, I was unsure what to expect. I tend to purchase and quickly consume Green & Black's organic brand as my preferred choice, even if it is slightly pricey. To me, dark chocolate is just dark chocolate, and although I will eat any dark chocolate, I still have expectations, and I was certainly pleased with Scharffen Berger's fine dark chocolate. This bar contains 70% and it's labeled as bittersweet, which is exactly what it tastes like, bittersweet. I never mind a bitter taste, but the sweetness to this bar makes the taste perfectly neutral, which was the taste I was looking for after drinking coffee. Needless to say, if you are a lover of dark chocolate and enjoy a touch of sweetness, this bar is perfect for you. This pack of 6 makes a great gift, especially a stocking stuffer now that the holidays are around, for any dark chocolate lover. Lastly, I have to admit that if you buy the pack of 2 (for 9.7 ounces worth of chocolate) versus this pack (18 ounces of chocolate), you might be saving yourself a few dollars for a little more of chocolate, but that's for the merchant to decide. I definitely recommend this chocolate!

review/text: To me, balanced usually means boring, and this chocolate could easily have been that. Fortunately, it has a lot going for it. It smells complex. It snaps cleanly, but not in a brittle way. The surface has a matte sheen. It melts to a very smooth and rich texture in the mouth. There is only a moderate amount of chocolate flavor (for a dark chocolate), but it's accentuated by flavors of dark raisin and enough bright notes (floral?) to make it interesting. It's not too sweet with only a hint of bitterness (I could have used more). Wonderful for a mass-produced bar.

review/text: I love dark chocolate, and the Scharffen Bergen is a yummy treat and a great bar of bittersweet dark chocolate. I have not heard of this USA based company and would highly recommend trying this brand of chocolate. Nice smooth bar that melts in your mouth with a delicious floral flavor and just the right amount of bittersweetness. It's right up there with the more upscale brands and does not have a lot of sugar, junk or additives. They even designed the breaks triangularly, so it's easy to snap off a piece. Overall, a great product at a price of around $2.60 a bar with the $5.00 coupon Amazon is offering as of today.

review/summary: A great tasting bar
review/text: I received these and the Scherffen Berger Papua New Guinea 68% series. Both are outstanding chocolate bars. This 70% percent bar doesn't quite have the readily apparent complex flavor of the 68% bar, but you can discern slight hints that they are there. The ingredient list between the two bars is identical (although different bean stock is likely used) with slightly more fat in this bar and a bit less sugar. What you would expect though as you get a higher percentage bar.<br /><br />I am a bit of a cheapskate when actually faced with bars on the store shelf and will tend to pick up what is on sale or lower priced. When I ordered these I wasn't expecting to taste a big difference over the lower priced offerings. These bars do taste better then most I have tried though. I won't rate my sense of taste as being refined enough to threaten anyones wine or chocolate tasting job anytime soon, but even I can pick up on the different flavors as I am eating these. They are great tasting and I would recommend.

review/text: Various health benefits have been ascribed to dark chocolate, and I hope they're correct, because there's no more delightful and not-very-fattening treat than a small piece (or maybe two) of this 70% cacao chocolate.  As another reviewer has observed, it's unlikely one would or could eat a whole bar, and even the "serving size" of one-half a bar is, surprisingly, an overstatement of what a typical person's intake, in one sitting, would be. It is said that Julia Child once claimed that Scharffen Berger was "America's finest dark chocolate", and while I'm willing to keep sampling until I taste them all, I wouldn't doubt it.

review/summary: Very good smooth dark chocolate
review/text: According to Wiki, Scharffen Berger was an independent chocolate producer in the San Fransisco Bay area that was acquired by the Hershey Company in 2005.  Scharffen Berger continues to produce chocolate under this name, now at a plant in Illinois.  Its products include the Bittersweet Dark Chocolate Bar reviewed here.<br /><br />Scharffen Berger Bittersweet Dark Chocolate is 70% cocoa and is considered "bittersweet", with a much stronger chocolate taste than milk chocolate that most Americans consume.  Though this is definitely a rich dark chocolate, I was actually a bit surprised by how smooth the Scharffen Berger chocolate was; though there is the slightest hint of bitterness, it is less than other 70% chocolate bars I have tried before.  If anything, as person who admires dark chocolate I wish that the Scharffen Berger had a bit more character; it is very good and very smooth but isn't memorable to me like their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NSKWMQ">Scharffen Berger Mocha (Dark Chocolate with Freshly Roasted Coffee) Chocolate Bar (62% Cacao)</a> is.<br /><br />In any event, Scharffen Berger Bittersweet Dark Chocolate is still a fine product that I will enjoy whenever I have the chance to have some.

review/summary: Good, not great
review/text: Scharffen Berger used to be a local (SF) chocolate factory.  Now that they have moved half way across the country, I'm not as enthralled with them.  It seems that freshness is a factor in dark chocolate flavor after all.  (Dark chocolates last at least a year, longer in my experience.) Or perhaps SB is not quite as good as it was before.<br />70% chocolate is the level where dark chocolate becomes truly dark, in my opinion.  Below that percentage, there are some fine chocolates, but not ones that I buy. 72% Guittard dark chocolate is my favorite for chocolates in the 70s.<br /><br />The SB 70% has the crisp snap when you break it.  And it melts nicely in your mouth, if you let it linger. And it has some nice complexities in the after-taste. If you are moving from 55%-65% chocolate to the true dark chocolates, then this is a nice introduction. But I do not recommend buying six bars if you have never tasted it.<br /><br />Go to a brick&mortar sweets store and buy an assortment of bars. If you are lucky enough to have Eastern European grocery stores in your area, try some of the Russian chocolates. Some have honey for sweetener, which I personally don't like, but might be wonderful to you.  Some have brandy, which I do like.  Also Cost Plus has a fabulous selection of chocolates, including a 99%. One tiny square of that goes a long way.<br /><br />As far as pricing goes, I see these bars in our groceries for under $4.00, but only by pennies.  Cost Plus has the best prices, at least around here.  So if you know you like this chocolate and you live somewhere that does not have gourmet chocolate bars, then this is a reasonable deal.<br /><br />One last comment: The bar is scored in large triangles.  Most bars have smaller rectangles, three or four across. I prefer the smaller rectangles because it helps me regulate how much I eat at a time. And one of these triangles is more than my regular portion. What can I say, I'm a unit eater.

review/summary: Really Good Chocolate
review/text: Scharffen Berger chocolate is made in Robinson, Illinois on vintage European equipment.  I received 6 bars of bittersweet dark chocolate that measured about 6 inches by 3.5 inches.  Each bar is 220 calories.  They were wrapped in foil then wrapped in a paper wrapper.  The wrapper says that the bar is 70% cacao.  Cacao is everything that comes from the cocoa bean.  Knowing how much cacao there is usually helps you know how concentrated the chocolate taste will be.<br /><br />I compared this bar to many of the other common and not so common chocolate bars made in North America.  This chocolate broke easily and melted in your mouth smoothly.  The taste was excellent.  These bars of chocolate were easily as good or better than the famous big name chocolate bars.  It is very rich even if there are only a few calories in each bar.  The six bars lasted a long time.

review/text: The Scharffen Berger Bittersweet Dark Chocolate Bar is a delicious, delightful chocolate bar.  It's semi-sweet, without really any noticeable bitter taste, and has a smooth, soft texture (at moderate room temperature).  I've enjoyed a lot of chocolate, often from Switzerland where we have friends, and the Scharffen Berger bar compares favorably with their best.  This is high quality chocolate, not your typical mass-produced candy of dubious ingredients.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that bars are not scored, so breaking off uniformly-sized pieces is difficult.  As an added bonus, I also very much like that the product is American-made.

review/summary: Still the one!
review/text: This is still the same amazing quality chocolate, the one that cooks and bakers all over the San Francisco Bay area and then all over the country started raving about back in the 1990s:  U.S. produced gourmet grade to go up against anything from the European market.  On top of that, this chocolate is affordable - priced similar to many "gourmet" chocolate brands of good to indifferent quality such as the Newman's organic line (which I recently tasted for another review.)  Okay, I'm cheap, and completely unimpressed by advertising embellishment or slick packaging - Scharffen Berger is great chocolate without the "ooooo, how exclusive!" baggage.<br /><br />I'm San Francisco born, and will admit that when Hershey bought out the late Dr. Steinberg's startup back in 2005, I was saddened and predicted the worst; that the company would be out of San Francisco (probably outsourcing production to some overseas factory) and that the quality would go down.  I'm happy to say today that I am -- so far, knock wood -- mostly wrong.<br /><br />Mostly because Schaffen Berger *did* leave San Francisco, closing the Bay Area factories and moving production of the bars to Illinois.  Certainly disappointing, but at least production stayed in the U.S.  And whatever the backlash, it certainly wasn't the media circus attending Marshall Field's Frangomints leaving Chicago in 1999, after 70 years of production there.  I lived in Chicago for 3 years around that time, and can tell you that the public outcry/anatagonism against Marshall  Field's/Macy's was unfading and of astonishing proportions!<br /><br />In any case: Scharffen Berger chocolate, to me, today tastes the same as it ever did.  If you love chocolate for it's complexity, depth, and even it's bitter bite, if you're not just into the smooth and the sweet, if one little wedge of the good stuff beats a truckload of - sorry - Hershey bars, for you, then this is the stuff you'll dream of, forever after you first try it.  Even my children have preferred the high cacao product from early on, and likely your kids will love it too...assuming you're willing to spoil them for the "cheap stuff".<br /><br />But heck, Chocolate is healthier as a not-everyday indulgence is the first place, right? Or...at least not much, everyday...

review/text: I've always preferred dark chocolate. (Not surprisingly, I don't care for chocolate made with Dutched -- alkalai-treated -- cocoa. Bleh.) In college, I used to go out after dinner for a Hershey's Bittersweet bar. (It was more bitter than the current Special Dark bar.)<br /><br />I was expecting something spectacular from Scharffen Berger's 70%-cacao bar, and was (sorry) bitterly disappointed. Their description -- "bright fruitiness and a long, smooth finish" -- is accurate. (The lingering bitter taste is especially pleasing.) But there's insufficient "complexity" to justify a $5 price. The taste isn't sufficiently "better" (or more-adult, if you like) than a much-less expensive Hershey bar. Definitely /not/ a treat to be savored, one small bite at a time.<br /><br />A "good" chocolate bar, but of questionable value. See if a friend will give you a bite before you commit to buying.

review/summary: Great for Nibbling, Vegan too.
review/text: Can't go wrong choosing this 70% for, at least for snacking.  It has a deep chocolate flavor with minimal bitterness and minimal fruitiness.  Eating it by the square (or triangle) is a pleasure.  1 or 2 pieces satisfies.  While this bittersweet bar is certainly a great bittersweet dark chocolate, my favorite in this category is the Valrhona 71%; but I have a hard time finding it.<br /><br />One note:  Hershey bought Scharffen Berger in 2006.  Hershey closed Scharffen Berger's San Francisco Bay area plant and layed off most, if not all, of the workers.  SB is still made in the USA but in Robinson, IL.

review/summary: Chocoholics Beware!
review/text: If you're looking to treat yourself with a delectable dark chocolate then look no farther than the Scharffen Berger brand. Made of fine, quality ingredients, the 70% cacao bars are smooth and rich, definitely bittersweet, and with a slight fruitiness to its flavor (as described on the wrapper rather accurately) and without the waxiness that can be found on some inferior chocolates. Since there is such a large percentage of cacao in the bar, making the taste stronger than most, I find I only need a tiny piece of the three ounce bar to curb any chocolate urge I have and far from half a bar they have as a serving (220 calories per serving, 440 for the whole bar). This is a great choice to get the health benefits dark chocolate provides. It would also make a great gift for any chocoholic in your life or be used decoratively on various desserts. A very nice dark chocolate that more than satisfies and is sure to please most anybody's dark chocolate craving.

review/summary: Simply Impressive
review/text: I need to accept the fact that I am somewhat of a dark chocolate snob. I am not proud of it, but I have found myself time and time again disappointed by brands that many people like and seem to have no problems with. There are two main flaws that I have found in these products that do not fulfill my expectations: some have a noticeable bitter aftertaste that ruins the experience, and others have a huge problem with texture, and you feel like you are chewing powder or a dried out version of what the product is supposed to be.<br /><br />I am happy to report that this chocolate passes both those tests with flying colors. It has a smoothness that blew me away, it almost reached the levels of the smoothness you may find on milk chocolate. You can definitely identify the bittersweet taste when you are eating it, and the flavor remains constant in after it's out of your mouth. There is not a hint of the dreaded bitter aftertaste here.<br /><br />If you, like me, have struggled to find affordable high quality dark chocolate, look no further, this is where it's at!

review/summary: So creamy
review/text: I've been a fan of dark chocolate way before it was considered healthier than milk chocolate.  This is my first time trying this brand and couldn't be any more satisfied.  I'd like to eat an entire bar at once, but at more than 400 calories I cannot afford it.  Just like other reviewers have said, it is nice and smooth, creamy and almost fruity.  Nice chocolate flavor.  It is great for baking as it makes some of the best chocolate ganache I have ever tasted.  In two words: "Just excellent!"

review/summary: Excellent dark chocolate
review/text: Scharffen Berger is known for being high quality chocolate, preferred by some chefs for baking.  Although some of the very dark chocolates can not only be bitter but one-dimensional and chalky, this one has a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness and also a fruitiness that I enjoy.  If you're used to Hershey's, you'll be surprised that chocolate has a lot more complexity than emerges from any of the mass-produced, very sweet, waxy candy bar-style chocolates. Although I won't deny I love the taste, I eat as much chocolate as I do these days mostly for its purported health benefits, so I usually eat unsweetened (or baking) chocolate.  70% cacao is actually at the sweeter end of the spectrum for me, but I know some people who wrinkle their nose at it as "too bitter."  I find it great for munching or cooking, and it's a good choice for those who are looking for the health benefits but don't find the super dark variety palatable.

review/text: Suprisingly listed as a later division of Kraft foods in the USA, this Artisan Confection has a rewarding taste with cacao's natural health benefits wrapped inside.<br /><br />Scharffen Berger Bittersweet Dark Chocolate bar probably comes close to  having similar nutrients found in the darkest berries; yet, it's rich, smooth, and perfectly balanced with sweetness that's not too bitter.  In addition, mixing a piece with hot water and/or milk makes a tastety indulgence.

review/summary: Decent semi-sweet chocolate
review/text: This bittersweet "dark" chocolate is unremarkable, but fine. I generally like dark chocolate at 80% or higher. These bars are 70% cacao. I think that is the minimum percentage to be called dark chocolate.<br /><br />It tastes similar to other chocolate bars with 70% cacao, so why pay more (and deal with the absurdly long name)?<br /><br />There isn't much more to say. It's just a barely-dark chocolate bar. If you want something more interesting, try their 68% bar from Papua New Guinea. That has a unique fruity flavor (without any fruit in it).

review/summary: Awful fish coating
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers about the Scharffen Berger Bittersweet Dark Chocolate Bar, at 70% cacao.  It's chocolatey yet it manages to be both bitter and sweet at the same time, which is a good combination if you like your chocolate to taste of chocolate and not so much of sugar.  I think it's an acquired taste, like espresso or a single-malt Scotch or a fine cigar or a six-month-old chunk of Limburger cheese.<br /><br />Because I am as big a fan of high-octane cacaoa -- and 70% is high indeed -- as so many other reviewers are, I appreciate the deep flavor of the bean as it resonates through the remaining 30%.  To my palate there's the slightest nuance of coffee and perhaps an insouciance of lignin, and just maybe the tiniest tincture of acetic acid and vanilla.  Altogether it works well, at least for me, as a chocolate bar to nibble at from time to time.<br /><br />I have to point out that, based on numerous experiments I conducted over the last couple weeks, the Scharffen Berger Bittersweet Dark Chocolate Bar at 70% cacao is at best neutral and is at worst positively disgusting when added as an ingredient -- in various concentrations and whether melted or not -- to certain recipes such as onion soup, ranch dressing, potatoes au gratin, and steak tartare.  Also, don't waste your time melting a bunch of this chocolate bar in a double-boiler and dipping the guts of a McDonald's fish fillet sandwich into it and letting it cool and then expecting it not to surprise you with just exactly how awful it is.<br /><br />The bar does not serve well as an eraser for errant pencil marks; it just leaves behind a waxy brown blob that's even uglier and harder to remove than the original mistake.  I'm not sure which reviewer said it would make a good eraser, but it doesn't.<br /><br />Also contrary to a reviewer's assertion, I did not find any GPS transmitter hidden in any of the wrappings or in the product itself, and I looked pretty hard.<br /><br />For these reasons, including the cons, I still have to rate this product at 5 stars.

review/summary: Good Deal.....Very Tasty
review/text: Like most of us I have been eating animal crackers since I was a kid.  Nothing seemed to go with the TV westerns of my childhood like animal crackers and milk.  I don't really think this Stauffers brand was around back then.  Only that familiar other brand with the circus animal on the box.  I have to say that taking a chance on this big container of them didn't disappoint.  They are just as tasty and look just as much like zoo animals as any other.  I keep them around all the time for the kids and grand-kids, and for myself, (with or without a western).  This large container is very easy to store them in an keep them fresh.  For one thing about animals crackers, (which are really little cookies) is that they get really soft and stale rather quickly if not kept sealed.  The big Stauffers jar is handy and makes sense.  And they are a downright bargain when you order two or more at once and save on shipping.  Oh and one last thing.  These cookies are a great take along when visiting one of those petting zoos where you get to feed the animals.  (Although check with the zoo first just to make sure).  The animals love the cookie critters, and the kids get a kick out of feeding them animal crackers.  Order some and enjoy with a big glass of fresh milk... : )

review/summary: These have great shelf life
review/text: I was shopping at my local drug store late one Saturday night and I stumbled across this brand of animal crackers. I've tried Barnum and Keebler before but not this brand so I wanted to get it. These Stauffer's Animal Crackers are a lighter version of both the Barnum and Keebler. They have less fat and calories and taste more like a cracker whereas the other 2 are more like cookies. So I guess you can eat more of these without feeling as guilty. One aspect of these Animal Crackers that really stood out for me is that they have amazing shelf life. The package I bought is not the same as this one on Amazon - it more resembled a potato chip package. So I opened it and ate some and then closed it with a clip and then I forgot about it for a while. It must have been sitting there for about 2 months before I remembered I had it. So I tried it and it was as good and as fresh as new. I was amazed. Would definitely buy these again.

review/summary: AMAZING JERKY and SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH
review/text: I am somewhat of a jerky fanatic due to its great protein vs calorie content, and the flavor is pretty helpful as well.<br /><br />FIRST OFF, the service was awesome[not the shipping, but I am in Iraq...sooooo that probably had something to do with the time :)]  The reason I say the service was so good was due to my inspection of the package.  Upon opening I see not only my bag that I ordered, but there are also 3 other packages(samples, of which two were a fairly large amount) of different flavor/cuts of jerky.  So, not only do I get the Cajun Western Cut, I now know that the Maple Jerky is AMAZING, the Chipotle Habanero is RIDICULOUSLY FLAVORFUL(I really like hot stuff.  Not to say that this was hot, but the flavor was amazing.), and I haven't tried the spicy sample (but I am sure it is nothing short of the previous reviews)<br /><br />The original purchase is pretty tasty, but I will likely be reordering the habanero.  The cajun is lackin on the spicy side, has a decent flavor, and the cut/quality of meat is superb for all of the above.

It was sweet like candy and had absolutely no heat to it.  I would say more like sweet Teriyaki.<br />I think this recipe needs a redo.  Jerky should not be this sweet.  The bag of jerky I bought was passed around to 5 other people who all said it was too sweet.  I spent 8 dollars on a bag and threw it in the trash.  Very disappointed.  If I could give you zero stars I certainly would.<br />I cannot recommend this to anyone and will not buy any of your products.

review/summary: defective k-cups - coffee grounds explode into machine
review/text: most of the reviews that said that these cups explode were written a few years ago, so i took a chance and bought them, hoping timothy solved this problem. he did not. 3 out of 4 of these k-cups explode into the machine, filling all the nooks with coffee grounds. i have found that if i run just half a cup of water there are less explosions (but half a cup of coffee is not very satisfying). a full cup of water will always produce an explosion and coffee grounds are just everywhere. WTF, Timothy?

review/summary: Timothy's Decaff Coffee for the Keurig Brewer
review/text: We got a Keurig K-Cup brewer about a year ago and found that we were spending far too much locally buying the coffee in small quantities.  I checked on Amazon, and found the Timothy's World Coffee and have been purchasing it every since.  We only drink decaffeinated coffee and found it hard to find sometimes locally, but with Amazon, as always, it was available.  We got delivery in a timely manner and will continue to purchase Timothy's World Coffee.  It is such a pleasure to be able to have a "fresh" cup of coffee when you want one instead of depending on a full pot to stay fresh all day.  We put confidence in Amazon to always furnish the best available.

review/summary: decafe coffee
review/text: Timothoy's Columbian decafe is a full bodied and delicious tasting coffee.  When the doctor told me I<br />had to drink decafe, I thought to myself that I would never enjoy a cup of coffee again.  It took much<br />serching and many disappointing cups before I found Timothy's.  I can honestly say that I really do<br />enjoy my morning coffee once again. At Amazon I found that the price was managable and the delivery is<br />supurb.

review/summary: I love this decaf!
review/text: Timothy's Colombian Decaf is about as close to full flavored caffeinated coffee that I have found. If I liked a normal roast then this would be 5 stars since it takes like a great cup of regular coffee. The issue is that I like extra bold and dark roasts and this tends to be a little on the weak side for me. If it's too late for caffeine though, this is my go-to decaf!<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are looking for a great cup of coffee and decaf is your only option, go with this. You won't regret it (at least not in my opinion).

I save money and I have a perfect cup of flavorful coffee every time I make a cup. Many people claim they don't like decaf coffee because it doesn't taste like regular coffee, but I challenge anyone to taste Timothy's Columbian Decaf and then tell me that it isn't a great tasting cup of coffee.

review/summary: Timothy Defective K-Cups continue
review/text: There are several older complaints in this and other forums about defective Timothy's K-Cups.  We purchased the 50 unit multi-pack recently and 30%+ are defective.  When making coffee the drinking cup is filled with grounds and the machine is contaminated with loose grounds requiring a thorough clearing before another use.  We carefully removed the top from a defective K-cup and found the filter pulled loose from the K-Cup rim and folded down on itself.  This allows grounds to wash over the loose filter edge and into the machine and drinking cup.  Timothy Coffee has not addressed this quality control issue for many months and continues to sell defective K-Cups with current lot dates.

review/summary: Best Decaf I've Ever Tasted
review/text: Thanks to all that took the time to write reviews of this product. My doctor told me I had to give up caffeine, which devistated me because I hate the taste of decaf coffee. After reading tons of reviews on various decaf coffees for sale on Amazon.com, I decided to try this one. I am so glad that I did. This coffee tastes great! It's a nice medium blend coffee and the best part is that there is no funny after taste. Plus you can't beat the price. I am highly satisfied with this coffee and will definitely buy it again.

review/summary: Nice flavored, Medium roast Decaf coffee
review/text: My wife drinks this coffee daily. Takes a cup with her to work every morning. Drinks a cup most every evening when she comes home. She needs decaf, but she doesn't like the weak flavored decaf coffees you normally get/see. This one is a medium roast - so it's a bit stronger. In the Keurig, you can make a large sized cup and it still tastes like coffee, not like watered down coffee.<br /><br />We Subscribe & Save this item, and have for the past 18+ months. One problem is the price of coffee recently. A year ago this case of 50 was Subscribe & Save priced at less than $18. A GREAT price!!!. Les than a year and several price increases later, it's now nearly $26! That almost a 50% INCREASE in price! That's crazy! But, it's still cheaper than the typical 18 count boxes we can get locally. (Though with a coupon, it's about the same). One more price increase and it's back to the local store.

review/summary: Defective K-Cups from Timothy's
review/text: I LOVE Timothy's Colombian Decaf. It is the best tasting Decaf out there. However, I have struggled repeatedly with DEFECTIVE K-Cups from Timothy's. For some reason water will not go through the K-Cup resulting in a cup full of coffee grounds. I have tried the Timothy's K-Cups in 3 different Keurig Coffee Makers and Timothy's is the only one with this issue. I have found this problem with more than 50% of the K-Cups I have purchased. Thankfully Amazon gave me a full refund for the DEFECTIVE Timothy Cups (all 4 cases). If you don't mind crunchy/chewy coffee, then Timothy's Decaf is for you...if not then you are going to be like me...looking for a tasty alternative Colombian Decaf from another manufacturer. Considering the high cost per cup of K-Cups in general, I cannot afford to continue to be Timothy's guinea pig due to their lack of QA/QC.

review/summary: Dissapointing K-cups
review/text: I have purchased quite a few k-cups through amazon with success, but this last shipment was very different. Instead of being in the original Timothy's boxes, the k-cups were loose in the box (mostly likely because it has changed to 50 instead of 48). I wonder if these aren't rejected cups. Since using this shipment many of the k-cups have been defective and, as other posts have mentioned, the grounds end up everywhere. I have used this on several different machines and get the same result. The price is great, but the quality has gone down. Not sure I will purchase these through amazon again.

review/summary: used to love; now disappointed
review/text: I used to love this decaf-was my favorite, great flavor, non-bitter but good flavor bordering on strong which I liked.  The last carton I received through Amazon.com is weak.  I can only use the small cup setting to make it okay.  I used to use the larger setting and add a little extra water.  Has the amount of coffee in the K-cups been reduced?  If the next batch is the same I will be looking for another brand.

review/summary: Coffe Pods from Amazon
review/text: I couldn't believe that I actually found the coffee pods at Amazon and for a very reasonable price. I was looking for decaffeinated coffee and there it was! the coffee is delicious. I hope to order more soon.

review/summary: Fresh brewed decaf
review/text: We bought the Keurig machine because my husband has to drink decaf and I don't drink coffee at all.  Instant is not a great option.  The Timothy's Columbian Decaf is great, fresh brewed and easy--with no left over coffee to waste.  It is perfect for us!

review/summary: a bit weak
review/text: Still looking for a strong decaf that will work in my machine. I put the cup size on the smallest possible, but the coffee is still not as strong as I would like.

review/summary: Exploding K cups, grounds everywhere
review/text: I ordered these K cups thinking that they were going to satisfy my craving for coffee and come to find out these K cups have done the exact opposite.  I arrived home after a long day at work and saw the box on my doorstep.  I was pretty excited to try these and proceeded to make one.  Not even 2 mins later I hear a "BOOM".  Come to find out I walk in the kitchen and see a complete disaster.  Not 1, not 2, not 5, but 10 k cups out of 15 that I made EXPLODED coffee grounds all over my kitchen. I am completely dissatisfied and went right then to buy a drip coffee maker.  I will say though that the coffee was pretty good when it didnt explode but its a gamble to make them knowing that there is a possiblitly of an extra 5 mins work of cleanup to follow about 2/3's of the kcups.  Thanks alot for all the extra work.

review/summary: HATE decaf.....LOVE this!
review/text: Wow...I guess "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" when it comes to coffee.  I purchased this for my hubby since he drinks WAY more then he should.  This is his after dinner/night coffee.  It's GREAT!  Yes, I actually DID try it....I do not like decaf coffee and this is excellent.  This is like going to a fine resturant and getting their decaf coffee.  So....this gets 2 HUGE thumbs up from me and OH YEA, hubby loves it and this is our second order here from Amazon on this.

review/summary: Best Decaf
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee, and this is the only decaf I have found that actually tastes like a good cup of coffee.  I like the fact that I can just make one cup at a time as well.
