review/summary: This is 1/2 step up from cat food
review/text: Actually, I feed my cat wet food and the chicken pieces in that looked significantly higher quality. I suppose if there was some kind of apocalypse and you're futilely hiding from our new alien overlords in some attic inside a blownout dilapidated building and you couldn't find any rats to kill and cook over a trash can fire, this might suffice to technically keep you alive. I imagine this must be close to the quality and taste of Russian prison food or perhaps the porridge in Oliver Twist. The entropy grey color of this slop is quite unappetizing and makes me feel as though I should have my head stuck through a gate and eating it out of a trough like a pig. Probably the only positive thing I can yield from this is that it allowed me to exist for 6 more hours without feeling hungry.

review/summary: I LOVE this stuff!!
review/text: I'll concede that it isn't very pretty, but is it ever delicious. I would live off of this if I could. I love that it's salty. I add some La Choy Soy Sauce and eat it over white rice. It's very difficult to get in my neighborhood so I am excited that it's available on Amazon for decent prices. It's much more expensive on other sites.

review/summary: I will urge my local store to stop carrying this
review/text: I think there is no such thing as a "good" or "bad" food. However, I believe there are foods that I would choose to eat again and those I would not. This is the latter. Russian prison food I know not, nor Dickensian gruel, but the food served by the 3rd Infantry Division during the mid-70's nadir of its morale on snowy evening German logging roads is fondly remembered compared to this. And I'm afraid, like another early reviewer said, its smell reminded me of pet food.

review/summary: THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA
review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING "REAL BREWER'S YEAST" -- NOTHING ADDED<br /><br />This "Genuine Brewer's Yeast" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

review/summary: B Vitamin Bonanza
review/text: I first encountered brewers yeast when pregnant.  It kept coming up again and again as the perfect food based nutritional additive.  Since it is food based and not a suppliment, it is easily absorbed.  However, it is known for its unpleasent taste.  A serving is two heaping tablespoons, and at first I could not find something to mix it in that I liked well enough, so I gave up on it temporarily.  It kept coming up in my researches for a healthy pregnancy, and so returned to it and it has remained part of my daily routine.  The mix I found I like quite well is the two heaping tablespoons mixed into about 5oz of Pom pomagranite juice.  This mixture is actually quite pleasent.<br /><br />I have tried a few different brands, and I am fond of Twinlab for the more palitable taste and the balance of the B vitamins.  The "subscribe and save" deal on Amazon puts it at a very good price.

review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPUPSS">Brewer's Yeast</a> is for my cats. Every day I sprinkle a little onto their food. They like the taste of the yeast and regard it as a special treat. The yeast provides them with extra B vitamins.<br /><br />One of the vitamins in the yeast is vitamin B1, thiamine. Many people believe that thiamine repels fleas. This has not been proved. However, since the cats like the yeast, they get in on their food. One 18 ounce bottle seems to last forever. Also, they do not have fleas.

review/text: I ordered this as what is said to be a more bio-available source of chromium and B12, as well as essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals and trace elements, vs most of the peddled chromium supplements. I haven't tried sprinkling it directly on food but I have enjoyed adding it to my shakes and the flavors it imparts. A blender helps when adding to liquids as it seems to mix about as well as powdered cocoa.

review/summary: Good taste, bad solubility
review/text: I started taking brewers yeast because the large amount of chromium in it is supposed to be very good for your skin, especially if it's acne prone. I've been taking it since the end of January and my skin still breaks out a little bit, but I stopped taking it for a couple of days and my face broke out a lot so I suppose that it is having some sort of an effect. An online review I read said that most people's skin cleared after eight months in an study, so I am staying positive.<br /><br />I started out by taking Swansons' Brewer's Yeast Powder, and mixed it in smoothies and grapefruit juice. I tried mixing it in orange juice, which was pretty bad, and even just having it with water, which was horrible and made me gag. Because I wasn't crazy about the taste, I read some reviews and decided to try this product next. The taste is much better, it is much less noticeable, especially if I add a little bit of peanut butter or grapefruit juice to the smoothies. The taste is also not at all noticeable in warmed apple juice. I don't have the courage to try it in plain water, though.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is that it does not dissolve well. I cannot stir it in any cold liquid without getting clumps (hopeless when stirred with a spoon or knife, somewhat works when stirred with a fork but little clumps remain), I can barely dissolve all of it in warmed liquids, and if I put it first in my blender when I make the smoothies, a lot of it remains at the bottom. In that respect, I liked Swansons' Brewer's Yeast better. This one is a little bit high maintenance because if I want to just have it in grapefruit juice, I have to put it in the blender first and when I make smoothies, I have to make sure that it's one of the last things to go in. I would, however, buy this product again if I can't find a brewers yeast that has the taste of this product with a better solubility.

review/text: this stuff is ok.  I was hoping it was the flakes but it's a very fine powder, like a flour consistency.  Which makes it kinda turn pasty when sprinkled on veggies or sprinkled on popcorn.  The taste isn't bad, not really great either, but not bad.  I think the yeast flakes would be better, more texture.  But since it only comes in the 3 bottle package, I have 3 bottles to get through now before I can buy the flakes!  If you're not sure you'll like it, try to find it in a single bottle first.

review/text: I fed my cats this food (and sometimes the organic version) for two years. They loved it and were healthy and happy. Then PetSmart stopped selling it and I looked for alternatives. One they hated and wouldn't eat, one was ok, but I settled on Science Diet because of it's good reputation.  Almost immediately, I started finding spit-ups of largely undigested food everywhere.  Realized that we had the same problem with our prior cats on Science Diet.  It may be more costly, especially with shipping, but I am going back.  The savings in time and clean-up efforts are worth it, my kitties love it, and it smells so good I almost want to eat it!

review/text: I compared this to Starbucks Antigua. Starbucks is about $10 per pound which is a reasonably good price at least now for premium coffees. I found the Starbucks to have a mellower flavor and not nearly as acidic as the Copper Moon. The Starbucks brand beans do have an oily sheen to them vs. dry beans from Copper Moon. That said, I still think the Cooper Moon is quite good and fine for an everyday coffee. I am generally pleased with it but I will probably revert back to Starbucks since it is better and the price is not that much different. My daughter disagrees with me however. She does not like the Copper Moon at all when compared with the Starbucks. She felt that the Copper Moon had an odd smell.

Tiramisu is amazing and bares a huge resemblance to the actual dessert and so does creme brulie. I recommend these chocolates, but I would see if these chocolates are at your local Walmart because I got this 6 oz. box for 8.98, not the 19.99 plus 11 dollars worth of tax this site is asking. Unless there is more than one box in the shipment, I don't think it's a good idea to get it shipped if you have the option to get in store.

review/text: I don't usually like chocolate desserts because they are usually too sweet and sugary, but this Lindt selection isn't like that at all, in fact it's the opposite, the sweets are light and exquisite. I got this box as a gift and it was finished within 2 days as each family member tried to get his/her favorites before the others got them! Of course Lindt is a famous brand of "usually expensive" imported chocolates but it's prices have fallen in the last 20 years or so, so that it falls into the realm of mid-priced expensive chocolates.<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you want something a little bit more than plain chocolate and you want something that's light and refined. If you give this as a gift, your recipients will totally thank you for them!

review/summary: Better than Typical Store-Bought Boxed Chocolates
review/text: First, I will say up front that I purchased these chocolates off of the Lindt site itself in a 21-piece ballotin ($12 there) because I had a coupon/deal voucher.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Lindor truffles, but I have a friend who loves these petit desserts. So, I figured I'd give them a try!<br /><br />First impression - Adorable! If you're looking for dinner party chocolates, these would be lovely.<br /><br />Texture - The chocolate still is a tad waxy, but not nearly as bad as the Lindor truffles. The fillings are smooth and taste similar to the desserts that each chocolate resembles. There are different textures - different than what you'd find in typical chocolate boxes. Crunchy nuts, crispy meringue and phyllo-ish substance, and creamy creme brulee and lemon.<br /><br />Taste - Each chocolate has a unique taste, but not so unique as to not be enjoyed one after another...so, be careful ;)<br />Each chocolate tastes somewhat like the dessert.<br /><br />Overall - They aren't Godiva, but they're the next best name brand thing I've found!

Or our guests from Europe bring Lindt as gifts too. Lindt chocolates taste like home.

review/summary: Buyer beware, Proctor & Gamble has ruined this food!
review/text: My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!<br /><br />We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.<br /><br />Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.<br /><br />Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more "crumbly", i.e. there is a lot more "food dust" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.<br /><br />So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called "Simply Nourish", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.<br /><br />WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing "Innova Cat & Kitten", or planning to buy it in the future, we believe that P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it was before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!

review/text: Very disappointed. These lollipops are advertised as 3" diameter. When they arrived, they looked small, so I decided to measure them. The pops were 2"-2.5" in diameter, not 3", which makes a big difference. Also, each lollipop is supposed to be individually wrapped with a twisty-tie, but some of the ties were missing in the boxes I ordered. These are being returned.

review/summary: Get Creative!
review/text: These are interesting.  You open the packet, rinse them off and then throw them in boiling water for just a few minutes.  The texture is slightly diffent, and they taste like absolutely NOTHING, so you need to get creative.  They will take on the flavors of whatever you cook them in, so, if you are a creative cook, they can be a great alternative to dishes where you may use pasta.  The "Rice" is more like a pastina, so they work well for soups.  The "angel hair" is my favorite though.  I make a lot of stir fry dishes, so these are great to throw in, and as stated, they will take on the flavor of the oils and spices.  If you are trying to consume less carbs, these can be helpful, but don't expect a taste and texture of semolina pasta.  Also, they have absolutely no nutritional value, so they are strickly just a filler.  You don't want to consume these and nothing but these to lose weight or you will be starving your body of the nutrition it needs, especially while dieting.

review/text: I'm watching what I eat (isn't everyone), and use my George Foreman grill daily, for chicken.  I use just a sprinkle on each side of the chicken breast, and it transforms boring old chicken into "wow". Got to watch the sodium level (hence just a sprinkle), but a little goes a long way.  I've introduced this to many of my non-persian-heritage friends, and they've loved it.  This is definitely a staple in my kitchen.

review/summary: Best yeast
review/text: My daughter-in-law gave me a 2 pound bag of Red Star yeast last Christmas and it has lasted me 8 months, baking a loaf of bread almost everyday.  I take a small amount and put it in one of my old 4 ounce yeast jars and freeze the rest and it has kept very well. In my opinion Red Star is the best yeast out there, but not always available at my supermarket and you can't beat the price, 2 pounds for $14.88 sure beats $8.99 for a 4 ounce jar at the supermarket.

This bag has the same product without the extraneous packaging and will serve you for months while bringing your yeast cost per bread/cake down to pennies (10-15x cheaper :)).

review/summary: Baker's yeast
review/text: As far as I am concerned, bulk is the only way to buy yeast. These little packets and tiny jars are ridiculously priced for what you are getting, and beside that most people arent using enough yeast in their baking either. I use yeast for everything from bread to pancakes to corn bread. I use more than most people do. Unlike baking powder and soda, yeast is actually nutritional (as long as it is cooked, never eat it uncooked). Yeast adds a nice flavor and aroma not found in these 'powders'. I don't know where some of the common practices for using yeast came from, but I've found that you don't need to let things rise two or three times unless, that is, you are looking for a way to pass time. Also like in pancakes, just mix up the batter and throw it on the griddle, it rises for me. But don't be so stingy with the yeast. Yeast is not some rare thing that needs to be conserved, actually it is cheaply made, yet yeast boasts rather high nutritional value.<br />  I may be biased, I rarely if ever bake with white flour, I use whole wheat, corm meal or perhaps rye, mostly whole wheat. I use egg in my dough, batter etc., rather than the added white flour for gluten. Again the egg adds flavor, nutrition and RISE POWER without damaging the texture or character of the whole wheat or cornmeal product.<br /><br />  Red Star is offering a great deal here, and the price is right.

review/summary: Gold star for Red Star
review/text: I compared this yeast to a popular brand of jarred, bread machine yeast. This yeast gets an "A" while the other yeast gets an "F" (which coincidentally is the starting letter of its name.) The "F" yeast did not last a month, even though it was stored properly. Within 4 weeks, it had lost its potency and failed to make decent bread. Meanwhile, this 2 lb bag of Red Star, kept in a sealed plastic tub in the freezer, has worked for months on end. I found that in my bread machine recipes, the same amounts work, no matter whose active dry yeast is called for; 3/4 tsp per 1 lb loaf.<br /><br />Just make sure you store the opened bag in a proper container to keep it dry and cool, and make sure to bring the yeast up to room temperature before throwing it into the bread machine. This is a very economical way to buy yeast. If it's too much for you, split the bag between you and a friend.

The granules are tiny.<br /><br />Yes, you can get bulk yeast a bit cheaper in some discount stores, and in groceries, but this is for sure worth it at the price.<br /><br />Just not having to run around the kitchen looking for little packets of yeast, or having to cut them open, try to pour into your measuring spoon, etc. I divide the yeast up to about 2 to 4 zip locks and stick them in the fridge. I keep one handy to use, all I have to do is open it up, stick in the measuring spoon, and close it back up. Easy. And you never have to worry about running out.<br /><br />You can save TONS of money making your own breads and pizzas, and it is fun, too. And almost always tastes better.

review/summary: Best yeast and the best price I have seen anywhere.
review/text: I have been baking with yeast for more than 25 years. I have tried other brands, but Red Star is by far the best one I have ever used. I don't use anything else. Use to buy it in the little packets at the grocery store, but they are way to expensive. I found it in a 1 lb package from a popular baking company and have been ordering it through them for many years. However the price of the shipping was almost as much as the yeast, but it was still cheaper then buying it in the packets. I was thrilled to see it on Amazon and to realize I could get two lbs for what I was paying for one and no shipping cost.<br /><br />Since it is such a large quantity I store it in the freezer and it last until I run out. No problems with dead yeast unless I kill it by making the liquid to hot. I would highly recommend  purchasing Red Star.<br /><br />I have read some reviews saying you can get it at some of the warehouse stores for less. I have never seen it in ours and not everyone has a membership or a warehouse near by. So if you like to bake with yeast this is a great deal.

review/summary: Fabulous!
review/text: For years, I always bought the little packets of yeast at the grocery store. Then, we got a bread machine to make more bread at home instead of always buying it, so we needed a good amount of yeast. I'm now fully convinced that if you use yeast on a somewhat regular basis (more than just once or twice a year) that it makes the most sense to purchase it in bulk like this. And if you can't get this locally in your area, this is a really good way to get it and have a good quality yeast for all your baking needs. We've been using it for months now to make primarily different breads, but also pizza crusts, cinnamon rolls, and a few other things requiring yeast, and it works really well. I store it in the fridge in between uses, which is the way I was taught yeast is supposed to be stored, and it's still going strong. I definitely recommend this, and if you can't find it anywhere locally for a better price (or want it delivered straight to your door!), this is a great way to get it as well.

review/summary: Decent value for active dry yeast
review/text: Mainly I think this product is good value.  Also, there is an advantage to getting active dry yeast as opposed to cake yeast.  It has low moisture content, giving it longer shelf life.  The shelf life of active dry yeast is 2 years from the package date, but it's advisable to use it within a year.  If frozen, it can last for over 10 years.  The main disadvantage is that it's more vulnerable to thermal shock than other baking yeasts.<br /><br />As an alternative to dry active yeast, you might prefer instant yeast.  Unlike active dry yeast, it doesn't require rehydration, plus it is has a much higher percentage of live cells.  Some people swear by it.  If you'd like to get instant yeast, here's a popular one on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZEGN0">Fleischmann's Instant Yeast - 2/16 oz. bags</a>.<br /><br />The main reason I get this yeast is the value.  Sometimes I can't believe how much small packets of yeast go for in stores.  I make my own bread because everybody loves quality fresh bread, and I have a lot of people under my roof.  They make good bread disappear.

review/text: The dough rose maybe too quickly! That's how good this yeast is. The package was stamped with manufacture date of 6 months ago, and it's very very fresh and effective. The package says it's good for 2 years, so there's still plenty of time to use it all up before it expires. Although, considering how effective the yeast is now, I expect it will still be plenty effective after expiration. I store it in a dark airtight container in the fridge. In my experience, you can store the yeast on a cupboard, as long as the cupboard doesn't get the heat from the stove (or environmental if you live in warm climate).

(about 18 months)  I contacted the seller first to check that detail out before I bought it.  I suggest you do that too. (2lbs is a lotta yeast!)  Anyhow, I love having yeast in bulk. I can use it without thinking about the price.  It's up to $2.69 for a tiny 3pack in my neighborhood!<br /><br />As for the product, it's great.  Breads rise beautifully in my bread machine.  I was concerned because I use the quick yeast in the bread machine. But this yeast worked just as good.  No having to dissolve it first either.  Just lay it on top with the dry ingredients just like the bread machine recipes tell you.

review/text: I have never had a problem using the bulk red star yeast in the 2 lb bag. It's an even better deal if you can get it from Costco. I paid 3.99 for the same two pound bag being sold for more than 2x that here.  I had to pay 6.99 for a four ounce jar at the grocery store!  I just keep my bulk bag in the freezer double bagged in freezer bags.  I refill my little glass yeast jar as needed, and won't have to buy more for several months!

review/summary: Save Money and Bake Better Bread
review/text: If you bake frequently, you can save enough money in a very few months by not buying yeast in little foil envelopes to buy a pretty nice bottle of wine.<br /><br />Active dry yeast will keep almost indefinitely when frozen, so you'll need something to keep it in.  Get one of these: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00189XVXA">Brabantia 298004 Clip Top 4/5-Liter Plastic Canister</a> for another $13.<br /><br />Keep the canister of yeast on the freezer door.  When you need yeast, get it out, measure what you need, and put it back.  Never let the contents warm up.<br /><br />According to Harold McGee, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a>, yeast should be dissolved in 110� water.  That feels pretty hot to the touch.  Use a thermometer until you have {ahem} the feel of it.<br /><br />Yeast "works" best at about 95�.  I put yeast breads in the oven with the light on to rise.<br /><br />So, you've saved a bunch of money and you're baking better bread.  Glad we had this little chat!

review/summary: RED STAR | This product is exactly like the store (small individual tiny spheres)
review/text: When ordering this product, I was wondering if this was a "solid" block of yeast, or exactly like the 0.75 oz. packets sold in small packets.  It is exactly like the small packets sold in stores (it is individual spheres about the size of BB's).  For me, I has placed 1/4 of the bag in a sealed container, and the remaining 3/4 placed in a vaccuum bag, and placed in the freazer.<br /><br />I am not sure if I will even use 1/4 bag (8 oz), but buying it this way is much cheaper than even a small jar from the store.  For my needs, this will be "endless" yeast for many years.

review/summary: What can you say about yeast?
review/text: Without being facetious, how do I rate yeast? It came promptly. The packaging was as described. The yeast works well and everytime I use it,it rises as it's supposed to. To keep it fresh,I do use it almost on a daily basis to make bread, I put some in a glass jar in the refrigeator and store the remainder in jars in the freezer until needed.Although it may take quite a few months, I do use up my supply of yeast long before the expiration date, so I can not attest to its longevity.You can't beat the price over supermarket yeast, especially if you do a lot of baking.

review/text: I bought this to use with my bread machine.  The yeast came vacuum sealed (like a brick of coffee) and the expiration date is 1 1/2 years away.  I tested it and it is fresh. I figured this was enough yeast to make anywhere from 96 to 120 loaves of bread.  So if you make 5 or 6 loaves of bread a month, you will use it up by the time it expires.  I think it was a great purchase.

review/text: A consistently good result in baking bread 3x a week.  Buying 2 lb at a time beats (in price and convenience) the 4 oz jars available locally as well. This quickly became my every-time yeast.  The first thing I do on opening the package is transfer all the yeast into 8 oz canning jars, which are then stored in the refrigerator.  That way, only what's in one jar gets disturbed with each use.

review/text: I've always had better luck with Red Star than any other yeast for machine bread baking.  And buying a two pound package is a lot cheaper than the store bought 4 oz. jars.<br /><br />I knocked off a star only because of the price here.  As another reviewer said, Smart and Final has this for about $5 (but I think him/her rating it at one star for that alone is excessive).  Some people don't have a Smart and Final close by, and if that were me, I wouldn't hesitate to order this.

review/summary: Good Product-Bad Price
review/text: I recently started baking a lot and decided to look for bulk yeast. I couldn't find it at the local stores in my area, including some of the fancier stores that sell odd products. I started to order it from King Arthur, but a 1 lb bag was $6.95 + $6 shipping. Amazon's is at least a bit cheaper if you order over $25 and get free shipping. Thanks to the reviews here I found we have a Smart and Final not terribly far from where I live. Out the door a 2 lb bag was about $4.59. I've never looked at Costco, but will the next time I go. Some people say the 2 lb bag is too big, but even if you only use a quarter of it, you've still come out ahead over $4.59 for a 4 oz jar. I will try freezing some of my package since a lot of folks seem to have good success.

review/summary: I can enjoy yeast bread again
review/text: Several people have commented on how well this yeast works as well as how economical it is so I won't be repetitive, I'll just wholeheartedly agree. The only thing I'm doing different is I'm freezing all of it and taking it out when I'm ready to bake. However, this is not the reason I purchased the yeast in the first place.<br />I have never had any problems with yeast bread until I recently started making my own bread. I had used a machine years ago with no adverse effect from the Fleischmann's yeast. When I decided to start making bread again, I wanted to challenge myself and try to do the kneading and the whole nine yards without the use of any machines, well except my mill, not into rock pounding grains:). Besides, it might prove to be a necessity someday. My problem was, no matter what bread I made, even very sweet cinnamon rolls or how well the bread came out, the smell of the yeast overwhelmed me and made me ill so much so that I couldn't even stand the smell of my house let alone stomach the bread. I would also taste the yeast for many hours later if I ate any of it. I could only surmise that I had developed some sort of allergy to it. I was pretty much beside myself, one because I had still had a good bit of Whole Grain wheat left & an expensive new mill but two because I could walk into Restaurants and bakeries and the smell of the yeast rolls baking made my mouth water. So what in the heck was wrong with the Fleischmann's? To my dismay, I couldn't find anyone else with a similar problem. So I studied many hours to learn how to make my own starters and even tried a friends Amish starter but bread did not get the raise I wanted nor the lightness. Neither am I a sourdough kind of girl & if I wanted cake, I would have made a cake, not bread want-to-be.  I wasn't ready to give up and thank goodness I didn't.<br />When I found this yeast, I was like why not, if it stinks, I can put it through my septic tank.<br />I made bread yesterday and to my delightful surprise it didn't make me sick, & I'm sure pouring it into jars stirred it up in the air a bit too. I halved the amount of yeast I used in the recipe, just to play it safe, and it did the job perfectly. I can't lie and say I thoroughly enjoyed the smell of the yeast, but the unpleasantness was minimal. I hope this doesn't change but at least for now, I can love my yeast breads again.

Our hope is that the yeast survives that long.

review/text: Red Star Yeast is an excellent yeast.It works better than some others- better rise and taste.We are keeping two small working jars and the rest in a tightly closed container in the fridge. We bake bread almost everyday. Nothing beats the home baked bread. Amazon shipped it and we received the package on time.We are very happy with the company.

review/summary: Not effective
review/text: I've been using Fleischmann's Bread Machine Yeast to make bread in a Panasonic bread machine for a number of years.  I recently purchased a package of Red Star Baking Yeast on Amazon, to try to save money.  I was very disappointed with the Red Star yeast and have just discarded it.<br />Using the Fleischmann's yeast, I need 1 1/4 teaspoon to make a perfect small loaf of bread in 1 hour and 55 minutes.  This amount of Red Star yeast produced a rather pathetic un-risen loaf, so I gradually increased the amount of Red Star yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons.  Although I was able to get my bread to rise more by using this higher dose of Red Star yeast, the loaf had more of a square shape than a rounded shape, it had a coarse texture, and it tasted "yeasty."<br />I've gone back to using Fleischmann's Bread Machine yeast.  Although expensive at about $8 per 4-oz jar at the local supermarket, it seems to be worth the price.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KWEZTO">Red Star Baking Yeast, Vacuum Packed, 2 Pounds (32 ounces - 908 g)</a>

review/text: It's yeast. It's everywhere. Nothing special about this package. It makes bread rise. There is nothing special about it. Fleischmann's is a touch cheaper.

review/text: Two pounds of Red Star Active Dry Yeast for just under $9.00 *is* a good value but this exact product is $4.79 at Smart & Final which is an even better value. I'm not sure why the price here is almost double Smart & Final's price?

review/summary: Too much of a good thing
review/text: The product seems to work well - there's just too much of it.  The home baker<br />probably will not be able to use 2 pounds of yeast before it loses its<br />effectiveness.  I doubt I will purchase again - will first try the brand<br />available at super market to see the result.  Bought this because it was brand<br />used to test recipes for the Bread Machine.

review/summary: Interestingly darker than green tea
review/text: I've been drinking different brands of green tea regularly for a while now & since I adore the scent of white tea body lotion & bath products, I thought the real deal might be just as wonderful to drink.<br /><br />So I bought Salada white tea & was surprised that it steeps darker than green tea (I guess I expected white tea to be lighter & more delicate) & it has a strong flavor, not what I'd call dainty.<br /><br />I have a whole box of 40 bags to use up, so I'll see how I get accustomed to it. But right now I'm surprised to find I prefer going back to green tea, which bitter flavor I always hated (but ultimately got used to). Maybe I'll get used to white tea also. I'm sorry to say, right now I'm really not liking it.

review/text: Probably the most tomato-ey chips I've ever had. They taste a lot like tomato sauce that you would put on spaghetti. I would've preferred a more subtle tomato flavor but these are worth a try.
