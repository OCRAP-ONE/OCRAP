review/summary: Excellent Walnuts
review/text: Looking on Amazon for a selection of Raw nuts I found these Now Foods Walnuts.<br /><br />I use other supplements from Now Foods and find them to be of the highest quality, so I tried these Walnuts.<br /><br />To no surprise they are an excellent product.  Tasty and didn't get any of the surprise rancid ones as you do with other brands.<br /><br />I was totally satisfied and am ordering again.

review/summary: Price Comparison
review/text: I've tried the NOW Foods organic walnuts before. These regular walnuts however are not as fresh as the organic ones I purchased. In one bag, I came across about 5-6 rancid ones, but compared to a bunch of other brands I've purchased, NOW Foods walnuts are still a bit crisper, lighter, and fresher tasting, regardless.<br /><br />That being said, I want to remind shoppers that you can purchase at Trader Joe's a 16-oz bag of walnuts for $7-$8. Whereas NOW Foods (at this time, they are being sold for $27 for 3 packs, $9 per pack) is only 12 ounces for $9. I've tried both, and in terms of freshness, they are roughly the same, but NOW Foods walnuts are noticeably a bit larger. But when it comes down to it, it's really about the amount you're consuming -the weight, and not size. And you can get way more for less if you go with TJ's. Unless, you're using these walnuts for some kind of fancy display or something on a cake, or for guests. But, I've never seen anyone make a cake with whole walnuts smothered all over it or use a walnut as a centerpiece.<br /><br />BUT, if you plan on buying the NOW Foods Organic line of walnuts, which run for about $10-$11 per pack on Amazon, they are more worth the cost since they are noticeably fresher and overall richer in taste compared to this bulk package of regular walnuts. I've never found a rancid nut in NOW Food's organic walnuts. So, in summary, you're better off with a one pound bag of TJ walnuts or, if you're willing to pay an extra buck (or $3-$6, if you buy 3 packs of the organic ones), for the NOW Foods Organic walnuts.

review/summary: One of the better Earl Grey's even for a tea snob.
review/text: I have tried several different brands of Earl Grey including a couple of loose leaf varieties from fancy tea boutiques. I really must admit that Bigelow's version is probably one of my top two favorites (Stash also makes a nice Earl Grey). It has a nice smooth and balanced flavor and the bergamot is spot on. I also like that it is all natural and made with real bergamot oil. It is also easy to find in almost any grocery store. Five stars!

review/summary: Good flavor, stays fresh in sealed packets.
review/text: We drink a lot of tea in our household - black, green, white and a variety of herbal. This Bigelows Earl Grey has been a favorite of ours since discovering it at a Walmart (where it sells for about $2 a box; it sells for around $4 at our local grocery store.) The nice thing about Bigelows teas is that each tea bag comes in a sealed packet so the flavor remains fresh.<br /><br />We enjoy this tea with Splenda and sometimes with lemon for extra flavor. If microwaving your water, make sure it gets good and hot to get the most out of your teabag; if the water isn't hot enough, the flavor is a little weak.

review/text: As a busy law student I often need caffeine to get me going throughout my day.  Since coffee makes me feel nauseous, tea is a great alternative!  Out of all the teas I have tried, Bigelow's Earl Grey is definitely my favorite.  Bigelow's blend of black tea and natural oil of bergamot gives the tea not only a great smell but a great taste.  What I like even more is that unlike other teas, this tea does not leave an after taste in your mouth.  It's also gluten free, although that's not an issue for me.  The best part about this deal, however, is the very affordable and convenient subscribe option!

review/summary: It's our regular dog food
review/text: Our last dog had allergies and we learned how good it is for the dogs to be on good quality food. This is more of a mid-grade food without a lot of fillers. I like the meaty smell and that it is soft.<br /><br />It still has enough fillers to make the dogs poop more. Usually with higher quality products they don't poop as big or as often and the food has a higher nutrition quality.<br /><br />I like this food as a daily food and the price is not as expensive as some of the other products but the biggest thing about it is my dogs will eat it and they don't like some of the other foods I have tried.<br /><br />Our dogs are fairly young at 4 years old and they have no health problems. They are extremely active dogs and this gives them the energy to run miles every day. I'd recommend this brand in a heartbeat.

review/text: I found this product to be fresh and tasty. They also sent me a free sample of some of the beef jerky that was the best jerky I have ever had. It was so moist and tender and fresh and had so much flavor I will order some of it next time instead of the venison jerky.

review/summary: Wondeful flavor
review/text: This is a wonderfully flavored jerky.  It's a fairly smokey flavor with maybe a hint of soy sauce flavor along with the natural flavor of the venison.  It is a bit expensive compared to let's say their "country cut" line of beef jerky, but well worth trying at least once.<br /><br />I do enjoy their "Country Cut Teriyaki" flavor a bit more, but this one is still worth the five stars, and will be something I order when the Teriyaki flavor doesn't appeal to me at the moment.  For the record the Teriyaki has a fairly strong soy sauce flavor, with some smokey flavor, a hint of something else I haven't placed yet (Onion perhaps?) and a very slight sweet flavor.  I've also had the Barbeque flavor via a free sample they sent with my last order (I've placed two orders with them so far, and they always so far send a small sample pack up and beyond the normal order) and although I enjoyed the Teriyaki and this flavor more, the BBQ is very much worth trying at least once as well, the BBQ sauce flavor was very nice and smokey/sweet.<br /><br />The only product I felt wasn't quite up to the same level of quality so far was their mild "short shot" beef sausages.  They weren't bad, and I did rate them four stars but I didn't enjoy them quite as much as the jerky products by them I tried.  I'd suggest just getting a small sample of their snack sausages to try first before placing a large order.

review/summary: Yummy, tempting dark chocolate chunks
review/text: These granola bars combine dark chocolate with crispy cereal. More specifically, they have chocolate layer on the bottom, cereal in the middle, and chocolate chunks on the top. They are similar to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DHNJE2">Special K Bars, Chocolatey Pretzel, 6-Count Bars Net Wt 4.6 Oz  (Pack of 6)</a>, which have been on the market for awhile. These are definitely worth a taste. However, they are slightly higher in calories and fat compared to the other cereal bars (e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZ7HQQ">Special K Bars, Chocolatey Drizzle, 12-Count Bars (Pack of 3)</a>). I also prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006BXUYN8">Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter, 4.76-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> over these, but these are a close second place.

review/summary: Compared to the Other Leading Brands, Special K Granola Bars Have More Protein and Less Fat!
review/text: I suffer from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  Instead of eating junk food such as potato chips, nachos, cookies, etc., I eat high fiber cereal bars.  I love chocolate.  Therefore, I buy the following:<br /><br />  1.  Kashi Dark Chocolate Coconut<br /><br />  2.  Fiber One Chewy Bars, Oats & Chocolate (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z1R1W">Fiber One Chewy Bars, Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>)<br /><br />  3.  Quaker Chew Dipps, Dark Chocolatey<br /><br />  4.  Kellogg's Fiber Plus Antioxidants, Chocolate Chip.<br /><br />  See the photographs that I have posted on this website.<br /><br />  Naturally, I had to request the new Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Dark Chocolate, when it was offered by the Amazon Vine Program.  I found it very comparable to Fiber One and Kellogg's Fiber Plus.  All three taste very similar.  However, I noticed that the Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar had 4 grams of protein, twice as much as the other brands; only half of the fiber as the other brands; and only one-fifth of the calcium.  Only Kashi had the same amount of protein; I buy this bar for the coconut, which I love almost as much as chocolate.  The Quaker Chewy Dipps had more fat than the other bars but was more delicious; it had a thick layer of creamy dark chocolate that completely covered the bar.<br /><br />  On this website, I posted a photograph that compares nutrition facts for three of the five bars.<br /><br />  If you want a more muscular, lean physique, I highly recommend Kellogg's Special K Granola Bars because they have more protein and less fat.  If you suffer from IBS, purchase Fiber One and/or Kellogg's Fiber Plus.  (Trust me, they work.)  If you crave coconut and chocolate in a healthy, high protein snack, get Kashi Dark Chocolate Coconut.  If you crave a semi-healthy snack that has lots of delicious dark chocolate, buy Chewy Dipps Dark Chocolatey; unfortunately, these bars have the highest fat content; 45 calories out of 140 were fat.<br /><br />Joseph B.

review/summary: Delicious, but a bit smaller than the competiton
review/text: At around $.75 per bar, I was a little disappointed to see that the bars are less than 1 ounce each.  Most of the competition (at least the ones I checked in my cupboard) are more like 1.3 ounces per bar, at a lower cost per bar.  That being said, that is really my only complaint.  The taste of the bars is outstanding, and if you're a chocolate fan, you won't be disappointed.  They are not at all cheap with the chocolate as I've seen with some other brands.  Also, the chocolate is actually quality dark chocolate, and isn't overly sweet, which can sometimes be done to compensate for a lower quality chocolate.  I'm not sure what the ideal use for these bars is, but I eat one every morning for breakfast to hold me until lunch, and these do an adequate job of that.  They would probably also be great as a between-meal snack, or great for kids (as long as they like dark chocolate).  I highly recommend these bars, but just be aware that they cost more per bar, and weigh less per bar than their main competitors.

review/summary: A Tasty Candy Bar
review/text: A quick peek at the ingredients shows that while this may not be as unhealthy as a 3 Musketeers Bar, it is certainly not something you should use to replace a handful of almonds as a snack. It contains hydrogenated oils and tons of sugar. Although the flavor is "dark chocolate," the bar is actually made with semisweet chocolate. Don't be fooled by the "Special K" brand into thinking that eating these will shrink your belly down to nothing.<br /><br />I can write that the flavor is good, though I'm not sure that it is appreciably better than the chewy granola bars you can get at Aldi. I enjoyed the marshmallow-like texture with the granola and chocolate. The bar did leave me with a little bit of an aftertaste, which I will assume is from all the oils. However, it was certainly not unpleasant.<br /><br />This is a fine snack if you take it for what it is. Don't think that you are getting a ton of nutrition with this, but enjoy it periodically as a treat.

review/text: I love dark chocolate so assumed I would love these. Unfortunately, not so much. The texture was nice, chewy & not hard. The taste left something to be desired. The dark chocolate is really dark. There was very little sweetness to these bars. They also had a sort of flour taste to them. I looked in the ingredients & did find some various flours listed, including peanut flour for those with peanut allergies. They were just ok for me. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy them. I'll stick with the Fiber One Chocolate 90 calorie bars.

review/summary: Tasty and 'light'
review/text: These are tasty granola bars, but they are not 'dense'.  They are light in weight, calories, and taste.<br /><br />There is, of course, a reason for this: to keep costs down, producers are making products that have less material in them, but charge the same price.  And, of course, the tie-in with Special K means that there is a built-in market for these granola bars.<br /><br />Would I buy them in the future?  I'm not sure.  They were very good-tasting, but, again, 'light'.  It seems as though Kellogg's has developed a product that will hold together without adding a lot of product (and weight) to the granola bars.<br /><br />I must admit I only had two of these bars.  My wife ate the rest of them.  She obviously enjoyed them.  Take that for what it's worth...

review/summary: Good, with more fiber and protein than Quaker granola bars
review/text: These were good granola bars, almost like Rice Krispie treats in texture, with little bits of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Very similar to Quaker granola bars which is my usual granola bar.  The main difference is Quaker granola bars have 1 gram fiber and 1 gram protein, while these Special K bars have 4 grams fiber and 4 grams protein (both bars are nearly the same size).  So if you're looking for more fiber and protein, these Special K bars will fit the bill.  I'll be buying more of these when they're on sale as my husband liked having one in his lunch bag for a snack.

review/text: Not a lot to say, other than these are very good tasting bars. The texture is chewy but not "tough" to eat. They are sweet, but not too much. Good balanced flavor - perhaps slightly rich.<br /><br />The chocolate tastes like chocolate and not some powdery substitute as often happens in bars like these.<br /><br />The only reason I took off a star is that these have caloric content at the high end (not the highest, but high) of the bars we've bought in the past. For instance. these have more calories than our Quaker chewy granola bars. The packaging and the Special K brand imply something better, but these have fat calories, among other things. Now, we would still buy them anyways (hence four stars) but this is not "health food", it's another pretty good granola bar snack food.<br /><br />If it's competitively priced at the store when we're shopping for granola bars, we'll get these in the future.

review/summary: A little below the usual Special-K standard
review/text: I expected quite a bit from the Kellog's Special K Dark Chocolate Graham Bars; it's not inexpensive but Special K products usually deliver value. This one falls a little below the usual standard.<br /><br />The bars are certainly good enough in many respects; they're not overly dry, for one thing (a common issue with many other bars). They're filling and nutritious, although high in calories if you're using them for a snack rather than an exercise energy bar.<br /><br />The real issue is the chocolate flavor. If you're a dark chocolate lover, you probably have definite expectations. I'm a dark chocolate fan, I know other such fans, and we do have pretty high standards. Please keep that in mind when considering my comments.<br /><br />The bar just doesn't deliver that rich, smooth, deep flavor that chocoholics crave. There's a definite artificial quality to the chocolate taste, the kind of flavor associated with cheaper generic products. This isn't to say that the bar has a bad taste; it's just that it disappoints.<br /><br />Should you buy these bars? If you have said to yourself, "Wow, a dark chocolate Special K product!" then maybe not. If you don't have the expectations of the true chocolate addict, you might like them and might be willing to pay the price.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I'll start by commenting on the size of these granola bars. They are small. Really small. Each granola bar is only 0.95 ounce (27 grams). To put that in perspective, A single Pop-Tart is 50 grams. A Reese's (with 2 peanut butter cups) is 1.5 ounce.  Nature Valley granola bars are 1.5 ounce (42 grams) per package (serving) and are 190 calories. This Kellog's granola bar is light as a feather. But I suppose they make them that small so they can keep the calorie count "low". Each bar is 110 calories. There are 4 grams of protein, 4 grams of fiber and 3 grams of fat per serving. I like the flavor of these granola bars. They have a nice consistency, soft and chewy. But because of the small size they are not very filling. They will do if you want a small snack. A really small snack.

There are no nasty aftertastes, either.<br /><br />While I prefer Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars, these are a nice occasional alternative.

review/summary: Great for a mid-morning snack
review/text: I won't wax poetical about the Granola bars--they're...well..granola bars.  I prefer the Special K bars typically because they're not dry, chewy and tend to be the perfect size for a quick snack.  The fact that these were also dark chocolate certainly sweetened the choice.<br /><br />I found the bars tend to work well as a mid-morning snack instead of a mid-afternoon snack.  My job is low intensity as far as physical labor goes--its a desk job and the most physical activity it requires of me is to carry the boxes of paper to and fro occasionally.  To compensate my friends and I go to the on-site gym for 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the afternoon to job, walk and do a little weight training.<br /><br />As such I brought along the Special K granola bars to both a morning and afternoon session.  We found that after the morning session the granola bar helped to a) appease our hunger until lunch (so we weren't reaching for junk food) and b) gave us an added boost of energy.  After the afternoon session, maybe because we had a lunch earlier (about 3 hours), but it didn't give us a signficant boost in energy levels and made us feel fuller than we liked.<br /><br />Caution though, because the bar's bottom is chocolate and its drizzled in chocolate with chocolate chips strewn throughout, it was a better idea to eat this while still wrapped in the packaging.  Without the packaging it became a messy, sticky affair.

review/summary: Nice chocolate flavor
review/text: You get a nice, dark chocolate flavor with these granola bars.  It's not over-powering, but a decent amount of chocolate kick and a definite 'chew' factor.  They're not the biggest bars out there, but again, considering how chewy they are (your jaw gets a nice workout), and the fact that they're only 110 calories, it's a nice snack to stave off the hunger pangs and any sweet craving you might have and still let you feel good about yourself (as well as your diet).  They keep you from rushing through the bar too fast, and they do help with the appetite.

review/summary: Tasty and surprisingly soft
review/text: These bars have a nice hit of dark chocolate without it being overpowering or bitter. Another nice point is that they are fairly soft and chewy. Most of the granola bars I've tried in the past have been either hard and dry with sharp bits that just never feel good in the mouth, or their softness is at the expense of being gummy and too sweet. These were very well balanced. The bars were also just a bit smaller than the average bars, or at least they felt it, and that was a good thing, too. They were more than enough to satisfy that sweet craving without being heavy or too filling.

review/summary: sweet munchy
review/text: There is nothing too terribly exciting about this granola bar.<br />I mean, it isn't awful. I enjoy the blend of the dark chocolate and the whole grains, but it isn't as if there aren't other dark chocolate and granola/grainy granola bars.<br />It is satisfying, flavourful, and enjoyable, but to me, it's nothing to rave about. If someone was looking for a whole-grain/more healthy nutrition bar with dark chocolate, would I recommend this? Maybe. It probably wouldn't be my first choice/recommendation, though I would tell them about it and what I thought. It is good, and I don't doubt that most people would find it enjoyable. But, I guess, there was nothing super grand or superb about it that makes it stand out compared to other bars (other than the name, maybe).<br /><br />Again: it's not bad, it tastes just fine, but it didn't really animate me (or my tatebuds) like other foods have. If you like more whole grains and a bit of dark chocolate, I'd say: go for it. If not, that is okay, too.

review/summary: the dark chocolate is a nice option
review/text: We regularly buy a variety of "on the go" granola snack bars (Special K among them), as they're great for trips or when the kids want a snack. My wife prefers dark chocolate over milk chocolate, so this is a nice option. Other reviews describe the product pretty well, so I won't go into a deep description, but never do the kids turn these down, and the dark chocolate means this is the one my wife will choose first.  :-)  It's a decent bar that I'll give four stars, as I've not yet come across a mass-produced bar that warrants five stars.  Some have warranted one or two, but this one is pretty good and deserves four.

review/summary: protein without heaviness
review/text: I have to say, I generally avoid the protein bars and meal bars.  They tend to make me feel like I just put a bowling ball in my stomach.  These, however, are different.  Yes, they are a little heavier than a granola bar, but not much!  Taste is similar to other Special K or Slim Fast snack bars, but I didn't get as hungry as quickly after eating one of these.<br /><br />My husband also tried one.  He thought the flavor was a little stale, and not as good as the Cliff bars (which I haven't had).  But if you're looking for something that tastes similar to a granola bar but lasts a bit longer, this is definitely worth a try.

review/text: Hi,<br />I like this breakfast/snack bar alot but not a whole lot.  I like the fact that the 'dark chocolate' (which is deceptive) really tastes like dark chocolate.  However, I believe Kellog's uses the chocolate flavoring substance to cover up the other things that are going on with this bar.<br />First,  A small container of yogurt will have less calories and fat than this bar will.  Additionally, this bar contains caffeine, which is a natural appetite suppressant.<br />Secondly, this breakfast bar contains a lot of sodium and fats.<br /><br />Always look at the ingredient labels before purchasing these breakfast bars or drinks--they often contain a great deal of ingredients that you would not normally eat...or give to your kids.<br /><br />Whenever I get a snack attack, I go for a Nature Valley bar.  It's just granola, oats, & honey (there are some other ingredients but it's a heck of a lot better than overly-processed junk.<br /><br />All the Best to<br />You and Yours,<br />Miles

review/summary: More for Less
review/text: There are a lot of products out there that claim to be low calorie or low fat or otherwise healthy.  In a lot of cases you find out it's because the product in question is really tiny, like 90 calorie brownies that sound great until you realize it's only about 1 square inch.<br /><br />In this case the Special K bars are slightly lower in calories and fat than the Fiber One bars I usually eat.  The only reason for this is because the Special K bar is a half-inch shorter.  Each Special K bar is 3 1/2 inches vs. 4 inches for a Fiber One bar.  Yes I did actually measure them.<br /><br />The Special K bar also tastes a little drier than the Fiber One bars.  It does taste OK, but considering it probably costs more than the Fiber One bars, it doesn't seem worth it.  I mean you could buy the store brand Fiber One bars (or even Quaker granola bars) and cut a half-inch off and it's the same thing and would cost less.<br /><br />That is all.

review/summary: Good granolaish taste, an alternative to sugary candy bars
review/text: There is no replacement for fresh fruits, veggies and nuts, but we don't always have the luxury of consuming those every time. Granola bars can be a good alternative to even worse things, like sugary mass market candy bars. With that in mind, this Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Dark Chocolate tastes as you would expect, granola-ish with a chocolatey flavor. No complaints on the taste given what it is. One thing to note, this has semisweet chocolate per the ingredients list, so if you are a fan of high-percentage dark chocolate, this is probably not for you. There is no dark chocolate percentage listed.<br /><br />Each box has five individually wrapped granola bars. Do not let the (pack of 6) in the Amazon product title confuse you - that number refers to the number of boxes you get with this particular Amazon product listing. (If you are a fan of boxes, this is a middle of the road box, nothing exciting or creative)<br /><br />Per the box, each individual bar has 110 calories with 3g of fat (1.5g saturated, 0g trans), 0mg cholesterol, 85mg sodium, 17g carbs (4g fiber, 7g sugars), 4g protein, 10% of Thiamin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, 8% riboflavin, 4% iron and 2% calcium.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is long and has some unpronounceables which is often not a good thing.

It's one-half the calories (110) of an equivalent sized candy or health bar, only 7 grams of sugar, 4 grams of fiber, and no "junk-food" low-carb sugar products. I'd recommend one or two of these a day.

review/summary: Dark chocolate, granola -- nice combination
review/text: I love dark chocolate.  I love granola bars.  So I ought to love dark chocolate granola bars, right?<br /><br />I'll start by saying that I really do like these.  Dark chocolate layer on the bottom, chewy granola layer in the middle, with chocolate chips on the top, along with drizzled dark chocolate.  You can see that in the cover photo.<br /><br />The photo makes the bar look a lot thicker and bigger than it is, however.  I know product photos are intended to really show the food in the most appealing way possible, but when I pulled the bar out of the wrapper and stared at it next to the box, I had to wonder if there was any way they were photographing the same product.<br /><br />Regardless, I like a granola bar with a decent amount of protein (4g) and fiber (4g) that doesn't taste like cardboard.  So this is something I probably will purchase again.

review/text: I would be tempted to call these cereal bars, rather than granola bars. Kellogg's Special K Granola Bars are chewy and definitely have chocolate. Very tasty; a very good snack. I feel sorry for people with nut allergies, though. These bars contain almond flour and peanut flour, which don't do much for the overall flavor, they just reduce the population of people who can enjoy them. Would I be willing to buy these again? Yes. Would I be willing to go out of my way to find them? No. A good snack bar among other good snack bars.

review/text: I love love love, dark chocolate, and so I decided to get these bars. I will say that I havent shopped around to find a lot of bars. I tend not to eat them because it seems like most have a lot of sugar in them. These have 7 grams of sugar and are 110 calories. 25 of that is fat.<br /><br />The taste of these were good, but I wasn't blown over by a strong chocolate flavor.  Now,  this could be because I am a huge chocolate nut, so eating the little dark chocolate drizzled on the bottom and random chips here and there didn't do it for me.<br /><br />Overall, it was good. To be honest I dont think I am going to run out and buy more. Others have said these are a healthier option, and I'll take their word for it because I'm not a huge granola bar eater.  I will say this. I was hungry and they did take the edge off. But if you are dying for chocolate this won't satisfy you.

review/text: I wasn't sure I would like these because we recently tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006BXUYN8">Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter</a> and didn't love them. (Well, my kids loved the other bars. But my kids also eat dirt, so there's that.)<br /><br />I was pleased to find that I *did* like these! The dark chocolate was rich and flavorful, though I would have preferred to have more chocolate throughout the bar than just a thick layer on the bottom and a smattering of it on the top. The description on the box of "chewy" is accurate, so this isn't what you'll want if you're hoping for a crunch. (The thickness of the bar - with rolled oats second on the ingredients list and rice not too much farther down - made chewing go on and on!)<br /><br />I didn't love these, but I liked them enough wouldn't pass them up in the store if the price was right!

The bar will not make anyone say "oh my goodness this is good" but it is still pretty tasty.  Has a semi moist texture to it so you won't need liquid to wash it down like some granola bars.  Product labeling on the box is helpful and clear.

review/text: These bars are very small. Length: 3 and 3/8 inches. Width: 1 and 1/4 inches. Height: 5/8 inches.<br /><br />They taste good. Sweet, chewy, and chocolatey. There's chocolate all along the bottom, and chocolate chips embedded in the bars. I suppose this product is trying to market itself as a healthful chocolate bar alternative.<br /><br />But I'm not sure how healthful these bars are. Ingredients include Fructose and Corn Syrup. I'm not sure if those ingredients are as bad as High Fructose Corn Syrup (not listed as an ingredient), but I avoid anything with even Fructose or Corn Syrup.<br /><br />If you do a Google search, you'll see there's a debate as to whether High Fructose Corn Syrup (or even related material) is worse, or no worse, than regular cane sugar. Some say that High Fructose Corn Syrup is more likely to cause cancer, diabetes, and weight gain. Others (e.g. the corn industry) say that sugar is sugar, same chemical makeup, whether High Fructose Corn Syrup, Corn Syrup, Cane Sugar, or Organic Cane Sugar.<br /><br />I'm no scientist, but to be safe, I recommend staying away from any Fructose or Corn Syrup. You might have noticed that many products are now bragging that they have no High Fructose Corn Syrup, so consumers are becoming aware of the controversy.<br /><br />That said, this product has fiber (4 grams per bar) and oats (lowers cholesterol) so it's not as unhealthful as a chocolate bar.

The bar was sticky, chewy, and had an unpleasant feel in my mouth.<br /><br />Of course when I saw that the ingredients are sugar, dextrose, corn syrup, glycerin...sugar sugar and sugar. One bar (they are small!) has 7 grams of sugar. "Soluble corn fiber" as first ingredient? It has a lot of soy in it as well, more than I expected to see in a granola bar. It's like a bunch of gunk bound together with sugar.<br /><br />For a net carb count of 13 grams (over half that sugar), there isn't enough nutritional redemption in them for me to even consider packing them as a snack. A mere 4 grams of fiber for such a tiny bar, and it probably comes mostly from the corn? The Fiber One bars I've had, taste better for sure. I've never had a stinging and prickling sensation in my mouth from eating a GRANOLA BAR...it was disconcerting. For what it's worth, my husband liked them. But there isn't much he DOES NOT like.

review/summary: Chewy, Crunchy Granola Bars
review/text: These Special K granola bars with dark chocolate are very tasty. There is a layer of chocolate on the bottom, with granola in the middle and a sprinkling of chocolate chips on top. These bars definitely satisfied my chocolate craving. With 110 calories, 4 grams of fiber, and 4 grams of protein, it seems like a good snack, but I wouldn't classify them as "healthy." The bars are small (less than one ounce each) so I gave in and had a second one. Although I'm sure there are healthier choices for a snack, these are great for what they are.

review/summary: Nothing special about Special K bars
review/text: These bars taste similar to most granola style bars. They would be more worthwhile if they did not have hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils or undefined natural and artificial flavorings.

review/summary: The best thing about this product is the box!
review/text: The bar looks delicious & scrumptious on the box.  The specs seem okay, but that's because it's less than 1 oz. per bar.  Granola cereal in the box tastes better than this bar.  If you're familiar with KIND bars, this pales in comparison.  Both in taste & in how full one feels after eating it & especially in the ingredients.  Why do things we eat & put into our bodies have to contain so many ingredients; especially those which are hard to pronounce or even know their meanings?

review/summary: not too sweet!
review/text: I sometimes shy away from these types of granola bars because I just find them too sweet. This, though, is good! And I think that if you "aren't a dark chocolate fan" (even though I am) but also often find comparable bars too sweet, you'd like this. It's a pretty mild dark chocolate, and the dark chocolate is what takes away that crazy sugariness.<br /><br />I only wish they could find a way to make these still not many calories, but a liiiiittle bigger. It might satisfy a dessert craving, but it's not going to satisfy hunger.

review/summary: I was pleasantly surprised
review/text: These granola bars really tasted good. I don't normally eat granola bars or Special K. With not being overly sweet, the chocolate flavor was pronounced.  l love semi-sweet chocolate so these tasted great to me. They were crunchy and chewy and the cereal flavor did not dominate. Four bites was good but I wanted more. Too bad they are a small size and yet cost so much. I would love to have a stockpile.

review/summary: I've tried many kinds of granola bars . . .
review/text: . . . And I think this one is one of the best.  Lots of flavor, a little sticky and  little chewy; no very hard bits of ingredients that get stuck in teeth or feel like they could chip a tooth.  These are filling - especially with a cup of coffee - and I used a few for meal replacements when I was short of time.  I'll be buying these again.

review/summary: for people who hate granola bars - FINALLY
review/text: Kellogs has managed to do what years of oat-based bars have not. It actually tastes good. Cookie-like and chewy, very chocolate-y. These are small, fitting into a caloric count, actually a better size for a child's snack or for me. Best of all, no card-board, no crumbling, no dry mouth from eating. Delicious.

review/text: These Special K granola bars are just the thing when a healthy boost of energy is needed. They are tasty, crunchy and fill up that craving for a few hours.

You will find different varieties: milk chocolate, dark chocolate along with other flavors. Tuck one in your purse or attache case. You will be happy you did.

review/summary: My 1st Granola Bar
review/text: Who am I? A person who has never eaten a granola bar before. Raised on 50s cookery, I've learned to eat avocado, boregs, chickpeas, dahl, eggplant, felafels... you get it. So I was curious about what all the hoopla was over something that purports to be a nutritional bonanza but looks suspiciously like a big rectangular cookie.<br /><br />No, these granola bars don't taste like the oatmeal cookies of my youth (which I was hoping for.) They're quite a bit like Rice Krispie treats, which isn't a really bad thing. The dark chocolate had a nice flavor. I might top these off with a spoon full of peanut butter for a little added protein to turn them into a real meal.  A nice snack when there's no galaktakabourekos in the cupboard.

review/summary: Surprising because they are not too sweet
review/text: Kellogg's Special K Granola bars are overall a great granola bar and satisfying snack.  They are a high quality product and weather or not you like them depends on what you are looking for.  They are more on the crunchy side with a nice texture and base.  They have little chocolate chunks in them and are on the small size which seems right to me for the types of situations I would want to eat one.  The best aspect for me is that these aren't too sweet and the chocolate is dark so don't expect a sweet milk chocolatey taste.

review/summary: Delicous snack to feed the chocolate craving
review/text: We already love Special K breakfast bars (we've tried the fruity ones), but this chocolate flavor is yummy because it hits the special 'Chocolate' spot. Since I have a weakness for chocolate, I like the fact that these are still low calorie, appropriate for breakfast, and have other 'healthier' ingredients. I think one of the things that sets this flavor apart is that the dark chocolate makes the bar taste particularly rich. It's better than a chocolate candy bar and not as dry or grainy as some other hard core granola snack bars. For me, this product sits right in between those too. Between the two people in the house, the box is already empty. Highly recommended if you seek to satisfy your sweet tooth with a healthier, low calorie alternative.

review/summary: Tastes just OK but what's in it?
review/text: The new "Dark Chocolate" flavor of Kellogg's Special K granola bars tasted OK out of the box. The texture was a little grainy, but not in a whole-grain sort of way. It was like there was some sort of powdery/grainy filler in it, which I think may be the extra fiber they tout on the label.<br /><br />I took a look at the ingredients. Typically for a Kellogg's product, the ingredients list was very, very loooong. I looked at the first ingredient and stopped right there. "What's 'soluble corn fiber'?" I wondered. I Googled the term and found some interesting things. One blog posting caught my attention. I think I'm not allowed to post external links here, but you can just Google "soluble corn fiber" and find a posting called "Link Between Corn Syrup & Artificial Sweeteners." It said that "soluble corn fiber" is just another term for "corn syrup," and that the manufacturer of Splenda, who also markets soluble corn fiber, was suggesting that food packagers could use that term to avoid consumer sensitivities to the term "corn syrup," or, especially, "high fructose corn syrup." That's not to say that this is not a healthy ingredient. It's just to point out that you may wish to learn more about food-processing ingredients whose names seem new and different to you and then draw your own conclusions. There are other postings that go even more deeply into this issue relative to soluble corn fiber.<br /><br />So, the product is chewy and sweet, with a slight hint of dark chocolate flavoring. Obviously, they're going for a "dark chocolate" variety because of all the news about how healthy small amounts of dark chocolate can be for you. Maybe that's why I was a bit skeptical when I saw the first ingredient here was something new to me. The flavor is good--I just didn't love that grainy texture.<br /><br />We also have the issue of the packaging size. The box contains 5 bars, and the bars are on the small size, at that. But the box looks about the size of one that might contain 6 full-sized granola bars. Also, the individual bar wrappers are quite oversized. Once you open the wrapper, you see that the bar looks small inside it. The stats: each box contains 5 bars that are 0.95 ounces (27 grams) each. Total net weight, 4.76 ounces (135 grams). You can compare with your own boxes of granola bars.<br /><br />Back to ingredients. After the soluble corn fiber, you have rolled oats. That's good. Then isolated soy protein. (I'm tempted to Google again.) Then sugar. Then "cereal (rice, whole grain wheat, sugar, wheat bran, soluble wheat fiber, salt, malt flavoring, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, riboflavin)." Notice that all that parenthetical stuff combined comes in after sugar--not really a lot of "cereal" in this. Then fructose, semisweet chocolate, vegetable oil (hydrogenated and/or partially hydrogenated palm kernel, palm, canola and/or coconut oil), corn syrup, chicory root fiber, rice, dextrose (isn't that the same as or similar to fructose?), and...that's about two-thirds of the way down the list. There's a lot more.<br /><br />If you don't care about ingredients, it's a reasonably tasty snack that fills you up a little bit. Personally, I get filled up much more by eating a fresh, juicy apple or a handful of grapes.<br /><br />Kellogg's owns Kashi, a brand I like. I really think they can do better than this Special K-branded concoction.

review/summary: Not Granola, more like soy crispy treats way too sweet!
review/text: I think the name should be changed to Soy Crispy Bar because "Granola" is a stretch here. Surprisingly lacking in much flavor, just way too sweet, not rich chocolate tasting and far from satisfying for the 110 calorie three little airy bites. This is mostly soy crunchy bits and sugar, far from real granola with whole grains and lasting satisfaction. This is a pretty empty bar nutritionally speaking and weak on flavor to boot, I just can't personally justify putting this in my body, have an apple!

review/summary: I only got a 5-pack
review/text: I'm not sure if it was because I received my product via Vine, but I noticed that the product description is for a pack of SIX bars, but my box was a FIVE pack (it's even written on the front of the box).  It's a regular retail package and looks just like the picture on Amazon, so I'm just hoping that mine isn't indicative of what's being sold here.  Still, it could be a fluke, so I'm not knocking off any stars for that, however, caveat emptor.<br /><br />No, my three-star rating is because these bars just weren't very good granola bars.<br /><br />On the positive side, these bars are relatively low in calories (110), fat (3g), sodium (85mg) and sugar (7g), and have 4g of dietary fiber.  What I didn't care for was the taste (or lack thereof).  I understand that chewy granola bars tend to be more "airy," but this bar just isn't as dense as other granola bars, so it doesn't feel satisfying.  And, despite the dark chocolate, it had a soy/fiber taste that reminded me a bit of cardboard.  This is coming from someone who drinks regularly soy milk and needs to consume large amounts of fiber daily.  Plus, the dark chocolate taste wasn't that strong, it was just sweet, making it a sweet, chewy, oaty mass that left me feeling like having another snack, defeating the purpose of this snack bar.  I suppose the best way to describe it to someone is, and pardon me for being cliche and vague, "It's only okay."<br /><br />Also, I hope the way my box of granola bars was shipped was due to the fact that I was getting it free on Vine and this will not be how it'll be shipped to other customers.  My box was shipped in a large, padded envelope, so the box inside was completely smashed, as were most of the bars inside.  It looked like it had been sat on and folded a few times.  Horrible.  I'm usually pretty pleased with Amazon's shipping, so this was a shock and disappointment.  I realize this isn't an issue with the product itself, so I'm not deducting any stars for it, but I felt it bad enough to warrant a mention.<br /><br />I eat all sorts of granola, energy, and protein bars, and though I realize that this one is a "diet" snack, I've had others with more taste and felt more filling, but if you're the type to reach for a candy bar when your stomach growls, this could be a healthier alternative.

review/summary: Tasty and chewy, but if you're looking for something all natural, keep looking.
review/text: Special K's Dark Chocolate Granola Bars are a tasty snack that's fairly healthy, with just 110 calories per bar.  The bars are about 4" long and 1" wide.  They are chewy, but not sticky, and don't get stuck in your teeth.  One the bottom of the bars is a coating of dark chocolate, as well as some chips mixed throughout.  Even with the chocolate coating and chips, the chocolate flavor is subtle and does not overwhelm the woodsy granola flavor.  The one disadvantage to the chocolate coating is that they do not make a good companion on a hot day to carry around with you as a snack since the chocolate will melt.<br /><br />Despite the low calorie count, and Special K name, the list of ingredients is long and complex, with lots of ingredients you won't find in your local grocery store.  So, if you're looking to eat as close to natural foods as possible, this is not the granola bar for you.<br /><br />All in all...a chewy tasty granola bar that is low in calories.
