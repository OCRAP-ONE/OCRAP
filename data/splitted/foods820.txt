review/summary: No substitute for a healthy diet, but the kids love it
review/text: We all know by now that eating a balanced diet leads to a over all better quality of living.  Will this product be the end all fix for tricking your kids to get the proper amount of veggies a day.  No way, but that doesn't make it a bad product, just not a miracle in a pouch.  Each pouch is one combined serving of fruit and vegetable.  That  doesn't mean one serving of veggies and than one fruit but only one serving made up of both.  The taste isn't bad at all.  My kids inhale them as soon as I ration out their daily allowance.  I noticed the amount of sugar in these and only allow one a day.  My kids would love to drink these all day long if allowed.  They pass the kid taste test approval.  I subtracted the 5th star and only give a 4 because of the amount of sugar to volume, and that the juice is not 100% juice.  I would love to see a Super-V drink with 100% juice and not the 66% it currently has.  The Berry is the best tasting one in my opinion, but since we also buy apple, and fruit punch Super-V I notice they all go just as fast when offered to the kids.

Tasted fine, but was a bit heavy on the sauce and light on chicken and pasta.

review/summary: Like others said, different product but I wasn't surprised thx to other reviews.
review/text: The price was right and the other reviews set my expectations of getting something other than Parm so I wasn't disappointed.  The pre-packaged (by Hormel) ready-to-ship case does have a plain white label on the cardboard that says Grilled Chicken Parm, but the meals inside were grilled chicken and pasta.  So it is not the product listed nor the one pictured (which is also different than the one listed).  Tastes fine, about what I expected.  Good value.  All-in-all I'm very happy.<br />Here is what you are really going to get for those who might want to read up on it or see a correct picture:<br />[...]

review/summary: Average for the Hormel Line
review/text: First off, the product photo is for the Spicy Italian Sausage and Pasta not the Grilled Chicken Parm. Secondly, I received the Grilled Chicken and Pasta not the Grilled Chicken Parm.<br /><br />As such, this review is for the Grilled Chicken and Pasta.<br /><br />The sauce, like all of Hormel's red pasta sauces, is on the sweet side with a tang of too much acidity. I find both are easily rectified with something spicy added (I opted for some red pepper flakes for this which helped a lot but I've also tried hot sauce and sriracha chili sauce with others and they work just as well). The spaghetti is cut into short and stubby strips which makes it easy to eat but bothered me for some odd reason. As for the chicken, I found half to be extremely dry and almost unpalatable and the other half to be perfectly fine.<br /><br />All in all, the grilled chicken and pasta is one of the average meals for Hormel. There's nothing horrible about it but then again, there's nothing completely great about it as well. If you need something that doesn't need to be refrigerated, can be heated up extremely quickly, and don't mind lots and lots of sodium (900mg for this one which is on the low end for Hormel), you can't go horribly wrong with this meal. Of course, if you're expecting the taste of something homemade, you're going to hate this. But if you're well aware that this is a pre-packaged meal made for the masses, it'll fill you up with very little time and effort.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XOQZC">Nabisco Snack Wells Creme Sandwich Cookies 1.7 oz. (Pack of 12) 20.4 oz. net</a><br />I purchased these cookies in the store several times and thought they were a great alternative to other indulgences.  When I saw them on Amazon, I thought it would be a super savings.  However, these cookies must be fresh, or they are simply not worth eating.  The photo above is a very good sample of some very old and dried out cookies.  When they were received in fresh condition, they were excellent, with soft moist cake and marshmallow and a chocolate coating that was a solid, shiney dark brown.  In this photo above you can see a very dried out product with an old and  pale, discolored coating.  I ordered 3 seperate times, 1st box was "great"  other two were not even edible.  1 FOR 3 MAKES THEM A VERY POOR VALUE.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XOQZC">Nabisco Snack Wells Creme Sandwich Cookies 1.7 oz.

review/summary: Thank Goodness For These Little Tasty Snacks
review/text: I could eat a devils food cake a day. . .but then, I'd be so big I would require my own zip code.  So I'm darn glad the folks at Nabisco came up with SNACKWELL'S DEVILS FOOD COOKIES.  These are the real deal:  a little devils food cake, surrounded by a marshmellow layer, covered in chocolate.  Zero fat, zero cholesterol, only 50 calories--but this little snack sure doesn't taste like no fat/no cholesterol.  It tastes like sheer indulgence, and that's always a good thing.<br /><br />So I always keep a box around when the sweet tooth starts to take over and I'm needing some guilt-free pleasure.  SNACKWELL'S DEVILS FOOD COOKIES.  Devilishly good.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

review/summary: Loaded with sugars and contains undeclared fats; not a health food
review/text: People, learn how to read nutrition labels. Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the "Fat Free" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type "snackwell devil food nutrition facts" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that "Fat Free" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other "health-conscience" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore "helpful review" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics.

review/summary: A good deal?
review/text: I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.  I thought that was kinda "iffy", and the cookies were a bit worn (they had that patina of old chocolate), but they were edible, so, okay.  In April, the expiration date was sometime in the far future (September or October of 2011), so I figured the March shipment was a fluke.  In May, the expiration date was *again* 12 March 2011!!  They were PAST expiration.<br /><br />Of course, I'm a carb freak so that didn't stop me from eating them, but, C'MON!!  I'm almost scared to get my next shipment.

At one time FD had duplicated Nabisco's packaging, now its in a green and white box. These Devil's Food cookies cost $1.00 as oppposed to N's supermarket prices of close to $4.00 if not on sale. They are probably made in the the same factory. Plus they have a money back guarantee.

review/text: I think that these cookies are a great deal through Amazon, because the packages are the exact same size and count as the ones sold at our hospital, where we spend far too much time. I'd suggest this bulk purchase to anybody who wants to break free of the $1.25 to $1.75 per pack that a vending machine or the cafeteria will wring out of you...even a convenience store gets right around that same amount, too, so again, just about the best price I can find!!!! =)

review/text: I remember seeing these cookies and imagining how nasty they must taste. I tempted myself into trying some and was quite delighted. Granted, they are not the best cookies (that title belongs to Keebler's Soft Batch) but they are certainly an excellent substitute for those who like to eat cookies and not worry too much about weight. They're quite expensive at the stores (between $3.5-4.5 a box) so I ordered them in bulk from Amazon which bought per box cost down to $2.50.

review/summary: Not a ringer for Nabisco!
review/text: I can't speak for anyone else, but I am most definitely not a spokesperson for Nabisco!  I love these cookies.  They are super yummy,not too sweet, not too "blah."  They do not taste like a "diet" cookie.  I like these as well, probably better, than your normal, everyday "who cares about weight" cookie.<br /><br />I will say this.  I am not a fan of marshmallow.  I don't like marshmallow peeps, marshmallow in cookies, marshmallow "moon pies," any of that. I DO however, like the marshmallow in these cookies.  So that said, it means the marshmallow in the Snackwells is very different than what you find in the above-mentioned snack/sweets.  Therefore if you do like the peeps, moonpies, etc., you may or may not like the Snackwells.  However, the marshmallow is such a small part of this cookie, I don't think it will matter.  The star of this show is the fudgy chocolate.<br /><br />For the person who felt the cookies were bad, I wonder if there could have been a small hole in the packaging and they were, in fact, stale.  I don't typically have any sitting around long enough to go stale, but when I do, they do lose their positive attributes!<br /><br />I think my only "complaint" about this cookie is the fact they are so good, I end up eating too many, taking away any advantage of the fewer calories they contain.

review/summary: Best Jerky Ever
review/text: This is hands-down our family's favorite jerky.  It is very flavorful and peppery but not hot (original flavor).  If you like gooey jerky, you probably won't like this.  If you like jerky that doesn't leave your fingers greasy but is a touch on the dry side - try it.<br /><br />I also have to say that I love these small, convenient 1oz single size servings - they are easy to slip into a bag and make a great afternoon snack.

review/summary: The best stuff you can buy
review/text: This is the one food product I'm willing to buy on line because it's cheaper, can be bought in bulk, and in small one ounce packages. Plus, it is the best tasting jerky I've found, and not all stores carry this particular brand.

review/summary: Doing hard time
review/text: I really like the idea of this all natural jerky,but it's pretty difficult to get past the texture and hardness.  The flavor is OK but if you get my meaning, it's hard to get to the flavor when you feel like you're chewing on a piece of *hard* dry leather.  I got the box of 1-oz packs and it's pretty consistent among the packs.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This may be my newest addiction, it is delicious tasting jerky and I'm glad I found it on here.  It wasn't too dry, wasn't too moist...I thought it was perfect. I want jerky to be closer to tough than soft because it takes longer to chew it. There are 80 calories in a 1 oz serving, 10 of those from fat.  550mg of sodium, 3g carbohydrate/3g of sugar and 30 mg cholesterol, 14g of protein. Ingredients exactly as listed on the package are solid turkey breast meat, worcestershire sauce (water, corn syrup, vinegar, molasses, soy sauce (water, wheat, soybean, salt), salt, caramel, spices, dehydrated garlic, dehydrated onion, tumeric, flavors), soy sauce (water, wheat, soybean, salt) liquid smoke, honey, sugar, vinegar, pepper (black), garlic powder, spices.<br />No preservatives, all natural ingredients.  I will definitely buy this again.

review/summary: What Happened???
review/text: This review is actually written in Sept of 2011. The original was a glowing review but apparently I'm not allowed to review the same product twice. Really Amazon? This jerky used to be so good and now it's the weirdest ever. The packaging that used to be so easy to open is now impossible without scissors. The jerky itself is like squares of hard rubber that are nearly impossible to chew.I bought my usual boxes of original and teriaki and the flavors were almost identical. After years of being a fan (especially my husband who doesn't eat beef)I'm so disappointed in whoever is responsible for destroying a great product. To whoever designed the new packaging....you need to go back to the drawing board. How about the original? It was perfect on all counts as it was. From 5 stars to 1. Barely.

The texture is perfect, not too chewy, not too tough, and the teriaki flavoring is perfect as well, not too overpowering, but tasty and well-balanced in flavor. The only downside is I can't stop eating it!

review/summary: Astronaut Jerky?
review/text: I don't know if this is naturally how turkey jerky comes or if it's just this product, but I've never had jerky this dry in my life. It's like they freeze-dried it or something! Instead of ripping a piece off with your teeth, you shatter it. I realize turkey breast meat has lower fat and a stringier, low-connective-tissue makeup, but this stuff is just not enjoyable to eat. It's too bad, too, because the actual taste is really good--spicy, savory, a hint of sweetness. But jerky should be chewy, not crumbly-hard, and my rating reflects this. Very disappointing.

review/summary: Pretty good but mixed feelings on this jerky....
review/text: The first bag my hubby and I had was very good. It was big pieces that weren't too tough and I LOVE that this jerky is nitrate free!! The second bag we ate as a snack while driving at night so we didn't see all the peppercorns in the bottom of the bag! What we thought was little pieces of jerky was actually very hot black peppercorns and we didn't have any water to wash it down! Yikes, that was painful :o( There wasn't any in the first bag we ate so I guess we will just have to be more careful in the future since the jerky isn't really uniformly packaged.

Since I couldn't find them at Costco the past couple of times I went there, I searched online and found them on Amazon.  Funny...after I ordered them I now see them at my local grocery store chain (Ralph's)...and even on the flight I took across the country last month (United Airlines).  However, I'm still glad I ordered a big box of them because we go through them pretty fast.  :)

review/summary: OMG!!!!  Solves that craving!!
review/text: Oh, YUMMM!!<br />These are THE best chips I have tasted in years.  I am allergic to lactose, gluten, soy, mint and grapes, which has made it hard to go through these past several years craving soda crackers or something akin to them, and even trying (unsuccessfully) to come up with a workable recipe I can make for myself.  Now I have found them!  These are my newest comfort food.  Wonderful with a chilled glass of Diamond Almond Milk, and I am that little kid back in the kitchen sitting with my milk and crackers.  The texture and tender-crisp "bite-factor" (to me) is so close to that of good, old fashioned crackers - - and the flavor is just deeply satisfying.  I will be up in the middle of the night snacking on these for sure.  I cannot rave enough about them, but I see that others agree with me in the quality and "yummy-ness" quotient of these wonderful chips!  To me they taste closer to crackers than tortilla chips and that is SOOOO yummy!<br />Thank you AMZ for putting these on S&S!!!  Come next payday I will need to be getting a whole case, maybe 2!!

review/text: These chips were amazingly delicious!<br />These olive chips were thin, crispy, tatsty, yet not too salty.<br />My 2 year old son loved them. The best part of these chips is the fact that they (chips) are super healthy.<br />These chips are also small enough for your little ones to enjoy and eat easily.<br />I highly recommend these chips for any occasion, especially to place in your or your little ones' lunch box.

review/summary: Crispy, Somewhat healthy, Not too Olively tasting tortilla!
review/text: I like these tortilla chips.  You can taste the olive but only faintly-you know it is there so you search out the taste but it is is a background flavor.  However if you don't like olives don't order these!  The fat content is reasonable for a snack food and they are satifyingly crispy!

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: These were a change of pace so to speak. I thought they were very good flavored tasted good. Over all I have had lots of different brands, flavorings and such of tortilla crackers/chips but I think these were unique first the multigrain thats something new in a tortilla to me and I thought that was tasty ,then they added the olive flavoring . I loved it instant hit with me I would definitly buy these anytime i seen them in a local grocery or back on amazon someday . I think they are unique  and something as I said a different pace and taste definitly worth getting others interested in trying.

review/summary: Good. Different. Not too strong. Could maybe be stronger.
review/text: I'm a pros and cons gal. I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting. The flavor was stronger than subtle and the chips were utlra-fresh tasting. Straight up, here's the pros and cons:<br />PROS: Super fresh. Nice portion size, especially because you'll want more than one portion. Attractive on a plate, unlike traditional tortilla chips. Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy. Chips were sturdy and didn't crumble in the bag easily. No pile of "chip-lets" at the bottom. Would probably be a nice surprise in someone's lunch box or at a movie party or summer get-together.<br /><br />CONS: Probably not great for dipping. If you're an olive lover, you may prefer the flavor to be more potent, as I did. If you're concerned about packaging waste, there's a lot of extra bag here which seems wasteful.<br /><br />I personally felt the olive flavor could have been stronger, so I withheld one star, but that is my personal taste. Several people felt it was strong enough. They are definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Average Chip...
review/text: Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly "olive" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of "crunch".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty & healthier substitute for junk-food chips
review/text: Are you the type of person that always needs a side bag of chips to accompany their lunchtime sandwich but then feels pangs of guilt afterward for consuming  that extra 120-200 trans-fat laden empty calories?  If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Olive' line of tortilla chips (think of a white corn tortilla chip with flavor profiles of black and green olives and a hit of garlic) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite.  These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself.  These chips are tasty enough with the right crisp texture you've come to know and expect from your standard snack tortilla morsel.  Great product all around.

review/summary: Interesting twist on tortilla chips
review/text: Olives and tortilla chips...who ever though such a combo would be so good? No trans fats, not overly salty, nothing artifical (like the label says...) makes for something a bit different that your typical tortilla chip.<br /><br />You don't need any salsa or cheese on top of them -- the flavor is perfect (if you like the taste of green olives, that is.) You'll be asking for more as the 1 oz. bag will not be enough!

review/summary: Tasty and Wholesome
review/text: When looking for snack products, I tend to look for those with the fewest artificial ingredients or no artificial ingredients, if possible.  On this count, chips from Food Should Taste Good easily qualify.  All the ingredients are pronounceable and identifiable (quinoa, pronounced keen-wa, is a South American grain).  I have now tried three of the seven flavors, Chocolate, Sweet Potato, and Multigrain, and they all, well, taste good as the brand name implies they should.  The Multigrain chips have a wholesome nuttiness that would go well with a variety of dips (although I'm eating them plain).<br /><br />Best of all, they're kosher, gluten-free, and vegan.  How can one go wrong?

review/summary: Very good tortilla chips
review/text: The taste of these is right between Tostitos Multigrain chips and Original Sun Chips, and that's pretty nice place to be. A little sweeter corn flavor then the Tostitos, but not as much as the Sun Chips.<br /><br />They company/brand/motto of FoodShouldTasteGood lives up to its promise. Even though tastes vary greatly I think most people who like tortilla chips or even thin crackers like Wheat Thins will find these very enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing I thought was funny was that the mini bag seems to be just a scaled down version of the large bag since the picture which they claim is "Enlarged to show texture and detail" is really a bit smaller than actual size (which is about a 2" x 1.5" hexagon).

Love the very subtle hint of garlic but I just don't quite notice the taste of olives. I don't buy the same chips every time I go to stores,  but this is good enough that I will certainly pick up a bag from time to time.

review/text: These were absolutely delicious.  They came very nicely packaged, with a thick and smooth exterior plastic packaging.  I was a little disappointed that the package was mainly air- there were only about 15 chips in the 1 oz. bag.  However, each chip was delicious and wholesome.<br /><br />They were perfectly seasoned- not too salty, but just enough to bring out the flavor.  The sesame and flax seeds were very evident, and a nice addition.  The ingredients list the chips as being partially made from corn, but frankly, they tasted mainly like whole wheat.<br /><br />I ate them plain, and they were excellent.  I think eating them with salsa would be a waste!

review/summary: Tasty chips
review/text: I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.<br /><br />Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand.  The chips are little hexagons about 1" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  While the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  They're not overly salty - indeed, if I had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.<br /><br />These chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself.

review/summary: Pretty tasty chips with no weird ingredients
review/text: These multigrain chips are more like those vegetable/organic/seed crackers than a tortilla chip.  It does taste a bit like a tortilla chip, but most of the flavor comes from the seeds in it.  I don't think they're too salty and the flavor is pretty well balanced.  The thickness and crunchiness is comparable to that of a Wheat Thin.  I only had one chip broken in half in the last bag that I ate.<br /><br />The ingredients list is pretty interesting in that there aren't any long chemical names: stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.  Take a look at the gallery above for a picture of the back of the bag.<br /><br />Each bag is 140 calories and contains 7 grams of fat so they make a pretty good snack.

I like the thin texture too and at less than a buck a bag, not too pricey as products like these tend to be.

review/text: This product is a perfect size for a lunch-box or a quick snack.  I find it to be hearty and quite filling.  The whole grains are entirely satisfying and work well with most traditional accompaniments for chips.  They are a nice break from the same-old corn chips and all of my guests who have tasted this product find them to be tasty and interesting.  Many have gone on to buy and enjoy this product themselves.  Just like the olive-flavored chips, virtually all the chips are whole and unbroken, which is a nice change of pace from what one gets with most similar products.

review/summary: Tasty, goes well with most dips
review/text: These chips are a nice break from the carbon copy corn-chips that we are all used to.  They have a nice, but not overwhelming, flavor of olive that is really quite delightful and that even people who dislike olives might enjoy.  They go well with guacamole, salsa, one of my favorite spinach dips, vegetable pate and just about any other dip that one might care to eat with it.  They have a hearty taste and texture that is quite satisfying and almost all the chips are whole.  The size is right for a lunch.  Frankly, I cannot imagine anybody not finding these chips enjoyable.<br /><br />I suppose that the only caveat is that if you specifically want the same-old corn chip, then this is probably not for you.

review/text: ...but I guess a little more like a tortilla chip.  I found these tasty and satisying, not quite as salty as the grocery store type tortilla and corn chips (a plus for me).  I didn't taste anything that hinted of olives, though.  Devotees of all-natural foods might be attracted by the lack of GMO ingredients, artificial colors/flavors, preservatives, etc. - that's not a selling point for me, though.  At my age I need all the preservatives I can get!

review/summary: Great taste,all natural ingredients,"iffy" texture
review/text: I'm always in search for good, healthy, whole grain products. When I saw these chips, I jumped at the chance to try something new.<br /><br />The ingredients are superb: it has a corn base, uses non-hydrogenated canola oil, brown rice flour, Turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, flax seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, Quinoa and sea salt. They are not overly salty like most other tortilla chips, which is a nice surprise.<br /><br />They are hearty chips and hold salsa well without breaking. They have a very good taste - corn, nutty, slight hint of salt, and hearty.<br /><br />My main complaint is with the texture. They're crunchy, but have too much of a cardboard texture for my liking.<br /><br />Overall, they're deliciously healthy chips, if you can get past the texture.

review/summary: Crackertilla
review/text: CRACKERTILLA is a word I came up with because this snack is both a thin, round cracker and tortilla chip all in one.  It is light, crispy, and quite tasty. We strongly sense the company really believes that, "Food Should Taste Good."<br /><br />Although we were skeptical at first, the unique olive flavor attracted us to this product. In addition, there are NO artificial colors, flavors, or GMOs in the ingredients.<br /><br />After opening the bag, we observed an attractive sight and scent and . This product is not like average chips, it has the aroma of real-food. The taste is also unlike any other, not only because of the olive flavor, but because of the marriage between the cracker and tortilla chip. The crispness is just right, and the Olive flavor is included without dominating other ingredients. The one-ounce serving size is just right and allows one to easily travel or pack this with a lunch.<br /><br />Overall, this healthy snack is recommended for both kids and adults.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: I've tried 2 types of FoodShouldTasteGood chips - the Multigrain and these. I must say, I'm impressed with both. Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, "No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential. Whether you're willing to shell out the extra cash for a non-essential snack will depend on your tastes, your priorities and your pocketbook.

review/summary: An All Natural Winner
review/text: Though I like to try and use all natural foods, I will not sacrifice flavor just to "go natural". From the 1st mini-chip to the last in one of the 1 oz snack-sized bags, I was entirely satisfied and will definitely buy these. I started eating the chips plain and, from the 1st bite, found the multigrain flavor satisfingly strong with a just a hint of sweetness that took the edge off the grain flavor. The size and shape of the chips (more like crackers than larger tortilla chips) was good for snacking, plus the thickness provided just the right texture and "crunch" factor.<br /><br />Later I finished the chips with a pesto dip and the complementary flavors worked perfectly: the chip didn't over power the dip, but neither did it roll over and die. I am sure I would enjoy these tortilla chips with other dips.<br /><br />Finally a last observation is how well these mini-chips kept their original shape. Out of the entire (albeit small) bag, only 1-2 chips were broken.<br /><br />An all natural winner that will have a permanent spot on my households snack-food roster.

WOW.<br /><br /> A hint of Garlic, and just enough salt, to draw you back, to take another, and another etc. I did't taste the Olive taste as much as others did, but I would buy these when I see them at my Store.<br /><br />They are crispy, and would be great for a dip, or just eat them as a snack.<br />Good in a child lunch bag, then the fried high fat other chips.<br /><br />No Trans fat, no chols, no preservatives, No GMO, no fake coloring or fake Flavorings.<br /><br /> One oz. Serving:<br />140 Cal. Sat fat 0.5.. no sugar, sodium 80mg. Carbs 18g, Protien 2g<br /><br />Two thumbs up.

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: Wow, the olive flavor socked me from the first bite. GREAT flavor. A little more unusual for a tortilla chip, which is what I like about it.<br /><br />There's a nice, very subtle hint of garlic there, too, which gives it a bit of pinch. (Not punch, just pinch)<br /><br />Very fresh right out of the bag, nice small sized chip.<br /><br />The olive flavor was overpowered by any dips or salsas. It tastes best to me plain, but then again, I tend to like vanilla flavored ice cream. To each his own--I'd definitely suggest trying this with hummus.<br /><br />Ingredients: Stone ground white corn, high oleic sunflower oil, black olives, green olives, sugarcane fiber, garlic powder, sea salt.<br /><br />One serving: 1 oz., one package, 140 calories

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: These are wonderful chips that really do taste like what they say, olives! If you like a very crispy thin chip packed with wonderful olivey goodness and subtle garlic then try these they are awsome! I first tried this companies products from Costco where I purchased their multi grain chips. I was hooked from the first bite and like them even better then the olive ones but they are both excellent chips. They are not too salty either which is another reason I love them. The grainy taste is nutty and a little sweet and addictive. The little bags were not enough I was left wanting more but on the other hand the little bags are safer to have around! You will love these I promise!

review/summary: Healthy alternative
review/text: Before opening this package I read the ingrediants and daily values. There was an advantage in the lack of saturated fats which was pleasing to me. I had the Olive flavored variety. I found the chips to be tasty but a little dry and lacking the olive flavor I had expected. I THOUGHT I tasted an olive experience in the first bite but did not taste it again. By saying I thought it was dry may have been the thought that the product may have been a little old OR had the same sensation in my mouth as stale varieties I have bitten into in the past. Was pleasing enougha but I can't honestly say I would purchase again.

review/summary: Here's the chips
review/text: I tried the multigrain chips without any dip or cheese.  The flavors were minimally pleasant and reminded me of the chips on airlines flights when the choice is chips or pretzels.  I will not make a point to buy these chips if alternatives are available at similar comparable prices.<br /><br />The best chip currently available is the Lant Chips on your Amazon.com site.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQ58XO">Original LantChips, Salted, 1.5-Ounce Bag, (Pack of 28)</a>

review/text: I love these!!!  It was hard to save some for the rest of my family to try ;-)<br /><br />For nachos, I would use regular tortilla chips but for a snack, with toppings like cheese, tuna etc - these are delicious!!!!!<br /><br />I will definitely order these again :-)

review/summary: Excellent, natural chip
review/text: You won't find any MSG, hydrogenated oils, or various things that most people can't pronounce and have no idea what it actually is in these chips.  What you WILL find, however, is a very flavorful chip that has enough flavor for eating plain, but not too much flavor for dipping.<br /><br />While I couldn't really taste a true "olive" flavor, I think that the olives mixed with the garlic salt provides a very subtle flavor that is more robust than plain salted chips.  Of course, not having an overpowering flavor is a good thing...<br /><br />Texture is important with the foods I eat, and these had a nice firm crispness to them.  Other various natural tortilla chips I've tried (including "store brand" Whole Foods chips) have an off-texture (not quite crisp, not quite stale) that have prevented me from repeated buys.  Not the case with these ones.
