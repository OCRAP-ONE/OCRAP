review/summary: Best cookies I've ever had.
review/text: I was given 1 of these cookies from a friend. I savored every bite. After I finished it, I was offered another and I immediately said "YES PLEASE" and I was told I had to buy them on amazon or select states. I ordered the 4 pack. I shared some of them. Everyone that tried them liked them and many of the people are begging me to order more and want to buy them from me. Yes, the Mothers English Tea Sandwitch Cookies are THAT GOOD. If you ever wondered "Why would I ever buy cookies on the internet when there is a large selection at my local stores?" Try these and you will have you answer. If for some reason you don't like them, it won't be hard to find someone to BEG you for more. I know that if they sold these at local stores around here, they would sell a TON. I don't know why they aren't sold nationwide or worldwide at local stores. Maybe they want to keep them "rare" and "special" and not just some "mainstream cookie" and have it be sort of like an "underground special treat", I'm not sure. They are worth every cent of their price. I can't say enough about these cookies. I highly recommend these to everyone. If you have to, have a few friends/family chip in and split it, if you buy the 4 pack and don't like them, you can give the other packs away as gifts/presents. A+ 5 star, my #1 favorite cookies without question.

review/summary: Mother's Taffy Cookies
review/text: We used to enjoy these cookies when we lived in CA where they were made. We missed them terribly when we moved and even bought 8 packs to take with us. When we saw them on Amazon we jumped at the chance to set up a regular shipment to us. They are no longer made in CA but taste exactly the same. They are simply the best and arrive perfectly packed and fresh right on time. There is not another cookie that I know of that's even close!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDGYN8">Mother's Taffy Sandwich Cookies, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Great Cookies - Mother's Animal Cookies
review/text: I used these as favors for my daughter's circus birthday party.<br /><br />I agree with other reviews, the cookies do seem smaller than what I remember.  Then again, I was a kid the last time I had these, and if you look at the nutritional value, you'll be happy that you get a few more small cookies versus 2 large cookies.<br /><br />They arrived in good condition, a reasonable amount were broken which is expected, even in the store.  The seals on the back of the bags were taped to help prevent them from coming open (much appreciated).<br /><br />They tasted great and everyone from kids to adults were happy to see them as a treat.  I will order these again since I can't find big bags on store shelves.

review/summary: Mother's Chocolate Chip Cookies
review/text: My review is for Mother's Chocolate Chip cookies. I purchased them based on all the positive reviews of this brand. I had never previously tasted them, although I'd seen them many times at WalMart. I thought they would be a less expensive alternative to Famous Amos Chocolate Chip cookies since Amazon has recently increased the price on those considerably. I was very disappointed in the Mother's brand. It did not live up to the compliments expressed in other reviews. They seem to have a strong "baking soda" taste and the chocolate chips have no flavor. I will not purchase these again!

( And could not get a store to mail us some.)<br /><br />  So on to the internet we go, but alas, no "Rippin Good" cookies available, (I have always said, you can find anything on Amazon.Com),  but we did find these great "Mother's" macaroons and must say they really come close to the "Rippin Good" macaroons.<br /><br />We have not given up our quest, short of driving, 8 hrs., we have telephoned another store and this manager has given hope that they will mail us some.<br /><br />Mother's macaroons are delicious cookies, and I took some to work, and one of the ladies there, ordered a case, she loved them so well.

All she could remember was coconut flavoring with cream in the middle and they were by Mothers. As usual I did an Internet search and got an Amazon hit. I should have known to go to Amazon first. I reviewed the cookies that met the criteria and found Mothers Taffy Sandwich cookies. My sister acknowledge these were "her" cookies. I ordered them and she has not stopped enjoying their great taste. She stated they were as enjoyable as she had remembered. It's always good to find an old favorite.

review/summary: So happy that Circus Animals are back!!!
review/text: I was so distraught to see my favorite cookie company go under and remember buying a bag a couple months after from a second hand seller and thinking "This is probably the last bag I will ever eat!"  Well, I was pleasantly surprised today to have the familiar pink and purple packaging catch my attention from the corner of my eye today.  I bought a bag, wondering if they still tasted the same.  A couple of the cookies were smaller than I remember, but they taste exactly the same:  Perfect.  If you have never had them, I highly recommend you give them a try.  Of all their cookies, the Circus Animal cookies are by far the best in my opinion (which says a lot because their entire selection is absolutely delicious!)

To add insult to injury packages have BEST BY DATE of FEB0311 ...less than two months away :( The seller would have done better hosting an ice cream social using these crumbles for toppings. I'm not sure how prospective customers can be informed items are near their expiration date or the condition is sub par, but they should be given the option to purchase "less than standard product". I won't gamble ordering ANY Mother's Cookies again.<br /><br />This holiday will have more cookie crumbs than usual, ugh!<br /><br />9/2/2011 5 STARS ... Coconut Cocadas ...

The coconut flavor carries me back to my childhood in New Jersey sitting on the front steps munching away figuring which adventure us neighborhood kids would be getting into. It wasn't until years later that my Mom weaned us off Drake's Coconut Jumbles and onto these to save money. Though not as coco-nutty  as Drakes's Jumbles these were always available. Neither were as good as any cookies my Grannies made :)

Imagine my dissappointment when I discovered these "New" Taffy cookies are not the same.  They have too much coconut in the recipe.  The old Taffy cookies were darker brown in color and had a completely different flavor.  I wouldn't say these new cookies are terrible, but if you are labeling them as "TAFFY" cookies, they are definitely not a resurrection of the late greats :(

I simply put it in my water bottle with water, in the freezer it goes, and in not too long, I have cold, icy tea.<br /><br />I am not a "hot tea" drinker; perhaps because I've always lived in the South.  But I do love cold, iced tea.  I prefer my tea without sugar or any type of sweeteners, even though most people like to have sugar or some type of sweetener in their iced tea.

review/summary: Smells like apple cinnamon, tastes like cherry pie!
review/text: This ruby shaded brew has an appealing cinnamon and apple aroma. The flavor was more like tart cherry than cranberry--maybe that is due to the combination of cranberry and apple. Quite tasty--don't brew too long or it can become sour!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box: "Genius is the power of of lighting one's own fire." John Foster

review/summary: Wonderful Tea, Even Better Service
review/text: I was unable to find this tea in my local grocery store. I was delighted when I found this tea on Amazon. When I got the email stating that the order would be filled through VitaminLife, I became a little concerned. I don't particularly like buying through third party suppliers. However, the day I received my tea (which was SUPER FAST) I also received a package with my address on the outside, but the invoice showed that I was not the intended customer. I called VitaminLife to report the mix-up. The customer service person was very kind and helpful. All I had to do was put the package back on my front door, and they took care of the rest. I would absolutely buy from them again.

review/summary: A young vigorous Islay with a huge flavor profile but also a sweet and wooded side.
review/text: Jim McEwan has really shaken up the whiskey world in his decade or so at Bruichladdich. Rocks is one of his new products, along with Peat, and Waves. Peat is smokey peat monster. Waves is buttery fat and sweet. Rocks strides between and manages to be something unique and something, in my opinion, very true to the original aspect of Bruichladdich: a sweeter, fruitier, more harmonious take on briny iodiny smokey Islay malt.<br /><br />In the glass, Rocks is golden with a lovely peachy rosy glow. Rocks is aged for several months in French red wine casks which McEwan says accounts for the color. Aroma is delicate and dry with iodine, pork rind, dry oats, maritime brine, and a mineral tang. It smells like rocks on the sea shore. First sip shows a huge and unexpected (from the nose) explosion of honeyed cereal sugars with a midpalate expansion of oak vanilla, blackberry, and red fruits. The finish is long with smoky notes and anthracite char joining the honeyed cereal sugar red fruit medley with some oak resin tannins unfolding at the very end. It's a beguiling flavor profile, reminiscent of the Port Charlotte PC6-8 monsters, but less intense (and minus the peat), less proof, and far less expensive. It captures a measure of their intensity of flavor and maritime brine meets honeyed malt splendor. There's no age on Rocks' label. McEwan says its a blend of young single malts ranging from 6-9 years old. That's another way it's like the Port Charlotte offerings.<br /><br />Rocks quickly became a favorite for me and the first bottle went quickly. Shopper's Vineyard recently dropped the price and quickly got more. This is very reasonably priced for the quality. This is the everyday drinking version of the big Port Charlotte salty-sweet Islays from Bruichladdich.<br />Comment Comment | Permalink

review/summary: Good; very thin slices
review/text: I was expecting a tin of chunky pieces of fried tofu.  This contains actually a bunch of very thin slices, more like fried tofu skins.  There are a LOT in the little can, and they are rich and satisfying, so you don't need a lot per serving.  I would estimate that each slice is about 2" long by 1" wide? (haven't measured, just guessing).  The jar is crammed very full, so they are a little difficult to extract at first, but you get your money's worth.  They are seasoned in a light sauce which appears to be basically like soy with a little oil, which is pleasant and neutral enough that these can be thrown into probably any savory dish you are preparing (wouldn't add to anything sweet however; although if you rinsed them well, it might work; I haven't tried that).<br /><br />The taste is very light and they are a little chewy and overall very good.<br /><br />I am very happy to have found this product and will keep them on hand in my pantry as an easy way to add protein to quick meals.

review/summary: Not quite what I was expecting
review/text: I thought I knew what a popcorn bag was in my mind, and when they arrived, they were much different.<br /><br />They're very large- We use them at a business to hand out, and these bags are probably the equivalent of a movie theater medium. No complaint there except that they hold so much that we have to give out more popcorn than they'll consume, so it runs out fast and gets tossed.<br /><br />They're constructed cheaply- Usually the sides of popcorn bags are pleated so they can hold a good amount for being small, and they're much easier to load. These ones aren't, so they are difficult to fill up. The bottom doesn't fold out to make the bag a square either, like most popcorn bags. Instead it's sealed, so it just opens up into an oval.<br /><br />I can't complain about the product itself because it was very cheap and does its job excellently. I would like to warn anyone out there considering them, though, that if you're giving it out commercially, 4 bags will clean out the machine.

review/summary: Great Inexpensive Popcorn Bag
review/text: We used these bags at the video store for handing out popcorn and at home as well. We have a stand up popcorn machine in the TV room and a bag of popcorn is the first thing everyone wants when they enter the room. These bags are very inexpensive compared to the boxes and this is all we now use. They may be a little difficult to use inside the popper as the kettle takes up a  lot of the overhead space, never the less we seem to manage that little issue. The reason the bags are hard to fill is there is no expansion in the sides. That is good as my popcorn goes further after each popping and with the large boxes someone was always leaving 25% in the bottom of the box. Another plus over the boxes is this bag after becoming empty can be wadded up and tossed easily.

The item I received is the kind of soy sauce that they have in restaurants - the ones that don't have a screw cap but rather a small hole on each side for pouring. In other words, you can't close the bottle. I bought it for the purpose of transporting after using it, but it's not possible. Fortunately, the person I bought it for doesn't mind, but beware that it is not the actual item they show on the buying page.

review/summary: A good soy sauce
review/text: I use a lot of soy sauce in my kitchen. For one thing, I make a lot of stir fry dishes.  And a little soy sauce tops things off nicely once the vegetables and chicken (or whatever) are done and once the fried rice is ready to go.<br /><br />For another, sometimes I like to eat left over fried rice by itself.  Once again, some soy sauce added to the reheated rice is a delicious and simple snack.<br /><br />Kikkoman Soy Sauce, then, is a nice addition to one's pantry.

review/summary: How many complaints does it take?
review/text: I just sent a complaint to Amazon because, like others, I did not get the item pictured.  I got the restaurant-style container that cannot be closed.  Not only that but, for a set of 4, the restaurant-style containers are a cheaper product.  Restaurants like the lids with holes on two sides because they know the containers will be used many times during the day by many patrons.  So, there is little chance of the soy sauce spoiling before the container needs to be refilled.  Not so with people at home.  I'm the only one here and do NOT use soy sauce every day.  So, I'm probably going to have to pour it into another bottle that DOES have a lid that closes ... just to keep it fresh.<br /><br />So, 5 stars to Kikkoman for making a great soy sauce and 0 stars to Amazon for cheaping out on at-home customers with an unfair switcheroo.  Between 5 and 0 stars, the average I give this order is 3.<br /><br />P.S.  When I sent the complaint to Amazon, I specifically stated that I wasn't asking for a refund.  They responded to my complaint - saying they were giving me a refund anyway and asking if it solved my problem.  I told them, "No," because I was still stuck with 3 restaurant-style containers.  However, they did say they would investigate why this switcheroo is happening.  Hope they fix it for future orders.<br /><br />P.P.S.  Up to this point, I was merely disappointed.  But then, Amazon responded to my response.  They suggested I "try one of their other sellers."  And they asked me again if this solved my problem.  I answered yes ... but only to get them off my back.  And I took away 1 more star - making my review a 2-star review.  Buying from Amazon should be like buying from any other store.  Customers need to "trust" that the store "knows" what it is selling.  If I visited a local Safeway store and bought this item - only to find the item switched in my shopping bag when I got home - I'd be disappointed.  A refund doesn't put the product I bought in my home.  And the suggestion to try a different Safeway store would be a bit insulting.  Who knows, maybe the other store would do the same switcheroo.  Selling and buying should be a transaction, not a crap-shoot.

review/summary: Wrong bottle type
review/text: Although the quantity of soy sauce is the same, the bottle that I received was a restaurant-style table dispenser, not a bottle that can be closed. Because this will cause evaporation in my desert climate, the soy sauce must be transferred to another container. The photo should be updated to show the actual container.

review/summary: The taste I grew up with in a handy bottle.
review/text: My children love soy sauce and so do I.  It makes everything taste better.  Kikkoman is the brand I grew up with and what I now cook with.  This little bottle is handy.  It's cute, and lets out just enough sauce to flavor the rice at the table.  It's also refillable.  I usually buy the large bulk bottles of Kikkoman and use those to refill the little tabletop bottles.

review/summary: Absolutely Delicious!
review/text: Since I've been cutting back my budget and eating in instead of carryout, I've found myself craving my old favorites.  One of them being Chinese food. Fried rice and pan-fried noodles have always been comfort foods for me and I found myself longing for them.<br /><br />Following my instincts, I made my first batch of fried rice using Kikkoman's, veggies and two eggs.  The soy sauce was all I used other than a pinch of pepper and it was all that was needed.  Kikkoman's is flavorful without being overly salty. (That's a lot coming from me being as I can't stand overly salty foods or condiments.) It's no where near as salty as those soy sauce condiment packets you get at the restaurants.<br /><br />I actually found myself adding more after the dish was done to add more flavor.<br /><br />I think the sauce is a tad pricey, so if you can find it cheaper elsewhere, great.

review/summary: Mmmmm. . .Braaaains!
review/text: When I first saw the Brains Cupcake Kit, I was a little skeptical.  Cute, clever, and fun for the kids, I thought; but I assumed that the finished product would be more for show than for taste.  You proved me wrong, Jo Cupcakes!  We love these cupcakes!  The kit itself is terrific.  It has everything you need, excluding the ingredients for the homemade taste (egg, butter, powdered sugar, milk, oil).  The directions are very clear and easy to follow.<br /><br />By following the directions exactly, the cake turned out just as it should - light textured and golden.  It's a little denser than regular commercial boxed mixes; but in my opinion, the texture is more like made-from-scratch cake.  Contrary to tasting like cardboard as another reviewer commented, we really enjoyed the light vanilla taste - flavorful, but not sickly sweet.  If you make the number of cupcakes indicated, these cakes will be a little smaller than what you might make using a regular box mix.  So it's important to not overbake.  Set your bake time for the lowest recommended.  Ours didn't need any more than that.<br /><br />The frosting is also delicious.  The frosting mix makes a wonderful creamy frosting, and because you use real butter, sugar, and milk, the result is a true buttercream frosting that you simply cannot get from a can.  And the pink color is perfect! One recommendation I would make to the company would be to add an instruction somehow reminding folks not to overwork the piping bag when making the brains - by the last few cupcakes, the frosting had gotten rather warm and soft, so the frosting become more fluid and the "brains" wouldn't be as pronounced.  No biggie - though.  Five minutes in the fridge to stiffen the frosting a bit helped.<br /><br />This is the second "Jo Cupcakes" that we've tried, and I've loved them both.  I'm planning on buying some for my own use this holiday season as well as for little gifts for some of my friends who enjoy baking with their kids.

review/summary: Not one of Blair's best by any means, Sudden Death is a lot better
review/text: I will prefix this review by saying the other Blair's sauces I have had to date, Pure Death, After Death, and Sudden Death all get an all around 5/5 in my book.  They are all fantastic, and great tasting hot sauces for what they are.  Blair makes some of the best hot sauces available, and an A/B taste test of Beyond Death (original formula) and Sudden Death (the updated formula) is a testament to the fact that Blair is constantly working on improving his hot sauces.<br /><br />I was disappointed with Blair's Beyond Death however -- I guess this is the reason why Sudden Death was created in the first place, to create a hot sauce that is about the same heat level but with a much better taste.  Granted, half of the reason they still offer it is for nostalgia, and it does come in a nice bottle for collector's, with the wax seal and all.  But in short, the heat is pretty good, but the taste just isn't quite there. There is a distinct soy taste (despite soy not being an ingredient), along with a sweet taste, and the sauce is not sure what it wants to be -- the two do not really mix well, leaving a rather unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth long after the burn disappears.<br /><br />Unless you are buying the bottle for collectability, I would recommend skipping this one and picking up a bottle of Sudden Death instead, or even two bottles of After Death (which is half as hot, but you can use twice as much of it).

review/text: Unique Pretzel Facory  is one of those small (boutique ) bakers in the pretzel capital of the world -Berks/Lancaster county, Pa.  They have been around since the 1800's!  Of course this is an old Pa Dutch area and we all know how well beer (Germans ) and pretzels go together.  The Splits are a over-baked broken variety of pretzel. They are nicely salted and very crunchy. They go well with a cold beverage of choice, a nice dip or straight out of the bag. Once you try these beauties you will try to always have an emergency supply in the cupboard.  I was very happy to find these on Amazon. It saves me the 5 hour oneway drive to Reading to restock.

review/summary: Awesome bruschetta type rounds in a largish size
review/text: These are essentially like regular, somewhat thin slices of a baguette or Italian loaf, which have been dried so they are lightly toasted and crispy.  They are not as hard or thin as melba toast or bagel chips.  They have more of a "honeycomb" crispiness than a "snappy" crispiness.  The texture is really nice.  Like any dried bread, you will probably get a few little crumbs and occasional breakage, but these generally handle very nicely and neatly.  The flavor is of a fresh, neutral but not bland bread.  These make a great base for all kinds of toppings and they work with dips too.  I haven't had any problems with them turning soggy at all even with moist toppings.  These would make great large croutons for quickly preparing something like a classic French onion soup gratin.<br /><br />They come in a package which has two stacks of slices, each wrapped with corrugated paper to help protect them from breakage and keep them fresh.  You get a nice amount per package.<br /><br />While I personally haven't had a problem with breakage in this product, Amazon's deliveries are sometimes bizzarely packaged.  Considering that these are a somewhat delicate item, you might not want to order these in combination with something like canned goods, just to be safe in the delivery packing.

review/text: These are a lot like the grommet beef sticks you can get at the farmer's market or in some grocery stores.  They are a little thicker and a little saltier.  They are a good value on subscribe and save.  I like how they have a long shelf life and come in a re-sealable package.  This makes it a perfect snack to keep on hand for hikes and hunting and such.  Only 4 stars because they do seem extra salty, but they are still really good.
