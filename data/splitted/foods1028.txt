review/summary: I'd rate this lower if possible
review/text: There are 85 servings in this 3oz container. Each serving is only 1/4 teaspoon and yet each serving is a WHOPPING 240 mg. of sodium. Not only that but the 2nd ingredient is Monosodium Glutamate....I could be wrong but I believe this is a form or MSG.<br />Regardless, I am very disappointed in the taste of the product...hard to describe but think "wheat" plus salt flavors and that comes close to describing this seasoning...... in addition to not liking the taste I am really surprised by how high the sodium is..... and suspicious that it is loaded w/MSG.<br />I do not recommend this and am very sorry I bought it. Will probably just toss. One of the very few utter disappointments I've gotten on Amazon.<br />I was searching Amazon for "dried mint" when this came up. Yes, I read the other two reviews and did not see a mention of mint.... it was late at night, I was tired.... blah, blah.... just so you know there is absolutely zero mint in this seasoning and I'm wondering why it showed up in my original search.... oh well, live and learn.

review/summary: Stronger than usual
review/text: I received my first shipment of this packaging last week.  I was surprised that each packet is intended to be mixed with 20 ounces of water.  The standard On-the-Go packets mix with 16.9 oz.  So the taste is stronger, but not overwhelming.<br /><br />Also, the packet makes 2.5 servings, and at 60mg of caffeine per serving, this gives more of a kick than the 16.9 oz variety, which has 2 servings of 60 mg of caffeine.<br /><br />Just wanted people to know.  Does anyone know why this size is offered?  16.9 oz is half a liter, and in my local stores water bottles tend to be metric.  I certainly didn't see any 20 oz sizes when I looked.

review/summary: Cafe Bustelo is excellent using a K-Cup insert
review/text: I am one of those K-Cup snobs, who loves a hot cup of fresh coffee each and every time I get a cup.  Sorry, brewing 10 cups that sit in the pot for an hour til I want another cup just doesn't cut it for me.  But K-cups can get expensive (running $0.40 - $0.60 per cup depending on the type).  Well, I picked up a packaged of Cafe Bustelo, and used the individual insert K-cup, and OMG!  None of my prepacked K-cups come even close to the flavor and intensity of this coffee.  It's bold but not bitter.  A scoop is fine for making a single cup, and I am guessing I'm going to have about 40 cups per 10 oz package.  Cuts my cost down into the $0.10 range per cup!<br /><br />So if you are a K-cup user, try this brand of coffee.  You will not be disappointed.  BTW: I purchase this locally at Walmart for about $2.80 per 10oz package...

review/text: We owned a bed and breakfast for many years and the coffee we used daily was Cafe Bustelo.  The flavor was rubust and not bitter...just good coffee that 95% of our guests thoroughly enjoyed.  Recently, I ordered 8 packs from Amazon, and only 2 of the 8 arrived in their vacuum brick...the others seemed to have not been sealed well.  This had never occurred before.  The coffee in the sealed packs is the delicious flavor that is known, but the unsealed packs has given the coffee a bad flavor...who knows how long the vacuum was broken before arriving at our home.  I will purchase this coffee again...but from the Cuban Market.

It beats the heck out of the more common Folgers and Maxwell house brands, and with the low price and high quality, you can't beat Cafe Bustelo.<br />The flavor itself is strong but smooth, not as bitter as some, and the smell is sharp and rich. It reminds me of visits to Puerto Rico, where all my great aunts would play cards and drink it every evening.

However it is a very popular brand so if you shop around you may find it in the small resealable metal cans for only pennies more at your local store.

I've seen this package in several stores but never purchased it because I thought it was a cheap tasteless blend.  After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this Cafe Bustelo because it appeared most customers were pleased with the taste and the price.<br /><br />I can report that I'm very pleased with this blend and I use it in my maka pot too.  I love strong coffee, but not the acidity taste and this is strong but not bitter strong, and of course the price is great.  Also,  I don't have to grind coffee beans to get the consistency as fine as this blend.  I think I will become a Cafe Bustelo purchaser for the foreseen future!

review/summary: Great Coffee and Price
review/text: I have been purchasing this brand of coffee for approximately 2 years now. I first tried it because I make my own espresso drinks at home and was looking for a good,rich espresso coffee without the ridiculous price. My objective as always was to save money, yet get a good product at the same time. I bought this at the store that I most frequent for $3.45 for a 10oz can. I was pleased with the flavor, and the price. I have used this ever since.I have also used in it my regular coffee maker and it makes a great cup of regular java for those that don't want all the foo foo in their coffee. However lately I have noticed that at the place I shop known for " Always low prices" that they have slowly raised prices, not by much but it got me to thinking I wonder if I can find it for cheaper here on my favorite ( tonque in cheek) website. Well lo and behold, I found at a good price for 4 10oz. bricks of my favorite espresso coffee, with Prime free 2 day shipping. All told I actually saved some extra money for my favorite chocolate to add to my espresso tomorrow morning! Thanks! I will be grabbing it this way for a long time to come. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E95KLK">Cafe Bustelo Coffee Espresso, 10-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 4)</a><br />  Happy coffee everyone!

review/text: I just love this coffee. I'm a big fan of a really smooth and very dark roasted coffee. For reference some of my other favorite coffees are made by Unique Roasters in New York. This coffee tastes a lot more expensive than it is. It doesn't taste truly as rich as an Espresso, but, I just have a regular drip coffee maker. Perhaps, that's why, but if you love a good dark roasted coffee with no bitter tastes than you will love this coffee.<br /><br />Usually, I buy this coffee brick and the cans at my local Wal-Mart, so I cannot comment on the unsealed bricks that the other reviewers have mentioned.

review/text: I have only used this in my Bialetti stovetop espresso maker so far, but I'm sure it would be fine in any machine.  My next experiment will be using it in my old Senseo machine in the refillable eco-pods, which are great by the way.  I picked this up for a road trip, because I wanted some pre-ground espresso coffee, and didn't want to lug around my burr grinder for the whole beans I normally buy.  I think I might be hooked on this for a while!  Here's a protip - if you have a TJ Maxx or Big Lots nearby, they have great deals on coffee beans.  I picked up bags at half the price found anywhere else, including online stores. If you're a rich coffee snob, and can afford the good stuff at $50/lb, then great for you, but for the rest of us, this coffee is nothing to sneer at.

review/text: I will preface this by saying I am a coffee snob. I would not dare, adulterate a cup of java with diary or sugar. Sacrilege!  In any case, Bustelo is a good solid coffee and for the price it is a good bargain. As someone else posted- It is infinitely better than Folgers and Maxwell tripe. On a scale of one to ten, I would rate it a five. Average. But again, for the price, it is hard to beat. For reference, I would rate most of the Starbucks brews in the 6-8 range. Pure Kona and Jamaican Blue Mountain start getting into the 9-10 category.

Now I have a hearty robust and very<br />rich tasting coffee that to me tastes the way coffee used to taste 20 years ago.<br /><br />Pilon is another good product, but Bustelo is less expensive and honestly I dont<br />know how to tell the difference. Dont be afraid to try this with your everyday<br />coffee, it blends very well.

review/summary: Love my cafe con leche
review/text: Born in NYC I was weened on cafe con leche. Mom always used Bustelo.  Moved to Miami where un cafe Cubano became a daily tradition.  Moved to Olathe KS 13 yrs ago and freaked out  when I couldn't find any of my favorite Latin products.  It's better now but the prices are outrageous.  Yesterday I saw  my bustelo going for $6.35 at my local supermarket.  Through Amazon I can get 4 packs of Bustelo for less then $11.  What a bargain!  I have ordered enough to last through 2011.  (I keep my stash in the deep freezer!).  The shipment always arrives as scheduled.  Cafe is 1st rate.  Last month  the Smucker's company purchased Bustelo.  I pray they don't try to mess with the formula.

review/summary: Best espresso for quick home use
review/text: I grew up on this coffee, and find it to be a way better deal than the new espressos. I can't be bothered grinding beans. This coffee stays fresh as I put the bag in the Bustelo sealed can right after opening it, and keep it in the fridge. Richer that more expensive brands, hint-of-chocolate-flavor in the way it's roasted. No other coffee tastes this rich, and it's the best deal, price-wise. Bless Amazon for carrying this brand, as where I now live, it's not available without a long, expensive trip to get it.

review/text: Tried it in my friends espresso machine and it tasted horrid. I have a drip coffee machine and again it tasted bad but I put it in my bodum french press and rapture. It doesn't taste as an espresso should but it's a nice dark roast. I personally like STRONG coffee with only a little bit of sugar and this was perfection for my ideal coffee. I bought it at a place that gets items that have been damaged and one of the sealed pouches had opened so  I bought the other three at $1.75. I hope they get it again but if not I now have it on my wishlist on amazon.

I love Amazon.com for its free shipping for orders over 25.00. And I love Cafe Bustelo. We bought a couple of cans of the expresso and now we just empty the contents of the brick into the tins. We were happy to find that the stuff in the bricks is just as good as the stuff in tins. Love buying in bulk, too, because we don't run out for a while.

Still no coffee smell.. vague  fruit smell like that I have smelled in some tobacco's.. Over riding crap smell sends to have dissipated.. Noticed another reviewer mentioned a 'green' quality.. ie picked too early.. I would concur.<br /><br />I had purchased to mix with my premium blend for economy.. dumb dumb dumb lol decided to prepare as per my normal, unmixed. Whole milk to the boil, frappe, auto drip 6 teaspoons espresso grounds to 24 ounces of water. milk frappe in cup, ghost dust with cinnamin, med-light sprinkling of dark brown sugar on foam filled cup, pour 2-3 ounces if expresso straight down the middle.. As I do with premium blend.. Smellless, wow, after cooled to drinkable it's actually drinkable.. Though my stomach tells me the acid content after 3 sips is way to high.. And no coffee aroma our premium taste.. A slight green fruitiness..but not really a coffee taste.. definitely a do not buy brand. Too bad. It sucks

review/text: I rarely review anything with limited time...unless it's either really great or perfectly horrid. Bustelo out of the can is without exception, the very worst coffee I've ever had in my life. I sensed the flavor of dirt off a factory floor with a mild flavor of old dirty cigarettes. This was with filtered water (so no water issues). Maybe I got a bad can, but man, this was rough and acrid stuff. Your mileage may vary...

review/text: I have a small collection of finishing salts that I use for different things. This one is my favorite for things like salad and desserts. It's gorgeous with large crystal shapes that are very thin, some are just flakes, but other pieces are like shallow hollow pyramids. The flavor is mild and they have a nice snap which adds a textural interest to chocolates and candies.<br /><br />For more robust flavors, I prefer stronger flavored salts like smoked or Peruvian pink salts.

review/summary: my hubby loved them
review/text: Love their tortilla chips, so thought I'd try these.  The reviews for the yellow corn shells were mixed- one liked them, the other seemed like they just got a bad case.  I couldn't find them in my local grocery stores to try just 1 box to see if I liked them before buying a whole case of them.  But, no worries...  They arrived in perfect condition and were delicious!  Much thinner and crunchier when heated than your standard Ortega or Old El Paso fare.  They became very crispy with just a subtle, clean corn flavor when heated (I only heated for 4-5 min at 350).  My hubby doesn't like the "musty" flavor (his description, not mine) that regular store brands have; even if it's way before the "sell by" date, he thinks they taste and smell stale.  These shells don't have that problem, plus I like the fact that they're organic.  I will definitely be buying them again!

They're really poorly packaged (just thin shrink wrap around the box; open the box and there's nothing but a tray and the rings) and they don't taste good at all.  The chocolate is flaking off of the rings, which look crystallized.  I wanted these for Hanukkah but they look and taste like they've been sitting around since last Passover.  Skip these and get Joyva.

The rings weren't all ring shaped. The taste was blah. I looked on the box to see where they were made and got really concerned. THey said "Made For Manhattan Chocolate and Nuts, Inc. Bayonne, NJ 07002". Considering how many foods get recalled, shouldn't it say where they are ACTUALLY made? Got at Costco and I'm taking them back. Worth trying once so you can really appreciate Joyva, lol. My son loves Jelly Rings and wouldn't take more than one bite. Lesson learned. Two thumbs down.

I thought it may have been a flock when I bought the first box of these, so I gave them a second chance. BIG MISTAKE. The second box was just as nasty as the first. I asked the grocery manager why they carried these and he told me that the Kosher section wasn't handled by the regular grocery distributor, and that this is all they could get.<br /><br />I know by the Joyva rings online and just have to deal with their hipping costs.

review/summary: Steak Rub is Excellent
review/text: I have used Bilardo Bros. "Steak Rub" for years. It is by far THE BEST boxed spice rub out there. A word of caution. It is a "pepper" product which carries with it a bit of heat to the palate.<br /><br />That said, if you like Whiskey Peppercorn Steak this is the rub for you! Simply fry your rubbed steak in some olive oil on high heat and sear both sides appropriately. Set aside. Whisk in 1/2 tsp. fresh cracked peppercorns, heavy cream, whiskey of your choice, and maybe a pat of some real butter. Whisk over medium high heat until all is combined, then pour over your resting steaks for a scrumptious, firey delight.<br /><br />Bilardo Brothers spice rubs are convienient, tasty, and an excellent choice for the part-time gourmet chef with a steak fettish. Ummmmm!!!

YS Farms raw honey is a very good raw honey, very good tasting and I have consumed many jars of the YS Farm raw honey but this is not an organic raw honey, it is conventional regardless how good it tastes. It is good enough that I just ordered few jars of this from Vitamin Shoppe since they were selling it for $5.91 a jar. I consume the organic one as well. The labeling on the jar is specified as Y.S. ECO BEE FARMS. There is no misrepresentation by the YS, it is by the sellers including Amazon where they specify as organic just to boost their sells but then after busted they close that chapter or correct the disclaimer. Apparently Monsanto recently contributed $4.2 million to defeat the ballot measure scheduled for California voters on November 6, 2012, proposition 37, along with DuPont, Bayer, BASF, Syngenta, and other biotech companies that have each contributed over a million dollars each in their attempt to keep us the consumer in the dark about GMOs in our food. YS Farms sells 100% organic honey with certification and USDA stamp for more money. Consumers like LIZABETH have chosen to make misleading comments. For LIZABETH to discredit USDA, organic certification process, as well as YS Farms when YS Farms sells the organic honey, and then define a non organic honey as "some of the best organic raw honey out there" is appalling. Hopefully consumers will get the chance to read the facts and educate themselves accordingly and organic farmers will keep producing organic produce for individuals who actually want organic instead of conventional, regardless of LIZABETH's misleading comments and explanations.<br /><br />Some of the best organic raw honey out there!, April 22, 2012<br />By Lizabeth (BARTLESVILLE, OK, United States)<br />Our very favorite raw honey comes from All About Bees in Ralston, NE but this honey is a very, very close second. I resorted to bringing in honey from afar when I no longer had access to our favorite. I wanted to buy honey locally and everybody says theirs is "raw" but it isn't unless it is cloudy and a bit gritty like this one is (those are good qualities, I promise!). My kids quickly came to enjoy this texture and taste as their favorite. The clear stuff is too cloyingly sweet. Anyway, I will be using this as the honey for my family and the 3 pound size here on Amazon with Prime is a great deal when they can keep it in stock!<br /><br />Sep 4, 2012 6:09:55 PM PDT Lizabeth says:<br />I appreciate you notifying me of your concerns. However, until they can put a leash on bees, I don't trust ANY organic labeling for honey! My review is based on reputation, taste, and comparison to my favorite raw honey in addition to many, many years of raw honey consumption. Organically certified honey from Canada from purportedly pesticide free regions tastes exactly the same to me - I have purchased them both and based my recommendation on my personal opinion and rated it accordingly.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT SOME OF THE BEST RAW HONEY OUT THERE SINCE IT IS A CONVENTIONAL HONEY NOT AN ORGANIC HONEY, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BEST CONVENTIONAL RAW HONEY OUT THERE. SHAME ON CONSUMERS AND SELLERS WHO MISREPRESENT AND MISGUIDE PUBLIC FOR THEIR OWN SELFISH AND FINANCIAL GAIN.<br /><br />I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa in my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best low calorie energy I can get to boost my immune system and give me healthy energy when I am middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutrition when heated but any further heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollens in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon. This is a superfood to me only when it is from quality producers, in a raw stage, and not mixing it with hot drinks in moderation. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin. Bravo.

review/text: This is excellent honey!  And at a remarkably good price.  Be aware that you don't just pour it out of the jar unless you nuke it.  I like that it's very firm because it spreads much better and doesn't run where you don't want it to.  This brand doesn't have the comb or the propolis in it, as some aficionados want.  But who cares what they want?  It makes a very good throat soother too, if you get to hacking & coughing.  Honey bees are a dieing breed, so get a bunch of honey for your honey now!

review/summary: An all natural fruit snack that tastes great and has the crispy consistency of a chip!
review/text: This is a great tasting snack that's good for you!<br /><br />Crunchy N Yummy mango has the crispy consistency of a chip.  This snack is wholesome and all natural - just 100% sun ripened and freeze dried mangoes.  The mangoes are certified USDA organic - even the water that is removed from the fruit is returned to the farms!<br /><br />These snacks contain no sulfur dioxide (E220), a food preservative commonly used in dried fruit.  Some individuals may be sensitive to sulfur dioxide especially in large amounts, so it's great that Crunchy N Yummy products contain no preservatives and no artificial whatchamacallits! :))<br /><br />The freeze dried mangoes are great in salads, cereal or as a topping in yogurts or ice cream.  I don't worry about re-sealing the pack to keep the mangoes crunchy - at only 100 calories per 1 ounce serving, I can eat the entire pack!  :))<br /><br />SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGES<br /><br />The only negative comment I can make is the high price for these single serving snack packs.  I do hope Amazon would offer these Crunchy N Yummy snacks at cheaper prices soon!<br /><br />4 STARS for the high price - 5 STARS for a great tasting crunchy dried fruit snack!<br /><br />RECOMMENDED: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B3K8ZY">Crunchy N Yummy Organic Freeze Dried Fruit Papaya</a> is great for snacking on the go.  At only  55 calories per pack - you can even start another pack without guilt tripping! :))

review/summary: Like eating glass
review/text: I'm not sure where all the other reviews came from, but this freeze dried mango is terrible. First off the package is very small and you don't get as much as you would think. There are only a few pieces of mango that actually resemble a freeze dried mango, the rest of the mango pieces inside are small hard pieces that feel like your chewing on glass and get heavily stuck in your teeth and have almost no flavor, and not to mention lots of sugar. The product is inexpensive enough that you can purchase it on your own and see for yourself, which is what I did.  The only reason I didn't give the product just one star is because I just looooove my mangos. haha Enjoy. (PS Trader Joe's mangos are the best, but not sure if they're available onlinen, guess I'll go check.)

review/text: I bought this balsamic vinegar to try it, since I have previously bought the Gold version from the same company (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000INOVMC">La Piana Gold Quality Aged Balsamic Vinegar PGI</a>) and loved it.  This one does not come anywhere near the quality of the Gold.  It is closer to the pricier balsamics from Trader Joe's (which are around $5 instead of $20) than to a nice balsamic.  The Silver is fairly sour, the sweetness barely comes through.  As for viscosity, it's very thin - if you're looking for the more syrupy kind of balsamic, this is not it.<br />Given the small increase in price, it is completely worth it to go ahead and buy the Gold and not waste your time and money trying the Silver.

We do not want syrupy, sugary vinegars, and this is definitely not in that category.  This has a nice balance in flavor, not too sweet, not too tart.  It mixes beautifully with olive oil for salad dressings, or can be used by itself very nicely, and the price is not overly high for the frequent use we give it - several times a week.  I am back here to buy another bottle as it's hard to find locally.  Very tasty.

review/summary: Good quality cat food
review/text: I have been trying a variety of grain-free foods on my two cats.  They seem much healthier when they're not eating corn cereal.<br /><br />I had never seen Felidae in a local store, so I decided to roll the dice and give it a try.<br /><br />My only concern was an ingredient known as "menhaden" meal, which I had never heard of before.  With some additional research, I learned that menhaden is actually nothing scarier than a type of fish.  Satisfied that the food was edible, I put it in the cat food dish.<br /><br />My cats like to rotate through all types of food for interest and so far have had no problems on Felidae.  They don't seem to prefer it more or less than any other food.<br /><br />I gave it four stars mainly because the smell of Felidae is quite a bit stronger than some other foods.  While this is good for kitties, it can be a chore to fill the bowl for people who don't really care for a fish market smell in the kitchen!

review/summary: 7 cats are rating 7 paws up
review/text: I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in p�t&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.

review/summary: Delicious -- but also try the Donut House
review/text: These are absolutely delicious and of course work great with the K-Cup.<br /><br />I also have to recommend the absolutely decadent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030Z8SLK">Donut House Cinammon Roll K-Cup, 24 count (pack of 2)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032DA70K">Donut House Chcolate Glazed Donut Coffee 48 K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> which are probably the closest thing to heaven on earth, or at least heaven in a K-cup.<br /><br />mornings are a whole lot more pleasant these days.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: We have the Kuerig Coffee Maker that uses these pods.  The best thing about this coffee maker and the pods is that you can make a single cup in a minute!  No coffee sitting for hours.  A fresh cup each time.  Of course, the pods are of no use without the coffee maker. Buy both from Amazon.  You can't beat a really fresh cup of coffee!

review/summary: Best tasting coffee at a great price
review/text: This is a great deal and the best tasting coffee I have found for the Keurig. I used to like the Caribou, but the taste has changed.  Thanks :) This is my second order.
