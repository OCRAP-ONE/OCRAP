review/summary: Best tasting peppermint tea!
review/text: First introduced to this delicious tea when served @ a gourmet breakfast place in Blowing Rock, NC.<br /><br />Took a bag home w/ me so I could look for it online.  Pleased to find it on Amazon for a steal & w/ free shipping!<br /><br />I've been drinking Peppermint tea for years & this one has the very best flavor I've experienced.  I usually enjoy my tea sweetened w/ a little honey but took some to my skinny sis who lives without honey & was suprised @ how delicious this was even without any sweetener:)<br /><br />The first time I ordered this I ordered it packaged in (6), 20 count boxes which was great b/c when running out to someone's house for dinner or a visit I could grab a box to give as a modest hostess gift.<br /><br />This time ordered the box of 100 b/c of the significant value!<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this as much as I do.

review/summary: My favorite tea
review/text: I haven't purchased this item from Amazon, but I came here to find it since I haven't been able to get it locally recently. I started drinking tea because of the health benefits, but I didn't really care for it. Then I found Stash's Green Chai, which I started to really enjoy. Then I found the White Chai, which is even better, and apparently has even more antioxidants and health benefits than the green. A cup every morning starts my workday off right. I am excited to find this good deal on the large package.

review/text: I had expected this tea to have a stronger fragrance and flavor however, it is more like a hint of cinnamon and a hint of vanilla.  The subtle flavor makes it a tea I can drink more frequently than I actually was expecting.<br /><br />As with all Stash teas the individual bags are easy to transport and the tea stays fresh.<br /><br />On the whole, it is a great product, even if it's not what I expected.

review/summary: Best tea, great way to reduce packaging waste!
review/text: My husband loves green tea and will only drink Stash. I got really annoyed by all the packaging, so I was extremely happy when I saw this 100-count box.<br /><br />That's ALL you get: one small box filled with 100 individually wrapped tea bags. The box doesn't come in a box, how awesome is that?! Also, no more fighting with the plastic wrap and filling your recycling bin with hundreds of flimsy little Stash boxes.<br /><br />The tea itself is delicious. Very earthy, clean and slightly grassy. It reminds me of the green tea you get in real Japanese restaurants, but a bit less grassy (which I like).<br /><br />Decaf is perfect if you want hot tea during the evening.

I can not do caffeine much so it is really nice to find tea that tastes good and is decaf. It is a nice chai taste not too strong. Great with honey and a bit of milk or half and half.

review/text: I am absolutely thrilled with this tea.  I love Autumn and the scent and flavor of this tea reminds me so much of everything I love about Autumn.  The spices are perfect to give an excellent aroma and flavor...In my opinion, this is the perfect beverage to have as you curl up with a good book on a cool afternoon, or to enjoy as a delicious dinnertime tea.  I like to drink it with raw, unprocesed cane sugar.  I feel the cane sugar gives this tea even more the taste of a special chilly-weather treat.  I plan to drink this tea as my after dinner drink each evening, and will definitely be purchasing it again and again.  Kudos to you, Stash...and kudos to Amazon for having such a great price.

True to other reviews that they were all just kind of stuffed in the box in an unorganized way, but that doesn't effect the tea at all.  Would buy more in the future, if I need to make more favors.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This tea is one of my favorites.  It has a clean, subtle, delicious flavor very similar to the Stash White Decaf Lemon, but unlike the lemon it's lemongrass free, which can be important for people with grass allergies.<br /><br />Three warnings for this tea:<br /><br />1.  If you like strong tea, you're in the wrong place.  This is a subtle white.  I find it delicious, but many of my friends want a stronger flavor.  I think this is comparable to flavored water in the intensity of the flavor, though it would be unfair to compare this to the fake chemical flavor of a propel water bottle!<br /><br />2.  It's a white tea.  It steeps FAST.  If you'd like more flavor, choose another tea or put in 2-3 teabags.  This tea will not always forgive a long steep and can become very bitter if left too long.<br /><br />3.  It's not a very good iced tea.  It tastes like it would be lovely, but the flavor oil leaves a film on the top that I find unappetizing.<br /><br />Enjoy your tea!

review/summary: Great tea, just a touch too light
review/text: I purchased this because I wanted a decaf white tea that had some flavor to it.  I normally don't enjoy fruit flavored teas.  This one is a great flavor, but I have noticed it needs to steep longer to get enough flavor out of it.  The raspberry is a little too subtle.<br /><br />The outer package is the pictured cardboard box, but the tea bags are individually wrapped in air tight packets (the small white packet shown with the box) which are pretty enough for display or gift baskets. If you aren't sure about buying 100 at a time, look for a sample package on Amazon or elsewhere (though the Amazon prices are impressive compared to other ones I've seen).<br /><br />If you are interested in a full-flavor tea, I highly recommend Stash's White Christmas Tea.

review/summary: Incredible Chocolate tea!  Hershey's anyone?
review/text: I tell everyone I know to buy this tea.  It's the ONLY chocolate tea I've found that actually tastes like chocolate!  It's not overwhelming and although I'm not normally a fan of hazelnut, it really only serves to act as a flavor enhancer to the chocolate.  It's just awesome, hands down, not weak either, although it is decaf.  The price here is a bit high - you can get this in the store that begins and ends with a t here in the States for about two dollars and a quarter for the 18 bag size.  Great, incredible stuff, I'm almost out again!  Highly, highly recommend!

review/text: I originally bought a small box of this at the grocery store to see if it could replace my nightly cup (sometimes 3) of hot chocolate during our cold Maine falls and winters! I LOVED it! I guess if you like your tea with a splash of milk or cream it'll taste even more like mint hot chocolate but I only drink tea plain but that's what friends of mine have done when they come over.  This box is also an AMAZING price considering the local stores (that IF they carry this flavor, which 99% don't,) sell it for at least $3.50 a box. Great deal for a great tea! On ward to health and warmth! ;)

review/text: This blend of Earl Grey from Stash Tea is delicious. It is the most fragrant Earl Grey we have ever enjoyed. The blend has a floral quality to it; not overpoweringly sweet but quite distinctive. Not herbal.<br /><br />The taste is similarly floral with no harsh black tea flavor. It must be low in caffeine as I experience no "spikes", either.<br /><br />A very distinctive blend for which Stash should be pleased.

Only the tea bacgs themselves seem to be dirty with an orange colour, so probably there are some colorants in this tea. As the box is so big it is a pain to finish them... I would recommend not to buy it. A good orange spicy tea is the one from Harney & Sons.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I've come to trust the Stash brand, among only a few others due to its consistently excellent product line and variety.  I was initially a fan of English Breakfast tea, but was introduced to Irish Breakfast tea some time back.  A slightly thicker liquor produced than does English Breakfast, it mixes well with a variety of items (sugar and milk are recommended, but certain alcoholic bases or mixers sit quite nicely if you want to switch up the classic Hot Toddy concept or use Kahlua instead of sugar), and has an even stronger aroma and flavor than your regular black tea.<br /><br />If you're a fan of weaker brews where one or two dunks is good enough, this is not for you.  I tend to steep this for a long while (tea experts would call me nuts for doing this as it could scald and alter the flavor of the leaves), but I love the strength of the brew afterwards.  This is great to have on-the-go, too, and hearty to drink if you're ill and require a lot of liquids.

I expected the tea bags to be arranged in rows in a box, but STASH appears to have dumped and squashed 100 tea bags into too small of a box. The individual packs are crumpled, folded and mangled. If you prefer more pristine tea bags, order the multi-pack box.

One bag is enough or me I can put it in a cup of hot water and leave the bag in without worrying if it was to get too strong like other teas do.  Adding just a little raw honey enhances the flavor also.<br />I enjoy this tea before I go to bed and it has a very soothing and the warmth of the liquid allows me to slip into a nice sleep.<br /><br />I like the convenience of a foil package, I can carry one or two with me when I go out to lunch with friends, I just order a cup of hot water and slip this tea into it.<br />I have on occasion I have put this is a cup with some fresh ginger and it makes a totally different tea, and he ginger helps sooth the tummy while the Chamomile tends to relax you.<br />Doesn't get much better than this.

review/summary: Love the mango taste
review/text: This green tea is absolutely tasty. I have been looking for a good tea that has the true Mango flavour and have not found one before I tried Stash Mangosteen. I love this tea, I have a cup every day. It is also great with some real ginger in it with honey :). Yumm!

review/summary: short shipped
review/text: I was disappointed to find my tea bags hastily packed in a 6X6x6 shipping box, and only 93 of 100 tea bags. Also this batch of tea almost without any Jasmin taste. In the past my Stash green jasmin tea was better.

review/summary: the most drinkable green tea
review/text: I make  iced green tea because I find drinking water bearable rather than enjoyable. And green tea is healthier than other non-water beverages, but I don't love green tea, either. So I've tried various flavored green teas, and the fruit-flavored ones usually result in a sort of sicky-sweet fruitiness mixed with the dirt flavor of green tea. This one, however, is the most tolerably-flavored green tea I've found so far, almost enjoyable, even.

review/summary: I absolutely love this tea!
review/text: STASH brand teas are typically very expensive to buy here in the city. I'm so grateful to find a box of 100! Packaging is very no frills - a box with 100 tea bags, but they are individually sealed to stay fresh so it doesn't matter. Small box is conveni8ent to store at home, and 100 bags makes it a nice perk for the office.<br /><br />This tea is great with or without milk. It reminds of chai tea from an Indian restaurant. Very flavorful and full of cinnamon goodness with a hint of heat.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: Stash Peach Tea is the best peach tea that we've found. For some reason it is always hard to find in OKC, it sells out as soon as it appears on the local store shelves. We found the 100 count box on line and ordered it. The price was higher per bag than the 20 count boxes that we buy at the local stores, but the convenience of finding it was worth the additional money spent.

review/summary: Delicious sleepy time tea!
review/text: This tea has a great smooth flavor.  It has a subtle spearmint taste to it which i find to be relaxing after a long day.  My only complaint is that the tea did not come in a 100 count box, it was loose single serving packets thrown into the box that it was shipped in.  Not that big of a deal, but would have been a little nicer if it was in a 100 count box like in the picture.

review/text: I don't sweeten the oolong tea I drink in Chinese restaurants, but this Stash tea with fruit flavors is enhanced with some sweetening.  It will even stand up to some milk if you wish to have it the British way.  Stash blends good teas!

review/summary: A deliciously potent peppermint tea!
review/text: This stuff is great.  The peppermint smell when you open up the teabags is incredibly strong -- much moreso than with a number of other peppermint tea brands that I've tried before.  Let me tell you, I am a mint addict, and this stuff really hits the spot.  For hot tea, I use one bag for every 8-12 oz. of hot water.  For iced tea, I use 2 bags for every quart, and it's great every time!  So, for 100 bags, I will probably get about 15-20 pitchers of tea (just depending on how much I make each time).  One thing that I wish the product description had let me know -- they literally send you a cardboard box with 100 loose (though individually wrapped) teabags inside.  The whole thing is a  little disorderly and presented a bit of a storage problem for us since the box is fairly large and the bags are not organized at all inside.  However, the tea is just so good that this one inconvenience is not enough to take the rating below 5 stars.

review/summary: Stash Tea at it's best
review/text: I'm a fan of all kinds of teas so it's easy to give them a thumbs up.  The single pouches are what I use to take with me to work or camping which cuts down on space AND lets me share with others easier.  Great product at home or on the go for sure.  They do have strings, staples and paper tags which is why I only gave it a 4 star.  Eliminate those wasteful parts and they're a five star for sure.

review/summary: Great, subtle tasting jasmine green tea
review/text: Taste is very personal, but I do enjoy this jasmine green tea. I've found the taste to be more subtle than some other brands I've tried, but it is still very pleasant. If you like a stronger tea, this might not be for you. The jasmine has a wonderful aroma and is not overpowering at all.

review/summary: Best decaf green tea. DELIGHTFUL FLAVOR & CONVENIENT
review/text: Stash tea continues to serve up the best tea products in bags.  This is especially true for their green tea.  It is pleasant, slightly "grain" flavored, lacks bitterness while having a delicate tea flavor and feel in the mouth. It is equally robust when used for iced tea.  I also like the 100 count box of loose envelopes without the cello zip strip bags of 25.  They are very fresh in their individual foil lined bags, convenient easy to open and use.  Overall a good value.  Will continue to buy this delightful tea

review/summary: Not Earl Grey
review/text: I did not receive the tea in its original packaging and there is no way this is "double bergamot" since it doesn't taste like Earl Grey at all. As a tea it is very good one though. The batch I received had no flavor or the nice smell of Earl Grey even though it says on the packaging it is. Upset with this purchase.

review/text: I've tried the other teas but when I open the package of this tea the freshness comes out. The tea has a great peppermint flavor. If you're trying to diet then mix it with ginger root tea and it has a great flavor by themselves without adding the calories of sweeteners. It won't taste sweet but it will taste good. Drink it practically everyday.

review/text: The stash black tea has a nice flavor, definitely better than lipton. I still prefer Tazo over it because Tazo has a little bit more of a bold flavor and does a better job of waking me up in the morning. Still, it's a nice tea and cheaper than Tazo so if you're mainly looking for nice flavor and not an early morning jump start this is a nice one to try.
