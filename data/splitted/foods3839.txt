review/summary: dissappointed with Amazon
review/text: The tortuga rum cakes are the most delicious cakes I've had, but was disgusted with what amazon delivered. I don't know if it was old stock, but the cakes had been robbed of their moistness. Cannot express my disappointment and shame, since they were gifts to my friends. Amazon should be careful when it comes to food to ensure its fresh.

review/summary: READ THE INGREDIENTS!
review/text: I think anyone who reads the ingredients on this stuff and continues to buy them is not paying attention. Try smoking, testing for voltage with your tongue, or jogging along a congested highway (carbon monoxide & physical dangers); maybe some more partially hydrogenated oils - trans-fats, Aspartame (diet pop), processed cake mixes, or statin drugs. Those will do it just as fast if you are trying to self distruct. It's all friends of the fda approved and tastes ok, so....yo ho ho, eat up me hearties!<br /><br />Or, pay attention.<br /><br />Updated 8-10-12.<br /><br />Looks like some dislike reality.

review/summary: Super good dog food!
review/text: I got some of this (5#) on a sample deal, and our 5 dogs, (all sizes) really pricked up their ears and gobbled it up. It's no grain, and no potato. It's a little pricey, and I wish it were Prime eligible. Our crew eats about 55# a month. it's little pieces, which is great for the little guys, but the big ones just vaccumed it down! I may get some to mix in with their regular food!

review/summary: more fiber
review/text: It took a couple of days for my dogs to convince themselves that this was ok to eat, but then that happens anytime you change food.  I purchased the product due to its high fiber content to try and relieve the dragging of the butt on carpet syndrome.  It is too early to tell if successful but it is apparent that their BMs appear to be easier, quicker, and a lighter color and I'm still mixing the Nutrisca w/ their old food 50/50.  I believe this will be a great product for my dogs' digestive health.<br /><br />So, to amend my previous review, yes it does have more fiber but my dogs refuse to eat it so I guess I have to rate it lower than my original review.

review/text: I brought some of this back from France with me.  Generally I am a mustard person and have tried many different ones over the years.  While I am sure there are plenty in this world I have yet to try, I have had more than most and among the many different varieties I have tried, this one is the very best.  It is better than any Dijon mustard I have ever purchased in the states by far.  After having it in France I just had to find a source for it in the US because it is really something special in the Dijon mustard category.

review/text: Judging from the excitement in my dogs, I am sure that love the stuff. But again, they are very easily pleased with any food as long as it is not the dog food. There are five five different varieties in the bag, four of them with primary ingredient of chicken breast (one is actually whole piece of chicken breast jerky)and the other is made from primarily pork skin. When I bought it, I paid equivalence to $1/lb, which is really good deal. But your mileage may vary.

review/text: My husband and I really enjoy this product.  We purchase it from a German Baptist bulk foods store in town and have tried the Black Currant and the Blueberry.  I was rather skeptical when my husband brought the bottle over to me to see what I thought but figured we'd try it for the price.  We're not sorry as it is very quality flavor, easy to mix and great for the price as you dilute it 1 party syrup to 7 parts water.  (I actually use more water because we don't want it very sweet.)<br />I would highly recommend this product!

review/text: These are my favorite candies of all time! I love the spicy, chewy flavor. It's so hard to find delicious Ginger foods and candies (except online) and I'm so happy that Amazon started carrying these products by the Ginger people. I usually purchase the little tiny bags at a specialty store and it is $5.99 for a really small bag of candies.<br /><br />I melt these in a cup of boiling water for a really delicious late-night tea. These are great for nausea, too.<br /><br />Great for travel sickness, great for morning sickness, and just great taste when you want a really spicy candy. I love them! The pilots use them.<br /><br />Recommended!

review/summary: Deliscious and cures nausea
review/text: My wife has received these as a gift and I loved the "sweet heat" from these candies.  I came down with a stomach bug and the nausea was debilitating...I thought "hey ginger is supposed to help with that"...but didn't expect anything since my mom had been feeding me the ginerale story since I was little and the soda never did anything for me.  Sure enough...I AM NOT KIDDING...every single swallow from the melting candy in  my mouth resulted in a decrease in nausea.  On top of that the taste is fantastic so you get a little treat while you're sick as a dog.  We keep a box on hand for any nausea emergencies all the time.

review/summary: Soothing help when needed.....
review/text: My son has GERD and the medication for GERD is very expensive and is also known to put one at risk of liver issues.  The Ginger People Original Ginger Chews help him to control stomach acid so that it doesn't burn his throat and create ulcers.  Ginger chews keep him out of misery and help to control his GERD.  It's nice to have a natural way to address the issue and misery of GERD.  It doesn't always keep him from having to take a round of medication, but if he keeps the chews with him and eats 2 or 3 chews at the first sign of distress, then he has a better chance of not having to take the medication.  Highly recommend for anyone with stomach acid issues or for travelers who get upset stomachs in different forms of transportation.  I buy this in large quantity so it is always available.

I had to stop because ever time I open my mouth I would find a reason to pop a chew. Finally one of my caps came out and I had to cut back for a while . Then I started up again until all of the chews were gone.  This is  where I am right now .  I will get my cap replaced first.  Then I will reorder the chews or some other type that are not as delicious , or at least I hope is not as delicious as the original. Then  I will decide how to go about eating these.  I takes self control, which I have .  Maybe I will just order them and give them away. NOT!

review/summary: One of my favorite Haribo candies
review/text: I was at the grocery store the other day and saw these and figured I'd try a bag. Based on the art, I was expecting a hard candy that had some sort of fizzy interior, but these are actually a lot softer than they appear. Each bag has cola, strawberry, raspberry, lemon, and orange flavors (every bag I've purchased tends to favor the cola flavors). I can't really think of any candy to draw a comparison to. I can't say I'd spend $3 on a bag of these, but if you've got a respectable sweet tooth and enjoy German candy, these are delicious (the green are my favorite!)

I have made Indian rice from scratch and must say that Badshah Masala makes my rice taste as though I spent hours preparing it, and also cuts out most of the prep time.

Note that is is an instant tea; it consists of granules which dissolve immediately, not leaves of tea or herbs that require steeping.  Purists may not like the instant aspect.

review/text: This is a great price. I use to buy a 140 count box at Whole Foods for $10. This 1000 count box with last us at least a full year and save us almost $18 ($52 for the 1000 box vs seven 140 count boxes for $70). I like Truvia. I use to like Equal years ago, but it gave me a headache and I found out its a neurotoxin. Then I was using Splenda for a few years, which I really like, my favorite sweeneter actually, but was hearing things about it not being that good for you being that its chlorinated and all. I had tried several stevia products in the past and always threw them out because they were awful. I do find that Truvia has a bit of an aftertaste when sweetening tea. I did try it with whipping cream, using the amount of packets that would be equivalent to the amount of sugar I would use, and the whipping cream was pretty awful, I ended up adding quite a bit of powdered sugar to make it edible. I pretty much use Truvia for 3 purposes only: to sweeten my greek yogurt with berries as I still need a little bit of sweetness in my yogurt; my other low-carb dessert - just taking 2-3 oz cream cheese, a few berries, and one packet of Truvia. and my occasional black tea or ginger tea.

review/text: On the plus side, Truvia for me is a very good tasting low-calorie sugar substitute.  Does it taste exactly like sugar? No.  But for me it tastes better than Sweet & Low, Equal, and even Splenda.<br /><br />The problem I have with Truvia -- and hence just the three stars -- is that it is not just a sweetener made with from a stevia extract.  The other major sweetening ingredient contained in Truvia is erythritol, a sugar alcohol.  Unlike stevia that has a history of 30+ years of safe use (with no major bad side effects) in Japan, there's nothing much known about the safety and long-term effects of taking large and repeated doses of erythritol.  Erythritol has simply not been tested a whole lot.<br /><br />So one is rolling the dice with Truvia, hoping that there's no long-term negative consequences of ingesting so much erythritol on a daily basis (if one is using Truvia regularly for their morning coffee or tea).<br /><br />If one is drawn to using a stevia-based low calorie sweetener for the known safety record of stevia (as demonstrated in Japan), then it would be wise to use a stevia sweetener that does NOT contain erythritol.  Unfortunately, Truvia does.<br /><br />On the other hand, if one is only concerned about the taste of the low calorie sweetener, then Truvia is a fine choice in that regard.

review/summary: Great all Natural Sweetener - Buy in bulk and save money!
review/text: If you are buying Truvia in bulk, I assume that you have already tried the product, so these is not much to say about that :-)  What I will say is that buying in bulk is definitely a money saver.  I tried the small 9.8 oz jars, I ended up using more and for the price, the packets save you more money if you figure out the cost p/oz.  I've been buying in bulk for well over a year without any issues with the product and will continue to do so.

Using truvia in my coffee and oatmeal, I dropped 10 lbs in 3 months, no other changes to my diet, no excercise, etc. Have been using truvia for the last year & will never go back to sugar. Also, no more sugar highs or lows! Best price on bulk box (1000) only  at Amazon!

When I see this product offered in the store in smaller sizes at expensive prices, I just smile and keep on walking!  Thanks amazon.com! I decided to see if the shipper really sent me 1,0000 packets (who would be crazy enough to count them, right?) and I'm happy to report all 1000 are accounted for! I highly recommend Truvia in 1000 count packages!

review/summary: Tastes Great!
review/text: I don't generally care too much for the healthy alternatives, especially when it comes to coffee. However, after trying Truvia at a hotel, I am now hooked. I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.<br /><br />This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! - However, definitely try out a sample before purchasing such a large box!

I do like Truvia, though -- it's a good and safe alternative to calorie-laden sugar.

review/summary: Truvia
review/text: I need Truvia because of my diabetes. I bought the 1,000 package because it slightly reduces the cost/packet of Truvia.<br />The problem with the shipment is/was that someone just threw the packets of Truvia into the box they were sent in. There is no way for me to check whether the count is/was accurate; and the largish box presents a storage problem too. This hassle is the reason for the 3 rating.<br /><br />Otherwise, Truvia is Truvia - a "natural" synthetic sweetener with a metallic aftertaste, which diabetics like me simply have to learn to tolerate. Sugar is definitely better.

review/text: This was my 1st attempt to get off artificial sweeteners. I liked it! It takes as much as sweet n'low for each cup of coffee/tea(3 packs)..I should say it takes a little getting used to, it is less sweet that sweet n low(since natural sweet is less sweet anyhow) but you get used to it quite fast! and there's no aftertaste or anything like it. If you looking for something natural & with zero calories then you should give it a taste.

review/text: My cats like Fancy Feast no doubt and I got a good price on this product.  However, the down side... the cats are not crazy about this flavor and one of them throws up from it and they do not throw up from any other foods.  I put it side by side with the Fancy Feast poultry and they gobble that up with no getting sick.  For whatever reason the Filet Mignon flavor is just not a hit with them and it is also from my perspective in comparison to other selections it doesn't smell good either.<br /><br />I am only giving two stars over one because I do tend to like the Fancy Feast name and so do my cats.  Another cat might like this flavor just fine but my crew does not.

review/text: First...I am not a doctor, so take my review with a grain of salt.  However I read in several posts on the internet that pumpkin seeds could help shrink the prostrate gland in men over 40.  I noticed in recent years, I'm 42 now, that when I needed to empty my bladder it took longer before urine would start flowing and it took longer to empty my bladder.  I've been eating a handful of pumpkin seeds everyday for 6 weeks and I have noticed an improvement where the urine starts faster and flows faster like it did when I was younger.  Plus these seeds taste great and make a nice snack.  It took about 3 to 4 weeks before I noticed a difference in urine flow.

review/summary: We Cant Stop Eating Them
review/text: Just got our first shippment of the 15 packs and we couldn't be more pleased.  These little seeds have excellent flavor. They are crunchy and are very, very lightly "sea" salted. They are fresh tasting. My packages show a Nov 30th, 2012 expiration date. Have not come across a "non seed" particulate or stale or off tasting seed yet. Packages are easy to tear open are are resealable....but the problem is, once you start snacking on them you cant stop so resealing a package hasn't happened yet. I was set up for a once every 3 month delivery......but after 2 days, we've gone through 2 packages.  I've since changed it to delivery once a month.<br /> Total Carbs, 5g, Total Fiber 5g, total sodium 100mg per 1/4 c up serving......so if you're on a low or no carb diet this snack is for you as the fiber cancels out the carbs. It's healthy, no preservatives, no chemicals. Only ingredients are organic shelled pumpkin seeds and Portuguese Sea Salt.Would be a tasty addition to salads rather than sunflower seads.<br /><br />One word of caution.... be careful eating around your computer keyboard....they're small and flat, and easliy fall into the spaces between the keys!

review/text: These are delicious. Perfect if you want to add a little sprinkle in your Greek Yogurt or oatmeal. Or if you like to make homemade granola bars, these will be perfect. They are big and plump with a slight crunch and a nutty flavor. Not overly salty and with no added oils. They are dry roasted. I recommend these, but with all nuts, portion control is needed.

review/text: I was so glad to see the Amazon offered pumpkin seeds that were organic.  They have such a good flavor.  Very little salt taste but the pumpkin seed flavor comes through.  This is a great way to get added protein and other needed nutrients in your diet without a lot of sodium.  What a great bargain with the subscribe and save offer.  Nicely packaged in resealable bags.  Just be careful not to over due it because they taste so good.  These are not low in fat.

review/summary: HEALTHY AND GREAT TASTE!!
review/text: I finally found a great protein source that is very healthy, organic, gluten-free, cholesterol free, sugar free, preservatives free,an excellent source of fiber and unsaturated fats that include omega 3,6 and 9 essential fatty acids that include an excellent amt of fiber. A quarter of a cup has 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber. Besides all that, they taste great!!! They're dry roasted w/alittle sea salt added. The 4oz packages are so convenient. Being pre-diabetic and have stomach/bowel problems, I'm always looking for good protein sources. These are so much better than alot of the protein bars out there that have other ingredients you dont' want or could do without. I really love this brand of pumpkin seeds. They also have another one that has some spicy flavor to them which Amazon also sells. My husband likes having these at the office for a quick protein pick me up.

review/summary: Tasty, much less salt!
review/text: I love the David's pumpkin seeds in the shell, but they are so salty that if I eat more than a few, I feel awful. I also used to love a granola that came with pumpkin seeds as part of the mix, but the manufacturer recently started adding lots of "evaporated cane juice" to it. Having lost 28 pounds in the last year by exercising, reducing my carb intake and eating more whole grains, I was very disappointed!<br /><br />I ordered these in the hope of adding them to muesli or eating them as a snack. They are excellent. Lightly salty, nutty in flavor. Yes, they are high in calorie, but you don't need to eat so many to be satisfied.

review/text: Although these look a little odd (off color and various sizes), they are outstanding.  People who wouldn't touch a pumpkin seed will rave about these.  The only drawback, other than looking a little odd, is that they are not raw.  On the other hand, raw pumpkin seeds are definitely an acquired taste.  You can mix these with the raw seeds to make them a lot more palatable.  These are good for the prostate, you know!  The small bag size keeps them fresh.  These are also known as pepitas (but roasted).

They have a very nice texture and for the calories, OMEGAS, fiber, protein, and low sodium they are a fantastic snack food when you are on the go!

review/text: If you are looking for pumpkin seeds that are roasted and only lightly misted with Atlantic sea salt these might make you happy. They are not my favorite because they sell some really good pumpkin seeds at my local health food store. However my husband loves these and eats them as snacks. A serving size is about 1/4 cup but I usually eat less than that. So one serving is about 200 calories.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Considering the candy is rock solid, I can't imagine them being busted up from the postal service anyways.

review/summary: taste of the wild grain free high prairie dry dog food for puppy
review/text: I can tell you from experience this is the best puppy food on the market so far. It gives my puppy a very shiny coat. I was told by my vet if a puppy has a shiny coat, good skin, crystal clear eyes, he is a healthy puppy. When I took "Q" to his vet appointment, the vet asked me what food was he own and I told him Taste of the Wild High Prairie dog food for puppy. He said keep him on what you are feeding him, he is a very healthy puppy. Now if my vet approves this food what other proof do you need. My friend had her puppy on a different brand. He was always sluggish, seemed to poop more. This puppy food does the job for my puppy and I will use nothing else. Now my friend is convinced to do the same.

After some research online we tried this product and am happy to report that not only does she love the food, but the gas issue has been resolved and her stool firmed up. Unpleasant conversation - but more unpleasant experience that TOTW helped us resolve so I thought it worthwhile to share for any of those who might have the same issues. Very happy with the food.

But that all changed when we found Organix and that's the only brand Autumn will eat.  Now he can't wait until I feed him every morning.

review/summary: Great food, but consider the costs.
review/text: I have an old, soppy Saint Bernard who's missing a bunch of her teeth.  And don't start nagging me about doggy dental care!  I adopted her from a rescue organization & the damage had already been done when we got her.  Anyway, we started supplementing her dry kibble with this canned food; and although she really likes it & the consistency is great for her toothlessness, the price increases EVERY TIME we order have left me seeking other options.<br /><br />After weighing out all the costs, it's actually cheaper to buy ground beef in bulk & boil it up for her, and mix it up with some brown rice and/or eggs.  I don't know if this diet is "healthier" for her, but she isn't gaining any extra weight & her coat looks fantastic.  And I have peace of mind in knowing ~exactly~ what she's eating.  She's almost 10 & probably doesn't have a whole lot of time left with us, and she seems to prefer the hamburger/brown rice/egg concoction to the canned food.  And my budget likes having a couple of extra dollars a week, too.<br /><br />I really do think it's a great food.  Just make sure you do your own cost calculations to find the best value for your already-stretched dollar.

I only feed them premium dog foods like Organix and Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers' Soul.  They contain real meat products and no fillers.  Organix takes this a step further with organic food in the ingredients.  The price is a bit higher, but it's worth it to have healthy pets!  My last dog died of cancer, and after a lot of research, I believe that high-quality pet food ingredients without fillers are the best plan for healthier pets!

I'm reticent to feed the food<br />from the dented cans, so end up throwing them away.  Any<br />savings I gained ordering from Amazon were lost in<br />the cans I had to dispose of.  Other than that, my dog<br />loves this food and does very well on it.  I may just<br />have to resort to sourcing it locally.
