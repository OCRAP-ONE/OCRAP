review/text: I am a repeat customer for this product.  I have three dogs and they all go crazy for this treat.  They know by the sound of the bag rattling what they are going to eat.  The smell of chicken from these treats is unbelievable!  This is a real winner.  I'll definitely keep ordering this product.

review/summary: made my dog sick...
review/text: The treats were very hard. My dog still seemed to enjoy them so I continued to feed them to her little bits at a time. However, my dog's poop started getting very mushy and today started throwing up. The only big change were these treats, so I don't think they are right for my dog. Maybe you will have better luck.

review/summary: Inconsistent moisture content
review/text: We've been giving this treat to our little Yorkie for over two years and she absolutely loves them. However this is the second time we've had to arrange for a replacement shipment because the manufacturer isn't able to provide consistent quality. When ideal, the treats are moist and chewy, like jerky, but the treats in this last shipment were as hard as bricks...essentially devoid of any moisture. Our little dog knows what to do with them but it breaks our hearts watching her try to eat them.<br />I talked with the manufacturer the first time there was a problem. They were very apologetic and explained they were correcting the issue. Guess their old nemesis has returned. Amazon is also very nice about it and is replacing the most recent shipment at no additional charge. We'll have to see whether our dog can enjoy the replacement.

review/summary: Should Be Zero Stars
review/text: This product is made in China. Although it is distributed by a company in the US, it states "Made In China." I see that nowhere listed on the ad to buy it and thinking I was doing my dog a favor, I did him harm; he has been ill for two days, after eating two of these "treats" when I received them two days ago. Because the label touts health and wholeness does not mean it is made by people with health in mind. It is made in China. The same nation which put melamine in food; melamine reads as protein in analysis of the food so it was a cheap and shameless method to advertise more protein while it caused misery and tears and death to countless. And this is an item Amazon does not accept as a return so purchase at your own (dog's) risk.

I advise you to contact your vet if you do not believe me.  This company states right on their website that they get their treats from china, because they do not want to cause more waste.  I am sorry your company is called DOGSWELL!!!! If you cared about dogs well being then STOP getting your chicken from China and get it from somewhere safe in the US.<br /><br />They are only getting one star because it is needed to post a review.

review/text: I just purchased a bag of this Vitality Chicken Breast dog jerky product from a large national retailer today (I liked the natural, wholesome ingredients), and was VERY concerned and upset when I read that is is made in China. Given the many unecessary and unethical pet deaths that occured fairly recently due to melamine and other toxic ingredients in Chinese made pet products, my concern is quite legitimate and justifiable. You just don't know if you can trust any pet products from China anymore. And here I thought that I finally found a good, heatlhy, wholesome pet treat for my dog. I had to throw out the bag. Bummer.

review/text: Although these are the same calorie count as a regular MilkBone, they can be broken up into 4 individual treats.  My large dogs find the invidual snaps incredibly tasty.  At first my dog tated it, spit it out, then tasted it and spit it out again.  But soon thereafter she would quickly run to her "biscuit spot" and happily munch away.  I like the fact that they have added ingredients to help with joint issues.  Although the individual snaps are small in size, they are crunchy enough that the dog thinks it is getting a full size bone, I don't know how Canidae does it.<br /><br />I just ordered a 4lb box.

They are five inches long as I expected, because that's the size I wanted and ordered, but can't be any bigger around than even a pencil and that's a BIG stretch!! WOW, I'm sure disappointed considering the cost ~~ $7 and shipping. Won't be ordering these again.<br />  Of course my dog likes them ok, but wouldn't call them her fav by any means. :(  Will I send them back? Don't know if it's worth the hassle at this point. But I will NOT recommend them either. Because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from!  Keep looking is my advice. :)<br />  The other Beefeaters' products I ordered well met my standards. This one was a DUD!!  What's the old saying?  Buyer beware?

review/text: I was hoping these bones would be a little harder for my dogs to comsume.  I bought them  for Christmas and thought the dogs could knaw on them for an hour or so while we were opening presents, but the bones are quite brittle and only took them about 10 minutes to consume.  Also, the shards are quite sharp and I got a little worried.  They were insanely messy for in the house.  I think for the money I would rather buy either those hard, filled bones or the rolled up raw hides.  They last longer, are less messy, and don't have sharp pieces for the dogs to swallow.

review/text: We were a little surprised that it didn't actually come in an Orville Redenbacher's box but was just the individually wrapped bags inside a shipping box.<br /><br />That's really our only complaint though and obviously didn't effect the quality of the popcorn itself.  My wife and I went through a period there where we were eating a bag of popcorn pretty much every night and we went through most of this pretty quickly. Will probably be ordering again soon.  We had been eating some cheaper(i.e. less quality but we hadn't bought it in bulk so it was actually a bit more expensive) popcorn before and this was a nice step up.<br /><br />The only thing better is making it ourselves on the stove when we feel like the extra effort...

review/summary: The Best for Chicken
review/text: This seasoning is great.  Really adds flavor.  We have used it on fish also.  The pack of 2 is convenient as we always have one on hand.  The Chicken Grilling Seasoning is hard to find in our local store, they are always run out!  Having it available online is very convenient.

review/summary: BEST GRANOLA EVER
review/text: So I was a little skeptical of a product that I'd never heard of & that came from Alabama (no offense Alabamians), but WOW was I wrong.  This granola is like no other.  Comes in two large blocks (which I think helps to keep it tasting fresh), but is easily broken up & can be sprinkled over yogurt, eaten as cereal or is great as a pick me up type snack. It's crunchy, tastes SO fresh & is chock FULL of flavor!  You can definitely taste the honey, just the right amount.  The cranberries are absolutely the best I've ever had.  They are so juicy & succulent because they're sweetened with apple juice!!!  Ingenious. And the almonds are plentiful too.  They really don't skim you on this granola. I don't usually rave over products, but this one deserves it.  I definitely recommend it for people maintaining or looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It's got lots of fiber & protein...really, it's got everything you need to get through the day.  I could go on & on, but I'll just say if you've read about this product & it sounds like something you might enjoy...you'd be crazy not to give it a try.  QUALITY!!!

review/summary: You are going to like this stuff
review/text: If you want a good snack, try this granola.  It is not to sweet (like most snack bar types) and since it comes in sheets in a pouch it can be eaten like a snack bar by breaking off the portion you want.  Also, you can crumble it easy enough for toppings or cooking.  It is truly the best I have found for the money!  I store the extra bags in the freezer to keep them fresh until needed.  I love to snap off a portion for a quick breakfast to carry out the door.  It says it is made using quality natural goodies.  I have found it in some stores but the best price I have found is on Amazon.  As you may know, you get your stuff from Amazon fast and in one piece.  By the way, thanks Amazon for that.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003I5AM84">Big Sky Granola Honey Almond Granola, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: I got these in both apple and banana. They are high in fiber so they are particularly filling. They are also tasty. A bit dry but I put sugar free jam on top for an extra 10 calories.  With a cup of green tea I found I can get through my worst times of sugar cravings with the bar and tea. I also like the natural ingredients. Worth the price? Yes because I have ended up not spending any on binges.

review/summary: Not a lot of taste, but great for your health!  and less expensive!
review/text: Please note that each box has 5 bars in it, not six or 7.  And each bar is 1.6 ounces. I am VERT happy with these.  There is only one criticism... The taste is dry and bland.  However I eat many things not because they taste good, but because they are healthy.  The nutrition listing does not break down the fiber content by soluble and insoluble fiber, however I see that they do contain psyllium which includesa lot of soluable fiber, which is good.  You need both soluble and insoluble fiber in your diet.  There is only one other fiber bar or cereal bar that I know of that has 12 grams of fiber... Gnu food bars.  Gnu bars are tastier, but are also much more expensive... over $1.45 each bar.  THESE are a little over half that price.  I will try these for awhile to see how they work out compared to Gnu Foods bars.  Should be the same.  I know I like Gnu Foods.  Please note, ONLY 5 BARS IN EACH BOX, not 6 or seven unless Amazon made a special arrangement with the manufacture.. Even the picture above of the box says 5 bars.

review/summary: Works great! just follow the directions!
review/text: I first found this product a little over a year ago, I live in NY and on the shady side so weeds and moss have a field day (especially in the sandy loam we have).  I bought this to deal with an over abundance of Broad leaf Plantains, Violets, oxalis and clover and was extremely surprised by how well it worked.<br /><br />I followed the instructions as closely as possible.  Made the mistake once of over applying once (saturated the grass and soil) and was amazed that it did not completely kill my grass although it didn't make it happy.  Since then i always just lightly apply the product and just get the leaves damp and have had great success, it does almost exactly what it says.  it might not do it's job completely in 24 hours but it definitely starts.  First plants to show product is working is normally the clover, then the violets and oxalis and finally the plantains.  I haven't had a dandelion issue since i started using it, and they use to be thick down by the street (edge of lawn).<br /><br />I highly recommend a second application if there are still some weeds after 3-4 weeks.  and remember the product has to dry on the leaves of the plant to have the best results.  the violets and plantains are super tough weeds, while the oxalis and clover just have sheer numbers.  I recently applied this product in mid may and just last week (jun 27th), as long as temps will be below 90 for a day or so it should be safe to put on.<br /><br />I do wish that you could turn off the chemicals and just run water through the sprayer to make disconnecting the hose from the container easier, tho i'm sure you could just put a quick disconnect on it to fix that.<br /><br />A+ Product from Scotts here, i'm not a huge Scotts fan but this one works.  I've recommended it to many friends.

review/summary: Works on wild violets
review/text: Ortho sells a number of Weed B Gon products, and it took me some searching to find exactly the one I wanted. I wanted one of the versions containing the chemical triclopyr, which is what my state agricultural university extension service recommends for killing wild violets, which for several years had been stubbornly resisting all my organic methods to keep them from taking over my lawn. Since I only had a fairly small area to spray and didn't want to invest in major league spraying equipment if I didn't have to, this version was just what I needed. It's very easy to use. You just attach it to the end of your garden hose, turn on the water (not full blast, just enough to make a nice controllable spray) and spray it on your broadleaf weeds. They absorb the triclopyr through their leaves, it messes them up bad and they die.<br /><br />There was enough in the bottle for me to spray the wild violets that hadn't died after the first application (as the directions and my extension service mentioned, you usually can't get them all the first try.) Actually, I spent twice as much money on the respirator I bought to wear when I was doing my spraying. I strongly recommend you read the directions carefully and follow the safety instructions. You don't want to inhale this stuff or get it in your eyeballs or mouth or on your skin. Triclopyr is SUPPOSED to break down fairly quickly and not leave residual traces--we'll see about that.

review/summary: Kills St. Augustine grass
review/text: This product kills weeds quite well. It also will kill your St. Augustine (non Floratam) grass under some conditions that Ortho-Scotts will not admit to and does not disclose on its directions. We sprayed the pre-mixed product 1 time late in the afternoon w/out any direct sun on our East side lawn. Now you can see the line of demarcation where I sprayed and did not. Ortho-Scotts has various excuses and explanation that reminds one of the dead Parrot skit of Monty Python. For those who have not seen it, a customer tries to return a Parrot to a pet shop he purchased 1 hour before because the bird is dead. The shop keeper insists "no he is only sleeping". " "But his feet are nailed to the pedestal!". The point is in both cases the seller will not own up to the deficiency of the product and tries to BS the customer. Here Ortho-Scotts finally offered a refund when the product has caused hundreds of dollars in damage.Do not believe it is safe to use on St. Augustine grasses ! Can I give a minus rating ?

review/summary: Didn't work for tough weeds
review/text: Bought a house where the yard has been neglect for 6-10yrs. The weeds dominate the back yard and it's not your typical dandilion. These are the tough ones with the thicker stems. Trying to save money and hard labor I bought two of these, more then required for the area I was testing them on and soaked it down. Took quite a bit of time but I thought for sure it would work. Unfortunately not a change. I can't give a review for people dealing with regular weeds they get in their lawn but if you barely have a lawn because of weeds then this will not work for you. Sorry to say that.

review/text: Love this stuff. Would probably rate 3.5 stars but I'm tough on products. New to the south last year and used this for the first time. Worked great. Have used three times now and kills weeds for many many weeks. Learned that for optimum efficacy to use early in morning, preferably when rain has happened but grass is dry/drying (and when plant cell stomas are open) and to let your lawn 'grow out' some first. Works best when weeds prevalent. I thought most of our yard was weeds because of mix of native grasses....nope, this killed the weeds and gave the grass more room/nutrients to grow. Just sprayed again today after early morning rain and little wind. Now it can bake in the sun and fry those weeds further. If only they made something as good for fire ants!

A little bit of moisture would have gone a long way, and I'm experimenting with rehydrating them by putting a piece of lettuce in the bag overnight (in the fridge).  The results have been inconclusive as to whether this helps, with two of us having a split decision.  The teriyaki flavor is perfect...not too salty as I expected, and the taste, if rated separately gets 5 stars.

review/summary: Excellent Protein
review/text: This protein has an excellent amino acid complex. I prefer Milk and Egg over why proteins as they are absorb into your body more efficiently. Whey protein is absorbed quickly, and if you are only working out once or twice a day, then a lot of the protein isn't going to get absorbed effectively. Milk and Egg based proteins take longer, so you get a constant flow of protein rather than having your body trying to absorb it a couple times a day. I take about 2 scoops of this protein, 2-4 times a day, and, working out every other day, I've been putting on about 5lbs every other week.

review/summary: NOT CHOLESTEROL FREE
review/text: I bought this because the amazon page says that it is "cholesterol free." It isn't...it actually has more than most (I think around 40% of your daily intake in one serving). Plus it tasts REALLY bad (I've been mixing it with Muscle Milk to cover the taste because I'm too cheap to just throw it away), it's extremely grainy (kinda coats your throat going down making it super gaggy) and sometimes all the protein in it dumps out and coagulates into a nasty ball inside the shake ball in my shaker-cup if I don't drink it fast enough...I've eaten some pretty horrible stuff (mostly on dares) and I can't handle a Universal only protein shake...too nasty. I'm sticking souly to Muscle Milk and Optimum Nutrition brand protein powders...lower cholesterol (Muscle Milk is only 5% per serving) and MUCH better taste.

review/text: I have grown up with this product - over 57 years.  While many manufacturers have cheapened their products over the years, Solo has maintained the same quality and consistency over nearly 6 decades.  The filling is clearly dominated by the poppy seeds themselves - the filler and binder is kept to the minimum necessary to make the product work.  Flavor is excellent and consistent.  I highly recommend Solo Poppy Seed filling.  In our family it supports THE classic family pastry: babovka.

review/text: WITH SHIPPING, (AND HANDLING!), THE COST OF THIS ARROWHEAD DISTILLED WATER COMES TO $14.005 PER GALLON!  This price is even hard for luxury-loving me to swallow!  Especially as there is a way to make distilled water, (even without a water-distiller!) for just about no cost at all!<br /><br />Please note that I am NOT here singling out Arrowhead Distilled water as being over-priced.  It just happened to come up first on the list of ready-made distilled water, here at Amazon.  I'm sure that it, (and all the other ready-made distilled waters being sold), is tasty and healthy, (and convenient!) distilled water.  However, it is WOEFULLY OVER-PRICED.  My review here is for ALL ready-to-drink, distilled waters, offered on Amazon, (and elsewhere), at such ridiculous prices.<br /><br />HOW can one make distilled water far more cheaply -- and without a<br />water-distiller?  By employing a method known as "home-distillation".<br />(This has NOTHING whatsoever to do with home distillation of whisky, of course.  It is for home-distillation of WATER.  Nothing illegal here, (yet, anyway!)  Copper kettles, copper coils, and new-made cornmash are NOT required, or used here!<br /><br />What IS used?  Large, (gallon size, if possible), glass jars.  The type in which organic apple juice often is seen.  What to do:  After washing out the bottle thoroughly, (and or, after previously drinking up all of the delicious organic apple juice), rinse jar throughly, to be sure no soap is left in the jar.  Rinse first with hot water, then, very slowly, (so as not to have an abrupt temperature change that can crack the glass), decrease the amount of hot water, and increase the amount of cold water used to rinse out the jar.  When 100% cold water is flowing from the faucet into the jar, keep rinsing<br />jar for another minute.  Finally, empty the jar, and fill with 100% cold(est) water.  Lightly cover with a PLASTIC cap, as metal caps tend to get rusty after a while.  (I find that different top colours from gallon-sized jugs of milk are perfect for this: gradually build up a collection of red, orange, green, white, and other colour milk-gallon tops, from whole, nonfat, and other types of milk.  Caps from bottles of products such as ENSURE, and PEDIA-SURE, are also good for<br />lightly covering these gallon milk containers, filled now as they are with home-distilled-water-in-the-making.)<br /><br />Fill up as many of these empty gallon glass containers as you can, (and for which you have room on your kitchen counter, or elsewhere), waiting at least an hour before you fill each jug in sequence, using a different colour top for each one.<br /><br />Get some magnets, and place them in a handy place -- like on your refrigerator door.  Take some small pieces of paper, and write the colour of each top/cover, on them.  Attach the pieces of paper to your refrigerator door, (or other handy place).  Line the pieces of paper up in a row, with the colour of the cover of the first jug you fill first, the colour of the colour of the top of the second jug you fill second, and so on.<br /><br />Now, just wait at least 10 hours from the time you fill the first jug.  When you want some distilled water, simply pour it into the saucepan / goldfish bowl, or wherever else you want to use your home-distilled water.  DO NOT USE MORE THAN HALF OF THE CONTENTS OF EACH JAR!  The secret of home-distilled water, you see, is that all of the flouride, and other things that are put into tap water, that you do not want, (and are the reason you buy or make distilled water in the first place), will, during the 10 or more hours you are waiting, sink down to the bottom of the bottle, as they are heavier than the water!<br />I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU BOIL THE WATER IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU HAVE DISTILLED IT, HOWEVER -- AT LEAST TWO FULL MINUTES ON A FULL BOIL.  BECAUSE "STANDING WATER" CAN GET STALE, (AND PROBABLY DANGEROUS), IF YOU LEAVE IT OUT TOO LONG WITHOUT REFRIGERATION.)  Of course, if you have a HUGE refrigerator, you can probably put the distilled water into it immediately after filling the jugs, and reduce, or eliminate, the boiling time otherwise required.  If you must boil the water, and want COOL distilled water, just turn the gas or electric stove off after the required two minutes, and wait until the water has cooled.<br /><br />When you finish using the first bottle of distilled water, rinse it out again with hot, then ever-so-slowly, cooler -- then cold water.<br />Move the paper attached to the refrigerator with the magnet, signifying the first bottle, (say, with the word "blue" on the paper -- signifying that the first bottle has a blue cap on it), to the end of the row.  Now, take the paper attached by a magnet signifying the second bottle, (say, with the word "yellow" written on it, meaning the yellow-capped bottle), to the "head of the line" of pieces of paper attached by magnets, on your refrigerator.  And so on.  This way, you need only move the papers attached by magnets, on your refrigerator, and not the bottles themselves, to always know which bottle has been sitting out the longest, (and hence has the most distillation at the moment.)  Lifting these little papers-attached-by-magnets-to-the-refrigerator, and moving them around, to different places in the line on your refrigerator, is a whole lot easier than always lifting, and repositioning the gallon-size glass jars on your kitchen counter!<br /><br />In any event, you will now have pure, home-distilled water!  The longer you let the water remain in the jugs, the more distilled the water will be.  The less you take out of each jug, the more distilled the water will be.<br /><br />NOTE: DISTILLING WATER, BY ANY METHOD, WILL ALSO ELIMINATE NEEDED MINERALS FROM THE WATER.  Because minerals -- along with flouride and other contaminates your well-meaning city water system puts into city water -- are also heavier than the water.  SO, IF YOU DRINK DISTILLED WATER, FROM ANY SOURCE, BE SURE TO ALSO TAKE MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS!<br /><br />This SOUNDS like a very, very complicated process -- but read it a few times, and you will see how actually very, very simple it is.  You get another bonus when boiling the distilled water -- it takes LESS TIME TO BOIL, AND WILL BOIL MORE THROUGHLY, because the floride, minerals, and other things have been removed from the water.  It's like the difference between boiling water that has pebbles in it, and water that doesn't have pebbles in it.  Because these "extra-aqualar" particles -- minerals, flouride, etc. -- are just that: tiny, microscopic "pebbles".<br /><br />Line up as many gallon jugs as you can find and have room for, (I have 8).  Have fun and save money with your home-distilled water.  It will cost ONLY the price of your water-bill!

When the frostings came out I was excited to have a convenient source of frosting in a pinch.  The directions were easy, the prep a breeze but the final product fell short.  The frosting was too sweet with an overpowering vanilla taste-and I love vanilla. I would have to say the vanilla tasted artificial since it was so strong. I make a beautiful vanilla buttercream and although I did not expect a final product of this caliber, I expected better than what I tasted. Skip this product and take a few extra minutes to make your own.

Thankfully I baked the cake and mixed the frosting the night before my son's party, because this frosting is just disappointing. I'm not sure why someone said it has an overpowering vanilla flavor, because all I can taste is sugar. Silly me, I should've read the ingredients before buying it, because that's what it is! Just a bag of powdered sugar and powdered vanilla! The end product isn't smooth and creamy, but just flat and overly sweet. I like frosting to have a little body, and this is a huge disappointment. Luckily, I have some whipping cream in the fridge; I'll just whip that up with a little sugar and vanilla. I will not buy this product again, and I will not stock it in my store.

review/text: I hadn't had frosting for many months when I made Pamela's Vanilla Frosting mix.  As a Type II diabetic and being gluten intolerant, it was something I felt I had to do without.  BUT...I had had a wonderful gluten-free chocolate cake made from a Betty Crocker mix and I had felt it was just a little plain.  For the next cake I wanted a little more pizzaz.  Amazon had Pamela's Vanilla Frosting mix on sale so I decided to give it a try.  It was fantastic; my taste buds danced on my tongue when the first bite passed my lips!  It was sweet with a light texture and literally melted on my tongue.  I knew I was safe from reactions to gluten and I had taken the proper steps to manage my diabetes in order to allow me the pleasure of this snack.  I can't treat myself like this very often but I would recommend this product to anyone.  Just don't expect it to be a pure white color--it's more of a cream color.

review/summary: Magnificent Scotch Whisky
review/text: Highland Park produces an amazing line of standard bottlings that range in age from 12 to 50 years.  The king of the hill for us serfs is the 25 year old. The 30 YO is just a touch out of my comfort pricing zone and the 40 and 50 are priced in the stratosphere as investment grade only. So we have the 25 YO as the drinkable top of the line HP. At a cask strength of 48.1% the alcohol has no problem delivering those amazing Highland Park scents to your nose. Word on the street is they are running low on the 25 YO and future bottlings will be at a lower ABV so get it while you can.<br /><br />Imagine the 18 YO only more defined, bolder, and muscular...sherry, honey, vanilla, autumn spices, chocolate, dark fruits, and a very shy old oak cask hiding in the shadows. Only a drop or two of water is all that is needed to soften the alcohol and deliver the nosed flavors to a smooth drying mouth feel --some smoke, caramel apple leading to a long vibrant finish that coaxes out that aged cask, nutty, sweet fruits, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little honey and smoke and finally that Highland Park trademark mouthwatering affect.  Everything is delivered in exactly the order you expect it to be.<br /><br />A truly magnificent whisky that demonstrates craftsmanship and quality matched by few in the all of the whisk(e)y making world. Not for everyday, but for those special occasions when you want to indulge in a single malt that is expensive, but oh so worth the price of admission. Smart shoppers can find it for the same price as that bloated, vile, over-marketed JW Blue label stuff masquerading as fine whisky. HP 25 YO, db, 48.1% abv = Highest Recommendation.

review/summary: My Choicest Black Tea
review/text: This is my favorite tea to drink. I am a big fan of Yunnan black teas, so this fits my palate nicely.<br /><br />I love the smell of this tea. It's earthy with notes of cocoa and malt. There is also a honey-like sweetness to the nose.<br /><br />The taste is excellent: the malty and cocoa notes are quite obvious, but they are present after that honey-sweet earthiness mentioned before. One of my favorite things about this tea is that there is little to no bitterness at all (Personally, I have found that 3-4 minutes at 195 degrees is a good temperature that brings out flavor without causing bitterness).<br /><br />The second cup is just like the first, except the honey and malt take a backseat to the cocoa and earthiness. This tea doesn't get noticeably weak to me until the 4th+ steeping. However, it is not a hugely apparent loss of flavor. In short, you'll get many infusions with this one.<br /><br />Don't let the price scare you away -- anyone who has tried many Yunnan teas knows the difference in quality with price. For this particular concoction, $15/2 oz. is a reasonable buy. I use three pearls per 8 oz. water, and I haven't used mine up in weeks! Go buy this stuff and enjoy.

A must have, at a good price.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YJ4XJ0">Domino Sugar - 10 lb. bag</a>

review/summary: Best coffee, hands down.
review/text: A friend from Georgia brought me a bag as a friendship gift and I began using it and loving it! I soon found out it wasnt available where I do my grocery shopping so on a whim I checked Amazon. I found not only was available but I could set up a regular delivery and at a cheaper price than I was often paying for Folgers at the store. The best thing though is it is the best coffee I have ever made at home.I would give both the coffee and the delivery 50 stars if it were a choice!

review/summary: Great coffee!!  Great deal.
review/text: This is the best Louisiana coffee made - as a Louisiana native I know. It is rich and bold. Amazin's auto delivery is the best deal I have found.

review/summary: Good coffee for the money
review/text: I've made this coffee both through a regular drip coffee machine as well as a Keurig, both with great results. Solid cup of coffee, I'm not a connoisseur but it was good enough for me. Worth giving a try, especially for the price.

review/summary: Good coffee, but I like the Breakfast Blend better
review/text: I like this coffee, but I prefer the Community Breakfast Blend over this one.  This one is strong coffee and much better than Seattle's Best coffee that I bought when I ran out of the Community coffee.  I really like this brand and this coffee.  I will keep buying this brand.

review/summary: Wow, truly the best.
review/text: Didn't know what good coffee could be until I had a few cups of Community Coffee when I went down to New Orleans.  At first I noticed that the coffee tasted slightly different from what I was used to.  Most other coffee I have drank taste almost watered down.  Community Coffee isn't like this.  The aroma is so fresh when it hits your face.  I can now say this coffee is truly high quality and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves quality.  From what I understand they only use the top 1% of coffee beans to brew their coffee which means they are not willing to sacrifice quality like the Starbucks and Folders of the world.  Talking to folks in Louisiana (famous for Cajun cuisine and people who love their food) their is only one brand of coffee and that's Community.  My Favorite blend is Cafe Special.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: New Orleans Coffee For REAL COFFEE DRINKERS!
review/text: I was raised smelling Community Coffee being roasted in New Orleans and started drinking it 1/2 community/1/2 milk when I was 5 yrs old, as just about all kids did.<br /><br />Community is all that we drink!  If the dark roast is too stronge, blend it yourself with medium or milder blend.  If the Community Chickory is a bit too much for you, you can blend it also with a "no chickory", milder blend.<br /><br />I really didn't appreciate the buyer that said it was "bad coffee"!!!  They just don't know what good is, che'!  It's the flavor of New Orleans!<br /><br />Maybe drinking on a balmy day, in an open-air setting by the Mississippi River and the French Quarter with beniets would make it much better.  If you're not able to do that, then here's a way to at least experience the best tasting coffee at home.  Enjoy!

review/summary: A Community worth keeping
review/text: We have been drinking this for quite some time. Delicious. When making it correctly you will get a smooth yet full body and dark rich cup of coffee. Please do not make as another has suggested. It is NOT one tablespoon per ounce of water. That would make a strong espresso. I think she meant one tablespoon per SIX to Eight ounces of water. We use one level tablespoon per two cups and it comes out perfect every time. Again make according to taste.

review/summary: Versatile great coffee
review/text: My husband and I have been enjoying this coffee for some time now. First we were putting it through our Cuisinart Grind n Brew, and still do when we have guests.  On our own, we've been making cold brewed coffee concentrate with this same coffee, and have been very happy with it.  We usually can do without the cream or cream & sugar we were accustomed to.  We have gotten this by subscription now too and like that convenience as well.

review/summary: Great coffee for the price
review/text: The dark roast version is delicious, and I've received comments from friends as well.  Full flavor, delicious in the morning without half and half (and that's saying a lot)!  For those who said it was weak, I have one suggestion: you need to add more coffee.  In my Cuisinart coffee maker (the model that has a 'step' indicator on the right hand side) I use 3-1/2 scoops for 10 cups. Super saver is a great way to get the coffee as well.
