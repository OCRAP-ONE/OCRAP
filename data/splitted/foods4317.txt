review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I love this product, I always bought the can version after a round of golf until I found this. I am a bit disappointed with Amazon for not offering this product to the people of Hawaii or Alaska but I know someone that can get this for me so it's okay for now.<br /><br />This mixes very well with water though I use the one liter water bottle since it has a lot of flavor in a little package, I have tried a lot of other mixes from other brands and this seems to mix better than most of them and does not have that grainy feel when you drink it. not too sweet so it doesn't make you more thirsty after you drink it. Very refreshing flavor after a round of golf or any other activity in the sun.<br /><br />I drink a lot of the Arizona teas, but this is by far the flavor i like the most with the sweet tea in second.<br /><br />I hope Amazon changes their policy on shipping these items since it's not a perishable item, but until then i got my fix.

review/text: Arizona Iced Tea products are terrific - except the powder substitute.  This product while purported to be Arizona Arnold Palmer Half and Half has 0 likeness to the canned and bottled products.  I tried extra water and less water and still all I get is a gritty tastless product.  I am sold on the bottled product - I will not buy this poor imitation again.

review/summary: Great for small dogs--one pouch a day
review/text: I have a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs around 10 lbs at the most. I have mostly fed her Mighty Dog in the can. She recently had to have almost all of her teeth extracted except for 2. She had a hard time eating the Mighty Dog because it is all chunked together like Spam. Even when I mashed it up, she had trouble eating it and scraping it out of her bowl.<br /><br />I started feeding her Pedigree Senior in the pouches. She likes it and where it had a little gravy in it it made it easier for her to eat. For the most part, it slides right out of the pouch although sometimes some of the food gets stuck in the little pocket at the bottom.<br /><br />One pouch a day is plenty for her. She loves it. We tried the new beef flavor with gravy and she actually likes it more than the Lamb and Rice but the beef flavor gives her diarhea really badly. She has never gotten diarhea from any other dog food so after I feed her the case I am switching back to this variety.<br /><br />This fills her up, is easy to eat, is quick and convenient for me to give her, and it seems to be really easy on her stomach.<br /><br />Highly recommend this for any small dogs. Grade A from me.

review/summary: Better pouch design needed
review/text: I have a 10 y/o chihuahua and she really likes this. It is little tiny cubes of dog food mixed with rice. She has lost most of her teeth yet she is able to eat this easily. The cubes are easier to eat then the typical wet dog food that is in a can and then you have to mash up--she can grab onto the cubes easily.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that the pouches are designed in a way that makes some of the dog food stick to the bottom of the pouch. The bottom is concave so it is like a little pocket that traps food.<br /><br />But I would recommend this for anyone with a small dog who is getting up in years. Especially if you have a dog w/ dental problems or who has lost teeth. My dog weighs about 10 lbs and one of these pouches a day along with a dog treat is plenty enough for her.

review/summary: Convenient and the four-legged one loves it.
review/text: Our older Tibetan Terrier has been losing weight recently, although our other two dogs happily maintain their size on dry food.  The vet suggested that due to her advanced years, our TT might need canned food which is easier to eat.  Pedigree Healthy Maturity in the pouch is the right size for a meal, and has been part of returning her to a healthy weight.  She considers it a treat, and becomes very excited when my husband opens the pouch and pours it out for her.  Getting these pouches by the case through Amazon is cost effective and extremely convenient, we'll be purchasing more.

After three days of offereing this Pedigree morsels mixed with some dry food, Miss Picky is now eating both the dry and the canned food happily. Can't ask for much more than that. Oh and it doesn't have that funky odor so many canned foods are afflicted with.

Ours will--including shoes, cardboard boxes, electrical cords, and our clothing (not that we put these things in front of him; he tracks them down). We got Pedigree Little Champions Healthy Maturity Morsels in Sauce with Lamb & Rice because our senior dog, who is medium fussy, seems to like lamb and rice meaty loaf, but it's not always available. The morsels are small, but she still isn't interested. The puppy, on the other hand, seems to think that this stuff is the dog's bow-wow.

review/summary: Oh La La!
review/text: Wooo hoooo my third matcha today. Its been a long busy crazy kind of day with the need to multitask, be sociable, run errand, work, make phone calls, help family out, entertain teen girls with girl talk time, and go go go. Thanks to the power of matcha it has been a breeze! Now I am waiting on the husband to get home from work hopefully within the next hour or so and spend maybe one hour of quality time with him before I can unwind silently on my own perhaps doing some reading. However, I am going for this cup to carry me through till that time.<br /><br />So I am indulging in some french vanilla matcha from Red Leaf Tea linked above.<br /><br />This is one of the smoothest matcha yet from Red Leaf. A lot like Bavarian Cream it is very velvety and creamy. I think I prefer this over the madagascar vanilla because this one seems to be a bit more vanillay more in your face a term I over use but everyone who follows me pretty much knows I like my flavors to be strong. Between the two, if you want something more mellow and laid back then Madagascar Vanilla is your cup of tea, but if you want something sinfully smooth, rich, thick, and creamy, then French Vanilla is the one for you.<br /><br />I will probably do a bit more exploring of all the flavors Red Leaf Tea has to offer before ordering a larger quantity however I am pretty sure French Vanilla would make that list. I mean you can mix it with other flavors to get a more creamy texture and flavor out of them such as mixing Caramel matcha with French Vanilla but then I think I could do the same thing with Cheesecake, or Bavarian Cream so the list of possible mixes goes on and on!<br /><br />This is one that has a permanent home in my matcha stash!

review/summary: My One True Matcha Love
review/text: Now, those who follow me and my reviews know I can't stop raving about the Madagascar Vanilla from Red Leaf Teas. I'm almost out of it already, it's the one I reach for the most and when people ask which one they should try first, my immediate answer is "Vanilla. Oh my goodness, the vanilla."<br /><br />But Madagascar's reign may soon be over.<br /><br />French Vanilla is my one true love. French Vanilla anything. Vanilla was my favorite ice cream flavor before I gave up ice cream. French Vanilla is the ice cream flavor I will risk my dairy allergy for. It's just so creamy and rich and guh, so good. So when Red Leaf Tea let me know they had a new matcha out, a French Vanilla, I was sold. It immediately went into my cart and I feverishly finished my other reviews so I could order it as soon as possible.<br /><br />I opened the package this morning and almost drooled. It smells like icing. Like I had just opened up a new tub of Betty Crocker vanilla frosting. Oh god, I want to drown in it. It's almost too sweet for this early in the morning, but I don't care! I have to have some of this now! I'll make bacon later to make up for it.<br /><br />It...it's perfect. It's everything I ever dreamed of in a vanilla matcha. Everything. Creamy, smooth, beyond amazing. I want to shout from the rooftops that I've found The One, the tea I've been searching for forever, the tea that is the reason I own 6 different vanilla rooibos and 8 variations on a vanilla black. This tea is my holy grail. It's matcha, which I have come to love and value over almost any other tea, and it's that French Vanilla goodness that rocks my world. I know it seems like I've gone a bit crazy, but this is just...guh. It's fulfilling my ice cream cravings, my icing cravings, my everything cravings.<br /><br />That said, I will likely keep the Madagascar around for mixing, as it seems to blend beautifully with other flavors, but when I want to sit down and just enjoy a good cup of matcha, the French Vanilla is what I will be reaching for. Oh yes, my pretty. We will have a long, happy life together. Red Leaf Tea, I honestly cannot thank you enough for introducing this blend.

review/summary: Mediocre is the only appropriate word...
review/text: One of the really big selling points of the Keurig brewer was that it produced hot beverages other than just coffee. Teas, cappuccinos and hot chocolates were all available and we were eager to try them. I did my research after we got our brewer for Christmas, though, and was really disappointed to read a pile of negative reviews for pretty much every hot chocolate brand available.<br /><br />The Swiss Miss hot chocolate was on sale at our local grocery store so we decided we had to try it. It had ranked a little bit higher than most of the other brands so I held out hope that it would work out. I brewed a small cup when we got home and gave it a shot. The consistency that came out of the machine was nice and the consistency didn't seem watery.<br /><br />This tastes exactly like the no calorie Swiss Miss hot chocolate available in sleeves. While you're drinking it, it tastes alright, but then it's followed by a very plasticy synthetic aftertaste. There's no mistaking the artificial sweetener here and I can see how that would bother a lot of people, especially those with sensitive taste buds.<br /><br />I think we'll finish the rest of the box, but I'm not convinced we'll repurchase. We'll probably just use the Keurig to prepare the water and then use traditional hot chocolate packets.

I suspect the formula has been altered to get consumers to chew more gum and yes, to buy more. How cynical. How disappointing.

review/summary: Delightful salads again!!
review/text: I love salad dressing, not only for salads but also for dipping many other things.  They are so high in calories though and I wanted to prune some of the "excess" things that I don't consider really filling like high calorie condiments.  I hate fat-free dressings, they are mostly sugar and too much spice flavoring but these are delightful.  I haven't tried them all yet but the balsamic vinegar is my favorite with the ranch a close second.  The ranch is a little stronger tasting than the creamy flavor that I so adore but still very good and not at all like the flavor of fat-free dressing.  These would get five stars if it weren't for the high fructose corn syrup in the ingredients, it's one of those things that I think is overused but for the amount of flavor in so few calories they are still getting four stars and a thumbs up.

It's like chewing on a green apple stick made of gasoline. YUCK.<br /><br />I'm not picky about my gum, I'm really not, but I wound up spitting this out. When I dared a green-apple loving co-worker to eat one, he bit half of it off, chewed it for a few seconds, then said "Okay, I'm done" and spit it out.<br /><br />I suggested we keep it around for interviewees; it would be a great test of character and we could evaluate how our candidate handles the pressure of being offered a piece of gum and then discovering it was poisonous, but it didn't fly.<br /><br />Anyway, stay far, far away from this one.

review/summary: 5 Gum, 1 Star
review/text: I usually like 5 gum. But this new stuff is pretty rotten. The initial flavor is definitely green apple, but it fades to nothing in about 15 seconds. Then it starts squeaking when you chew. Kinda sounds like you're chewing on a ball of rubberbands. And when you're done, your breath smells pretty offensive... like you've been sucking on a pile of old coins.

review/summary: A new low in the annals of chewing
review/text: I'm generally a fan of 5 gum--to the extent that a person can "have a brand" of gum, it's my brand. But wow, this stuff is gut-churning. Even by fake-green-apple standards, it's bitter and almost rancid-tasting. Maybe that explains why the flavor only holds up through about eight chews. It's a small mercy, but a mercy nonetheless.<br /><br />If you're a gum dealer looking to score big bucks in the collector's market ten or twenty years down the line, you should probably grab a case or two, because there's no way this stuff will be available much longer. Otherwise, you're better off chewing on your fingernails or old gristle or whatever you can find stuck between the sofa cushions. Or any of 5's other delightful flavors. Except maybe watermelon ... oh, sorry, "Prism." I think the person who names these things is the same person who taste-tests them.

It seems to last as long as any gum.<br /><br />I read the negative reviews first, and bought anyway (because I have a friend who likes 5 gum, and can't get it in her country).

review/summary: Best gum ever made
review/text: This green apple gum is th ebest gum flavor I have ever tasted by far. I guess that is why it is always sold out at the stores in my town (Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Jewel, etc.) both at the checkout and on the racks with the multi-packs in the candy aisles... They can't keep it in stock. I have driven for miles around looking for it. Always an empty spot where this gum should be. Once they got a shipment, I bought 2 big packs, and it was gone again in approx 3 days when I got paid and went to get more to stock up. HOT HOT stuff. Truly better than anything out there. I used to think extra watermelon flavor was best before this. Now that tastes average by comparison. They got it right with this one.<br /><br />I chew it when running 5k races or training on long runs -- keeps my mouth from drying out like nothing else because the flavor is so awesome. Also great for losing weight because it has such an intense flavor -- satisfies cravings for sweets.

review/text: I don't know why people are saying this is bland. It has such peppery flavor I thought my wife added pepper to it. I also love that unlike Nissin or Maruchan, it's not laden with saltiness. The noodles were perfect: springy and flavorful. Their bounce was perfect in the broth so they didn't turn to mush. By far the best instant ramen I've ever had.

review/summary: Decent non-spicy ramen
review/text: Not a fan of all the spicy noodle bowls; they all go way overboard on the salt and the heat is overpowering. So far, the only non-spicy available from Nong Shim are the Ginger Beef and the Savory Chicken. I prefer the beef, but the chicken is a nice alternative. The flavor may be too mild for some; it's basically a thin chicken boullion. If you're looking for spiciness, you won't find it here. And although the salt content is pretty high, it doesn't seem to taste as salty as the spicy version, but I definitely don't taste any "styrofoam." And this comes in an 18-pack instead of the usual 12, so the per unit price is on the low side. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a non-spicy, cheap ramen.

review/text: Our dogs need to chew.  We feel comfortable with this product because there are no little pieces breaking off as possible chocking or digestive hazards. The dogs love it and could work on it for hours, but we set a time limit and save the treat for another day.  That way it lasts for quite awhile.  We prefer the ones that are wheat free. Most dog treats contain wheat which our dogs can't have so that's another plus. The biggest problem is fitting the treat into the ball, but if that were easy it would also be easy for the dogs to get it out! This product is safe and fun.

Unfortunately when he ate a chunk of it, it also kept my vet busy.<br /><br />I only allowed my dog to use this when I was around and gave it to him in the ball holder but he still managed to swallow a piece. It got stuck for a bit in his gut and caused him to throw up anything he ate and quite a bit of discomfort. Fortunately since this is a digestible item he was able to pass it without the need for surgery.<br /><br />My dog is a STRONG chewer and very determined, so you may have better lick, I mean luck, if your dog isn't so intent on liberating it from the holder.<br /><br />Also, if your dog has a Wheat/Corn/Soy allergy, be sure to test this with them before giving them the whole thing. I can't say for sure, but I suspect the package we had was NOT wheat-free b/c the boy reacted to it much like he does when he eats something with wheat in it. Unfortunately I didn't put that together in time to prevent what was described above.

review/summary: Definitely Consider This Flavor Brand
review/text: This one is loaded with spinach, and that's what I wanted for my twin 10-month olds.  It is not as dense as I expected or wanted evidently because they added enough water to make it more liquidly.  Nevertheless, Earth's Best made it sufficiently tasty by adding carrots.  That seems to be their technique to make what would otherwise not be popular with babies tasty enough.  It already has brown rice so I don't think there's a strong incentive to add rice cereal to it, although one certainly could.<br /><br />Of all the Earth's Best flavor brands, I believe this is the darkest natural green one.  I have this by subscription and am glad for it.  My babies like it.  They are 10-months old; they might not have liked it some months ago.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Water, organic spinach, organic potatoes, organic carrots, organic barley flour, organic brown rice.<br /><br />This has 50 calories, 10% protein, 50% vitamin A, 15% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron. I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/text: I subscribe to this 4 oz. carrot 12-pack.<br /><br />Both our twin babies love this one with carrots as we discovered with the vegetable variety pack. Other parents have told me their babies like carrots so this one is likely to be a winner.<br /><br />I've tried many Earth's Best baby food in the jars products on my babies. They like all of them with only a couple exceptions. I've discovered they're not fond of peas or onions, but I've also discovered that as they get older they will eat more types of foods. If you get something your baby doesn't like, maybe you can keep it on hand for when your baby is a few months older and try again.<br /><br />Several other varieties of Earth's Best contain carrots as one of the major ingredients even if they go by other names. I think this is to make them sweet so babies will like them more.<br /><br />The ingredients are simply organic carrots and water. One 4-ounce jar (not this 2.5 ounce jar) has 40 calories, and daily value: 4% protein, 150% vitamin A and 4% calcium (that's all of it; no iron for example).<br /><br />Compared to other Earth Best varieties, this has very little calories but is very high in vitamin A. I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult.

review/summary: Baby loves spinach!
review/text: We love most Earth's Best baby foods, but this is one of our favorites.  It doesn't include any fruit and is not sweet.  And yet, our baby loves to eat it.  We're thrilled that our baby gets so many good veggies without having to mask the flavor with sugary fruits like many other baby foods do (even some Earth's Best varieties).  The only ingredients are: Water, Organic Spinach, Organic Potatoes, Organic Carrots, Organic Barley Flour, and Organic Brown Rice.

review/text: This isn't one of my 7.5 month old's favorite flavors but she'll still eat it though. It's a bit runny to me so I add a bit of rice cereal to thicken the texture up a bit. I also added a bit of formula to this on the first few tries so that my baby got used to the taste. Consistency of each jar is very good and packaging is absolutely secure.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts from label:<br />Calories 50, Protein 9%, Vitamin A 10%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 6%, Iron 4%

review/text: I didn't think spinach would be very pleasant to my baby's taste buds. I tasted this myself and found it to be awfully bland but my 7 month old just LOVES this. She can finish a whole jar in one sitting with no problem. I've not had any problems with shipping & packing and the quality of each jar gets my stamp of approval. Yipee!

review/text: Carrots were the only veggie I didn't home-make for my baby (doctor's recommendation due to nitrate levels).  These are the yummiest ones we tried, and the consistency is very nice -- still very easy to eat, but not as watery as others.  Definitely not over-strained, also. They are like what I would've made.<br /><br />Have been pleased with all of the Earth's Best products we've used (cereals, snacks, & jar dinners).

review/summary: Best variety of baby food with Spinach
review/text: We received our package of 12 Earth's Best Spinach & Potatoes a few days ago and my 7.5 month old has already eaten two whole jars (and she doesn't eat much at once so that is saying something!).  I love how much spinach is in this product.  Reading most of the baby food labels, the varieties with spinach either have 1) sweet fruit in them to disguise the taste or 2) very little spinach.  This product is very dark green yet my baby loves it.  There are just enough potatoes and carrots in the mix to take the "bite" out of the spinach that makes children not like it. I will continue to purchase this variety of Earth's Best as long as my baby is eating pureed food.

review/text: I was sooo impressed by how this came in the mail.  It was tightly wrapped with bubble wrap (an added bonus- baby's siblings were thrilled) and a lot of heavy tape.  Despite my 8 year old dropping the box in her exuberance to get it to me all the jars were perfectly fine.  I ordered it also with the peas selection and that is what I have given the baby first- but it seems to be the right consistancy and the baby likes it- so it gets a two thumbs up.

He loves Elmo and when he saw the cake (which I  made myself) he was very excited and couldn't wait to bite into the cake. The picture itself was very easy to remove and place on the cake.

I just lays on top of the cake making a smooth, fondant-looking texture.  It also took a while for the image to moisten and adhere to the icing.  Once it did though, it looked awesome!  I was also worried if it would change the taste of the cake or icing, it didn't though!  You wouldn't even be able to tell it was there if you weren't able to see it!<br /><br />Great product!

The instructions explicitly state ways to help remove it from the backing if it is difficult to get off, which we tried - multiple times and in multiple ways - and nothing worked. We finally had to get a butcher's knife and carefully run it between the now ripped image and the paper. Once it was on the cake, it looked fine, but there were some tears that were noticeable. It is not an easy-to-use product.

review/summary: Great for the creative cook!
review/text: I used to make my own flans and creme brulee but I tried this flan mix and rarely make it from scratch anymore.  However, I have discovered that I can make a lot of changes and create some truly scrumptious desserts that are my "own".  Here are some options:  Use heavy creme for half of the milk.  Use coconut milk instead of regular milk.  Both produce a silky smooth and elegant custard.  Add fresh lime or lemon juice for part of the milk, but add it right at the end of the cooking process.  Instead of the enclosed sauce, use marmalade, lingonberry, mango or blueberry preserves,spreading it around the bottom of your custard cups before adding the cooked custard. If you are serving 6-8 people you will need to start with two packages of the mix. I don't have names for what I create, but I sure get raves from everyone who tries them.  Only thing is, don't make these rich desserts very often or you will clog up your arteries.<br /><br />I have been having a hard time finding this product in local grocery stores so was happy to see Amazon now sells it.  And, subscribe and save is a great deal, if you cook as much as I do.

I tried this and the taste and texture are surprisingly similar, definitely a good enough substitute for the real thing.  The color is a little more custard-y yellow than blonde as I remember my father's version, but that's no big deal.

review/summary: Delicious creamy flan with sweet caramel sauce
review/text: These are very good. It's not 100% authentic flan but it's flavor is pretty close.<br /><br />The difference between this flan & most other flans is that this jell-o one has a softer texture. Kind of like a custard. But that makes no difference to me. The flavor is great.<br /><br />The caramel is nice and sweet.and the flan is creamy. they just go well together! I can probably eat 2 whole boxes on my own! (well maybe)<br /><br />Oh and this is a great vegetarian item! No gelatin or eggs!<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />I also got the fastest shipping ever! Amazon's shipping facility was only a few miles away. So I got my item the next day!<br /><br />P.S the caramel does not form with the flan. it will just stay at the bottom of the bowl/cup. this does not bother me. but if presentation matters to you. you might want to add the caramel last. after your flan is already firm and refrigerated

I find a lot of things on amazon @ great prices and free delivery so one evening after being unsuccessful restocking my jello flan i decided to check amazon.  I was so surprised amazon carried it.  I told my husband it was a miracle! Not only did they have it but it was a little less than I was paying at the market, they offered free delivery and I was able to order it automatically every month so I never run out.  It has saved me so much time to not have to check at the market for stock.

review/summary: Great  and easy
review/text: Easy to make and a great flavor for such.  The caramel sauce is so good.  Would give 5 stars if there had been more of the caramel, but it was devoured quickly anyway with no complaints.

review/summary: The lobsters are plentiful!!!!
review/text: I read about the over abundance of lobster in Maine, so I thought I would try to get<br />a decent price. It would have been, but the shipping is outrageous. I am not paying<br />3 times the amount of the lobster tails for shipping. Maybe for a very special occasion<br />but even then I would buy local. The shipping is absurd.

review/summary: not pimentos
review/text: When I bought these I thought I was getting pimientos, but they are just bell peppers. Not that there's anything wrong with them, it's just not what I wanted to get. This company needs to be more accurate in its labeling.

review/summary: actually not pimentos
review/text: These are good quality canned red bell peppers, not the pointed pimentos shown on the label.  This could be a problem for people who can eat pimentos but can't eat bell peppers.<br /><br />I would have given the product more stars had it been actual pimentos  as advertised.<br /><br />That said, the quality is very good. Since the cans are quite large I open the can and put some of them in freezer containers and they work just as well after having been frozen.<br /><br />I would buy them again.
