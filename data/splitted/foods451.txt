review/summary: WOW
review/text: I wanted to echo the other positive reviews by folks that are "blown away" by the quality and taste of this product.<br /><br />I have never spend $45 on a condiment before. Like others I have used the $3 bottle of store bought balsamic vinegar. There is NO comparison.<br /><br />This stuff is thick and sweat. It has the viscosity of syrup. The flavors are rich and complex. This stuff adds an incredible eating experience when drizzled over a good cheese. It is delightful on Avacado. I originally used it on a juicy heirloom tomato and was disappointed because the juice of the tomato watered down the syrupy goodness of the vinegar too much. To experience this product you do not want to water it down in any way.<br /><br />I mixed 1/2 vinegar, 1/2 olive oil with some minced garlic and onions, a little salt and pepper. It made a nice thick dressing that was to die for spooned over mixed greens. Also, my concoction did not diminish the viscosity or the flavor of the vinegar in any way. When using this product you want the vinegar to always be at the center of the taste experience.<br /><br />The biggest negative for this product is that once you try it there is no going back. And, at $45 a bottle it is priced like liquid gold. Heck, I do not spend that much for a 1/5th of quality Bourbon! I find myself checking the level in the bottle every time I open the cabinet. This stuff is a real treat to be experienced.<br /><br />I am pretty frugal with how I spend my money. I never thought I would spend 45$ on a bottle of vinegar. But this is not vinegar as you and I traditionally know vinegar. Now, it is hard to imagine not having a bottle of this in our cupboard for those special occasions.

review/text: Not sure how I first found this item but it has become a staple in my pantry ever since. It is great on tomatoes with basal and mozzerela. I also make a great dressing with olive oil, dijon mustard, sugar and shallots. It is so versatile because it has such a wonderful taste. I have tried a lot of other brands, and for the money this is a good deal.

review/summary: Absolutely the best for the price
review/text: I've had a lot of different balsamics; from the watery, stinging garbage carried by your average grocery store to 30 year La Vecchia.  When I'm not fortunate enough to be enjoying a really old, thick, syrupy delight like the La Vecchia, I use and recommend this balsamic without hesitation.  It is so deliciously thick and complex, you can use it for anything as everyone already said - in any context where the taste of balsamic can shine.  It is as delightful on insalate Capresa as it is drizzled on your best salad, or used for bruschetta, or even used to (sparingly) top vanilla ice cream (knock your guests socks off with this one; for the adventurous, add some fresh cracked black pepper as well).<br />Honestly, for around $44. on Amazon (which is good, our local gourmet stores that carry it ask for at least $50) with free shipping - it is a STEAL.  It's a good amount and will last a while if you don't go crazy.<br /><br />The BEST deal for good balsamic, grab it while it lasts.

review/summary: I am an adult with GERD
review/text: I recently ended up with GERD and a really bad bleeding ulcer, due to stress and grief.  I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving.  Some types of baby food stay down,  where as other types cause me indigestion just as bad as adult food.  This specific sweet potato one seemed to ease my acid refluxing and indigestion and sooth my throat.  I'm not at the point where I can eat the whole container yet,  but this is a good start.  This also has a pleasant taste.  Some of the baby food is just bland and boring,  but this one is alright.  Not the best but still alright. Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems.  Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in,  and need to retrain your stomach and intestines.  Just be careful,  some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />By the way,  this doesn't have all the nutrients you would need to survive.  As a adult you'd need about 12-16 small jars a day and you'd need to make sure you get enough protein.  So be careful,  this is only a temporary fix for people with ulcers and GERD.

It saves a ton of room in the kitchen, rather than having them tipping over in the cupboard.<br /><br />One surprising thing we also discovered is that our cat who has a low appetite loves this simple pea baby food too. It has been healthy for my baby and a real treat for my pet. Good stuff.

review/summary: Product was as expected.  Arrival condition of product was poor.
review/text: While the product was as expected as I had ordered it before in smaller packaged quantities, the larger volume bag ordered arrived in an Amazon box opened and out of the sack.  The contents were spilling out of the carton even as I picked it up and loaded it unto my car.  I left a little trail of kibbles as I finally arrived home.  That was my only complaint and as I did not think the product itself was compromised I simply kept it rather than go through the process of returning the item.  My dogs of course love it so, the cost is much better than purchasing from the pet store and the convenience of having it shipped to my PO box is nice.  Next time though perhaps I should have it delivered to my home residence. Will definitely order again but will probably order in smaller bags so as to avoid the "opened" bag experience.

I went to a cheaper brand due to financial concerns but not happy with that food. Will stick with this brand. The price is cheaper then local pet-store and the convenience of home delivery is a perk!

review/text: If you feed your best friend Innova Small Bite or other Innova Dog Food these are great Health Bar Treats as they have mostly the same ingredients as the food !<br />Your dogs will love being rewarded and at the same time they will still be getting the same nutrition and flavor of their normal food.<br />They come in small and large bars to accommodate any sized dog. I have 2 small Papillons and I normally break one small bar in half for them and that works fine but I also give them whole bars from time to time. Since they are like the food one a day is usually enough for smaller dogs since they are more filling.<br />I would also recommend them for any dog owner, irregardless of the food you use, if you are looking for a good well balanced healthy treat !<br />Give these a try. Your furry friends will love you for it !<br />P.S. I have never had any allergy problems of any kind with any of Innova products ! Nice shinny coats also.

review/text: Unlike some other types of pour over microwave popcorns you cannot just add the mix into the bag & shake to make your popcorn, you have to pop the popcorn in the bag, then add it to a bowl, add the caramel on top, microwave a little more, & then mix thoroughly.  This extra prep work really is necessary, but it makes it just a little less convenient.  The popcorn tastes great though, just make sure to make it when you have others to share it with.  It's too rich to eat a whole bag by yourself.

review/text: We used to get this is kids.  Unfortunately, it's very difficult -- if not impossible -- to find.  They seem to have made improvements to the quality of the popcorn.  I remember my mother having issues with the popcorn burning once it was placed back in the microwave for the caramel to melt.<br /><br />If you've never made it before, here are a few tips.  Pop the popcorn slightly less than you would wait for normal, butter popcorn.  This should help avoid burning it when you put it back in the microwave.  Transfer the popcorn to a large bowl, ensuring you leave out all of the unpopped kernels which have a tendency to get "lost" in the caramel and really hurt when you chomp on them.<br /><br />Also, cut the caramel wafer into small bits; I think the directions recommend 4-6, but I usually cut it in 6-8 pieces.  This allows for easier distribution of the caramel.  After it melts, carefully stir with the largest spoon you have.  (Carefully so that you don't break up all the popcorn into tiny pieces.)<br /><br />Great stuff!  I wish the expiration dates on these would last 2-3 years.  Getting a carton of the stuff is great, but it's a lot of popcorn!  (And let's be honest, it's not very good for you!)  But it sure does taste good!

review/summary: Quality Organic Flax Seeds
review/text: This is the second time I've ordered these seeds from Amazon. As a previous reviewer pointed out, though it is not mentioned or shown on the label in the photo, these are organic, and the packages you receive do state that. An excellent product for your health and Omega-3's, I grind up a couple tablespoons a day in a coffee grinder and add them to my oatmeal every morning. Occasionally,I'll also grind them and add them to a smoothie.

review/text: My dog seemed to enjoy the food, but then again he eats anything. My main concern was the size of this food. I don't think it was meant for big "gulper" dogs. He choked on it often so I had to mix it with his regular food. I have a rescued greyhound that inhales his food.

review/summary: These are not "foam", but still tasty!
review/text: So, Amazon has these listed as "Luehders Foam." I assumed this meant a candy with a spongier foam-like consistency, which could be interesting.<br /><br />They have the consistency of giant gummy bears, basically. Despite the fact that they're not "foam" in any way, they're still quite tasty (even if mostly just flavored sugar), so I'll still give them 4 stars!<br /><br />This is a German product, but the name (erdbeeren mit fruchtst&uuml;ckchen) just translates as something like strawberries with fruit bits, which isn't any more accurate!  "L&uuml;hders Fruit Gummies" would be an accurate name, I guess, since the poorly-translated English label mentions "fruit gum."<br /><br />I have Prime, and this is an add-on item, so I probably wouldn't buy them normally unless they were a couple bucks cheaper than the current $4. (As that seems to defeat the point of add-on items...a random German site I found has them at 1.49 euro.) But if you need to get to $25 for Super Saver, this is a decent add-on item to snack on.

review/text: We love Tillamook's old fashioned silver dollar jerky and this is just as good, in fact, my wife actually prefers this to the old fashioned.  I'm split-I love both just the same.  We love everything about Tillamook products, and have visited their creamery/factory in Oregon a few times.  It's worth the trip from Minnesota, just to get their ice cream cones.  We haven't found any Tillamook jerky in retail stores out here, so we will be ordering more.

review/text: Found these at a local 7-11 and fell in love with them immediately. Not quite to consistency of your standard jerky but there is just something about these that make them absolutely delicious. They came very fresh and easy to eat, not dry and chewy. They are just peppered enough and somewhat with a sweet taste as well. I am so glad I was able to find these at Amazon instead of having to go and take a trip to 7-11. I think once you get used to the consistency and not compare it to other jerkys you'll find these to be a tasty treat as well.

You do get a lot but its not exactly a good value given you are choking it down.<br /><br />I got Jack Link's beef jerky for the crew and they all gobbled it down (they ate the stuff starting at 10 AM...animals).  Their feedback was that jack links actually was a piece of meat versus whatever the heck Tillamook was made of.

review/text: I have purchased these beans before when they were in the $2.00 a package range.  They are tasty athough my Mexican friends say they are not as good as Mom's. At almost $5.00 a package with a modest $7.00 for shipping, thats only $1.00 for each ounce, brings the beans to a total price $12.00 for just 7 oz.  A man would be a fool to pass up this deal.  Pound for pound it would be cheaper to fly Mamacita in from Mexico so you could experience the real deal.  Sorry no sale at these prices.

The Mexicali Rose is just too expensive to even consider, even though the taste is great. It's the next best thing to home cooked, BETTER than home cooked if you're a gringo.

review/summary: Very tiny amount excessively priced!
review/text: Don't be fooled by the image for this item, which (at least on my browser) looks like it might be about 5 or 6 ounces. The box is about 2"x1"x1" and the actual amount is about half an ounce! For the price charged plus shipping this is the most expensive spice in my spice rack. Or NOT in my spice rack any longer, not because I used it up in one go (although that would have been very easy) but because I literally can no longer find it among my spice jars and baskets and suspect it was accidentally thrown away. (Seriously, you would not even have heard it fall, it was sample size, that tiny and light.) To their credit, the sellers must have a bit of conscience because they threw another (equally tiny) box of all-purpose seasoning into the package. I have managed to try this and it is a pretty good product. It might have been an inducement for me to go back to them had the Vindaloo amount been more generous. Now, it is just a reminder of my disappointment--which was the only thing huge about this order.

review/summary: Got a bad batch
review/text: I'm a huge fan of the Bumble Bars, and while they are super expensive, I eat them as a breakfast every morning while on the Tim Ferris eating plan, which avoids all carbs and processed foods.  They are filling enough and healthy, and usually pretty darn tasty.  I've always ordered straight from the company, but this last batch I picked up on Amazon, and they must have been old or sitting in a hot warehouse or something, because the texture was all off.  Normally they are a bar, but these ones crumbled into a dozen pieces, making it impossible to eat in the car.  And since they are made of seeds, if they crumble too much you can't even pick them up since the crumbles are the size of sesame seeds.  I felt like I wasted my money ordering from Amazon and definitely won't again.  But I will be ordering more through the company, since they are a delicious breakfast alternative and I've never had issues with the texture coming straight from Bumble Bar.

review/summary: Pleasant Experience
review/text: This tea is something I look forward to every day. I have enjoyed tea for some time, but it was not until this tea that I really took it seriously. It is now an experience that I really enjoy.<br /><br />While some teas require me to be in a certain mood, this tea is just plain pleasant. I drink it straight with a drop or two of honey. It is already naturally sweet, but it does not have a sugar taste.<br /><br />Fruity is an overstatement, as this tea does not really have any citric flavor or tartness. The fruitiness is really an aroma that you can enjoy as you open your container to brew a cup.<br /><br />I personally am a novice to tea drinking, but I brew this tea in my ~20oz tetsubin for almost 5 minutes first, then I pour out a big stein of tea, and refill my tetsubin and brew again. The second brew is even better tasting.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

review/text: I tried Congo Bongo in my friend's house, and absolutely love it. But since I prefer green tea, I've ordered Fiji. It has great taste, hope the quality of the tea also good. Love Fiji, and going to try some other flavor from SerendipiTea.

review/summary: Exactly like skyline-with one modification
review/text: I LOOOOOOVE Skyline Chili.  There are none where I live so anytime we pass through somewhere with a Skyline we stop by.  We were introduced to these packets by a friend who said they tasted exactly like the real thing.  His only suggestion was to add 1/4 cup of hersheys chocolate syrup (the kind you use to make chocolate milk) about 30 minutes into the cooking process.  I thought he was insane.  He said that's the "secret ingredient".  Sure, whatever.  We followed his advice though and I have to tell you this stuff turned out PERFECT.  I would definitely recommend it!!

review/summary: This is good!
review/text: The first time I had this product was about three weeks ago at my sister's house.  She and her family were introduced to it a few years ago and have had difficulty finding the envelopes of special seasonings. Luckily she found these and gave one to me! It is not traditional southern chili but a specialty that Ohioan's are eating every day with variations. Save yourself the trouble of finding all the ingredients and working out the best way for your family and just get these envelopes, use the directions and go for it. Wonderful for hot dogs with chili. Wonderful over spaghetti with cheese and fresh chopped onions. Wonderful with chopped cooked hotdogs. Wonderful with a drained and rinsed can of light red or dark red kidney beans. Wonderful with all of the above and oyster crackers on the side. There is no way everyone wont love this dish.<br /><br />Sincerely!

review/text: Our neighbor brought a packet of this stuff back with him as a gift for us.  3 years later I am still hooked.  We don't eat beef, so we substitute it with chicken and actually make it a more of a crockpot style type of chili and we love it (and so does everyone we have served it to).  Great taste.  I have never been to cincinnati so have nothing to compare it with, but I really like the flavor of this.

It has a Geek influence with hints of cinnamon and spices.  But it is hearty and delicious for any occasion.

review/summary: Cincinnati Cili Mix
review/text: We used to get this chili mix in Sacramento when my husband worked there and we lived in LA.  I would visit him on the weekends and make this chili for him.  It was so easy and delicious.  He is from Cleveland so it was a taste of home for him.  We had not been able to find it in LA so I was delighted when I found I could order it through Amazon.  We have already had it at our family night dinner once and we are having it again tonight!  It was a huge hit! I had to re-order the 12 pack to share with family members.

review/text: As a former Cincinnatian, short a special trip to Cincinnati, this is a wonderful alternative. I used it when I lived in Cincy ... and now in CA.  I use it here for theme dinners (both the spaghetti and a chili dog) with friends ... always a hit.  I suggest adding less water initially or reducing the amount of water via extended simmering.  The former maybe a better approach so less gas or electricity is used.

We love it in our family, and as long as it is on sale here we will be buying it.
