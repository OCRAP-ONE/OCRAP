review/summary: Great Jerky
review/text: When I ordered I did not know what Western Cut was so it was surprised how thin they cut the meat.  The pack had about a year until the sell by date, which seemed like plenty of time to eat the jerky.  However, I would only need 24 hours as the jerky got better with every bite.<br /><br />A+.  I could not recommend this product any higher.  Lightning speed delivery service.  I've tried country cut HoneyPepper as well as the Teriyaki and they also were just fantastic.  The country cut is much softer than the western cut.  The western cut requires some good chompers to chew.<br /><br />The only draw back would be if you did not have tooth picks or dental floss available after eating the western cut.

review/summary: YUMMY PASTA!  A gem in the supermarket
review/text: This entree/snack is so delectable.  The pasta is soft; the sauce is scrumptious .  . . make sure when you get it that you keep the bowl as upright as possible; it's hard to get the powder back in.  To make this pasta VERY delectable, mix obsessively, wait for the water to steam before filling the bowl, and make sure it doesn't overboil in the microwave.  This melts in your mouth.  I can't begin to say how good this is.  If you like pasta and sauce in restaurants, you'll LOVE this.  If you're someone that simply does not consume meat, this is a great dish!  Warning for those to whom it matters:  This dish can have a lingering smell for over 10 minutes.  Cover with a paper towel to somewhat muffle the smell when transporting from kitchen to eating area.  It smells GREAT, though ;)

review/text: I keep buying this product, so I must like it. It is important to find the correct cooking time with your own microwave oven. The suggested time on the package ranges between 4 - 5 1/2 minutes. After experimenting, I found that 4 1/2 minutes works best with my oven. After cooking the pasta in its plastic bowl, plop it into a ceramic bowl to eat. It's better.

review/summary: easy inexpensive snack
review/text: Betty Crocker's Pasta Alfredo style Bowl Appetit! is a quickly-prepared, tasty, nicely textured and inexpensive snack, even alone by itself. It's even better with a chunk of cheese melted into it and a salad or a few veggies on the side. The package claims "No Preservatives or Artificial Flavors," so I'll trust that info. However, for most contemporary tastes it may be a tad salty. On the other hand, though I'm not writing a separate review, the Herb Chicken Vegetable Rice does not make it at all, but has a not very pleasing texture and a totally yuck, salty, artificial flavor. You win some and you lose a lot, but I'd definitely advise stocking up on a supply of Pasta Alfredo.

Then I couldn't find them anywhere in my area.  I decided to look at Amazon.com.  I ordered a case for his birthday and he was thrilled.  These are definitely for people who like the fast food taste (I don't think they are much like homemade), but my kids just love them!

review/summary: Let the buyer beware. this product contains High fructose corn syrup AND Splenda and no juice
review/text: All Natural Flavor/no artificial color, says the bold letters on the front of the package.<br />When you read the nutrition label you see there are only 8 grams of sugar compare to the nearly 16 grams in comparable drinks.<br />No where on the package does it tell you it has artificial sweetner as well as High Fructose Corn Syrup, neither of which is exactly natural, though technically not a flavor.<br />Since neither the outside box or the inside package tells you the product has Splenda (the only place you see it is in the ingredients list along with water, citric acid, natural flavor (not sure where this comes from)and HFCS. Absolutely no nutrient value)<br />The advertisement says it is "roaring with fruity flavor" and advertises it as a wholesome drink, but to be honest, this stuff is like drinking sugar with a very artificial cherry flavor going on. It basically tastes like an overly sweet cherry sucker was melted into a little bit of water and put in a pouch. The first swig made me recoil. It is way too sweet and the only "wholesome" ingredient in it is water!<br />To their favor they do advertise it as a water flavored beverage, but of course the cherry on the package makes you think it has real cherry flavor and it doesn't. It may have natural flavoring, but I've never tasted a natural cherry like that.<br />If you want a really wholesome beverage stick to water and swish a cherry lollipop in it if you want to add some flavoring. You will cme out better than Roarin' Waters which is a Roarin' Rip Off and borders closely on false advertising. If they placed bold writing on the front that said it contained Splenda... an artificial sweetner, not a natural one, I would never have purchased it and they would have never had to deal with this negative review.<br />Better to be honest with people and if you are making an artificially flavored "wholesome" flavored water, do us a favor and leave out the HFCS and use Stevia and real cherry flavor. Then you might have a winner on your hands that parents would love to buy and kids would like to drink. Don't be fake with people to sell a product that is disguised as good for you when it obviously isn't!<br /><br />In short, the product does not taste like natural cherries, is overly sweet, does not satisfy thirst, leaves a bad taste in your mouth that makes you want to drink some water to get rid of the sweet, cherry sucker flavor, and has not nutrient value. The most healthy ingredient in this pouch is the water. Do not be fooled by the all natural flavor, no color added description. This is not a healthy beverage and not wholesome. Convenient yes, but not a good choice for health conscious parents and their children.

review/text: Pretty tasty for a dry uncooked pasta with powdered cheese sauce.  Add water, and blast away in the microwave for 4-6 minutes.<br /><br />The sauce thickens while cooking and more as it cools. Keep an eye on it when first zapping, as microwaves vary.  My hi-powered microwave had everything ready in 3 1/2 minutes. Microwave timing will vary.<br /><br />But, please don't let it sit cooling too long, the pasta will start to stick together.<br /><br />Not homemade, but, in a pinch, it will shut up the stomach grumbling and tasty too.

review/summary: Great for Work
review/text: I've been searching most of my adult life for a good meal I can buy a dozen of and keep in my desk at work.  Bowl Appetit meals fit my needs perfectly.<br /><br />I have had bad experiences with dehydrated food and powders in the past, and had very low expectations when I picked these up.  I thought the three-cheese rotini might be bearable, and I picked up a few other flavors out of morbid curiosity.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The rotini rivaled that of one of my favorite restaurants, and the other flavors were just as well done.  The technology has come a long way, and they did an excellent job of selecting ingredients that work well with the concept.  If someone had served it to me, I wouldn't believe them when they said it was rehydrated in a microwave.<br /><br />The texture of the pasta in this dish and the rice in others is just right, and the flavors are not muddled or soggy like you get with wet-packed meals.  There is a large enough variety that I can eat them almost every workday without growing tired of it.

At a $1.40 per bowl, it's a solid serving at a good price for the busy person.

review/summary: GREAT product, not a great price!
review/text: I LOVE these!  I have been eating them for lunch everyday for most of the last 5 years, and still love the taste.  Best mac and cheese I have ever had!  And you can find them for great prices, but Amazon's current price ($16.80/12 which is $1.40/each) is not so great.  I just bought them at Target for .89 each, and Rainbow and Cub both have them for $1.25 each.  I was looking to see if I could find a good deal on buying bulk for 2 reasons- 1. To save money and 2. To have a case and not have to buy them individually for the amount I go through.<br />I work downtown and any restaurant I could want is within a couple blocks... the reason I make these and don't go out to eat is to save money and keep lunch as cheap as possible (I don't want to spend $50/week on lunch when I can have something I love for only $5/week).  So I guess I will stick with buying it individually in the stores, because I'm not paying that much for something that is cheaper at stores I will already be in anyways.

review/summary: Not very cheese flavored
review/text: Well, I guessed that a product marketed as being "three-cheese" flavored would taste reasonably cheese-like.  If I'd been given this in a blind taste-test, I'm unsure I would have even identified it as supposing to be a cheese-flavored product.  It's really, really bland.<br /><br />There's nothing inherently wrong with "bland" if that's what you are after.  Bland obviously is want one wants for a base for other things, for example.  But the marketing on this product seems deceptive to me.  It is sold as a "meal in a bowl" (suggesting it's not just a base, but a fully seasoned dish).  I specifically ordered it because I was looking for a quick way to make some basic cheesy pasta, and the product (and reviews) suggest that this is meant to be a cheese flavored item.  If it was marketed as "pasta in a mild, light sauce with a hint of cheese flavor", then I wouldn't have ordered it, because that wasn't what I was looking for.  I can see that someone might be looking for something like that; but in any event, that's not the implication from the packaging.<br /><br />I don't like dissing this product because it sounds like a number of people find it convenient, like the flavor, and want to be able to keep ordering it.  So I would say, as long as you understand that this a very gently flavored item, of predictably low quality pasta, and that will suit your purposes, great.  I appreciate honest reviews that others leave of their opinions, since it helps me figure out what I might like that I haven't tried yet.  We all have different tastes and needs for products, so I hope this review helps those who were thinking along the lines that I was when ordering this.

review/summary: Yuck.
review/text: I don't mind most quick microwave meals. Aside from the price (I feel that it is affordable) this meal is terrible. It starts off as a bowl with powder flavoring and hard noodles. You peel back the lid and add hot water to the powder and hard noodles. After stirring the product, you are suppose to microwave it for 5 minutes.<br />Easy peasy and perfect for busy working moms.<br />The problem was with the flavor "powder". It is a birck. No amount of stirring, stabbing or soaking loosens it and so it turned into a chewy salty mass of gross. I will stick with my cup of noodles instead.<br />What a shame.

review/text: I have been the one selecting bbq sauce when shopping since I was 12 and I have been a fan of few. Tony Roma's Bold and Spicy is hands down my absolute favorite! The very first time I chose it I warned my girlfriend of how spicy it is as she sat down to eat dinner, I tasted it before applying. When I finally made it to the dinner table I couldn't help but notice that her and my daughter who do not like spicy very often were completely silent and covered cheek to cheek in bbq sauce. I smiled, grabbed my rib and bit into the most tastiest and spicy rib that I have ever grilled. I grow up in San Diego, CA and bbq's are a way of life there. I now live in Oregon and grill every time the sun has shined and the evening is dry. Tony Roma's Bold and Spicy truly is the best store bought sauce!

I have tossed in jalapenos, frozen corn, mushrooms, broccoli, cheese or whatever else you just happen to have around and it always comes out great.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the little chunks of dried potato, they never quite reconstitute into a real potato texture.  I frequently just sift them out and dice a potato or two and toss those in instead, they cook soft in the 15 minutes it takes for the soup to cook and no one would ever know it came powdered in a bag.

review/text: This is the most delicious, homemade tasting soup I have ever had.  My daughter is literally licking her bowl.  It is quite spicy, which I assume is from the pepper you can clearly see throughout.  The potato pieces make it quite hearty.  Lastly, one pouch makes a ton of soup:  1/2 gallon!  Great as a meal or in a smaller crock as an appetizer.  I am trying this company's other varieties now and cannot wait.  Cannot say enough about this product!

Sometimes it can be found locally - and sometimes not (all sold out?) and that's the reason we order a case at a time.

If you are in a hurry use 2 packages of mix 'I use 1/2 the water and make up the rest with stock and the clam juice' a 51 oz can of Snow clams 'I only use half the clam juice the other half I save'. Add celery, carrots, butter, 1-15 oz can of diced tomatoes and spices of your choice bring to a boil simmer for 20 minutes or until it thickens a little. I know that I am cheating on the base but it is very good! Beer / wine, crusty bread,  hot sauce and you are ready!

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: This soup is surprisingly good for a mix.  It's convenient...easy to make...and very affordable.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of all the seasoning - especially the salt.  While it tastes good, it would be nice to have a little less salt - enabling people to add it if they'd like to do so...but for those who don't, they would be eating a lower sodium version.  However, this soup isn't advertised as being "blood pressure-friendly", and the sodium content is right on the label, so I digress.  :)<br /><br />All in all, it's a very good mix that I will purchase again.  And the convenience of it is exceptional.

review/summary: NOT real potato soup; too many ingredients.
review/text: I love potato soup and favored canned potato soup.  Then my wife discovered this product and we tried it.  First, it's spicier than it needs be, if at all.  Second, it's not a creamy product because there are too many small potato pieces that never cook to a softer texture.  Third, looking at the ingredients list one can see that a potato taste is the end result of all of those ingredients.  Almost every product is far from what is claimed, it's something we gotta live with.<br /><br />However, we came up with a method for making better-tasting potato soup than just following their simple direction of only adding water.  What you should do first before beginning cooking is to sift the envelope mixture so that you wind up with just powder.  Then process the potato pieces into a powder and mix the 2 powders.  This will produce a creamy soup.  But if you just cook the sifted powder the soup will be creamier.  You can also cook the envelope contents without sifting and when the soup is cooked, use an immersion blender to further cream it up.  You can also sift the cooked soup and keep the cooked potato pieces for future use.  We use them when we bake potatoes and mash them.  We also mash the cooked potato pieces and mix them with the mashed potatoes which will result in slightly spicy mashed potatoes.

review/summary: Great Immune Booster, Yummy and Unusual Tasting Tea
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Echinacea Immune Support herbal tea from Yogi Tea is for the natural boosting of the immune system. It's an all natural tea made from organic peppermint leaf, organic ;lemon grass, organic Echinacea root (angustifolia, purprea, pallida), organic licorice root, organic cinnamon bark, organic spearmint leaf, organic fennel seed, organic lemon flavor, Echinacea purpurea root extract (phenols 12%), organic cardamom seed, organic rose hips, organic ginger root, organic burdock root, stevia leaf, organic mullein leaf, organic clove bud, astragalus root extract, organic black pepper, European elder berry extract (30% anthocyanins), natural cinnamon oil, natural cardamom oil, natural ginger oil. Whew! Lots of good ingredients!<br /><br />The taste is unusual and hard to define, probably because there are so many interesting ingredients. It is slightly tonic-y but very pleasant. I love all the things that these herbs are purported to do!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with Echinacea Immune Support and with Yogi Teas in general. Echinacea Immune Support comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Echinacea Immune Support tea is a superior blend of several species of Organic Echinacea Root (Echinacea angustifolia, purpurea, pallida) designed to boost your immune system. Each tea bag is made with organic Echinacea Root and Echinacea Root extract, containing the equivalent of 1,400 mg of Echinacea. Health practitioners for centuries have respected the powers of Echinacea, an herb that supports the body's natural defense system by stimulating production of immune system proteins, interferons, that regulate normal immune response. Furthermore, Echinacea supplies certain naturally-occurring plant compounds known as caffeic acid derivatives, including cichoric acid, alkylamides and polysaccharides. These work together to stimulate the body's immune system. The blend is complemented with Astragalus, a stamina-enhancing tonic that also boosts long-term immune function, and European Elder Berry, which is immune-enhancing and supports respiratory function. To support sinus function and promote clear breathing passages, Organic Peppermint and Organic Lemon Grass are included.* Finally, Organic Cinnamon , Organic Fennel, Organic Spearmint, and Organic Rose Hips add a wonderful fragrant essence to this delicious herbal supplement."<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. The box says, "When your immune system seems a bit down, drink 2 to 3 cups per day. For increased immune stimulation, drink 4 to 5 cups per day."<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Excellent Peanuts!
review/text: Shopping in warehouse stores lends itself to buying a lot of impulse items. Well here's one quite good such item. I was going down the snack isles of my local Costco and found a couple huge displays of roasted peanuts, one salted in the shell and one not. Hmmmmm.  A five-pound bag of peanuts? That's much more than I need! But I love salted-in-the-shell peanuts. But, how will I ever finish five pounds of them? Oh, well,  we'll figure it out. Into the cart they went.<br /><br />The peanuts are quite good. Excellent, in fact. The roast is just right. They are salted, but very lightly. I actually prefer a little saltier, but I know this lighter flavoring is better for my health. In fact, the sodium to potassium ratio is close to equal, a rare instance in a salted snack product. I'd say, the peanuts are just excellent, much better than the brands I'm used to buying in smaller packets. Plus, they're real nice and fresh. The trick might be keeping them fresh as I work my way down to the bottom of this huge bag. But, no mistaking, they're excellent peanuts.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

To let him know we were still thinking of him, I used Amazon Prime to send him things and the most popular gift was this package of Hoody's peanuts.  My son didn't actually get many - the lead guide "snagged" them and shared them in his office (one of the rites of passage, I suppose) - but all the guides loved them and they didn't last long.  Should work great for a college surprise, too.<br /><br />Oh, yeah - good peanut taste, nice roasting brings out the flavor and crunch, and just the right amount of salt.

review/text: Prompt shipment; plants look in good shape and came with care instructions, and were fairly priced --- a good purchase!  The vendor was prompt and courteous as well.  The plants are small, but I'm sure this is the going rate for carnivorous plants this size, as I shopped around first.  This place got good reviews and so I'm happy to report that I have the same review!

review/summary: Great plants and a great buy
review/text: I just recently decided to purchase this set of plants after doing tons of research online.<br />I have not had much experience with growing plants in general, but have always been interested in carnivorus plants.<br />Although the flytraps that I previously bought at Home Depot and Walmart which were inside little terarium domes died very fast.<br /><br />With that being said about my current "skill" level.<br />I found these plants were sent very fast and arrived in great condition in plastic zip lock baggies with<br />some moss and wet gauze wrapped around the roots . As I already expected<br />most of the traps on the Venus flytrap arrived closed and the sundew was missing its "dew". Even so<br />the plants looked healthy. After one just one day most of the traps opened and the sundew's "dew" started forming.<br /><br />So far it seems very easy to take care of these carnivorous plants. I just am following the provided<br />directions and using the included mesh pots and moss. These plants might actually have some hope of<br />surviving now. If not it would likely be my fault.<br /><br />Thinking of buying some more now since these are such cool plants and they seem to have awakened my inner child.<br />Might post some pictures later.

Yeah you, the big pink meatsack, get rid of that box and get to making all that moss wet again.<br /><br />What are you doing standing there?!

I'll buy some carnivorous plants and just stick 'em in a pot of dirt and give them a good drink of this tasty tap water."<br />*smack*<br />You don't know me punk, and its a good thing that the Master knew you'd be one of our mindless minions and included a handy sheet of instructions.  Follow them carefully, please.  My life depends upon it, and consequently so does yours.  My associates and I arrived in good health, and I'm sure you were pleasantly surprised at our numbers.  Follow the Master's instructions.  Prepare yourself properly as instructed by his first communications.  Give us the purest of water and plenty of light.  We'll take care of the bugs.  And if you treat us very well, we might even repay the favor and take care of the neighbor's yippie dog, too.  But all in due time, Minion.  I'm thirsty.

review/summary: Fast Shipping! Packaged plants arrived with care!
review/text: I ordered these plants for an 8 year old's birthday gift with Amazon Prime...They arrived here before the other packages I ordered through Amazon! The boxed is carefully packaged as the small plants are quite fragile. The packaging material is also the potting mix that you will use so make sure when you open it, you have a place to put it or it tends to get everywhere. The plants look quite healthy-as they are packaged into baggies with some moisture, and wrapped roots. The venus fly trap and pitcher plant were together and included live ants for a snack across the long journey-my kids were thrilled with that one! It also includes directions-all three plants require similar care- and small pots to plant with.<br /><br />Hopefully, we can do these little plants a solid and keep them alive- They need lots of moisture(distilled H20) and LOTS of sunlight--so we will do our best!

I most certainly would recommand buying from here and i plan to again ONE THING THOUGH if your new to carnivrious plants they need distilled water which is like 88 cents a gallon at the store just buy some before so you dont have to wait to plant them

All of them were very healthy.<br />The seller went out of his way to ensure I received detailed care instruction for each of them, both in the packaging and online.<br />I was impressed. Would definitely buy more plants from him in the future.<br /><br />My only disappointment was that the Venice Fly Trap didn't help catch the tiny fruit flies I was wanting to get rid of...they require a regular size fly to land on them as a fruit fly doesn't weight enough to trigger their closing behavior.

review/summary: So cool! My dorm room "pet"
review/text: So instead of fish for a dorm room pet (too much work - constant feeding, cleaning out bowl, etc), I decided to get these fantastic carnivorous plants! What a great purchase. First, you can tell when you open the package how much the seller really cares about his plants and how serious he is about his business. The plants are carefully packaged in ziploc baggies, their roots are covered in a damp paper towel, and they are placed in the box which is full of dried moss and very detailed instructions. I do not have a lot of experience with carnivorous plants, let alone the grass that grows on my lawn, but the instructions are clear cut and setting the plants up took only 5-10 minutes. There happened to be a tiny little ant that was hiding in a plant root, and when I was unwrapping the paper towel he crawled up the plant. He made his way into the mouth of the venus fly trap, but it didn't close. So hopefully, it will be hungry soon and I'll get to see the plants in action. I love these things, they are too cool! I can't wait to put them in my dorm when I move in.

review/text: I'm new to the carnivorous plant world.  I stumbled upon it by accident in the local super market (long story).  I started reading and learning about these amazing plants and was hooked.  I placed my order and within a day or two received an email from the seller telling me to be on the lookout for my plants and what I should have on hand before they arrived (distilled water).<br />The instructions that came with my plants were clear and concise.<br />The plants themselves were in what I would consider excellent condition.  They definitely didn't look like they'd been shipped across the U.S.<br />I quickly potted them up into the enclosed pots and set them in their water dish.<br />They look just fine.<br />By the way, I had ordered a Venus Flytrap from another seller at the same time.  It arrived in good condition as well but no instructions or anything.<br />I emailed this seller with a question and had an answer within hours.<br />I would highly recommend this seller to anyone, especially newbees!

review/text: I have never had a carnivorous plant before, not even a venus fly trap.  The title of the product does not reflect the completeness of what you receive.  It contains the plants, the fibrous soil, netted pots, and care instructions.  You will need your own reservoir (bowl) for the plants, but that is it.  The order also included instructions on how to pot and care for each plant, a must have for any beginner.<br /><br />Only had them a few days, but they arrived very healthy and the seller contacted me with the expected delivery date to make sure the plants were not left on my doorstep in weather that was too hot and/or humid.<br /><br />Finally, the price-point was competitive.  This was a must for me since I did not want to commit a huge investment and am not an avid gardener.<br /><br />Very happy with my little meat eating plants.

review/text: Aside from the product being as described, and arriving safely and quickly, Joel's went of their way to fix my screw up. I mistakenly put the wrong shipping address on my order. When I got the notice alerting me that the shipment would be sent out that day (nice touch when dealing with delicate contents), I just then realized my error. I emailed, explained the situation, and even though they had already labeled my shipment and were headed to the post office, they pulled my order, re-labled the box, and shipped the items later that day. Now that may not sound like a big deal, but I seriously doubt many sellers would bother to take the time to fix a customer's mistake for a product that probably doesn't have a large profit margin.

review/text: If you want to buy carnivorous plants, then I highly recommend buying them from Joel's! I chose Joel's based on previous customer ratings, & I am happy to say that they were right.<br /><br />I ordered my plants on a Thursday & they arrived (in IL from CA) in 2 days. They arrived in wonderful condition with 3 containers, plenty of moss, & great instructions. Their roots were wrapped in wet moss, & they were placed in ziplock bags. I planted them in their containers immediately & have had them for about 2 weeks. They are healthy, happy, & beautiful. I posted some photos.<br /><br />Customer service was also impressive. The seller sent a pre-delivery email letting me know that my plants were on the way & how to care for them when they arrived. Then, the seller sent a post-delivery email asking how the plants were doing & if I had any questions/concerns.  This seller wants the plants to thrive & does everything possible to make sure that happens.<br /><br />I agree with Lisa from Texas... This seller loves what he does. You will not be disappointed! Overall, Joel's surpassed my expectations, and I will definitely buy from Joel's again!

review/summary: Healthy Happy and Hungry - Good Plants!!!!
review/text: My group arrived on Saturday June 2 via USPS.  They were packed very well.  No injuries to report.  Each plant was placed in it's own zippy bag and its roots were wrapped in spagnum moss.  Everything was moist as it should be.<br /><br />I immediately got everything set up, wet down with distilled water, and put in their respective baskets.  I then placed them in a low ceramic dish (I posted pics of this)and they have been happy ever since.<br /><br />I have been putting them outside for a while during the day.  Both the sundew and the venus flytrap love it, but I don't think the butterwort is as pleased with direct sun.  He seems to tilt slightly and that's when I bring them in.<br /><br />So far the butterwort wins on bug catching.  He's got three, the other two get zero.  However they are all still babies so maybe they aren't as attractive yet?<br /><br />I am delighted with my plants.  They are a great addition to my garden window and give it a nice variety.<br /><br />Buy from this vendor.  He loves what he does.  It shows in his plants.

review/summary: Great Buy!
review/text: I must say I was surprised you could buy bareroot plants on amazon, but my stepdad really has an interest for carnivous plants so I was glad I could get them at such a great price. Not only were the plants in great shape upon arrival, but I got a great email from the seller making sure everything with them was okay and if I had any questions to not hesitate at all. Fast shipping, great price and helpful seller!

review/summary: Nice Plants
review/text: Plants arrived quickly, actually got 2 venus fly traps! They were in good shape, although smaller than I was expecting (3" plants are small). I got them potted right away and they seem to be doing well so far.

review/text: These were shipped GREAT to me. They all arrived healthy and once I put them in the sun, they began to grow like crazy. I have had them for about 2-3 weeks now and they are very healthy, happy plants. The soil and directions were included as well.

review/summary: Exciting purchase for my classroom
review/text: A few days ago I placed an order with Joel for three plants.  They arrived quickly and carefully packaged.  This purchase is for the science center in my first grade classroom.  I also purchased books about the plants. Based on student response, this is going to be a very popular part of our classroom. I look forward to adding to our collection of amazing plants.

review/summary: My favorite chocolate around
review/text: The freeze-dried orange peels in this bar are similar in texture to puffed rice cereal.  They're delicious in the chocolate and if you're a fiend for chocolate & orange together the way I am, you will adore this chocolate bar.
