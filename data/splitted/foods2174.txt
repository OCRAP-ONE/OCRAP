review/summary: Neat container horrible hot chocolate
review/text: First off, each can only makes two 6oz servings.  So this is a rather expensive cup of hot chocolate.  The flavor, at least to me, is terrible, it is mostly sugar and red dye.  It is a novel idea that might appeal to small kids but adults will find it sickeningly sweet. As mentioned above, it is rather expensive for what it is.  Only thing I like about this are the coffin shaped cans.

review/summary: Japones Chile - 1 Lb Bag / Box Each
review/text: I bought this one pound bag of Japones Chile thinking that it was a great value. I usually mix this chilie and Pequin to get a  well balance red hot salsa. Lately, I haven't been able to buy Pequin in my area so I tried just making a salsa with the Japones. The seller does everything possible to make sure that the best quality looking product is sent out I'm sure but these peppers were not hot at all. I know that Japones and Chili Arbol have about the same heat and flavor but my sister brought over a little salsa that she made using Chili Arbol that she had bought for a pound [for the same price as I bought these] and it was so good and very hot. Just goes to show that you can sometimes get better deals locally.<br />If it was all that I had I might still buy these peppers, the quality seems very good, it's just some batches of peppers aren't hot and this was one of those batches. That's why I told my sister she got the best deal.

review/text: I recently purchased this spice blend at our local farmers market.  I rubbed olive oil and a small amount of the blend all over a piece of back strap of white tail deer. I lightly grilled this piece of meat, medium rare and served it with grilled veggies.  I would recommend this product.  I tend not to stray away from current seasoning which is olive oil, herbs des provinces, fresh garlic, salt and pepper.  But this was a burst of flavor and nice change.  Thanks!

review/text: Ships from and sold by Baker's Box, Inc...<br />It seems the important point to this merchant is profit and not quality. First clue besides "no order packing slip" was the opaque plastic bag in which both paper bags of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HTSJN6">Arrowhead Mills Organic Gluten Free Pancake & Waffle Mix (2x26oz)</a> were stuffed. Neither product bag has an expiration date, which was always included on other bags of Arrowhead Mills Organic Gluten Free Pancake Mix that I've purchased from other merchants and stores. When I lifted the first bag from the  opaque plastic, pancake mix billowed out. The second bag showed the same adulteration. These bags may have been last on the shelf or even part of someone's anger management program. I am not impressed with Baker's Box. This is being posted here to warn potential customers. Seriously, check out other merchants.

review/text: My dogs love these treats. The bite size makes it perfect for use as a reward for obedience training. The fact that it does not crumble easily makes it easier to just throw a handful in your pocket to go for a walk. Most importantly, the ingredients are natural and human grade. The wheat flour used in it is much better than corn.<br /><br />I've read about these treats a few months ago but could not find a local retailer that sold them. Amazon, at the time, did not sell it either. Other online retailers were charging $5-$6 for shipping, which is as much as the 8oz. bag itself. Amazon now sells this item and their price combined with the free shipping makes this a very good deal.

review/summary: Great for chili con queso
review/text: I always buy the original Rotel but the Chunky is the same thing but... chunkier. Go figure. Rotel is popular in Texas for making chili con queso (melted cheese dip, sometimes with meat, most of the time without meat, eaten with tortilla chips). I thought I'd share the recipe for everyone outside of Texas. It may not sound authentic but once you taste it you won't care. People gobble this stuff up at parties. Go easy on the Rotel at first or it'll be too spicy-hot. Most people serve the chili con queso in a crock pot.<br /><br />This makes a LOT of chili con queso, plenty for a party.<br /><br />1 pound extra lean ground beef<br />1 pound breakfast sausage (such as Owen's original country sausage)<br />1-2 cans original Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilis (add gradually, to taste)<br />2 lbs regular Velveeta, cut in chunks<br />tortilla chips (to eat it with)<br /><br />Brown the ground beef and the sausage over medium-high heat in a saucepan and then drain off the fat. Turn the heat down, add the Velveeta in chunks and about half of a can of Rotel. When the cheese has melted, stir it up and taste it and see if you want more Rotel. Keep adding Rotel until it's as hot and spicy as you like it. If you like it mild you won't need to add much. The chili con queso is ready when all of the cheese has melted. One thing to remember with this recipe:  whatever you do, do not allow the cheese to brown.

review/summary: Dog went from flabby to fit
review/text: My dog had a good result with this food, but it wasn't what I expected. My veterinarian wanted my dog to lose weight because my dog had no indentation at his waist or under his belly.  I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFV4">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag</a>, but his physique never improved and his weight never went down. For both weight-loss foods, I used a calorie-determination formula instead of the feeding guides. For both foods, the feeding guides on the bags recommended a lot more food than the formula (see formula at end of review.)<br /><br />Many dogs will not drink enough to process a very high protein dog food like Premium Edge (49% protein) even when fresh water is offerred. I suspect dogs may limit their drinking to accommodate a potty schedule.  At  my dog's 2 daily feedings, I add  enough warm water to just cover his kibble. (When I first added the water, my dog had accidents because I feed him after his morning exercise walk.  I had to change his feeding to 30 minutes before his walk.)  I let the food it soak on the counter for 2 minutes, and then I stir in 2 heaping table-spoons of low-sodium canned green beans (10 cals.)  My dog eats the food with gusto and seems to feel full after he eats. He begs less and is happy with small treats. On the other weight-loss food, he was acting full at first but, after a few weeks, he began begging for food right after he ate, even with the water and green beans.<br /><br />I also should say that I walked my dog about a mile per day on both weight-loss foods.<br /><br />When the vet saw my dog 6 weeks after switching to Premium Edge, I though he was going to tell me to go back to my dog's old food because, on my scale at home, he gained 3 pounds.  I was so frustrated.  To my surprise, the vet told me that my dog was in excellent condition.  The weight gain was due to higher muscle mass! His waist and belly were not flabby at all anymore. I guess the high-protein levels in this food are giving my dog what he needs to grow muscle, and the increase in muscle mass enables him to burn the fat more efficiently. He may have been so hungry on the other food because he needed more protein. I am so happy with the results that I am continuing to feed my dog the same food at the same amount indefinitely. He is still very satisfied with his food.<br /><br />If you are not willing to exerise your dog every day, I don't know if you will get this result, but I think it is a fabulous food if you are committed to walking your dog a long way each day, rain or shine.  It is an economical yet high-quality food.<br /><br />At 49%, this is the highest-protein in a dry dog food I have ever seen. Not even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XGDG">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food, Salmon Recipe, 24-Pound Bag</a>, which is grain-free,  comes close to this food in protein.  To get this much protein, I ordinarily would have to feed wet food.  There was no way I could afford wet food for my dog--it would cost $120 per month to feed my dog a quality, high-protein wet food. For a low-quality (and lower protein) wet food, it would cost $45/month, whereas Premium Edge dry food costs me about $25/month.<br /><br />In addition, this food is high in fibre, grain-free, low fat, and contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, probiotics, and chelated minerals (which are more bio-available than minerals that are not "chelated" to protein.) At 347 calories per cup, it is it is as low in calories as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFV4">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag</a>, but Premium Edge has more than twice the protein and no calories from grains.<br /><br />As with every dog food label I have ever read, the feeding guide on Premium Edge over-feeds the dog.  If I followed the instructions on the Premium Edge bag, I would be feeding 2 1/4 cups per day. According to Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition, the calories a dog should consume to lose weight is computed as follows: (1)Determine your dog's "ideal" weight with your vet or by looking up your dog's breed (or predominant breed) with the AKC. If your dog ever appeared to be a healthy weight, you can use that past weight as an ideal weight. Convert his ideal weight in pounds to kilograms by dividing the pounds by 2.2. For my dog, 44 lbs over 2.2= 20 (2) Multiply her weight in KG by 30. For my dog 20*30 is 600. (3)Add 70. In my dog's case, 600+70=670 calories per day. This food is 347 calories per cup, so 670/347 = 1.93 cups per day is the most my dog should be fed. The Premium Edge feeding guide recommends 2 1/4 cups per day, which is 781 calories.  A small difference in serving size makes a difference of over 100 calories.  Ironically, my dog is well-above his 44 lb "ideal" weight, but he is at a new "ideal" weight with heavy muscle mass.

review/summary: Beware the corn gluten meal!
review/text: After reading the product claims and ingredients on this product, I was intrigued by the promise of weight loss, but concerned about the presence of corn gluten meal as the #3 ingredient.  I contacted the company's staff veterinarian, who assured me it was a good source of protein.  With some misgivings, I placed my miniature schnauzer Cicero on this diet to assist in his trimming down about 2 pounds.  We had previously tried Wellness Weight Management, with no weight loss result and too many trips outside due to the high fiber content.  (Cicero had been raised on Innova prior to the Wellness effort at diet).  Not only did my pup not lose weight, he gained a pound in the two weeks he ate this, and developed a yeast infection which presented symptions in his right ear and on his back.  My readings confirm the suspicion that this was a direct result of the corn gluten meal, as he had never before had a food with any corn ingredient.  I immediately suspended feeding this product, sent the company proof-of-purchase verification for a refund, and conducted an exhaustive search of all-natural high protein foods without grains or filler ingredients which I would feed in controlled smaller portions, rather than another "lite" or "weight management" formula.  Am delighted to report that Cicero is doing beautifully on a combination of Innova EVO and Timberwolf Organics, and that Premium Edge refunded my purchase price in full.  To their credit, the manufacturer was immediately responsive to my emails and sent the refund check within a week.

review/summary: Seems High Quality & Dogs Love It
review/text: I was looking for a high quality dog food which is affordable for my two dogs. I liked the ingredient list as well as the nutrient content on this brand. I haven't really heard of the brand before but did a search on it and found some favorable reviews. My dogs really love it and it seems like the amount listed on the package to feed (based on weight) seems to satisfy them.  They are not extremely active so I have to watch their weight. Also there seems to be not a lot of waste (yard clean-up) associated with the food which tells me it doesn't have tons of fillers. Overall I think this is a quality food and a great buy.

review/summary: So far so good
review/text: My dogs really seem to love this stuff, but we're still transitioning from a combination of Blue Buffalo Weigth Control and Purina Beyond.  Not sure if they "love" it just because they're on diets and want more food or if they really enjoy the flavor :)  I switched to this after reading several reviews, including the dogfoodadvisor.com 5 star rating.  We needed a food that had fewer calories per cup so that we could try to give the dogs a little more quantity without increasing the total caloric intake.  I was ready to stick with the Blue Buffalo Weight Control, but decided to go with this instead.  No problems with the Blue Buffalo, they really seemed to like that too, just needed lower caloric density to help us achieve our weigh goals for the dogs.  Each time I up the ratio of Premium Edge to the Blue Buffalo/Purina Beyond mix, their stool gets a little mushy - but this is to be expected as you're adjusting your dogs diet.  I expect it will be a full month before I've fully transitioned them to Premium Edge.  I tried to find this at a local pet store and the best I could do was an offer to special order it for me.  Being able to buy this on amazon and have it delivered straight to the house is really convenient.

review/summary: 5 pounds gone!
review/text: My dachshund was at least 5-6 pounds overweight when we started him on this feed. He gained the extra weight gradually after he slipped a disc in his back (as this breed very commonly does) while jumping off the couch. Extra weight is dangerous for any dog, but especially so for dogs with long backs and even more so for those with previous injuries. Needless to say, he couldn't run very far or for very long without his back hurting, which was complicated by the extra weight, so it would have to be mostly diet that brought his weight down. So, with all that in mind, I clearly had to choose his food carefully. I relied heavily on the advise of [...] (awesome website) and I could not be more pleased with the feed I chose: Premium Edge Healthy Weight. He has lost 5 pounds since November (5 months) and is continuing steadily with controlled caloric intake based on his daily activity. I highly recommend this feed for this particularly vicious combination of permanently limited activity and necessary weight loss. I also recommend the website I mentioned above that helped me choose it, as they are very easy to navigate as well as being highly informative. Now that he has lost most of the extra pounds, I can tell that his back is much healthier than when he had to carry all that excess weight around. He plays longer and runs farther and is just a happier dog all around- a very good thing.

review/summary: Best dry dog food available for the price
review/text: I did a lot of research before trying the Premium Edge dog food. This high protein dog food was ranked at the top of just about all dog food commercially available at this price point. My two blue ticked beagles have lost almost 8 pounds total (a little over a year time period). They love the food and I know I am providing the best dog food I can for the money. I mix a little of the Healthy Hips can dog food just to dress it up and the dogs love it. You CAN NOT switch dog foods in two weeks when using this product. It has far more protein than most dogs will ever get in a commercial dog food. I highly recommend a VERY SLOW transition that takes place over a minimum of two months, an eighth of a cup per cup at a time when replacing another dry dog food. It also contains chelated vitamins for easier absorbtion, omega 3, and other essential ingredients for a healthy diet.

review/summary: Recall snafu
review/text: I'm not writing this review of the food itself, which is very good, but about the recall. This product is part of the recent voluntary recall due to potential salmonella contamination. When I get a new bag of dog food, I pour it into a tub that's kept closed near the food bowls, for ease of serving and insurance against my dog getting into the bag. The bag goes into the trash. And for this recall you have to have the bag to be certain that your batch is or isn't involved. Without the bag, nether the manufacturer or distributor will do anything except to tell you, "when in doubt, throw it out." My feeling is that the manufacturer, knowing that I ordered during the time in question, should offer to replace my food, but that was not the case. If this weren't the food my trainer recommends, we would be changing brands.

review/summary: Excellent price for high protein grain-free food!
review/text: We really like this food for our extremely active German Short Hair pointer. She certainly doesn't need to lose weight, but we feed her this because of its high protein content and the fact that it is grain free. She gets 4.5 cups per day and her weight is steady right where it should be. This food is similar to Taste of the Wild, but slightly cheaper and I like that it has 2 proteins both chicken and fish meals. We do supplement with coconut or fish oil a few times a week for some extra fat. This high quality food isn't just for those that need to lose weight!

review/summary: Great food
review/text: I bought this food because it was one of the very highest rated foods on good and healthy ingredients for weight control dog food. My dogs are doing very well on it, and they like the taste. Their poop is drier than it was before which makes it easier to pick up, thats a plus, and smaller piles (1 dog is large) so I do think they are using more of this food before it is eliminated. This company on Amazon had the best price on the internet and with free shipping it was a cost saver over all other sites that offered this same brand. I dont see a difference yet in the weight control but have had the dogs on weight cntrol food for a couple years now so hard to tell. Overall I really am happy with this dog food. Shipping was slower than most other sites I have ordered dog food from so dont wait until you need it to order, but I found it worth the wait, next time I will order early.

review/text: Since my dogs are "my children", I read labels on what I feed them, much more closely than on what I eat. I did a lot of research and found the ingredients in Premium Edge to be excellent. One of my dogs would throw up regularly. Since being on Premium Edge for over two years, she stopped vomiting. I tried other top brands of dog food, including Nutros, Merrick and Halo. None of them have matched my satisfaction with Premium Edge.

review/summary: Never again
review/text: We decided to try this dogfood because it was a few dollars cheaper than the Iams weight control that we normally buy.  We have spent FAR more than those few dollars in paper towels and cleaning supplies.  I guess because of the name, we thought it was a premium dog food.  If it is, it is the worst stuff we have ever tried.  I would go back to a cheap brand before ever buying this stuff again.  The dogs may lose weight, but if so, the dehydration from the diarrhea is a much worse consequence.  I expected some digestive problems with the change, but it has been almost 2 weeks, and no change in the problem.  I had to go to the store and buy our usual.  I wont even set this stuff out where stray dogs can get it.  Lesson Learned!

review/text: It's all personal preference, of course, but I really like the flavor of this tea - all four varieties. The flavored teas are pre-sweetened but only slightly. Definitely not too sweet like some other products. I also like the fact that the sweetened drinks are only 50 calories per serving. Only down side is that the servings are relatively small: 8 ounces of tea plus the additional volume from the melted ice makes for about a 12 ounce serving.

review/summary: Sweetened-- With what???
review/text: I bought this tea because I enjoy iced tea and it seemed like a nice variety of flavors.  I received the package and tried the raspberry tea.  It was okay, but had a strange artificial taste.  I looked at the ingredients, only to discover the sweetener used in the tea is Stevia.  With all the mixed reviews on these new sweeteners and their possible side effects, I have made a conscious decision to avoid them.  I am extremely disappointed that no where in the description does it mention that is is sweetened with Stevia.  The product description for the Sweet Lemon tea in fact says "the perfect balance of fresh squeezed lemon, fresh brewed black tea and all natural sugar."  I don't consider Stevia "all natural" sugar.  This is only my opinion and personal preference, but I feel like I was misled by this packaging.  I will now be throwing away all but the unsweetened black tea.  Had I known what was in these, I could have saved my money.

A bunch of the bags smelled rancid (I did not eat anything from those) and the other ones did not smell as bad but made me pretty darn sick (for 3 days).<br /><br />Double yuck.  Bad experience.

review/summary: Thick, tangy and filling!
review/text: I love the taste of tangy roasted red pepper in this soup. It makes for an interesting twist on the boring old tomato soup. This variety is thick, tasty and filling. I like to accompany the soup with Glutino Cheddar Gluten Free Crackers and/or plain low fat Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream). A few points about the size and sodium content:<br /><br />1) Each box contains 32 oz of liquid. One serving is 8 oz. However, for a filling meal I need double that (16 oz). Even doubled, the soup has only 220 calories and 4 gr of fat.<br />2) The sodium content is "lower", not "low". Each 8 oz serving contains 360 gr of sodium (or 720 gr for my doubled serving). Regular soups have typically upwards of 550 gr of sodium. Better choice for a healthy person, but not the right choice for someone on a sodium restricted diet.<br /><br />This soup makes a great work lunch. The container is resealable (the cap is twist off). In fact, it is also sold in 16 oz containers. Once opened, you should store it in the fridge and consume within a week or so.<br />Enjoy!<br />PS: The soup is certified organic and kosher dairy, for those to whom it matters.

I subsequently delighted in every drop and found myself devastated at Costco when they said they weren't carrying it anymore.  Thank goodness a friend said I could probably get it at Amazon. Thank you thank you, Amazon.com!<br /><br />It is the perfect blend of sweet, roasted, rich and smokey flavors.  And like some other review said, pair it with a dollop of greek yogurt and it is a complete perfect meal.  I cannot wait until it arrives!  :)

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I like this soup. As other reviewers have commented - it's nice and thick. It makes a good meal (although I use two servings instead of one). Therefore, it's 720mg of sodium for my 2-cup serving, but that is still way better then the original version. As for the flavor, I LOVE the smoky taste. My only reasons for lower stars: 1. it's sweet. I know most tomato soups are relatively sweet, but this one seems extra sweet to me. (Carb count is decent for a tomato soup though - 32 carbs for 2 cups worth.) And it tastes like it needs salt. Yes, I know, I bought the low-sodium version. Salting it would defeat the purpose. Other than that, I love it, and eat it every day for lunch. (Each carton is 2 lunches - since I use 2 cups per meal - so the case is enough to last me about a month.) Enjoy!

review/summary: A little disappointing
review/text: My entire family has long been huge fans of Pacific's Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato soup.  When I re-ordered last time I thought I'd try this low sodium version.  Unfortunately it has been something of a flop.  It doesn't taste near as good as the regular version and I can't believe the difference is only the sodium content.  The regular version is my teenage daughter's favorite soup of any kind but she won't touch this stuff (even when we add salt).  It just tastes flat and boring.  The roasted pepper flavor is not very noticeable at all.  Whatever rejiggering of the recipe they did for this version clearly needs work.  I'm looking at consuming the whole case myself.

review/text: This is a good tasting, light and creamy soup.  The red peppers aren't real noticeable so don't let that bother you if you are thinking of trying it - it is a mild tasting soup with a slight sweet flavor.  The tomatoes are not overpowering either. Good, wholesome low sodium soups are not easy to find in the stores and it also appears to be gluten free.  At the local store I pay $4.49 each for the 32 oz. cartons and they special order them for me.  One 32 oz. carton provides three good sized bowls (or 4 smaller ones) of soup so it's an economical lunch.  12 cartons are a lot to order at one time, but there should be no problem finding someone who would share the order.

review/text: We use this seasoning on a variety of meats including ribs, chicken, pork, steak and on wings with and without hot sauce. We make our own sausage and it's a great addition to the chicken or pork stuffing for a nice savory meal. We don't expect the taste of a brown sugar and bourbon sauce on an entree from a chef at a 5 star restaurant when we use this seasoning but the flavor it adds and the convenience definately meets our expectations.  We ran out of our first jar of the McCormick Brown Sugar and Bourbon seasoning that we had purchased locally.  We couldn't find it in again at any of the local stores which really disappointed us.  When we found it on Amazon, we were thrilled. Definately a very good purchase.

There are no instructions on how long to cook them. Second I thought they would have a sweet taste, there was no taste at all. No flavor whatsoever. I even marinated overnight instead of the 15 minutes they said. If the President of Mcmormicks tasted this product he would of fired the person who created this. Its riduclous that they would put a product like this on the market. I guess we'll see this product on sale soon at the supermarket.

review/text: I have used Dreamfields Healthy Carb Living pastas for over a year now.  I like the taste of whole wheat pastas, but some people don't or they don't want to eat it all the time.  If you are a low-carber (or not) who misses the regular semolina pasta with all the full-carb taste, then this pasta is definitely for you.  It tastes Sooooo good!  I have tried all of the shapes, and they are all great.  No more waiting for special occasions or treats to get the high-carb taste you love.  With 1 gram fat, 5 grams fiber (4g soluble/1g insoluble), 7 grams protein, and only 5 grams digestible carbs, you can't go wrong buying this great product.<br /><br />Dreamfields is great for those who have diabetes or metabolic or insulin resistance, or people who want to eat low-glycemic, low-carb, Atkins, Body for Life, etc.  Macaroni and Cheese, Lasagna, Meatballs and Spaghetti, Linguine with Clam Sauce, Penne Primavera--endless possibilities for low-carb meals, now.  I can't wait for other shapes to be introduced (hint, hint)--fettucine, cavatappi, orzo, angel hair, and on and on.

review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: With 5 effective "net carbs" (take carbs subtract fiber content= net carbs), this pasta is the poster child of the diabetic eating clinic. How does it taste? I donated all my other pastas and stocked up on this stuff! It's delicious! It doesn't require much to make you feel full. Add a tomato with some pasta sauce, yum! Remember to weigh or measure your portions as you don't need a lot of this to make you full!<br />If you are diabetic and really want a delicious pasta, buy this, don't delay, you won't be disappointed. I gave it to my family and nobody knows I've changed a thing. They never liked the high fiber pasta's either (the pastas were gritty and brown). Dreamfields isn't like this at all!

review/summary: Inaccurate Carb Count
review/text: This product's written description does not accurately reflect the total carb count.  It is higher.  While it is a bit lower than traditional pasta, it is not "low."  I would like to clearly see the total grams and the net grams (adjusted for fiber and sugar alcohols) posted for other consumers, so they know what to expect.

review/summary: Simply the BEST!!
review/text: Dreamfield's is the best low-carb pasta around. Personally, I can't taste any difference between Dreamfield's and regular pasta. Low in carbs and so yummy!! Makes sticking to a low-carb way of life just that much easier!!
