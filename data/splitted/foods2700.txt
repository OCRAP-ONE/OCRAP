review/summary: I like its pine nutty taste
review/text: Hempseed flavor reminds me of pine nuts.  Hempseed contain all nine essential amino acids, which makes them a complete protein, like egg whites and soy. One ounce of hemp provides 45 percent of daily magnesium requirement. Studies show that a diet rich in magnesium can slash diabetes risk by almost half, because it increases insulin sensitivity.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat hempseed is as a dip or a spread on a sandwich.  I use the same recipe for both.  I puree 1 Tbsp. ground hemp seeds, 2 Tbsp. store-bought pesto, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 1 can cannellini beans.<br /><br />Hempseed are easy to spill from the plastic bag they arrive in, so when I am ready to use a new bag I pour the bag into a plastic container designed for cereal, this allows me to pour the seeds out of the container's spout without spilling the seeds on the counter. To make it easier to move the content of the bag into the container, I cut a small hole in the bag and use a funnel to direct the seeds into the container.<br /><br />In case you find it useful here is a taste comparison of other seeds I use in my diet.<br /><br />FLAXSEEDS<br />Nutty-flavored seeds that provide the most nutrition when ground.<br /><br />HEMP SEEDS<br />Similar in taste to sunflower seeds and pine nuts.<br /><br />BUCKWHEAT GROATS<br />Soft seeds with a sweet, earthy flavor when toasted.<br /><br />WHEAT GERM<br />The flaky center of wheat kernels. Very light earthy flavor.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Good seeds. Good service
review/text: I ordered the Nutiva 3 pound bag from Amazon before and received it promptly and in great condition. My most recent order, however, while still received promptly, was rancid and inedible. I was so disappointed. I sent an email that evening, detailing my concern and asking for a new shipment. I didn't receive a reply to my email. What I did receive, however, was a new order of Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed, delivered to my doorstep just two days later! Since this new seed had the same packaging date as my initial order, I cautiously sampled it. The seeds were fine. Phew! So -- not only do I have a good supply of a good product, I got excellent service from Amazon!  Thank you!

It is considered a natural antibiotic and is most often combined with echinacea in preparations designed to strengthen the immune system. However, only one study found that goldenseal might help boost white blood cells (a measure of the infection fighting ability of the immune system), and it wasn't well designed.<br /><br />Mix the Hemp nut, Dulse flakes and fruit first; on high, till it makes a "milk".<br />Then the rest of each item, you want in it<br />If it gets too thick.

review/text: My husband and I couldn't be happier that we found these hemp seeds. Just purchased another bag as we go through quite a lot of it fast. The taste is somewhere between pine nuts and pecans, and is incredibly delicious. You really do feel like you're doing something great for your body just by eating it. One serving (3tbsps) contains 170 calories, 14g fat, 1g saturated fat, 2g carbs, 1g fiber, 11g protein and provides 16% daily iron. Excellent source or protein, so happy to have found it :)

review/summary: tasty
review/text: It's my first time trying hempseed and I'm amazed. You can eat directly from the bag! It has a texture similar to cooked couscous (soft and smooth.) It tastes like sun flower or pumpkin seed. It has a light omega-3 fishy oil after taste. Just when I have a thought of going to supermarket getting some ribs to do slow BBQ, I just tried four spoons of hempseed and my craving for soft tender ribs disappear in my head. So I guess it has all the needed stuff you can get from tasty meat with less required cooking time. So Nutiva hempseed is pretty fresh based on the taste and texture of the seeds. My bag was packaged 45 days ago. I separate 1/4 lbs into a smaller ziplock bag leaving in the fridge and the rest went to a bigger ziplock in the freezer.

review/summary: My New Food Addiction
review/text: I started adding these to my diet after reading about the paleo(caveman) diet and the anti-candida diet. I read these hempseeds control the sugar and carb cravings for those who follow those diets. Although I am not on the paleo diet or the anti-candida diet; I am eating mostly meats, fish, vegetables, fruits and nuts. These seeds are appetite filling and do control food cravings for sugars and starches.  Many times I will just eat a spoonful. I also add them to home-made smoothies and yogurt. These hempseeds taste similar to sunflower seeds, which I also love eating by the way.<br /><br />I will most likely be a customer for life.

review/summary: Quite a surprise!
review/text: This hemp seed reminds me of finely chopped black walnuts in appearance and to my taste buds, it has a much milder black walnut taste. I really did not know what to expect for a nutty flavor, but was pleasantly surprised. I plan to use them as a nut substitute when I make banana bread. I was concerned since we were having such warm weather this past week that they would turn rancid during shipping, but they arrived fully sealed, fresh tasting, and thus far I have no shell complaint. I have also started using Nutiva's organic hemp oil for salad dressings and Pacific' hemp milk to decrease my use of diary. All products have proven enjoyable winners.

review/summary: horrible product
review/text: This hemp seed made me and my family extremely ill.<br /><br />I ordered the 3 lb bag. I do not know if this was a fluke or just a bad batch but this was TERRIBLE<br /><br />I received the product in great time. It arrived in about 3 or 4 days and i gave half of the bag to my daughter. I used hemp seed mostly in my protein shakes. I've been taking hemp seed for about 4 months now. When I got this product, i used it in one of my shakes and 2 hours later I had horrible stomach pain and threw everything up. My stomach continued to feel horrible all day. I really didn't even think it was the shake, but a stomach virus at the time. Then 3 days later, my daughter called me and told me she got very sick, with similar symptoms. She had mentioned that it was a couple hours after drinking a shake she made with the hemp seed. At that point I was afraid to use to product, unsure if it was the hemp seed or my family had gotten a "bug" (by the way, my daughter does not live at home). So a month just passed and today I decided to give it another try. I made a shake and put 2 tablespoons of hemp seed in it (the recommended dosage is 3 but i only use 2 in my shakes). And then, like clockwork, 2 hours later i threw everything up and my stomach still feels horrible and i still feel nauseous. The expiration date of this product is December of 2012 so its not expired but there has to be something wrong with it.  To date, we've used about 6 tablespoons of this stuff and we haven't thrown the rest away in hopes the company will contact us and want it back for testing and give us a refund. I'm not saying the company acted maliciously but I do believe this may have been a bad/tainted batch.

There were a ton of shells mixed in with the product which made it very bitter and hard to eat.  I don't know if Nutiva is using a different process to remove the shells or if this was just a bad batch.  We are going order a new bag; if it is the same we will have to find a different vendor to order from.  Had this been our first purchase we would have just assumed that this is how the product is and would never have ordered again.

A tablespoon of this on your yogurt, cereal, smoothie, or stir fry will go a long way. I eat them by the spoonfull and would equate it to eating sesame seeds. They say that when the buddah was fasting he survived on just one hemp seed a day.<br /><br />These seeds do not have THC as hemp is a different viriety of plant than cannabis. The seeds are sterilized upon import into the US, by law. These seeds are grown in Canada, whos food safety standards are at least equal to the US. These are also USDA certified organic.<br /><br />A geat product. Nutiva is a good brand whos consistent quality I have come to trust.

review/summary: Too Smooth For My Tastebuds
review/text: I've been looking for a good expresso comparable to my caffeinated Brothers, Columbian Supremo which rivals the best expresso I ever had in Italy.  I've been using the Brother's bean for about 10 years now and have never found any better for my Rancilio Silvia.  This Lavazza is way too smooth for my taste but it is probably the best I have found during my 6 month search.  It also provides excellent crema but I ground it a little too fine which seems to promote extra crema.  I am still looking for a stout, very flavorful decaf expresso for my afternoon and evening lattes.  If anyone has any suggestions for me I would greatly appreciate it.  I have spent a small fortune trying to find a very flavorful decaf expresso.  Additionally, the Lavazza is decaffeinated using the very safe Swiss Water method (no chemicals).  If you are looking for a very smooth expresso this medium roast Lavazza is very good.

review/summary: Wonderful smooth rich flavor
review/text: This is one of my favorite decafs. Very smooth, but still has richness and depth. Outstanding as espresso, but also works very well in a moka pot or french press. The medium roast really allows the flavor to come through without the smoky (or sometimes burned) taste often found in darker roasts.<br /><br />Hard to find since it goes out of stock a lot. If it is in stock, get some -- highly recommended, even if you are not a decaf fan.

review/summary: Great beans!
review/text: We have a Breville Barista espresso machine which we use daily. I've had to cut back on caffeine so we switched to decaf beans. I was hesitant, but these beans are working out great for us. Wonderful, rich flavor and every bit as good as their fully leaded cousins. Great option for coffee junkies who need to back off the buzz!

review/summary: This is a favorite in our house
review/text: We really like the Land O lakes Coca. This one is a favorite flavor in our home. I will say though that it takes more water than you think. If you follow the directions exactly the hot chocolate will be overly thick and the powder will not mix up very well. There are other flavors but some of them are overly sweet or do not taste realistic. However, this is a great flavor with a rich chocolate taste. It tastes like you stirred it with a candy cane stick. Yum.

review/summary: Great Treats!
review/text: At first, my cats were hesitant to try them.  It took a few minutes of them sniffing and circling the treats before giving it a whirl.  I was getting a little scared because both of them have very different tastes.. they loved whiskas tempations that I bought for them in the past but it was making them vomit constantly.  The cats are absolutely crazy about these new treats.  They follow me everywhere wondering when I will give them some more.  I love the fact that they are organic and natural, that was a big selling point for me.  My cats are happy too :)  A previous review mentioned that the treats come in excessive packaging; in a paint canister.  That was not the case, they must have changed it up.  They come in 12 small ziplock packages that sit in a cardbord box, that works great for storing in a cabinet.  I wouldn't have minded the paint canister though too, I would have kept the treats in that as well. I gave my sister one package for her to try on her cats.. if they like them, which I'm sure they will, the packaging makes it easy to split up the treats between the both of us.

They eat them up and beg for more.  OK, the packaging is excessive to say the least.  They come in a paint can when a plastic zip bag would easily suffice.  I'm taking a star away for the paint can which is only about 1/3 full when you put in the treats.

review/summary: oo strong mint!
review/text: Mint mint mint! This is my review of how to love mint matcha!<br />First of all - they're both green! That helps with that feeling of "I'm drinking a strawberry flavoured drink but it's green instead of red! Ow my brain!"<br /><br />It freshens your breath! Don't do what I do and make your matcha way too strong - otherwise associations of swallowing mouth wash come to mind. Oops!<br /><br />It's classy! Think of cr&egrave;me de menthe. Okay cr&egrave;me de menthe way be a little old fashioned, but it still hits the spot when you sip from crystal glasses. Drink this matcha from a crystal bowl! Now you're fancy too!<br /><br />It's great for cookies! Peppermint shortbread is one of my favourite Christmas cookie flavours. Nobody will blink at a red and green cookie - so go for it!<br /><br />It's a perfect mixer! I know this is a strange and unorthodox review, but this is finally the part when I drink the matcha and love it! Chocolate mint my friends.  I mixed a healthy dose (1/2 tsp) of Belgium Chocolate matcha with a small amount (1/4 tsp) of mint matcha! The mint is quite strong, but after experimenting I've found this to be my favourite mix. For an extra treat I add the matcha right into warm milk and froth it up!<br /><br />It is delish and reminds me of an After Eight hot chocolate. If that's not a treat, I don't know what is!

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: This was my first time ordering from Red Leaf Tea. Everything went very smoothly and my order arrived super fast.<br /><br />In the fall, I love the mint lattes offered at the coffee shops. When I stumbled upon this, it sounded too good to be true.  I could make a yummy mint matcha latte at home? That's unpossible!  But no, it's true. It took me a few attempts to get the proportions just right, but when I did, all I can say is mmmmm!  To turn it into a latte, I add vanilla soy milk after mixing the matcha with warm water.  The end result is very creamy and mint-y and one of the best teas I've had. I've also tried mixing in some cocoa powder to make a chocolate mint matcha latte, and that was very delicious too. I think I have a new fall obsession.<br /><br />Even though mint is more of a fall flavor for me, I think because the mint in this is so smooth, it would also taste great iced. If I have any left by spring, I'm definitely going to try it, and also buy some bubble gum flavored matcha to mix in with it.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all mint tea lovers!

review/summary: MmmmmmMINT!
review/text: MMmmmmmMINT Matcha is JUST what I needed to help round off my matcha supply!<br /><br />I love mint but need to be in the mood for it. Luckly for me that mood comes fairly often!<br /><br />Mint is eye opening, awakening, and also helps soothe a troubled tummy.<br /><br />We had some really good Japanese food last night at a great restaurant but all of us were having some tummy "issues" last evening after dinner. This mornings mint matcha is really helping to settle the tummy woes.<br /><br />When I opened my bag from Red Leaf Tea the aroma was striking! I instantly thought "ohhhh yessss this is IT". It had some slight resemblance to Spearmint gum, and while I do detect a slight peppermint flavor here I would have to say the mint used is mostly spearmint. For those who know their mints some really prefer one type of mint over another. Spearmint to me is sweeter than peppermint and there is less of a bite to it. Some may beg to differ since most people are used to peppermint candies but in its true form I find peppermint to have more bite, sharper than spearmint and spearmint more sweet naturally. Regardless of what type of mint you prefer I have to say this Mint Matcha from Red Leaf does in fact taste very natural!<br /><br />Yet at the same time it is an excellent mixer as well. Of course you will want to use a little less mint matcha in your blend along with another matcha but I choose to blend mint with mocha this morning. The mocha I used a full scoop and the mint just a half of a scoop. I can taste the mocha very well and the mint does not totally over power it.<br /><br />This mint does not in any way taste like mouth wash or toothpaste. It is quite enjoyable. I am so glad that I purchased this one and will absolutely keep this as a stash regular.<br /><br />Also I notice that the mocha base is providing a nice creamy backdrop to the mint matcha! Ohhhh I MUST try a french vanilla / mint blend as soon as possible - I am thinking "Grasshopper" flavored matcha here! Oh yeah!<br /><br />So all in all I could not be happier that I went for it and grabbed this Mint Matcha from Red Leaf!

review/summary: A Shamrock whatnow?
review/text: Ah mint. My wife and I both adore mint, but I'm a spearmint girl, where she's a peppermint lover. And these are two very different mints.<br /><br />But I have love in my heart for mint teas. My childhood summers were fueled by Lipton tea bags with fresh mint set out on the porch to brew in the sun. Picking mint and just chewing on it as we played in the sun. Heck, my college days were fueled by mint juleps and raspberry mojitos. Mint and I are good, good friends. And a Shamrock Shake is a must-have for me every March! At least, it was until I found out about my dairy allergy.<br /><br />Which is what brought me to this tea, Mint Matcha, a desire to make my own version of the Shamrock Shake (which is essentially a vanilla-mint milkshake from McDonalds) with vanilla and mint matchas and soy milk or ice cream. But for the sake of this review, I'm drinking this matcha the way I drink all my tea, no milk and some sugar.<br /><br />Earlier today I made a cup of this for a friend of my wife's, who I am eagerly trying to seduce to the ways of matcha with my Red Leaf Tea collection,  and I fell in love the second I opened the package. It smells like a smooth creamy mint. When I commented on how good it smells, my wife agreed with me...and she doesn't even like matcha! I can't wait to have a cup of this myself!<br /><br />My wife's friend (who needs to be on Steepster, darn it!) says this tea tastes like Christmas (which may have something to do with the Rudolph travel mug I sent it to her in!). This made me think of my favorite tea of all time, Santa's Secret, which is a vanilla-mint black tea, so I have high hopes for this one.<br /><br />Holy mint, batman! This is definitely a peppermint tea, with just a hint of the smoothness that reminds me of spearmint tea. Wow. I am definitely craving a raspberry-mint matcha mojito now. Yum, yum, yum. It's mega minty in a non medicinal way and now I am dying to try it with the vanilla, but if I have any more matcha today, I'm going to explode XD. I love it! The burst of strong mint really helps wake you up too, and can definitely see myself adding this to my collection. And mint mixes so well with berries and fruit that I can see endless smoothie options here. If you're a mint fan, I definitely recommend this one.

review/summary: I've had better Italian chickpeas
review/text: This is only the second brand of Italian chickpeas I've tried. The first ones (not purchased through Amazon) were way better (but also way more expensive). These Roland chickpeas were similar to the other Italian chickpeas in flavor profile, but much more bland. Italian chickpeas (at least the two brands I've tried) are milder than traditional ones, but with pleasant grassy (a hint of green split peas) and earth notes. They don't make a great hummus, but they are great in chickpea dishes that are mildly seasoned. I make a chickpea-basil pesto that was the best ever when I used the first brand of Italian chickpeas. But when I used this brand, it was boring, and not as good as when made with regular chickpeas. Of course, beans may vary from batch to batch, but I'm not going to buy this brand again.

review/summary: Love it! You can almost taste the antioxidants
review/text: This is very high-quality raw cacao paste, and I appreciate that its non-GMO and organic, too. I eat raw chocolate daily, because it's delicious and also for its considerable anti-oxidant benefits. You can tell when you taste this that Sunfood's cacao paste is very high-quality. I've had poor quality cacao paste and it tastes sort of powdery and lacks the richness of good chocolate.<br /><br />I use it to make my own chocolate using 2 parts cacao paste to 1 part cocoa butter in my dehydrator. (Most recipes call for equal amounts paste and butter, but I've read that 1/3 of the fat content in cocoa butter is unhealthy, so I try to limit my cocoa butter consumption. This makes for harder chocolate, but I really don't mind. If you want really creamy chocolate, add more cocoa butter.) Then I melt it in my dehydrator at about 108 degrees for 2.5 hours, stirring occasionally. You could also melt it in an oven, but you'll want to use low heat, to avoid destroying the antioxidants in the cacao. Then I add a small amount of maple sugar dissolved in hot water, pour the mix into silicone molds in fun shapes and let it cool and harden in the fridge.<br /><br />You can also try melting the cacao paste, adding a little maple sugar (which is much lower on the glycemic index than regular sugar) and adding it to coconut cream for an out-of-this-world healthy dessert. I highly recommend this product.

Do not confuse stollens with fruit cakes they are very different. Stollens are made with bread dough and not cake dough so they have a different taste and texture. This particular baker Kuchenmeister makes a variety of bakery goods  and their stollens are top quality. The bread is very moist and flavorful and tempts you to have another piece especially with a cup of hot coffee or tea. They do have lots of calories but are worth every bite. You will be glad you ordered these breads and they will not disappoint your taste buds.

It's an excellent, smooth blend and a bit lighter than the extra bold offerings, but still has some good flavor.  I'll be keeping my eye on any Amazon deals in the future to replenish my supply when I start running low.

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: We just got the Keurig coffee maker for Christmas and Caribou Blend was our first attempt. I thought it was very weak and tasteless and chalked it up to using the 9 ounce setting on the coffee maker. We tried it again on the medium setting and I still was not impressed. I then tried the Coffee People's Donut Shop on the medium size setting and it was delicious. My husband will probably finish up our 18 ct box of Caribou (he's not as fussy), but I won't buy it again.

review/summary: Very poor quality Dates
review/text: I received the dates wrapped in brown butcher paper in a box.  They were not sealed in a bag, which could have led to some of the problems with these dates.  They were very hard and had a pungent chemical taste (a little like toilet bowl cleaner smells) that made them inedible.  Also, there were small bits of white paper stuck to many individual dates.  I returned the product to receive a refund, but did have to pay $12 return shipping.

So here is the ingredient<br /> list from the box for those who are interested:<br /> Cane sugar;maltose;choice ginger;tapioca starch;menthol;peppermint oil.<br />16 calories; 0 sodium; 0 fat; 4g carb; 2g sugar; 0g protein. ( per piece)<br /> They are 5 star for what they are. I would have been happier if I had found a ginger chew without sugar but they are very<br /> good. I ordered them in the 2 oz tins and the tins are really nice and well made with a sliding top. Very vintage look and I can refill them in the future by buying the cheaper 5 pound bagged chews.

review/text: I was told about this product at a Weight Watcher meeting. We purchased the "original" blend. I felt compelled to write and let potential customers know how horrible this product is. Our family of six tried it in soup, on eggs, on various vegetables, raw and steamed. No body liked any part of it. It sat on the shelf for about two months and we threw it out, all 21 ozs. We prefer Lawreys no salt seasoning or Trader Joe's no salt seasoning. Don't waste your money.<br />This product is made by Alberto Culver. Maybe they should stick to the hair care industry!

review/text: Okay, things are going to heck in a hand-basket, but it ain't the end of the world, YET! However, if you are inclined to stock your cupboard (or underground shelter) with tasty, nutritious products that will last -why not turn to the folks who "invented" the baked bean, B&M. These also come in real handy like if you are trying to cut down on the fast food expense (and calories) or just don't feel like running out mingling with society for a burger biggie and fries. Heat em and eat em, right in the comfort of your kitchen or panic room. Sure, you can pay premium prices for MEALS READY-TO-EAT if you like, but the baked bean is packed with protein and calcium, as well as other needed nutrients, and very little fat! And while some MRE's are "okay" --folks who have had them will agree that a can of B&M baked beans beat MRE flavor any time any place, even in the post-apocalypse! So stock em up, heat em up and eat em up! Oh yeah, and like yer daddy used to tell ya before having ya pull his fanger, they also real good for ya heart!

review/text: OK, first off, they claim this 16 oz. can is 3.5 servings (?) maybe so...but maybe not.  So multiply those single "serving" nutritional figures on the can by 3.5 and here is the total for the whole 16 oz can. 595 calories, 35 from fat. 2,520 mg Sodium (105% of daily req. Yikes!), 24.5g protein, 52.5g sugar, and so on.  OK, so this is definitely not health food. ;)<br /><br />It is however pretty tasty and a decent value (especially if you use subscribe and save as I do).  I am happy with the flavor, texture, quality, and so on.  There is almost no bacon to be seen, and little bacon flavor. I spotted two teeny, tiny bits in one whole can.  You could taste a bit of brown sugar, but not a strong taste. Overall, they tasted fairly typical to me, but good enough to satisfy.  So these are *not* extraordinary beans, they're just good beans.  However, that's enough for a can of baked beans.

review/text: I really love thses meals taste- and convenience-wise, but sadly the two I've ordered so far that were labeled gluten-free have each had at least one item that is "processed in a facility that also processes wheat." i blindly trusted the label and felt sick for several days, not realizing where the gluten was coming from. Finally I read each of the individual packets inside the boxes and found the culprits. Now I can avoid it, but then I don't get to eat the whole meal. It may be suitable if you don't actually have a gluten intolerance, but otherwise, buyer beware!

review/summary: quick easy complete light lunch
review/text: I had first tried the humus Gopicnic lunch, and loved that. The next one I tried was this Pepperoni one. Yes, the pepperoni is greasy. Really greasy. More so than any pepperoni I've ever had. But, it's simple... just dry it off with a napkin... and, yes, as another reviewer has stated, you will need a couple of napkins for this. I am not a fan of asiago cheese, but it was good. Also, dried fruit tends to turn in my stomach (or mouth), but the dried fruit was very good as well. These meals are really quite satisfying... I mean, if you are starving... they will help (but not "fill" you).... as a lunch at work (which, if I am at work, I really don't want something heavy), it is really nice as all of these meals come with five items... a little of "this", a little of "that"... a bit from several food groups. Nice.

review/text: These are great for a fast, easy, and tasty treat that's healthier than grabbing something while you're out! The pepperoni is somewhat greasy but I just bring a napkin along too and once I take it out of it's wrapper I set it on the napkin and that helps a lot. That's the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five because we really like them otherwise! It's the perfect snack or small meal (if you're like me and eat a few smaller meals during the day); a bit of salt, a little sweet treat, some protein, and grains all keep you going smoothly throughout your day.

review/summary: My favorite GoPicnic choice
review/text: First, as a celiac (needing to be gluten-free), I've been a fan of GoPicnic for a while. They're great for travel, providing a nice fill-in for the airline meals we no longer receive. Really, they kind of remind me of the sorts of lunch packs a lot of kids get -- single meal, shelf-stable, with various bits and pieces ready to combine once you dig in. The problem I've had with GoPicnic is that I'm picky, and I've found that while I enjoy *something* out of each package, most have at least one, often several, items I don't care for.<br /><br />This is the first GoPicnic package I've found where I like *everything* included. The asiago cheese, while not something I'd immediately think of for pizza, works great. The turkey pepperoni is tasty (although greasy, as any real pepperoni is going to be if stored at room temperature.) I *love* the dried fruit in this (pineapple and, uh, cranberries, I think? I'd have to look up the second one -- but whatever it is, I like it.) And while the dried fruit could probably double as a desert, the almond roca is awesome -- unless you're one of those weird folks who hates almond roca. And if so, then, well, why? How can you not feel a shudder of joy every time you bite into a piece of that chocolatey, crunchy, toffee-esque goodness? Well, it doesn't matter -- your odd aversion toward almond roca is none of my danged business, really.<br /><br />Any time I travel, I bring gopicnic with me. And unless I'm just feeling daring and want to pick up a box of some flavor I've never tried, this will be the only one I'll bring.<br /><br />To the gopicnic folks, a suggestion, if you don't mind: Any chance of tossing in a wet-wipe or towel with this one? The grease thing really calls out for it. And, thanks for making something tasty, portable, *and* gluten-free. Traveling with gluten sensitivity is a real pain in the butt. Figuratively, and otherwise.

review/summary: Gourmet Cheese Spread
review/text: What I love most about this box of snacks is the gluten-free crackers and the delicious asiago cheese spread. The dried cranberries and pineapple are also quite tasty. Then for dessert there is an small Almond Roca bar which is crunchy and satisfying if you like toffee covered in chocolate. These ready-to-eat meals are handy for all sorts of occasions like hiking and biking. They are also handy to take along on a spontaneous picnic. The foods in this box do not contain any MSG or high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: My favorite at work lunch!
review/text: Everything about this kit is awesome!!<br /><br />The meal consists of a pack of crackers, turkey pepperoni, asiago cheese spread, dried fruit, and a great little almond toffee chocolate bar.<br /><br />Every item is individually wrapped, tastes great and looks to be great quality.  Who knew eating glutin-free could taste so good!  My only gripe is that sometimes there are not enough crackers in the pack to account for all the pieces of pepperoni.  I like to have a one to one ratio.  Usually there are enough, but I've had cracker packs with way too many and had packs with way too little.<br /><br />The included almond, toffee, chocolate treat is great!<br /><br />Easily a 5 star lunch!

review/summary: Great but pricey
review/text: I'm a huge snacker!  I was walking through the cafeteria at my job (hospital) and noticed the cute little box.  I love trying new things and gave it a chance.  I would say that the combination of crackers, cheese spread, salami, candy, and dried fruit meets the needs of my taste buds with the sample bite sizes.  I'm happy to see that there are 12grams of protein as well.  My only criticism is that it's overpriced.  I bought an individual box for $4.99. Even $24.99 for a pack of 6 is too much when you can get $5 footlongs from Subway...I'm just sayin'..

review/text: This is my son's favorite of the lunchable style meals from Gopicnic.  He really likes the fact that he can have a lunch that is similar to other kids. He also likes the convenience of having a full meal in one.  Gopicnic is his lunch menu for an entire week at scout camp.  It's nice to be able to send him off for a week and know he will be able to eat good food safely.

review/summary: GoPicnic Turkey Pepperoni and Cheese
review/text: I was looking for some simple meals to put into my emergency pack. I like these because it needs no refrigeration, it's light, and it's easy to eat right out of the box. The kids and I opened a box and I was surprised as it was quiet tasty. You'd think in an emergency you'd be willing to eat anything, but it's nice to know that we have something that we'll actually like. I especially liked the dried pineapple. I'm not sure how filling it will be as an actual meal because we split it up, but I was satisfied with it as a snack.<br /><br />I subscribed for every 6 months. It looks like it expires end of October so that's right about when I'll be getting my next shipment. I'm excited to take these babies camping. No prep, easy cleanup, tasty snack on the go.

review/summary: A very satisfying snack.
review/text: This snack pack, or as I like to call it, my adult version of a lunchables lol. Of course it is not just for adults but definitely has a better, more satisfying taste. I love the wheat crackers, they are good alone but definitely better with some of the asiago cheese spread and a pepperoni slice. Everything is packed in its own little package and comes together very nicely as a whole. It is not a meal, unless perhaps you're on an extreme sort of diet but it gets me through my day in the middle of classes when I am too busy to run out and get lunch. It can keep you from hunger  for maybe and hour or 2 but it is not a meal. My favorite part of the whole thing was the small almond roca bar for a "dessert". My least favorite part was the small bag of dried cranberries and pineapple pieces. Normally i like cranberries and pineapples but as a dried fruit, these are definitely too sweet even for my sweet tooth. Overall i would recommend this product because it is nicely packaged and very tasty.

review/summary: Surprisingly Awesome
review/text: The gift shop at the hotel I work at started carrying these the same day I had to pull a super long work shift and forgot lunch.  I bought one, though they had the other varieties as well (Which are just as amazing) and I was surprised at the amount of food in the little box.<br /><br />Inside is a plastic knife, a piece of hard toffee wrapped up in foil and then plastic, a packet of turkey pepperoni, a packet of multi-seed rice based crackers that are very light and crisp, more than enough cheese spread to make your own little sandwiches of the crackers cheese and pepperoni, also dried fruit that wasn't actually too sugary for once.<br /><br />The box opens up so that you can use it as an eating container if need be, but it'd be difficult to spread cheese on crackers in it so I just laid out a napkin for that.  There was also a sudoku puzzle inside.<br /><br />Though pricier than a lunchable, I found this much more satisfying,  I don't eat a lot and i don't think it would satisfy the average adult, but this would be a fantastic meal for children or small eaters.  Best, they don't require refrigeration, so you can take them on long trips.<br /><br />I'll probably be buying these when my family heads out to the anime convention next summer, since the food at the convention center is expensive and sub-par, it'd be nice to have something my family can carry with them.<br /><br />This is also a great meal if you're dieting, as there's enough protein and lean fats to keep you feeling a bit fuller than the average under 300 calorie meal would.
