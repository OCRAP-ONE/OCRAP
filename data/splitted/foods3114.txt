review/text: I bought these cookies because I love lemon, I'm always looking for something that tastes good and is gluten-free. These cookies had everything up until the after taste - they had this funky fake lemon taste that wasn't there at the beginning. I was disappointed in the box and never bought another.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: My daughter has a wheat/gluten allergy so we have purchased a large number of gluten free cookies for her, trying to find something to serve as a substitute to real cookies.  Of all the brands and types of cookies, these are her favorite.  I have tried one as well and as far as prepackaged, store bought cookies are concerned, these are great.  The cookie is made up of alternating layers of waffers and chocolate creme and the whole cookie has been dipped in chocolate.  If you like chocolate I think you are going to love these cookies.

review/text: These are very good, but in the very warm weather the filling can go soft.<br />So I keep mine in the freezer.  Try and keep them sealed to avoid moisture -<br />all I do is fold the silver packet over - and they are really good. There<br />is not enough to them to taste cold - but they are crisper.  I only keep<br />the packet I have open in the freezer.  See what you think.

review/text: Before becoming a Celiac and switching to a gluten free diet, I used to love Trader Joe's Vanilla Joe Joe's. I found these on sale at the Grocery Outlet the other day and decided to give these a try. These were so much better than the Trader Joe's Vanilla Joe Joe's and significantly better than Vanilla Oreo's. Even my gluten eating friends said they were addicting. They are great dipped in hot chocolate, milk or tea but are even better on their own. Will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Great Cookies -- Period
review/text: I've purchased most of the gluten free cookies available on Amazon and in local stores.  These are best of the bunch.  If you like wafer cookies -- they're good whether you can eat gluten or not (I grew up eating cookies with wheat and these compete with any "normal" wafer cookie (I wouldn't go as far as I would with Blue Diamond's Nut-Thin crackers, which I would say are better than regular crackers -- but they are at least as good as most cookies -- if you serve them to friends they won't wince (or even know they are eating gluten free) when they bite into them).  The other Glutino flavors aren't bad either but the chocolate is the best -- I find chocolate tends to help mask the glutin free flour taste in most cookies.<br /><br />I would recommend some caution in shipping them during the summer as you are more likely to recieve a cookie block rather than individual wafers (although the cookie block was pretty tasty too).  Also, an added bonus for anyone shipping to APO or DPO, they will ship to these addresses(again a caution about the heat, especially if you are shipping to Afghanistan during the summer).

BUT- they are so sweet, flakey, and delicious that our whole family (my husband included) couldn't get enough of them.<br />BUY THESE COOKIES, for real.

review/text: CHOCOLATE. When going GF 10 years ago, I was bummed cause there was suck a lack of store bought goodies. I once had an addiction to Keebler Fudge Shop, Fudge Sticks. I was hesitant at first to but these cause of the price, but they are worth it if you have the craving. I like them frozen/refrigerated the best. I gave them to a GF co-worker and she really liked them too. The only problem I have is once I open one box, I have trouble not finishing the whole thing. oops. I've also tried the vanilla ones, but they are not that good. Buy these!!!

review/text: I've been gluten free for about 10 years now and love my cookies!  I generally order Schar products and love their vanilla sandwich creams which really are as good as or better than gluten cookies.  With Glutino I feel it's hit and miss.  Their crackers are generally delicious and I love their pretzels but these cookies tasted like styrofoam and the icing was super sweet.  Not my favorite product from Glutino.  If you didn't care for these, you might try the Schar vanilla cremes.  They're amazing!

They're crunchy and true to the texture of the other "real" cookies that aren't gluten-free.  Some might think that the filling makes them a bit too sweet, but for me that just means I've satisfied my sweet tooth sooner!  The chocolate version from Glutino is just as good and has a true "chocolatey" taste - something that isn't there with the other gluten-free brands out there.

Easily fixed with a Ziploc, but one time I tossed them in the fridge to keep them extra fresh.  That was when I fell IN love with these cookies.  When cold the creamy layers really hold up against the crunchy wafer and make a wonderful combination.  They are truly addicting.  Also, because we keep our entire house allergen free for my boys, these cookies are some that I can confidently serve when entertaining gluten-eating friends.  They often ask where they can get their own!

review/summary: Not a favorite
review/text: Well, my kid who isn't gluten free likes them, and my kid who is won't touch them.  I cook and bake most of what we eat, so desserts are very homemade and natural in their flavor.  These are really, really artificial-lemon flavored....they remind me of my dish soap every time I try one.  I really don't like the flavor, but the texture is nice.  I'm a little dizzied that I have so many boxes of something I don't care for... it was worth a try, though.

review/summary: Sweet and Mushy
review/text: My son is 6 and he has celiac.  He loves sweets, however when he took a bite of this wafers he was done with it.  He said that it just was not good.  I tasted it and had to agree with him.  The only thing I could taste was the extreme sweetness and the fat sticking to the roof of my mouth.

review/summary: Very good.  Also, they smell like potatoes.
review/text: I really shouldn't complain:  the world would be a sadder place without these.  They are like gluten-free Kitkats, which is wonderful.<br /><br />However, they also smell like potatoes.  The chocolate covers the potato taste and smell, for the most part, but, it's still a little bit like eating chocolate-covered crispy potatoes.<br /><br />However, as you are probably aware, there are variations in what people can taste and smell.  Personally, I can tell what vodka was made from--potatoes, wheat, whatever--even though it's so finely distilled that there shouldn't be any way to distinguish that.  If you're not super-sensitive to tastes and smells, you probably won't notice the potato at all, in which case, these would be fabulous.

review/summary: It's good junk food.  They also smell like potatoes.
review/text: First, let me say that I love this company.  They have somehow managed, with very difficult flours, to make normal junk food.  (These kinds of cookies are sold in American supermarkets in packages that are three times the size.)<br /><br />The packaging is pretty;  the cookies are crispy, light, and very appealing in your hand.  They are an exact duplicate of the wheat version.  However, once you get them up to your nose, you can smell the potato flour they are made from.<br /><br />Pull them away from your nose, and you have a very pretty cookie.  Bring them back in to your nose, and it's a surreally icky potatoey experience.  Cookies like this shouldn't smell like potato vodka.<br /><br />They do have a chocolate-covered version of this that you can't really smell, because the flour is covered. It's such a sugar rush that you may not care what it tastes like, particularly because it has an excellent chocolate-sugar-bomb wafer cookie texture.<br /><br />Just hold your nose.

review/summary: Beware of Glutino
review/text: My son and I who are both Celiacs loved Glutino wafers in both chocolate and dark chocolate varieties. We were on our 3rd box when I opened one of the bars and went to bite into it. It was the equivalent to biting into some sort of spongy rock. I immediately spit out what chocolate had fallen into my mouth while biting it. The bar itself seemed extremely stale to me. I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada, then sent to USA to be bought. It seems to me like one of the bars I had floated around a facility for quite some time before it was actually packaged and sent. Or worse who knows. I'm glad it was me and not my 3 year old son who bit into it.<br /><br />I tried contacting Glutino about what happened. I tried calling several times as well as sent messages via the internet. But no response. It went from being suspicious to down right scary, what are they hiding and if this is how they treat their costumers- how do they treat their food?<br /><br />Please be forewarned. Going gluten free isn't easy and Glutino is a big brand on the celiac's grocery list but since our incident we avoid Glutino at all costs.

review/summary: Excellent drink for running in warm weather
review/text: The negative review addresses only the price on Amazon (which I do agree is too high), rather than the quality of this product, which is excellent.<br /><br />I am a serious runner (1200 miles per year). Running in warm weather puts extra demands on runners, including the need to replenish electrolytes and hydrate more frequently. Gatorade G2 is an excellent way to do this. Unlike regular Gatorade, which is filled with sugar, a 20oz bottle of G2 has only 12g of sugar, which is more than sweet enough for me. It also has enough electrolytes to supplement the electrolyte tablets by Hammer Nutrition (which I have reviewed on Amazon) that I take before I head out in warmer weather.<br /><br />At the beginning of my run I pour a 20 oz.chilled bottle of G2 into my Smart Source stainless steel water bottle (which I have reviewed on Amazon), and then place that in a Nathan Quickdraw (which I have reviewed on Amazon) to carry the bottle. A 20 oz bottle usually lasts me about an hour in really hot weather, after which I buy another 20 oz bottle at a convenience store on my route for my second hour of running.<br /><br />Drinking G2 is far superior to drinking plain water to hydrate because besides electrolytes, you get carbohydrates and potassium.<br /><br />I have tried different flavors and the Lime is one of my favorites. I buy a pack of 8 at my local supermarket on sale for six dollars.

review/text: As far as the drink is concerned, it's 5 stars.  I think it's the best sports drink on the market.  My review is strictly concerning the price.  You can buy the same exact thing (24 pack of 20 oz. bottles) at Sam's Club for $14.88 ($14.23 less/49% cheaper).  The only difference is that it is a variety pack that includes 8 Lemon Lime, 8 Fruit Punch and 8 Grape.  I think Lemon Lime is the best flavor but I'm not sure it's worth paying twice as much for it.  Amazon should cut their price significantly and be more competitive.

review/summary: Excellent drink for athletes or people who work outside in the heat!
review/text: I have a big yard and like doing the outdoor work myself.  It can get very hot and the work is hard.  This is a great way to replenish the lost water and sodium from sweating while working in the yard or exercising.<br /><br />Each 32 ounce bottle contains 4 servings of 8 ounces each. That is 5 grams of sugar at a total of 20 calories per serving. It is a great way to stay rehydrated and keep you going strong. It recharges your energy without going overboard on the sugar.<br /><br />There are several flavors available and this is one of my favorites. It helps me recover faster than drinking just water or drinking a carbonated beverage.<br /><br />This is a good product and you will like it.  I do think the price of this product on Amazon is very high and the shipping charges are almost as high as the product price.  My 5 star rating is for the product itself.

My only complaint is that I have to plan ahead when I order since it seems every time I am about to run out, Amazon is out of stock.  If you see it, get it!

I was hesitant of buying this at Costco as they sold them by the box (12/1 Qt) I was afraid of buying it and not liking it and losing my money. I'm glad I did! This rice milk contains no canola oil and doesn't have the sweet flavor as in Rice Dream.  It is not as thick as regular milk but for me that is great as it suggests that they have not added too many side ingredients.

review/summary: simple but seems to work
review/text: just received this and used it for one cup of coffee. The device is simple but if you follow the easy directions it works.. albeit a bit slower than a kcup. The lid doesn't fit tight...don't know how long it will work but if the keurig machines maintain a constant pressure on the lid then that should not be a problem. The coffee itself was quite good and would buy the decaf again in the future. I also tested the flavor from the keurig with the adapter and I also have a MYBunn pod brewer and I would say the taste was about the same.<br /><br />update: have used this quite a few times now and have had no problems. The coffee tastes as good as if it were brewed in the pod brewer. The lid stays on because of the pressure of the lid and no grounds leak out. I actually run water through a pod twice because I don't like super strong coffee and all I do is quickly unlock the keurig and lock it back down and run a lesser amount of water for a 16oz cup of coffee.  It is easier to use than the other adapters that need to be filled with fresh coffee. Only need to put the pod in and then take it out and rinse out the adapter.

review/text: I spent a few weeks in the Southwest on my annual camping trip this year and enjoyed "Prickly Pear Margaritas" at a number of places.<br />Add a dollup of this to any Margarita and convert it to a "Prickly Pear Margarita".  It's also great on pancakes and waffles.<br />The pricing on this product makes it a pretty good value.

review/summary: Prickly Pear Syrup -
review/text: I was soo excited to get this prickly pear syrup because I had wanted to make a pricky pear juice drink and this was the closest I could find. I put club soda in with this syrup and didn't get the taste I was hoping for. It's way TOO sweet and just not as good as I had hoped. I am disappointed,

review/summary: Nectar to the Goddess!!
review/text: My wife and I went to San Antonio in 2011.  We had a great time.  We visited the Alamo, experienced The Rodeo, shopped at the flea markets, and had fun on the Riverwalk.<br /><br />The only problem was that it rained nearly every day of our trip.  The rain started to dampen our spirits until we found a delight at Boudro's, 421 E. Commerce St.  We went there to get the famous table prepared guacamole, but discovered the hidden diamond, The Prickly Pear Margarita!<br /><br />Who knew that � ounces of prickly pear cactus juice with � ounces of tequila, added to a frozen margarita would be so blissful.  I will say that after she had a few of these wonderful concoctions, this ugly and obese husband enjoyed the evenings more myself (wink wink).  It was so tasty and effective that my wife keeps looking for cheap airfare to reenlist the services of the wonderful syrup.<br /><br />I must admit that getting a little quality time with the goddess is worth the airfare but now that I have found the awesome additive on Amazon, well let me just say that the new experiment is to see which lasts longer...the blender or the mattress.

review/summary: What AZ restaurants and bars use...
review/text: I don't doubt that Cheri's syrup is great and leave that issue as it is.  If however you have visited Arizona and have had a Prickly Pear Margarita in a bar or restaurant they most likely got their syrup from another source; the Cactus Candy Company, located in Phoenix. I got my information from the bar tender at the Phoenician who showed me the Cactus Candy gallon jug of syrup.  They sell it in gallon containers which you need if you entertain guests and continue to offer them Prickly Pear Margaritas.  Amongst my friends Prickly Pear Margaritas have just about eliminated the need to make any of the other flavors.  If you don't have a margarita machine I can help you make better than machine made drinks.<br /><br />For ease of storing and delivering I use the bucket approach.  This allows you to make the mix, freeze it and keep it on hand until guests come.  As frozen the mix is not appetizing.  There is considerable separation of the contents but it doesn't matter as all of the ingredients are together and at the right temperature.  The only thing needed is to thoroughly mix the contents.  For this you will need a commercial blender which means VitaMix or Blendtec (go checkout bars and do research if you must).  I have both and prefer the Blendtec.  These machines are loud and powerful and will quickly mix a pitcher of margaritas (do not overmix as it melts the mixture).  With respect to ingredients I have done the "made from scratch" method which I still prefer for margaritas on the rocks but for frozen drinks I think it is overkill.  When your taste buds are well chilled and you're on the verge of a "brain freeze" the difference between great ingredients and good ingredients is nil.  In the beginning I bought the "On the Border" bucket mixes at Sam's/Costco until I started looking at the costs.  The buckets are expensive but they are reusable.  I still use the same buckets but I now buy Costco Margarita Mix to use in them.  The small buckets hold 80 ounces of drink, 64 of mix and 16 of liquor.  To aid in measuring I have a large 32 ounce measuring cup and add the smallest amounts first.  For the non-alcoholic components use 8 ounces of prickly pear syrup with the remainder (56 oz.) being margarita mix and all poured into the bucket.  The Cactus Candy syrup is thick and very sweet so try following directions first before you experiment.  When in a hurry or serving those that aren't aren't truly your "closest friends" just add 16 ounces of tequila.  While I wouldn't use the cheapest booze there is no reason to exceed the Jos&eacute; Cuervo Especial level for frozen drinks.  At this point you will have satisfying drinks that everyone will rave about.<br /><br />For a little more effort you can improve the mix, but let's review the objectives.  First you have to maintain the desired mix/alcohol ratio:  not enough booze results in a bucket of ice, too much booze and your bucket will have nothing but liquid.  Your goal is to have a drink mixture that will freeze to the extent that ice forms but will never freeze solid.  I wanted to use some liquors to improve the taste but had to maintain the "magic ratio" and too this end I use the following:<br /><br />  2 oz of Grand Marnier<br />  2 oz of Licor 43 (Cuarenta y Tres)<br />  4 oz of Everclear<br />  8 oz of tequila<br /><br />The Grand Marnier adds a fruitier note and the Licor 43, a Spanish liquor is used because it seems to heighten the taste of everything.  The Everclear keeps the alcohol in balance while the tequila completes its namesake.  I can taste the difference between the two but you or your friends may not.  The Licor 43 isn't cheap (about $40) so the experiment is for rich or the bold.  I generally keep 4 buckets of prickly pear mix in the freezer should a party breakout without notice.  Should the mix start to melt such that it can't be served return it to freezer and there should be little that is wasted.  Between the cold and the alcohol it should be safe to drink a long time.  I wouldn't know as my inventory turns over pretty rapidly with the help of guests.<br /><br />Lastly, keep a big pitcher handy during the blending.  The blender cannot mix the whole bucket in one go so do half, pour it in the pitcher then do the other half and finally pour both back into the bucket.  At this point the bucket contents will be well mixed so you can refill the pitcher, put the bucket back in the freezer and start serving guests.  If you are outside and it is humid there should be some frost around the drinking straws.  This indicates that the contents are well below freezing and the mix/alcohol ratio is in the right neighborhood.  I prefer the smaller (64 oz.) buckets as they are easier to store in my side by side refrigerator and the big buckets make a mess as you are trying to get all of the mixture blended using 2 pitchers.  if you use the 96 oz. buckets scale (multiply everything by 1.5) appropriately.<br /><br />Excessive consumption may occur so be prepared for overnight guests but may have benefits:  some discover singing and dancing talents long hidden, women may wake up next to a guy with a hairy back that they didn't like anyway and men may develop a new approach for that pretty girl that had previously threatened to call the police.  Enjoy

review/summary: Jelly Belly's are the Best
review/text: Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

review/summary: Missing ingredient!
review/text: I purchased these tomatoes. Yes, they came dented despite the bubble wrap covered box.  But, that didn't bug me. What irritated me is that when I opened the can and poured the contents into my saucepan there was a big leaf in it.  Looking at the ingredient list on the can, sure enough there is basil in it!  Amazon doesn't list it on their ingredient list and other than the tiny print list on the can there is no indication that this is crushed tomatoes with BASIL.  I am really disappointed because I would certainly not have bought this product had I known.

review/summary: Great dessert coffee or just for everyday!
review/text: Like most Keurig owners, we have had so much fun trying various flavors.  We stumbled across this one at a Target and bought it immediately. When we got home, I couldnt get the k-cup in the machine fast enough. The minute the seal is broken, you can smell the raspberry. As it brews, the aroma that fills your house is divine...just like chocolate and raspberry. I do enjoy the Van Haute Vanilla but I feel it is a weak cup of coffee and I don't think the vanilla flavor is very strong. The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle is the opposite...the flavor tastes as rich as it smells. And man, it is amazing and smooth, not too overpowering.<br /><br />I think this would be the perfect after-dinner coffee or a dessert coffee served with biscotti or some other coffee cookie. It isn't too sweet though and makes a great cup of coffee for anytime of the day as well.<br /><br />I love this coffee so much wrote this review. Other coffees I like (but am not writing a review for) are: Island Coconut, Timothy's Decaf, Sweet Tea (iced), Dunkin' Donuts (any of them), Chocolate Glazed Donut and Sleepytime Tea.

review/text: I just got this coffee in the mail today. I had been waiting for it for about a week, and when it finally came I immediately made a cup with my Keurig. I like this coffee because the flavor is distinct and strong. You can taste the raspberry and a hint of chocolate. It really  does taste like a raspberry truffle. You should probably know that I drink my coffee black. I don't know how strong the flavor would be with cream and sugar. It would probably be delicious though; I'll try that next.

review/summary: Rather pleased with this flavor
review/text: I picked up a trial pack of this at my local BB&B, and I'm pleased for the most part with this drink.<br /><br />The raspberry flavor is the most pronounced one, although you can taste the chocolate in the background. I went into this expecting raspberry to be the stronger of the two tastes (chocolate always seems to be a less pronounced flavor unless you add it in syrup format), so this didn't really surprise me. There is a tiny bit of what I can only describe as a "flavor additive aftertaste". It's not unpleasant, you can just tell that the raspberry is a chemical additive. (I don't mean this in a bad way.)<br /><br />Overall this is rather tasty and it went over well at home. I was a little hesitant about Van Houtte after tasting their caramel apple flavor, but this really was a nice drink. I'll more than likely end up purchasing it again.
