review/summary: Disappointing!!!!!
review/text: I have a Labrador/Mix puppy named, Max.  He is high energy and constantly needs to be busy.  I bought the product in hopes to help w/his teething and keeping him occupied.  Max, was able to remove/eat the treats w/in a day and a half.  This may be a good product for a purse dog, but definitely not medium size to large dogs.  For the price of the ball and its treats, it was not worth the money paid.

review/summary: My dog's favorite toys
review/text: I have a 70lb male Doberman who is capable of destroying nearly every toy I've given him.  The Starmark Everlasting treat toys, including this Everlasting Treat Ball are indestructible.  He spends hours playing and chewing this toy.  Sometimes he opts to just lay down and lick the treats I put in it.  You can opt to not use the everlasting treats if you don't want to.  Just throw some other treats in the center and the dog will be happy.  It's also a big enough toy that won't roll under my couch.  A huge plus.  I also tried some of the different flavor treats and my dog loves them.  I can't say enough good things about the durability of this toy.<br /><br />Some people mentioned that the treats pop out too easily.  I've seen this happen before, and for some reason only happened when I first got the toy.  I'm not sure if the inside gets stickier over time, but the treats have only popped out prematurely for my dog, and I put it back in and haven't a problem since.

review/summary: The Idea was nice
review/text: The idea was on the right track, but it look my thirty pound dog about a minute to dislodge the "everlasting" treat (which took him about ten minutes to consume). He's not a power chewer either. The pockets, inside the treat ball, made my financial loss a little more bearable - the ball itself will be useful.<br /><br />Pros: Won't have to buy the everlasting treats every so often.<br /><br />Cons: Will have to find something else to occupy him.

review/summary: Beware of Carpet Stains
review/text: My 35 lb cocker loves his new treat ball. The postman brought the treat ball in the morning and the dog spent all afternoon playing with it. Because I was busy and the dog was happily occupied I failed to notice for quite a while that the Everlasting brand chicken treat that came with the toy was making nasty stains all over the beige wall-to-wall carpet in my office. I'm pretty sure my pup isn't any more slobbery than any other avidly chewing canine. But his slobber and the chicken treat combined to create a trail of ugly mustard-colored carpet stains all over the room. In addition to a bunch of spots all over the place, I found a few large stains in out-of-the-way places where my dog had settled for awhile to lick and chew away at the toy. The treat ball itself is just fine -- I have no complaints about it as a quality dog toy. But I have serious issues with the food coloring that's used in the Everlasting treats that pop into the ball. I've just used up an entire aerosol can of carpet cleaner and an hour of elbow grease to remove the stains from my carpet. After this experience I won't be buying any Everlasting brand treats to put in my pup's new chew toy. If you're going to be using this product outdoors, then the Everlast treats might be just fine. But if you're planning to let your dog play with this toy indoors, and you've got nice flooring that you care about keeping reasonably clean, it's best to avoid the Everlast treat inserts.

review/summary: Not too impressed
review/text: I got the medium size for both my 20 pound corgis.  I put each in a crate with one of these, brand new.  In three hours when I came home there were no more treats.  Not really everlasting, but now I just put yogurt and peanut butter in and freeze them for a treat to keep them busy.  The refills are just too expensive when they go so fast.  They didn't chew the holder up yet, so that's a plus.  I got them for a bargain price so that is the only reason I bought.  Pet stores are charging way too much for these.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: Excellent for my small-breed dog. Your dog may prefer specific flavors so try them all as they come in two chews to a pack, small size treat for small size ball/holder. My pup likes the chicken it came with, but does not care for the liver; I put a different flavor on each side. My dog loves to lick and chew this and it seems to not be affected. I think this is my dogs favorite chew toy and I highly recommend your dog try one of these. The chews seem to last a long time and not break apart, so far. I recommend all chewing devices be supervised during use.

review/text: My dog-Chloe Cupcake-absolutely loves this toy! When the toy it empty she carries it around to let us know to refill it. She has destroyed the Kong toys like they were nothing, but this has so far withstood the test of her constant chewing. I'm not sure why there are quite a few who've had bad experiences with this toy...perhaps they've bought a size too small? Not sure...I just know I love this chew toy. Keeps Chloe busy and happy.

review/text: I bought the medium sized ball for my pug.  He managed to pry the brown "lid" off and ate and swallowed the damn thing.  I'm glad it didn't kill him, so I guess it was designed just in case a dog consumed it whole. I think the "lid" could pose a choke hazard to some dogs less voracious than pugs.

review/text: My dog loves the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YD8NS">StarMark Day-Glo Everlasting Fun Ball, Medium, Green</a> that you can stick treats into or just roll around and play fetch. I bought this one because I wanted him to chew on treats longer. He'll take his time with a small bully stick, but those get expensive. These would be more expensive because he had the treat out in a few seconds and chewed it up in a few minutes. Bummer!

review/summary: Keeps my dog busy for hours!
review/text: I had a friend who bought this for her malamute and told me he loved it, but that he figured it out very quickly and would somehow get the treat out in a few minutes. My dog is a more gentle pointer mix, so I thought I would still give it a try. I ordered it and have been extremely happy with it ever since! My dog is more of a "licker" than trying to chew or bite the treats off, so it lasts him at least an hour, and he absolutely loves it! He gets so excited when I bring it out for him to play with! I also love that you can buy a lot of great flavors. We started with the beef but they were so stinky and my dogs breath smelled awful, so we tried the mint ones and my dog loved them just the same AND his breath smelled better! The only downside is that my dog seems to have a little big of GI upset after chewing these in that his stool is a little softer. He also has a pretty sensitive GI tract in general, and my friend never reported her malamute having any issues so it's probably more of a "my dog" issue than with the treats themselves. I'm definitely happy with how the treat ball stands up to my dog's chewing and playing with it, and the one that belongs to my friend's malamute is still intact after years of use. This truly is a great product!<br /><br />I have definitely heard though of some other dogs finding a way to chew this apart, so if you have a very powerful chewer and want to try it, I would make sure to supervise them the first few times you let them have it.

review/summary: Truly Everlasting
review/text: This ball has lasted for almost a year with the zone of destruction that is my dog. She loves this ball simply for the fact that she can't defeat it. This thing even survived a battle with the riding lawn mower... The only reason why I didn't give it five starts is because the treats it comes with are too easy to get out. But if you stick treats in the middle compartment they last a bit longer.

review/summary: Works exactly as stated.
review/text: I had heard about these little toys about 2 years ago from my oldest sister who has a Shar Pei. She told me he absolutely loved it and she had to take it away because he would be panting out of excitement from chewing on it. I went to my local Petco and picked up just the treats without the ball to see if he liked them and the rest of my afternoon was spent chasing my Rat Terrier/Sheltie mix around my apartment trying to get the treat back.  Needless to say he devoured it after about an hour or so. I picked up the whole kit for about 19.99 at Petco. It comes with the ball and one chicken treat insert. I have read MANY reviews saying how there dog destroyed the ball or removed the treat in minutes. I'm not really sure how that happened as my little guy has pulled up carpeting before and has yet to even make much of a dent in the treat, let alone the ball. At first he was actually so frustrated that he just looked at the ball and whined/barked at us to get it out for him. Eventually I just took the treat out of the ball, let him lick it and chew on it just for about 10 seconds to get a taste for it again, and then I put it back in the ball.  He hasn't quit now for 45 minutes. I stuck some little treats I had laying around in the other side but it seems he could care less. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a way to keep their happy pet occupied and out of your hair!

review/summary: Great Feeding Puzzle
review/text: My adult dog was easily able to remove the included treat within a few minutes even when it was inserted backwards as another reviewer suggested, so I don't plan to buy refills. However, when I filled the toy with kibble, Regal and our Malinois foster puppy both had to work for a couple of hours to empty it. Neither of them damaged the toy so it seems to be pretty safe for them. However, as with any toy, I will continue to monitor them frequently to be sure they haven't managed to chew off a piece that could be ingested. The puppy still has most of her baby teeth so I don't know how the toy will fare with her in a couple of months when her mouth will resemble that of a crocodile, but Regal (a Bulldog/Siberian Husky mix) didn't faze the material and he is a dedicated chewer. I'd feel better about this toy if it were made in the United States rather than China but I believe it will be OK with restricted use. Regal gets all of his meals from food puzzles and this one adds some variety to the mix.<br /><br />I'm adding to this review because we have been using it for several months now. I raised the rating to 5 stars because it has been so useful and the dogs have not damaged it at all. The puppy mentioned above got all of her adult teeth but I was still able to put peanut butter in the toy to pacify her in the crate when she fussed. It kept her happy for a couple of hours and she was never able to bite off a piece of the material. We now have our own adult Malinois, Sizzle, and we use it with him as well. I put kibble in it and let him get his dinner that way when he needs to be crated. I bought another one so that I can give Regal and Sizzle their own. The new foster puppy is doing well without a peanut butter pacifier for now, but I won't hesitate to use it with her if necessary. I still suggest watching any dog carefully with a toy. They are all different, but so far our three serious chewers have safely enjoyed this toy for several months so I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Incredibly Long Lasting Treats, at Last!
review/text: We currently are fostering a Black Lab, and she likes to chew on anything and everything that might happen to fall in the floor. I tried getting her some rawhide bones and supposedly "long lasting" chew treats and she got through all of them in a matter of minutes. The everlasting treat ball has lasted for many weeks now and she is just about done with both sides. I put a BBQ treat in one side and the chicken flavor in the other and she loves both. She will sit and chew on it for hours. You can also put kibbles in one side and they fall out as they play for variety. If you have a dog that likes to chew, this is a must have.

review/summary: He Likes It!
review/text: I have an Australian Cattle Dog who, like most ACD's, tends to fixate on things . . . in the case of toys, this means destroying them as quickly and as thoroughly as possible (and then looking disconsolate because he has no toy). When I first put this down for him (with one of the everlast treats it came with), he wasn't particularly interested (though he did get anxious when the cats went near it, so clearly it was on his mind). But eventually he got into it. He worked the treat out pretty quickly and ate it with gusto. So I moved on to treats on the inside (a little jerky and some liver biscotti); it doesn't take him long to get them out, but he sure enjoys it. He's also getting a kick out of playing with it and chewing on it even now that it's empty. So far it's holding up, but I worry about those little flaps for treat entry; I can't imagine they're long for this world with his obsessive chewing. Frankly, I don't expect it to "everlast" -- but he's so happy in the meantime that I'm okay with it.

review/summary: Didn't realize my dog could love a toy so much!
review/text: I have an American Eskimo, she's only about 18 lbs but I got her the medium ball so that if she didn't take interest in it, I could give it to my sister's dog. My dog is very passive about the things I give her, she loves rawhide, but if Turq (my sister's dog) takes the rawhide from her, she doesn't care, same for pig ears, buffaloves, and all her other toys. She also chews through things pretty quickly, she's not very big but she can certainly destroy stuff. So anything everlasting sounds pretty good to me. I didn't realize how good it would be. My dog will always stare at myself and my family when we're eating, she'll beg and beg, until my dad gives her a scrap off his plate, she's completely spoiled. Doesn't matter what we're eating, she wants it, she'll drop anything to see if she can get some people food from us. Except this toy. Last night my sister and I were both eating and Kerrigan (my dog) wasn't even in the same room as us, and she was happily focused on this ball with the treat that comes in it. Even when I walked over her with my food, she didn't stop for anything. The first treat lasted about an hour for her, and she still plays with the empty ball a little, expecting me to throw it. It was also the first and only toy she has been possessive over, when Turq tried to take it from her, she growled. I love this product and I'd recommend it to anyone. I'll be getting refills as soon as I can make it out to the store!

review/summary: 4 stars for the toy; 2 stars for the treats
review/text: I keep buying puzzle toys for my Border Collie mix with the hope of finally finding one that will take longer than 10 minutes for him to figure out. I had high hopes for the Everlasting Treat Ball after reading so many good reviews. However, when I gave him the ball with the treat in it, he popped the treat out in about 5 minutes. I tried flipping the treat over so it points in as suggested by other reviewers and that lasted another 5 minutes or so. Then I jammed it completely inside the ball. That bought me another 5 minutes. I eventually had to take the treat away because he was eating it too fast. It later affected his digestion in a less than pleasant way. The treat is kind of gross-- it smells bad and leaves significant residue on the floor, dog bed, etc. I'm sorry I wasted the money on buying two (ridiculously expensive) replacement treats before knowing what I was getting into. That said, the ball itself is good for other things. I find that stuffing treats, frozen fruit, etc. inside of it keeps my dog occupied for much longer than the treat itself did. He spends more time with this ball than with any of the Kong toys he has, even the Kong Genius ones. I've also started feeding him his kibble shoved inside the ball. That way he has to work for a while to get his dinner instead of just inhaling it within 30 seconds. I'm still hoping, though, to find that holy grail of puzzle toys one day.

review/text: I have three boxers that destroy most toys.  I have found the Everlasting Treat Ball to be one of the most durable toys I've gotten for them.  They've figured out how to pluck the outside treats out and chew them separately and on that note, the outside treats leave a bit of slime and brown coloration on the floor/carpet/blanket but they do last a while.<br />In my opinion, the best part of this toy is the durability of the structure and the ability to put kibble or treats inside - that's the part that keeps my dogs occupied for hours.<br />Even though they've finally (over 6 months) damaged the structure of the toy, it is still usable to stuff treats in for their enjoyment.

Only problem is the little treats that are meant to put in the middle fall out and she pops out the everlasting disk in a matter of minutes. We just break up other treats we have that stay in the center for her and we will be buying the interlocking everlasting disks in the future. We actually have to buy another because our older dog that never has any interest in toys wants to play with it and our new dog doesn't like to share.

review/summary: Great toy for a gentle chewer
review/text: The large Everlasting Treat Ball has been a great toy for our 55-lb Basset. It fits just about every type of treat, and you can choose different ways of stuffing it. Our dog isn't a big chewer, so we haven't had the problems that others have had with this toy.<br /><br />A few notes on our experience:<br />- MOST IMPORTANT: The rawhide piece you see in the pictures came out right away, and became a chew-disk rather than part of the toy. We had to take it away so she wouldn't accidentally swallow it. (And there's another, sad review from someone whose dog choked on the rawhide and died - rawhide can be dangerous!!) I'd recommend supervising your dog the first time and seeing whether the rawhide comes out. Don't buy replacement rawhides until you're sure you need them.<br />- You can vary the challenge level by how tightly you allow the tabs to hold a treat. You can fill the inner section with kibble, or you can wedge a biscuit or hard treat into the tabs, or you could freeze soft stuff in there. There's no need to buy special treats to fit this toy - it'll work with whatever you have.<br />- Our dog likes to play with this ball even after the treats are out, throwing it to herself and chasing it around the house. We now give it to her (filled with treats) when we're going out as a way to reduce separation anxiety, and it almost always keeps her busy so she doesn't notice we're leaving.<br />- It's silicone plastic, so it's softer and quieter than hard rubber toys on wood floors.<br />- It cleans up very easily in the sink or dishwasher.<br />- Unlike the Kong or the Squirrel Buddy, it has big holes on two sides (the holes in the picture are on both top and bottom). So I'm not sure how much of a mess it would make with peanut butter or frozen soft treats - we haven't tried, because hard treats work fine for us.<br />- Doesn't fit a huge amount, so probably wouldn't work to feed your dog. Our dog takes about 15-20 minutes to get the treats out, then plays with it for a little while after that.<br /><br />Different dogs have different interests, but I completely recommend giving the Everlasting Treat Ball a try for your dog!

review/summary: Not so everlasting...
review/text: I bought this dog toy in the smaller size, with great anticipation of finally having something that my 1/2 Yorkie-1/2 Shih Tzu wouldn't chew up and destroy in one afternoon.  From that standpoint, I would say the toy was a success, because it actually took him about 24 hours to eat the ends out of the toy, nab the treat disk and be done with it.  &lt;sigh>  I'm still on the hunt for SOMETHING that Buddy can't destroy.  This, unfortunately, was not it.

review/summary: German Shepherd Friendly!
review/text: This product is a Godsend! I work from home and have a 1-year-old German Shepherd who constantly panders for attention. She's a very strong chewer and usually tears through anything I give her within one day, at most. The Everlasting Treat Ball has withstood the test of time! It usually takes her a week to get through one of the treats and she'll spend several hours working on it, which helps me get a lot of work done. She usually loses interest once she gets it down to a half-inch "teething ring" type shape, so I pop it out using a butter knife and give her a fresh one. I highly recommend this product, with no complaints!

review/summary: Great toy, skip the "everlasting" treat part
review/text: We picked up one of these on spec from the local pet store and ended up ordering another from Amazon because our older dog loved it so much he wouldn't share. We've put dry treats and some fresh cooked meat in the center area and it's led to 60 minute-plus play sessions for our dogs. We have 80-100 lb. dogs so we purchased the large size toy which has worked out just right.<br /><br />The "everlasting" treat included and then sold separately as a refill by the company should just be skipped. Our boys figured out how to pop them out from the toy inside of 20 minutes and I think that the treat must be very salty as they needed a lot of water to wash it down.<br /><br />Long story short it's the best toy we've bought in a while for catching the dogs' attention and being something they keep coming back to play with.

review/summary: Eureka!
review/text: I adopted a 5 year old Boxer mix, and despite my best efforts to buy him every toy on the shelf he refuses to go near any of them. When I tried the Everlasting ball, it was love at first sight! He's not a big chewer so the construction of the ball itself isn't an issue (although I would not recommend it for heavy chewers), and he is enamored of rolling it around trying to eat the treat! It worked so well bringing out the puppy in him, he even picked up a stuffed animal for the FIRST TIME and played with that as well!

review/summary: Great Rubber Ball, Flawed Treat Design
review/text: We've had this for about a week now. I have a 1 year old Beagle that destroys ever furry "super strong" soft toy, but he isn't interested in a lot of hard toys like tires, etc. We got this hoping that his food motivation would keep him occupied with a toy he can't tear apart.<br /><br />The Good:<br />  * It is VERY durable. He hasn't even managed to put a dent it.<br />  * We stuck a treat inside it, which is impossible for him to remove. He will happily spend several hours occupied trying to get it out. Yaaay!<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />  * It took him about 20 mins to pop the regular "everlasting" treat out. Without the ball to protect it, it's a 10 minute treat. :-( He can do this every time now.

review/summary: 10 Week Old Vizsla Puppy Likes the Large
review/text: I got the large on accident and it's great for my 10 week old vizsla puppy.  He is picking it up and flinging it and just chewing away.  It looks huge, but I think is better or just very different for him than the small would be.  Also, it's much cheaper on Amazon.  I got it at Petco for $25 and it was the same at Petsmart.  I think this will last him a long time.  I may even order the small for a different more mobile type of toy for him.

review/summary: great treat to occupy my dog
review/text: I have had the medium one for a couple months. In that time my dog's adult teeth have come in. When she first got the treat ball, she would bark and whine at it in frustration because she couldn't figure out how to get the treat after she licked it flat. She has her adult teeth now. It takes her a while but she can get the treat mostly eaten now; she hasn't figured out how to pop the treat out yet. That's a good thing! I gave a large one of these to a Lab friend who had it for all of 10 minutes before popping both treats out. For now this is still a great treat for my dog, but I don't leave it out unsupervised because our other dog gets jealous even though he doesn't really care to chew on it (he has never been a big chewer). So, I don't know if she would chew through the plastic if I left it out all the time like I've seen in some of the reviews.

review/summary: Get the right size and you'll be happy.
review/text: I can't imagine that any dog is a stronger chewer than my seventy pound lab girl. I didn't think I'd find a toy that interested her that she couldn't destroy in seconds.  We're working on day three and still see only a little difference in how much is gone from the treat, and she LOVES it!<br /><br />I appreciate the advice of some of the reviews I've read here.  Make sure you err on the side of purchasing a larger, rather than a smaller, ball if you have a question about size.  We bought the large for Ellie.  I can see that a dog would be able to chew it to shreds if it were too small for them, because they could get their jaws wrapped around it easily.  I think part of the fun of the toy seems to be the challenge of getting a grip on it.<br /><br />I've liked a lot of the suggestions I've read here, including items to stuff in the middle, and putting the disks in upside down.<br /><br />The disks pop in easily if you put them on a hard surface, put the ball over them and press down, popping the disk in place.<br /><br />Today the ball rolled under the bed, all the way to the wall.  She crawled under the bed to get to it.  She is obsessed with this toy, and that makes us both happier, because this girl needs to chew and I'm tired of buying toys that she rips to shreds in seconds.<br /><br />I'm sold on this toy and will order more disks online.  They come right to my house that way.  Five stars, two thumbs up, and all that!!  Now I'm going to look at other Starmark products.

review/text: This treat toy would get 5 stars if it weren't for 2 very important things: 1) the small treat ball is almost impossible to get treats into, as the opening is so tiny; 2) my dog had the disc treat out and wolfed down in less than a minute. Now I also have this treat ball in the large size for my German Shepherd and have not had the same problem with the disc treat coming out so maybe it's a function of the size, I don't know.

review/summary: Best dog entertaining device yet!
review/text: I have a very energetic young dog who loves to chew but most bones and rawhides last no longer than 5 minutes.  This treat ball with one of the treats in each side lasted her days with hours of nonstop chewing until I would have to take it away for a while.  She loves it and so do I!  I will say, once there is only a little rim of the treat left along the side you may want to go ahead and take it away because I let her have it past that point and she sorta tore up the rim a bit that holds the treats in because she was trying to get the last bit out.  I think it will still work just fine though for hours more entertainment for her.  Great product!! By the way, for people who say it is dangerous or got destroyed by their dog here are 2 points to consider:<br />1. you should never let your dog chew on any treat or bone like this without supervision<br />2. yes this is a tough product, but some strong chewers will just naturally destroy anything that comes their way no matter how durable it is and that is something you should know about your dog.  If they are a very strong chewer then you should try products like this keeping in mind that it may not last very long.

review/summary: The dog loved it....a little too much
review/text: My Jack Russell terrier mix loved this treat. More than life itself. He had it out of the ball in no time flat, so that wasn't much of a puzzle. But the treat is like crack for dogs. It's the only thing he's guarded. He's never growled when his dinner or a juicy beef bone is approached. He'd leave either for a chance for some lap time. But not with this treat.<br /><br />So...I would be wary. I'm just hoping it won't make him guard other things now.<br /><br />Oh, and for the price? It seems like they could include two treats, which the ball will accommodate.<br /><br />ETA: the ball does seem to be durable, which is good.

I literally had just put it together and gave it to her new and when I got back home an hour later she already had one side out, and was working on the second already. To her credit she didn't need to shred the silicone mold to get the end treat out, but none the less, this shouldn't be bought as a stimulation toy.

review/summary: This toy is amazing -but smells
review/text: After 5 months of near-perfect behavior, my golden retriever apparently discovered the puppy within herself and started destroying nearly everything. Toys that we have had for her entire life were suddenly being destroyed and stuff strewed across the house as if it were a warning to all other toys. She was destroying and swallowing 3-4 inch pieces of rope, curtain ties, everything! So it is with desperation that I went to my local pet store in an attempt to find anything destructible. From previous experience, I knew she didn't like Kongs and I couldn't bring myself to purchase anything that was merely a used tire marked to up a pet-toy price. With that, I found this toy and another "indestructible" chew toy. While the other toy is good, nothing holds her interest like this product. It has drastically improved her behavior while crated and all other toys have been spared a painful death.<br /><br />The only downside is that the product doesn't smell the best. As she is always playing with it, that means it is always near us. We have tried instituting a "no toys on the couch" policy but its hard to enforce.

review/summary: I'm still amazed!
review/text: I have a 9 y/o English Bulldog that is very food motivated. In fact, the only time he seems to be happy is if he's chewing on/ingesting something tasty. He goes through 9-inch compressed rawhides in a day and at $4-$6 a pop that gets pricey. He's got kongs and rollable treat balls but as soon as the food is gone he loses interest (naturally) and if he can't get the treats out easily enough, he gets bored and gives up.<br /><br />The Everlasting Treat Ball, however, is an entirely new ballgame! We had a rough start with it at first. He had the chicken ones that came with the ball and they really upset his stomach. If anyone knows about Bulldogs and their GI "issues" then you know that when their stomachs are upset, the entire house is miserable, if you catch my drift! (pun intended).<br /><br />Another issue we had the first time around was that he was able to get the second treat out within a few minutes (but not the first one it came with). That led me to believe that we weren't putting it in correctly, but no matter what we did, the end result was the same. So we gave up.<br /><br />On a whim I bought him some liver-flavored refills the other day and it's been almost 3 days and he's STILL working on the first one! It's a godsend! He'll leave it alone and come back to it a few hours later then spend another good hour or so with it. The best part about it (for us at least) is that there isn't any belly upset this time around! I paid around $8 for a refill of 2 and the first one alone has already lasted longer than a $5 rawhide...AND we don't have to dig slimy pieces out of his throat after he tries to swallows them. A win-win as far as I'm concerned.

review/summary: Large Everlasting Treat Ball + 1yo English Mastiff = Fun!
review/text: This is one of Mama's favorite toys. Sometimes I put small training treats and some larger treats inside. I don't bother to buy the refill discs. They are smelly, messy, and slimy. Plus, once they pop out if you aren't watching, they will be devoured in seconds!<br /><br />She has been unable to destroy it and has had it for at least 4 months.<br /><br />She can squish it in half with her chewing, but she has been unable to "tear" pieces off of it. She will play with it filled or not filled and she seeks it out when it is put away.<br /><br />Easy to fill by lifting a flap with one finger and stuffing (or dumping) treats inside.<br /><br />It's pretty heavy for a toy, but I've seen our yorkie pick it up and run off with it. (He prefers the Large Bento Ball).<br /><br />Large sizes are expensive at Pet Stores. If you don't need this toy right away, save the $$ and purchase on Amazon.<br /><br />2/21/12: Ball still going strong. Purchased the small sized for the yorkie, but it is way to small for Mama. I try not to let her have that one at all due to a potential choking hazard.

review/text: My dog needs attention almost 24-7... her favorite thing is to play fetch non stop.  I've been looking for toys that can keep her interest without me...I picked up the everlasting treat ball the last time I was in the pet stop... for the past two and a half days, she has played with this.  At first she spent 5 hours straight trying to lick the treat to death... it's still in there, a donut of a treat now... but since then, periodically she goes to town playing with it-- she throws it around the room like a kong, she carries it in her mouth (and she's only a 5lb chihuahua mix, so it's definitely a light toy), and she puts it between her paws and licks/chews it to death.  I've only had it for a few days, but I'm impressed with how long the treat part has lasted... I got one filler pack and I am going to get more!  These things are great... and I am imagining that on our next plane ride, this will come in handy.

review/summary: Everlasting Treat Does Not Last!
review/text: So we got this toy for our dog who gets bored easily, but loves treats. Unfortunately we left this "everlasting" treat ball with him for 15 minutes unsupervised and he managed to crack the large treat disc and gobbled it all up. We use the rubber toy now to fill it with kibble, a milkbone or jerky when we leave him in the apt by himself. It keeps him occupied for maybe 5-10 minutes because he knows he has to bite down in the center to crunch up the treats. It makes a huge mess so be warned. However, the pro to this toy is that it withstands his powerful chewing.

With everlasting treat ball, he has failed to destroy it (not for lack of trying though!).  This treat ball keeps him VERY entertained and engaged.  For many nights after we gave him his treat ball, we had to take it away from him to force him to sleep; otherwise he would have stayed awake all night chewing, playing, and licking on it.<br /><br />Certainly worth the investment!

review/summary: My Dog Loves It but It's Not Perfect
review/text: I have a very smart, often bored Australian Shepherd. She's about 40 pounds and I'd consider her a moderate chewer. She's not really destructive, but if she wants something bad enough, she makes it hers. We affectionately call this her "puppy crack dispenser". She brings it to us to fill up when she's finished the discs and she's PUSHY about it. To say she's addicted is putting it mildly. It keeps her attention for an hour or so at a time, which is a godsend. Right there, it makes this purchase worth it for us. As a matter of fact, we've just bought our second one. Which brings me to the bad...<br /><br />In no way is this an everlasting sort of toy, not in the ball part and not in the disc part. The first one we got her lasted for about 3 months of HARD use which really isn't bad considering the abuse it's gone through. We've replaced it now that little bits of blue plastic have started coming off and now that she can pry the discs out way too easily. Just as it started to get easier to put them in, due to use, it meant it took her WAY less time to get them out. The refills are just too expensive for three hours of entertainment when it would take her a couple of days to pry them free when the ball is new.<br /><br />Also, the slits in the middle to insert smaller treats open too wide to make it much of a challenge for my girl to empty it, so we skip that part.<br /><br />Overall, the fact we've replaced this toy when it started to wear speaks volumes. She loves it and we love anything that keeps her happy and distracted from her velcro-like tendency to stick to us when we're trying to cook or putter around the house.

review/summary: A toy my puppy can't destroy!
review/text: I originally ordered a package of everlasting treats to see if my puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting, so I had my doubts if I'd buy many more seeing as they are expensive for an hour of chewing. The second one lasted her a couple of days, so I did purchase another pack. The next ones lasted her about 3 days each, so next I purchased the treat ball. She likes to play with it, but can't gobble up the treats. I've got 2 treats in the ball now, she's had it for several days, and everything is intact. She likes to play with it, it seems tough enough to withstand her chewing (4-1/2 mo. old, 45#, husky/g.shepherd). This is a toy we like with treats she enjoys. I wish the treats were made of something more nutritious, but I'm okay with her having them especially since she doesn't eat them in one sitting anymore. My puppy, Akiak, gives this product two paws up!

review/summary: Non-everlasting treat ball
review/text: I bought this for my daughter's dog. He is a hybrid, probably Australian cattle dog and Jack Russell and weighs less than 40 lbs. It took him all of 2 minutes to figure out that he could get the large treat out of the ball by getting one canine tooth under the edge and pulling. The second one came out even faster! The treats themselves did take him about 5-10 minutes to eat. As far as entertainment value and boredom relief while in his kennel? I couldn't even give it to him in the kennel because the ball itself was too easy to chew up once the treats were out of it.<br /><br />Not impressed, not worth the money, doesn't do what it's advertised to do, won't bother ordering more of the treats to fit it as they are quite expensive and I can keep him entertained longer with a Kong or Nyla Bone. Modification in design so the treat doesn't pop out so easily might fix it, but at this point, for the price, don't bother.  Waste of 20 bucks.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: This is a great product and virtually indestructible.  Our lab enjoys it and will chew it for hours and if I fill both sides it can last from a few hours to a few days depending on her mood.  However, our golden retriever does nothing more than sniff it and walk away.  She has very little interest in this toy. So it will depend on the dog but is definitely one of the few chew treats that isn't gone in less than 15 minutes.

review/text: I bought 2 of these balls for my black lab mixed mutts. They had the treats popped out of the balls in less than 5 mins, we kept putting them back in but 30 seconds later they had them out again. Finally gave up and just let them eat the treat but had to watch them since they were somewhat small and I was worried they might choke on them. It took them about 10 mins to finish off the treat. My dogs aren't even serious chewers and at $20 a pop for the ball and $7 for the treats this is a total rip off. I would rather just give them a rawhide chew for 3 bucks. Good concept, wish KONG would make one. I'm taking these back to the store tomorrow!

review/summary: Gone in 20 min
review/text: I have a 2 year old small rottweiler mix. When i bought this toy she was just shy of 1 1/2  and was chewing through everything so after chewing through our third red kong in the matter of a month I was getting desperate and decided to try the everlasting treat ball. I bought the large size to slow her down. In five min she plucked out the treat and devoured it. Since the toy itself must of still had the smell of the treat she proceeded to rip the ball itself apart. In the 20 min I left her alone with this toy it was in about 30 little pieces, and then i had the pleasure of finding more pieces as they came out the other end. Overall the only thing that can actually withstand her if a large black kong (she cracks them in about 2 months) and the nylabone (those last four months) but this treat ball is anything but everlasting.

review/summary: This thing is a Godsend
review/text: I own a 3 year old pemmy corgi and this thing is just the best thing since wet dogfood to him. If I put the ball with 2 treats in it in front of him, I know he is going to be busy for the next 2-3 hours just licking it. And if the ball is empty, he constantly drags the empty ball around the house to chew on...I think he's subtly hinting at me to get him more treats for it. He's not exactly mister super powerchew, but he can tear a wayward shoe up if one gets left of the floor. So having something to redirect his attention without the noise/danger of a nylabone (or the weird gross chips off an antler chew) is just fantastic.<br /><br />So far the vanilla mint and BBQ flavored treats are his all-time faves. The vanilla mint especially. I tried the liver treats and they smelled awful and he didn't seem as interested in them.<br /><br />There has been minimal staining. But we have mostly hardwood and he can't get on the large furniture fixtures 'cause of those little corgi legs. The few times there has been anything left over from the treat on a blanket/comforter, it's washed right out. And even then it was less of a stain and more of a smell.<br /><br />My friend has an older cocker spaniel who constantly futzes around the house. I told her to try these treats, and she was like, "No, nothing ever works and they're pretty expensive." So one day I brought her an everlasting treat to try. (My dog was obviously mad at me for dipping into his stash, but oh well.) Now, her dog is missing most of its teeth due to age, so I figured just the treat would be enough to occupy her. Aaaand sure enough, I was right. Dogs go crazy for these things if they're food motivated! My friend is totally going to buy a stock of these treats as well.<br /><br />The only, ONLY real downside to this is that one day my dog managed to pop the vanilla treat out and with his chewing it was gone in like 20 seconds. He's also got a sensitive stomach so his stomach was upset for a couple of days afterward. However! It's totally not the treat's fault my dog has stomach issues. I just think the ball could do with more suction to hold the treats in a little better. But that's the only time it happened. Like everyone else says, BUY A SIZE LARGER. I read the reviews here FIRST and then bought the large size for my corgi and it's worked out great.<br /><br />I see a lot of complaints here but the thing about buying ANYTHING for your dog, whether it be a treat, a brush, shampoo, etc. You have to KNOW your dog. If you know your dog can chew through a table-leg, it's probably going to be able to tear up the foam of this ball. If you KNOW your dog is NOT food motivated, then it's probably not going to be interested in what is essentially a giant flavored treat for more than 5 minutes.<br /><br />As for me? I'm 100% satisfied. I just wish the treats cost a little less so I could keep them around the house more.

review/summary: Just what the doctor ordered!
review/text: We have a 15lb, soon to be 9 year old, chihuahua, dachshund mix who is by no means a chewer but he is an OCD licker. He primarily licks his paws and he also has a slightly elongated soft palette so he often just licks the air if you will. He has a history of stress colitis and overall a very sensitive digestive system. So, I was given the task of trying to find him enrichment that was food incentivized (as he loves food/treats) but wouldn't hurt his digestive track.<br /><br />So, I ordered this ball and it arrived today. He's totally into it! We're hoping that because he can't really break down the treat inside the ball he'll just sit and lick and keep him pre-occupied. He's been at it an hour and so far hasn't made a dent, he's growling at it which is kind of entertaining. The ball came with two chicken treats included which I didn't realize so I ordered the digestive sensitive ones too. I am going to try the chicken to see how he reacts to it.<br /><br />I'll update my review in a few days ending overnight results. So far, it's a total hit! Also, I ordered the medium, when I opened the package I was kind of scared because it seemed large but watching him try and eat it makes me realize that it's the perfect size. Anything bigger or smaller wouldn't work. I hope this review helps, I think it's a great toy!<br /><br />UPDATE: We had no problems overnight or this morning. He's still working on the one from yesterday. His stomach doesn't seem upset and we slept through the night without constant licking! I think this will be my new gift for the holidays to family! A definite buy!

review/summary: Best Toy Ever!
review/text: We have a 50lb lab mix that needs to stay occupied or else she's constantly whining and barking. We go through tons of raw hide and bull sticks, but really needed something that could occupy her time for longer. This toy is it! We had a beautiful 3 hours of peace and quiet while she went at the treat. Because of the domed shape, there's no way for her to bite the treat out, so it stays put! After two hours she gnawed the treat down to a flat level and within another hour she'd managed to wear down the middle of the treat (so it looked like a donut)...but it was still securely held in the toy. I'd imagine it'll last another hour or so...ultimately she'll get 4 hours of enjoyment (and so will we) out this one treat. I can only imagine what would happen if we put a treat on each end!

review/text: We have an almost 2 year old Doberman. Over the past year he has managed to tear the KONG apart. So, just 4 days ago we got him the "HURLEY" made by WEST PAW DESIGN, and there is already chunks coming off of it. However, this was the very first toy we ever bought him, he chews on it everyday, and it has no marks on it. We used to buy the refills, but now we just put random treats in it and he loves it...If you are a dog owner, and you cannot find a toy to last, this is the toy you want, lasted longer than a KONG, its versatile and very enjoyable for the our boy. You will not be disappointed in this toy.

The large puck shaped things are too easy for my dog to remove so I load one of those and some dog biscuits into the ball once he gets the puck out I take that away.  Too much treat at one time for him.  He doesn't mind cause I think he likes his biscuits better anyway.  After tonight's 4 mile hike he is still into his everlasting... stuffing it with his normal biscuits keeps him entertained and preoccupied. He has brought it to me tonight about three times.  Each time I say Yep there is more... and toss it back to him...

review/summary: Everlasting depends on the dog!
review/text: I have two dogs that both like this toy. I'd rate it a 3 for one and a 5 for the other, so I've given it a 4 overall.  For one of my dogs, it's quite the challenge to get treats out of the center and he'll spend hours licking the outside "caps" if I put them on. And, even when he's done with the caps, he'll still lick the ball part getting every last scent of food off of it. For him, it is the perfct toy that amuses him for hours. For my other dog, she can literally pop the caps off and eat them in minutes. Inside treats take her a few more minutes to pop out. She's 15 lbs of pure chewing power with jaws of steel. Of the two of these balls that I own, one is starting to tear a bit in the center from her biting down to allow the treats to fall out.  Even though she can get the treats out and eat them quickly, I'm still rating it a 3 because she likes to play with the ball even when it's empty. Because it has flat sides, she can bounce it and it will roll, but usually stops before it goes under couches etc that will cause me to have to climb under the furniture to retrieve the toy for her. (That's always a plus!)The treats that the manufacturer sells to accompany this toy are rather pricey, so I will often substitute my own, more cost-efficient treats or dog-safe veggies/fruits. In short, I'd recommend this, but it's not a miracle toy that will stimulate every dog and dogs that do chew it a lot should be supervised for safety.

review/summary: Gives me some time out!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>We adopted a six year-old retired husky stud from a farm.  Tock came to our suburban DC home like a 60lb ball of energy and always wanted to run, run, run.  When at home he either slept or chewed our furniture.  We sprayed our furniture with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EI1BRO">NaturVet Bitter Yuck No Chew Spray</a> to make it taste bad and redirected his chewing tendencies towards this toy.  As you can see, he loves the toy and although he is NOT a food-motivated dog, it combined with the Bitter Yuck to stop him from destroying property.<br /><br />As per other reviews, the treat is indeed difficult for my hands to stuff into the toy (my fiance did it in the end). Tock has been trying to get the treat out for about a week and not yet succeeded.  The way he manipulates the toy simulates how he would gnaw marrow out of a bone, engaging his paws as well as his jaws.  As an additional benefit, he is also less obsessed with running now, as you can see from the video.  The product does not smell or become sticky.  It is an outstanding product.

review/text: I have a toy poodle who is very toy motivated (and heavy into chewing as a puppy to boot), so my husband bought this for her thinking it would keep her occupied, at least for a good 20 minutes. Unfortunately, she had the treat portion out of the rubber holder in less than 5 minutes and our other dog (who, incedentally is food motivated) was eating it, and she was soon looking for something else to chew on as a puppy. The rubber "holder" makes a great throw toy, and is a good food pacer in the bowl of the other dog. It's also good to put a greenie through so they don't eat them too quickly. It is not an everlasting treat at all.

review/text: I have a 2 year old black lab mix who is very destructive to most toys that she encounters.  Kongs are very well made, but do not hold her interest for long.  I tried the Everlasting treat ball after checking reviews, because it is a bit of an investment, especially if it is something my dog would get bored with easily or be able to destroy.<br />She loves this toy!  The first day, she was at it for 2 hours, enjoying the everlasting treat stuck inside.  We had to take it away from her so she would go outside!  The material is very tough and she seems to be able to not penetrate it.  She is able to carry it in her mouth (she tries to drop it to make the treat pop out, but it has stayed intact).  I highly recommend this toy to keep a large, strong dog happily occupied.

review/text: I was very disappointed when my dog had the everlasting treat out within 5 minutes.  And when I put it back in and let it dry, he had already figured it out and popped it out in seconds.<br /><br />I think this is because it was too small for him.  It says for dogs "under 40 lbs", and my dog is a little shy of that mark.  The large looked really big and the product says that medium is good for under 40lbs... Apparently not though.  Since he could get his mouth around the edge of the toy, he could pop out the everlasting treat.<br /><br />Not sure it's a bad product, just maybe the wrong size.  But now I'm too scared of wasting $20 on the large in case that's a dud too.

review/summary: Wonderful product
review/text: I have 2 black lab mix dogs (littermates).  They are now 2 years old.  They didn't tell me when I got them that part of the mix was beaver.  These dogs can chew anything.  If it squeaks, it takes on average 10 seconds from being new to being destroyed.  Don't even get me started on toys that have stuffing.  Within the last two weeks, I've started allowing them to be uncrated in my house without me there.  Previously, they were completely untrustworthy, but I feel really guilty crating them while I'm at work.  And I thought they were acting more grown up.  Not chewing my stuff, just theirs.  So, I came home one day to find a highlighter destroyed (on carpeting, of course).  The next day the victim was one of their dog beds that they'd always left alone.  So, out of desperation I tried this product (and paid way more than the price at Amazon at a local pet store).  These things are AWESOME.  They keep their attention for hours and a treat lasts for about 2 days.  My one dog loves hers so much that she's like obsessed with it.  And the material it's made of seems to be unchewable to them (which I initially worried about, having not found anything in nature or manmade that they couldn't destroy).  I love these things.

review/text: I have 2 retrievers (7 months and 1 year) and they are basically 60 pounds of raging teeth.  They destroy virtually every dog toy (not to mention legos, briefcases, shoes, ethernet cables, small trees, socks, ... you get the picture)  that comes through the house in about 10 minutes.  They have never been interested in Kongs and rawhides just only hold their attention for so long.<br /><br />I found these at the store last week and bought a couple.  My dogs won't leave them alone.  They love the "snack balls" that come in them and they withstand hours and hours of chewing.  Even my 13-year-old sheltie who doesn't even like chew toys likes these things... My only complaint?  The petsmarts in my area can't keep them in stock so I have to order online.<br /><br />If your dog/puppy is a chewing machine... get these toys... lots of them... keep them in the crate, the living room, anywhere your dog hangs out.  The shoes you save may be your own!<br /><br />BTW, to get them interested, you want to find something soooooooo doggie delicious for the inside... give your dog a taste and smell of that before you stuff it in the middle.  Then stuff it in the middle and put the "caps" on. also, be sure to let the caps "dry" before giving them to your dog or the caps pop right off (you have to moisten them to make the pop in easier)

If anything entertains her for more than a half an hour, it's amazing!

review/summary: My dog is obsessed with this ball
review/text: I went on Amazon looking for some type of dog chew or hard food that would take a long time for my dog to get through, but not so hard that she would give up.  She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes.  I wanted to find something to cut into her boredom and downtime, but not add a lot of calories.<br /><br />The first day I put it together (took about one minute) and rolled it across the floor.  She slowly took after it, investigated, and I went to make dinner.  I enjoyed my first dinner at home in about a year that didn't involve my dog staring at me hoping for a handout.  She just obsessed over the ball, licking it, and grinding at it with her teeth.  After dinner I checked it, and she had made what appeared to be almost negligible progress on the treat.  We watched a movie in peace (other than this constant weird panting/slurping noise from the other room).  At some point, we realized she had been working on this thing for about three hours.  My wife checked her mouth, she was afraid her gums would be bleeding or that her teeth would be ground down to the gums.  But no sign of damage.  We took it away from her and put it on top of the fridge, and she sat there staring up at the fridge for about half an hour.<br /><br />I'm now on my third day, about three hours a day, still working on the first two discs that fit on opposite sides of the ball.  I think maybe she's gotten through about half of it.  She's actually penetrated one of the discs with a hole that goes all the way through.  She's obsessed.  While she has it, she doesn't want to do anything else.  If I go to pet her (which she normally loves) she treats me as an irritant keeping her from her ball.  Want to walk (normally her favorite thing)?  Nope.  Maybe after I'm done with this ball in another 16 hours I'll walk.  I wonder how long she would be on this ball if I let her?  Her jaws must be cramping up.  I get the feeling I could give it to her, go to bed, and wake up to see her with bloodshot eyes still working on the ball.  It's like crystal meth for dogs.<br /><br />Oh my god, while I'm writing this my dog accidentally rolled the ball under a table and she can't get to it.  She looks like an alcoholic staring at a drink they can't reach.  I actually feel sorry for her.  It's almost 9pm and she's been on this thing since 6pm.<br /><br />Anyway, for my dog, this was exactly what I was looking for.  I give it 5 stars.

review/summary: FINALLY a treat for my dog that lasts!
review/text: I am so glad that I purchased this item for my dog.  I have a golden retriever that is a very aggressive chewer. I cannot begin to count the number of toys, chews and/or treats I've bought for him that claim to be for aggressive chewers, only to be devoured or torn into shreds in less than an hour.  I hesitated in purchasing this item because of the price (I'm obviously tired of brands not living up to their description) but I am very happy to say that my dog worked well over 4 hours before the treats were gone.  He loved the taste of them and due to the design, they were challenging for him to get out so he really had to work on it.  Another thing I liked was the fact that the ball itself isn't hard, but feels gel-like and that is appealing to him.  This is by far one of the best things I've bought for him and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog that loves to chew!<br />UPDATE: Still a challenge for my dog after many months...he has figured out how to pop out the treat but I now insert it upside down so that the treat is concave instead of convex and that has worked very well.

review/summary: Be sure to order appropriate size
review/text: I am obsessed with researching stuff and I was nervous about ordering such a spendy dog toy.  I am very happy I did!  I originally purchased a small for my 10 lb wire fox terrier puppy (chews on EVERYTHING-he's teething), after getting it home I realized how some folks would have problems w/their dog popping out the treats too fast.  IMO, order the largest size your dog can have fun with.  I exchanged the small for a medium and it's worked out great. This way, he can't get his jaws around it and he can't pop the treats out-he just licks it to death, rolls it everywhere and growls at it b/c he can't get to the treats-which is the whole point of the toy. Like the reviewers before-know your dog and order bigger.  I have also read that you can put the refill treats in upside down to make it more difficult.  Hope this helps!

review/summary: Chew-Zilla was denied destruction
review/text: I have a year and a half old chocolate Labrador retriever, Loki, that chews and chews hard. I bought this toy because a neighbor who has a yellow lab has had the same toy for over a year.  I can buy a toy and Loki will have it broken or severely damaged within minutes.  It's easy to kiss 10 dollar toys good bye in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br /> I have had the product for about a month and it is by far Loki's favorite toy, even without treats.  I have played tug of war, fetch, and other dog favorite games; the ball-like object is in perfect condition still.  He will carry the toy about the house in his mouth, very regal and proud looking, as if he's King In The Castle.<br /><br />Some dog toys over time will gain a very bad odor.  After a month of constant use, this thing does not give off an odor that I can tell.  I won't put my nose or mouth near it, but from a couple of feet away, it still seems to smell like new.  If this ever gains an odor of some sort, I will probably resort to washing it and then adding some vanilla extract to the water to give it a humanly pleasant flavor.  I have done this for other toys and Loki seems to have a renewed interest in them.<br /><br />I have not allowed him to take the toy outside as we have several feet of snow and that would just be begging to be lost.  Based on the design, this thing will be a dirt magnet on the inside, especially since my backyard is in quasi-woods with zero grass.<br /><br />The treats that came with it seemed to be enjoyable for Loki.  It took him about an hour and a half to eat.  He didn't figure out how to pop them out as some people have stated.  He just gnawed and licked it the whole time.  The treats are a bit expensive, as I can buy raw hides or real bones for less.<br /><br />Peanut butter is your friend.  Smear some on the inside and Loki goes crazy trying to lick and clear it.  You can break up dog treats or put dog food in it and it will slow them down.  Loki has become an expert at getting them out, removing them in less than a minute.<br /><br />With all of that said and done, I would highly recommend this treat to anyone who has a dog that can truly chew.  It has held up over a month, which is very rare for a dog toy, and it has done so with not a scratch or gouge to the toy which has never been done.  I put these on the same level as the dog toys from Old Navy!

review/summary: Not a great product for its cost
review/text: The Everlasting Treat Ball is a great concept but poorly executed. The Everlasting Treat end caps come off very easily with a minimum amount of slobber. My puppy would lick them (because I'm sure they taste great) and within 5 minutes, the caps were off of the ball. The soft rubber makes it very easy to get them out this way. And they're a little too expensive to be made so poorly.<br /><br />My puppy loves to chew the ball to get any inner treats and food out, but there are better products on the market for that. Very disappointing product.

review/summary: Love the ball, treats not so much
review/text: I bought this for my Boston Terrier, Cookie, who can destroy most toys in less than an hour.  I thought the idea of a treat inside would slow her down a little.  Unfortunately, the treat did not suit her finicky palate, and she simply worked it out of the ball and left it on the floor.  The ball itself, however, has turned out to be Cookie-proof.  Months after the purchase, she still plays with it.  It bounces nicely, and doesn't roll under the furniture as much as other balls.  I've also found that if I stuff it with her regular treats (small bits of chicken jerky) or her kibble, it does keep her occupied for a while.  Although she chews on it, I can find very little evidence of toothmarks, so whatever this is made of is pretty strong.  I would give this more stars if it was easier to load, but then it would probably be easier for her to un-load.  Overall, a tough little toy, and one of Cookie's favorites.  A little pricey, but hey, she's worth it!

The other dog in the house, a border collie mix, has it gone in maybe twenty minutes.<br /><br />I bought it thinking it would be worth the price if it lasted a couple days, but if you have a dog that can consume a medium sized rawhide bone in one sitting, you are probably going to find that these are not "everlasting".<br /><br />Aside from wishing the treats would last longer / be cheaper, it is a good product, and the dogs love it.  But at a cost of $4 per treat there are other options out that last longer.

review/summary: Everlasting ball, but not everlasting fun
review/text: I bought the medium ball for my 5 year old lab mix as a Christmas gift. She's a hard core chewer so I was looking for something that would not be destroyed in one day... or in 10 minutes. She was happy to get it and plopped herself on the floor and starting chewing on the treats. It took her only 5 minutes to pop one treat out and start going to town on it. Dang, so much for the challenge. Maybe she was just lucky is what I thought, so I put the treat back in the ball and went to the bathroom to wash my hands and came back in under a minute or two and the treat was out yet again. So now I'm just letting her gnaw at the one treat which she's been at for over 15 minutes. I'm going to try buying the everlocking treats for the ball next to see if they're more of a challenge. But if that doesn't prove to last longer than 30 minutes or longer I'm not sure the whole product is worth it. For how easy the treats pop out and how expensive they are to purchase it might not be worth it in the long run. Oh well, I guess what matters the most is that my dog is happy with the ball treats or no treats.

For $20 I bought this, took it home and had hope for about 7 minutes.  She got the treat out, and I messed up by pushing it in too hard, and getting it stuck in between the 2 sides.  (In theory, this was the most amount of time the toy went without having the treat popped out.)  After she licked at that for a while, I was able to push the treat out and get it back to the place that it belonged.  Pop. Pop. Pop.  She is now a pro treat grabber, who can get these everlasting discs out within 3 seconds flat. 2 if you don't count the time she sniffed at it.  Now I have a $20 ball to play fetch with.

review/summary: Hooray for the Treat Ball!
review/text: My sister's youngest son had a pacifier which was nicknamed "Pluggy", which would keep him content for long stretches of time - and this is the doggy equivalent.<br /><br />I have a 17 pound Bedlington Terrier, for whom I purchased a Medium sized Everlasting Treat Ball, and we _both_ love it.  The "everlasting" treats that come with the ball were okay, but when they were in the ball she would lose interest because they were just too difficult to make any headway on, and when they were outside the ball she'd just chew them up in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />The real fun is putting small treats inside it (I use Charlee Bear brand turkey liver and cranberry treats which are about the size of a lima bean) and watching her go.<br /><br />There are several ways to get at them, she's discovered - rolling by poking it with her nose will sometimes yield results - smacking it with her paw is also sometimes lucky - and squeezing it with her jaws, which she can _barely_ do.  I think this is the secret - if she had a small she would be _too_ successful, and that would take the challenge out of it.<br /><br />I've had this for over a year, and it has sustained pretty much no damage, although shoes, electronics, socks and other items around our house had been completely destroyed before its arrival.  She can carry it sideways by biting on the flat part - the only problem is that we spend a lot of time looking for it when it gets hidden under things.  She knows the phrase Treat Ball by heart - and will usually go find it when asked - in order to get a refill - except when it has gotten into somewhere she is afraid or unable to go.  I'm buying another one so hopefully we can cut our hunting time in half.<br /><br />TREAT BALL RULES!

review/text: Bought this at big box store and spent mega for it, but my Mal loves it. She chews on the treat until she gets a hole in the end of it, then slams it to empty the treats inside. Only down side is when she throws it, look out!She is a heavy duty chewer with powerful jaws, but can't get her jaws  completely around the large size toy. If she could, she would probably destroy it to get treats. She loves it and will go get it when it is empty so I can refill it.  I don't know if they are all the same, but it is hard to get the treat top onto her toy (I leveraged it with a screwdriver) this may be why she doesn't simply pry the treat "lid" out. It sure isn't because she isn't clever enough to do so. I more think she just can't get the right leverage because of the size of the toy. She can spend hours with it. Great toy.

I was having a heck of a time but finally go the small one reloaded, forget about the large one. I just ended up giving them the treat not in the ball!! And that is an expensive treat to get demolished in a matter of minutes. It lasts longer if I can get it in the ball of course. I wish I could find another treat that they could chew on, that lasted and was less expensive. If anyone has an idea on an easy way to load the ball-post-it. Maybe I just got an extra stiff one. lol

The inserts are a little expensive but well worth the price for the amount of time your dog will enjoy this product.  So far she has not been able to damage the ball itself, after 8 months.  For me that means it should last about two years or more before I have to replace it.  For a puppy/dog toy that is "everlasting".  I love it and highly recommend it.  Just a note: my dog is small and the medium size ball seems perfect.

review/summary: If you can only buy one dog toy, make it this one!
review/text: We have a two year old miniature pinscher and a one year old papillion. During the first four months that we had them, these two literally chewed holes in my kitchen walls (yes,walls!!!) and rounded the corners of all of my cabinets. That's the thanks I got for penning them in the kitchen while we were in bed or at work. No toy had ever survived more than an hour, especially with the minpin. The Everlasting Treat Ball helped to turn that all that around. We bought all three sizes and they play with them all. They both love the treats that are marketed to go with the toy, but the minpin pops them out way too easily (even the large ones), so I usually just stick with filling the inside with carrot pieces, dog cookies, or even just a handful of their regular food. It keeps them busy for hours of destruction-free chewing. If I really need them to be good for a while, I smear a little peanut butter in it. I pop the toys in the dishwasher once a week with no ill effects. The only real negative that I can say is that they are pretty expensive and hard to find in the pet stores.  Also, I don't bother with the (expensive) plug-in cookies that they sell unless I know that the papillion is the only one that will be working on it (she's a much lighter chewer than the minpin). If it were just the papillion, the "cookie" would last several days.  Over all, great product for destructive chewers!

The other boxer was content to chew the toy with the treat still in it.  Both of them like to nose it around and wait for treats to fall out.  I'm still finding the balance between a treat small enough to fall out and a treat that stays in and keeps their interest for longer.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: I bought this toy for  my 1 1/2 year old corgi, I bought the medium sized. The "everlasting treat" lasted about 2 minutes, but the blue portion is GREAT. I have been stuffing dried chicken chews in there or even a medium sized soft treat and it takes my dog at least an hour to get it all out. He love the toy and it keeps him busy for a long time. Skip buying the treat refills because they are too easy for the dog to pop out and gobble down, just buy a fairly large, hard treat and wedge it in there and then it becomes "everlasting". I bought mine at Pet Club and it was MUCH cheaper than amazon and petsmart. The medium size was I think $14.99 and the treat refills were something like $3.00. This is my favorite "interactive" toy so far and it keeps my dog busy the longest with the smallest amount of treats.

review/summary: Neat Concept...but dissapointing
review/text: Neat concept...but disappointing results.  Our dog figured this toy out very quickly.  I agree with the other poster, it is hard to load the treats, so I do not know how a dog can get them out so quickly.  The fun only lasted for at most 2 minutes.  She still plays with the blue part of the toy every now and then, just with no treats.

review/summary: love it!
review/text: I have a lab/hound mix (9 months old) that eats everything and destroys everything within a matter of minutes.  I have bought many other toys advertised as "almost indestructible" to have them chewed up and ruined.  I was not expecting much from this toy.  Well it has been over two hours and my pup is still going strong.  Not only that but when it was time for his walk he ran out, did his business and wanted to return right away to his new toy!  I would definitely recommend it and I plan on buying refills tomorrow!

review/summary: Didn't Last
review/text: Got this for my 9-yr-old Australian shepherd.  I also bought the orange one for the younger dog.  Both dogs were able to remove the treats from the balls in under 10 minutes. (It took me at least 5 minutes to put the treat in.) I'm glad I tried it, but won't get any more.  Neither of my dogs is a very aggressive chewer...just very clever.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I purchased this to give my dog something to do while he is in his crate while we are away at work. Just to see if he liked it I gave it to him earlier today, he's chewed on it nonstop for hours. I actually took it away from him a few times because he seemed to get a crazied addiction to it and probably should have breaks.  He's never shown any sign of toy or food aggression before but boy he did not like when we took it away.<br /><br /> I would say that after about 4hrs of a 6 month lab chewing on it, it probably has a few more days before we need more of the discs. There is not a single tooth mark on the blue rubber piece. Overall I think this is a really quality product that he has a blast playing with and hopefully will never get bored of and we can use for years to come. Most of all I enjoy the freedom of having something that holds his attention longer than 5 minutes, I like that he is now able to be out of his crate while we watch a movie or do chores and not worry about him wandering off and getting into stuff.

review/summary: NOT for heavy chewers!!!
review/text: I bought the Everlasting Treat Ball (Large sized) for my 45 lb mixed breed dog, who is an aggressive chewer. This is the same dog that went through a red Kong in a day, and a Kong Extreme in a few months, and will liquefy any tennis ball in seconds. I heard great reviews on this and read about it in a book as well, and after MONTHS of debate decided to pick this up at my local pet store when it was on sale. I just gave it to her less than 20 minutes ago and she already has several chunks out of it.<br /><br />It did "challenge" her for a few minutes, as I put kibble and treats inside. She got the disk out in a few minutes and enjoyed that (chicken flavor) then went crazy getting at the food inside. So crazy, that she has taken several chunks out of the plastic already. And eaten them. Great. She did seem to have fun rolling it around getting the food out, but then went to chewing on the plastic.<br /><br />For a replacement, I got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YHTYC">Everlasting Fun Ball Large</a> in large from the same company- and its been over a week so far and she loves that toy!!! Its basically the same thing as this instead it is actually a green ball with more room for treats inside, and made of more durable material. Also, unlike the treat ball, it does not have any ridges for my dog to bite into and rip pieces off. And, its a bit cheaper. I'm writing this after I've had that ball for at least 6 months, and she plays with it EVERY DAY and there isn't even a mark in the thing.<br /><br />So, all in all, skip this and go for the FUN BALL instead!!!

review/summary: Lucy Loves It
review/text: Yup, the title says it all.  My pup loves her new toy and will work on it for an hour or so then fall asleep with it.<br /><br />To avoid inserting a new treat disc from becoming a frustrating challenge, work one side of the treat into the groove and then push to "pop" in the other side.  There is also an interior cavity where you can hide additional treats or kibble for more play or if you decide not to buy additional discs.<br /><br />Even though the price point of this toy is a bit steep the item is very durable.  My pup, Lucy, is a chewer and will rip apart fire-hose toys in no time.  After a week of chewing and playing with the Everlasting Treat Ball it's still looking as good as new.  This makes it a winner in my book.

review/summary: Tasty Toy for my Pooch
review/text: My 5 month old mini-doxie looooves this ball/treat! The name is a misnomer - this isn't an everlasting treat, but it is long lasting (the treat part lasted about a month of on-and-off playing). Even though the treat is gone, the blue toy-part rolls and bounces well and the size and shape of it is perfect for fetch with my puppy. This toy must be popular in my town, the treat refills for the small size are sold out at my local PetSmart! Ordering some refills (for a cheaper price, yay) from Amazon now.

review/summary: Choking Hazard?
review/text: I have a 60lb Boxer/Cane Corso mix who is a pretty aggressive chewer. The only toys he hasn't torn to pieces are Kong and Nylabone toys. Aside from that, I bought him an Everlasting Treat Ball and was disappointed, especially for as much as it cost. He was able to start tearing the rubber apart, but that's not what concerned me at all. I was concerned about the treats that go in them. He was able to pop those treats out with one good bite, even if I put them in upside down, which is not fun since the treats get so slimy. I was concerned about him choking and the treats themselves are hard as rocks. I tried to break them up with a hammer, but they wouldn't break! I even tried to soak them in water and then break them up so he could at least eat the treats, but they still wouldn't break.<br /><br />If you have a dog who is not an aggressive chewer, then I think these toys would be great entertainment, just beware of a choking hazard if they can pop the treats out! For owners who have aggressive chewers, I would surpass this toy completely.

review/summary: good for hard core chewing
review/text: excellent for hard core chewing dogs. one doberman has figured out how to pop out the treat which i find amazing since i am barely able to get the refills loaded. i would love to see the refills come down in price.
