review/summary: Plenty sweet, no calories and no aftertaste
review/text: For me, the Splenda products are great.  I get a sweet taste with no aftertaste.  (I don't mean no aftertaste like so many diet sodas have claimed for decades, I mean NO aftertaste at all!)  I like the Mocha a lot.  My only complaint with it is that 2 packets make my coffee too sweet but 1 packet doesn't quite bring enough of the mocha taste.  After some experimenting with adding cocoa powder, I've decided to settle for the 2 packets.  Great product.  I've also enjoyed some of the other flavors - Hazelnut and French Vanilla.  And for me, with those two, only one packet is needed.

So much so that when the grocery stores were not carrying this item anymore, I made it a conscious effort on my part to find it on line and buy a good supply of it.  When the boxes arrived ,I even gave my friend, who really loves the taste as well, 2 boxes for her to enjoy.<br /><br />When I could not find this product in the grocery stores I frequent, I tried all sorts of flavorings and nothing came close to being the same as the MOCHA flavor in the splenda packets.<br /><br />Now that I have found this item on line, I am truly a happy person when I have my coffee every morning.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW68ZI">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavor for Coffee, Mocha, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: Splenda Mocha adds flavor to the skim milk drinks that provide protein to those of us watching our weight.  Splenda made several flavors, including Hazelnut and French Vanilla that all helped make smoothies and "lite" drinks more palatable.  In fact, they make the taste terrific.  However, they have been disappearing from supermarket shelves in the past year so now the only way I can find the Mocha flavor is online.  Thank you for offering it thru Amazon!

review/text: Got these because I love the Splenda products. These have a very odd taste, all chemically. It has a small "hint" of chocolate (mocha) but it is obvious that it is chemically produced cause it is just nasty! I don't see how anybody can 5 star this since it really tastes bad. Nice concept and all but, WOW!!!!, what horrible execution.<br />Won't be buying this again........

review/text: I really like it - but it's not what I thought it would be.  I didn't read the product description well enough, but it's still black coffee you're drinking if you use this product. Just keep that in mind.  Makes a GREAT iced coffee - take cold coffee, ice cubes, one or two packets, and some skim milk.  Mix in the blender.  Outstanding - and virtually calorie free.

I am so glad I bought the 6 box pack, it should last me at least 6 months.  I only use one packet per my morning coffee and some creamer and it tastes like what you might buy at Starbucks. I've tried the Vanilla and Hazelnut, but the Mocha is by far my favorite flavor.  Thank you Amazon for selling Splenda flavors for coffee.

review/text: These packets are very good with coffee.  While trying to make "skinnier" iced coffee I tried the Caramel and the French Vanilla, and those flavors with a bit of fat free milk made excellent "skinny" iced coffee.  Mocha is up next! I haven't been through all the flavors yet to find one that I think is best, but it's well worth a try for hot and iced coffee.

review/text: I already use Splenda as a sweetener, so was happy when my wife brought home these Splenda Mocha Flavor for Coffee. The Mocha is my favorite, followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW68Z8">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavors for Coffee, Hazelnut, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW257S">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavor Blends for Coffee, French Vanilla, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. This is only a sweetener so I still use a splash of "Half and Half" along with two of these in my morning cup. These have no calories and less than 1 Net Carb each, so it isn't bad for me to have more than one cup in the morning.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: I was very disappointed in the taste of this item.  Not at all what I expected from Splenda.  It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste.  For instance, if added to coffee, you will not detect ANY coffee flavor, only the Splenda flavor.  Much too strong.  I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product - without question!!

However, I thought $4.99 wasn't bad for a pack of 10 . . . until I discovered this exact same brand, same package for sale at my local Kroger grocery store for $1.99.  Yep, I've been paying 2 1/2 times too much for something that was readily available at a grocery store chain.  I would check out your local grocery store before buying this product from Amazon and you may get a much better deal.

review/text: I got the sushi sheet for a healthy additive to my eating habits. i just cut off a square or two and place it on or with my food. i can add it to sandwiches or even make impromptu sushi. Example, I had some lasagna leftover so I made Lasagna Sushi Rolls !!! It was great !!!<br /><br />I've even experimented with making sushi chips. Basically baking slices of the sushi sheets in "chip" sizes. They are great with guacamole.<br /><br />However, make sure you use two sheets thickness on your "slices" and dip them in olive oil and cover with milled flax seed (as a batter) THEN place in over(preheated 325) and bake until you feel they are crispy enough for ya.

review/summary: Excellent Roasted Seaweed
review/text: This is very good roasted seaweed.  Excellent, in fact.  Most companies just dry their seaweed but let me tell you, they are lazy and really don't know seaweed.  See, that's the problem with most of the world today, laziness!  I can remember a time when companies and people cared about going the extra mile, when quality still mattered.  It's a shame.  Everyone is all about speed and convenience, speed and convenience.  It's like we're all on treadmills or really fast escalators or something quick and automated like that.  I just don't know what is wrong with everyone.  Sometimes I just have to sit down and shake my head.<br /><br />Roasting makes the seaweed almost taste like chicken and when you use it in your favourite recipes, you will think you've died and gone to heaven.  Yamamotoyama is the best!

review/text: I do not know how the product itself is because I gave it to my sister for Christmas. However, the company said it would be delivered on or by Dec 24 if I ordered on Dec 17 (which I did). It did not come until Dec 26. So, on Christmas day I had to tell my sister what her Christmas present was but that I did not have it yet. This was part of a Sushi making kit that I was putting together for her and some of the other items in it were from this company too.

review/summary: Authentic Electrolyte for Athletes
review/text: I am not an athlete but I have read several reviews which investigates the role of electrolytes in increasing the body's energy level.<br /><br />Electrolytes serve as the motor oil of the body. It keeps your cells on the go and a sudden decrease in its amount will result to fatigue and exhaustion. Most athletes experience these situations after long hours of training so many of them rely on different types of energy drinks, energy bar and power shakes which promises immediate energy booster. However only ZYM Catapult Energy Drink offers immediate absorption of electrolytes which results to instant improvement of your stamina and energy leve. YOu simply mix it with your water and you experience how it will give you additional jolts of energy to endure further trainings and work-outs. Unfortunately, the energy boosting effects of ZYM will not last  for so long<br /><br />Given the chance to purchase Gene Eden Vir 101, it is still by far the best and perfect energy booster I will recommend for athletes and non-athletes who wish to gain longer lasting energy boosters. It suppresses the production of chronic viruses in the body so the much needed energy of the cells is efficiently utilized. It costs a little higher than ZYM Catapult Energy drink but if you are in search of long lasting energy boosters and increased level of immune system then it is the perfect choice not only for you but your family as well.

review/summary: Cool party favor!
review/text: I ordered these not knowing exactly what they were: there's no picture or description at Amazon, and google wasn't helping. But at the price I thought I'd take a chance :D<br /><br />These are 12 individually wrapped plastic containers. Each has a chain attached (so can be used as a key chain), and a round lid with a "doodle" on it. All 12 in our assortment were different, but all of them were cute. A couple had monsters that would appeal to boys (and since we got them for Halloween giveaways, they tie in nicely!).<br /><br />Inside each container there's about 20 pieces of gum, different colors (white, yellow, red, green, orange and blue) and different flavors. The pieces are smaller, so you'd probably want to have 2 at a time. The flavors are ok, but don't last super long.<br /><br />My kids (10 and 6) were very excited to try this product and said that it's "the coolest gum ever", and it would be an awesome addition to a goodie bag.<br /><br />The gum I received (10/1/2011) appeared very fresh, but did not have an expiration date stamped on the containers. It is NOT sugar free. It's made in Canada, and the containers have something stamped in Hebrew, so the containers might be made in Israel. (It's a rare thing nowadays to find something this inexpensive NOT made in China).<br /><br />Overall, we are happy with the product and delivery (only took one day to get here!)

review/summary: Mystery Fluid
review/text: Received a flat of this product on a subscription. I was hoping to save money by buying in bulk and was looking forward to the  convenience of having the product shipped on a scheduled basis.<br /><br />The very first carton I opened contained a thick and lumpy fluid. It did not smell bad or have a distinct taste - it just was not what I expected to come out of a carton that should have contained soy milk. Yes I did shake the carton well before opening it.<br /><br />The second carton was fine.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the loss of one carton from the flat eliminates the whole value proposition of buying in bulk and on-line. I would avoid this brand.<br /><br />Update: Score so far for the pack of 12: 3 bad 8 good. One more to go!

review/summary: tasty soy milk, love that it's unsweetened
review/text: I really like unsweetened soy milk and I was thrilled when I saw this product on Amazon. Not only is it unsweetened, it's also organic, and you can get it for cheaper through the subscription service. It's super convenient to just get a box of 12 cartons or so every month instead of having to lug them home from the grocery store.<br /><br />I did recently discontinue this subscription for two reasons. First, I saw that the regular store-brand unsweetened organic soy milk is cheaper per carton than this one (even if I factor in the subscription discount). Second, and more important, I wanted to switch to a soy milk that is fortified with certain vitamins (i.e. B12, since I don't eat animal products).<br /><br />That being said, I really liked the taste of that one and the convenience of the subscription service.

review/summary: Doesn't have a good taste
review/text: My husband is dairy sensitive and uses soy milk on his cereal and in other circumstances because he can't use dairy forms of milk.  He had a hard time switching to soy milk because of the taste, but after awhile he has come to like it.  He doesn't like the taste of soy milk at room temperature, but has found that refrigerated soy milk tastes pretty good.  I have bought different brands in stores over the years and he doesn't really have a preference as to which tastes best.  It's pretty much a commodity for him.<br /><br />So, when I saw this brand on Amazon and I could sign up with the Subscribe and Save program, I was thrilled.  It meant not need to lug those big containers home from the grocery store. However, it didn't turn out so well.  My husband said that the refrigerated form of this soy milk tastes pretty much like other brands do when unrefrigerated.  It just doesn't taste very good to him.<br /><br />So, I have cancelled my subscription for this product.  What a disappointment.

I am pretty picky overall, do not like most of the aftertastes of protein drinks. I actually thought these were quite good and will be adding them to my daily regimen. I do not use as a before workout/post workout drink, but rather as a quick snack midmorning to hold me over. I have not tried the Chai but the Cappucino, Chocolate, and French Vanilla were good. I did refrigerate before drinking.

review/text: I'm a huge fan of chocolate and cocoa.  This doesn't taste like pure chocolate or cocoa.  Instead, it has a coffee taste, and I'd bet that one of the "natural flavors" listed is coffee.  My stomach agreed and gave me reflux (which is common for coffee).  The erythritol and stevia took a little getting used to.  Other than that, it had a smooth texture and a nice amount of protein.  I wish they didn't hide the true ingredients with the "natural flavors" listing -- a lot of stuff is natural and still not what I want in a protein drink.

review/summary: Filling but doesn't taste very good
review/text: I picked up a four pack of these at a local grocery store.  I did not care for the taste at all.  If you like soy, great, but I really don't like it and soy is definitely the predominant flavor.  The aftertaste is also really lingering.  I know some say that's the stevia, but I don't mind the stevia aftertaste in non-soy products, I think the combination of the two is what makes it so unpleasant for me.  I still wanted chocolate after having this, perhaps because it doesn't taste like chocolate, it tastes like soy with some cocoa.  It is filling, and I was able to use it successfully as a meal replacement (unlike your typical meal replacement drinks, which are a joke).  I also tended to get a headache and minor stomach ache while drinking it and had to practically force myself to finish each bottle.  Other drinks out there taste a LOT better, but nothing has worked as well for an easy meal that I can grab and go.  I think I will keep looking until I find the perfect protein drink for me.  I just don't think this is it.  I give it three stars because the ingredients are better than average and it does fill me up well.  It does what it should, just not in an appealing way.

review/summary: Awesome Protein Drink
review/text: For starters - I do not like most forms of energy and protein drinks.  I find the tastes are too sugary or the aftertaste is bitter or it just doesn't do what it's supposed to.  Anything that states it can be a meal replacement should not make me feel starved or deprived 1 hour later - as is the case normally.<br />The Svelte Chocolate is good.  Yes some aftertaste exists, but to me it taste like the same aftertaste as anything made from soy.  I've only had the chocolate because my local store carries chocolate and cappuccino and I don't like coffee related flavors.<br />This drink will leave you feeling full and sated for several hours.  I had one for breakfast one time and was perfectly fine all morning.  I didn't sit at my desk craving food.  It also works really well for afternoons if there is a long time between lunch and dinner.<br />The flavor is also rich.  It's not super sugar sweet but more of a rich sweet, which satisfies any cravings for sugar or chocolate.<br />One of my favorite things is the size - 1 bottle is an entire serving!  It's not one of those, "Here's a single-serving size container that has 4 servings in it" products.  Which probably helps with the satisfaction afterwords because you can have more than 4 oz.<br /><br />If chocolate isn't your style - try one of the other 3 flavors.  I hope to try the french vanilla and chai soon.

review/text: Really like these protein shakes, and had discovered them in a high-end grocery. When I looked, Amazon carried them! So I now subscribe and have them shipped every month. On my third or fourth month and not tired of chocolate yet (tired of chocolate=oxymoron?)

review/text: I have finally found it, a yummy chocolate liquid "food" that actually helps several health problems.  It beats all the diabetic drinks, both on the label and by evidence of my own little experiment.  I drink it every morning in my coffee - a half/half recipe that starts my day out just right.  Rich, creamy, filling....

review/summary: Best protein drink on the market!!
review/text: Calnaturale has figured out a way to make a protein drink without that chalky aftertaste.  It tastes like a delicious milk shake yet it's quite healthy with a minimal amount of sugar.  For me, it has become the go to drink after a vigorous workout.

review/summary: Unpleasant aftertaste!
review/text: The chocolate Svelte flavor is good until two seconds after you drink it. The Stevia flavor is an unpleasant surprise that lingers. I needed the protein from the drink and was filled up by it. However, I felt like I was forcing down every swallow and dreaded the aftertaste. Cute designs but I guess I'll have to try some other flavors and see if it can mask the Stevia.

review/summary: Undrinkable.
review/text: I had high hopes for this product - lots of protein, not too much sugar, convenient packaging, and comes in several great-sounding flavors. Unfortunately, I failed to notice that it's also a veritable cocktail of nasty zero calorie sweeteners. I don't know whether it's the erythritol, the stevia, or both, but something in this product gives it a horrible, too-sweet, chemical aftertaste that I find truly undrinkable. I had to throw the whole thing away after the first sip. Consider yourself warned!

review/summary: Mystery ingredients and drain clog
review/text: Strangest thing how something that is supposed to be good for you has all kinds of vegetable gums listed on the label. I guess people who drink this stuff are candidates for enemas, which is one of those growth industries in California. Do you want an enema? Oh right, there is inulin and other not-quite-fiber added to help out with the drain clog process. Do you think their added "fiber" makes a difference? I don't.<br /><br />And, when did the FDA allow food processors to use the highhanded and totally consumer-enemy term "Natural Flavors". I guess that is more informative than, say, "Unnatural Flavors", or even "Abnormal Flavors". Hmm, I think I'll go with "Abnormal Flavors", because that is what it tastes like.<br /><br />If you like the taste, you'll like the taste. Some products tell you that a man will turn into a woman from ingesting soy protein. This product eliminates all that and cuts to the chase by putting "Hello, beautiful" on the front. Well, fact is, I am a good-looking man, and I don't care what nonsense they put on these packages.<br /><br />It's the stevia ingredient that leaves that bitter aftertaste, as the other customer pointed out, but it tastes like sucralose. Tell you what, live a little. Put some sugar in to taste. Much, much better that way.

review/summary: Great Packaging, Horrible Taste,  YUCK!!!
review/text: I was so excited for this to arrive because I LOVE Orgain drinks and this has two benefits over Orgain.  The first benefit is the drink is larger in size (15.9 oz versus 11 oz) and it has a twist off cap that you can put back on (which Orgain does not).  This unfortunately is where the benefits end for this product.  Orgain tastes SO much better and also has more vitamins in it.  I don't know if it is the soy milk or what, but the taste of this is absolutely horrible!  It is like a bad medicine after taste.  I purchased this because of all of the positive reviews on amazon and because of the packaging versus Orgain.  I was REALLY hoping this would be great, but I now have eleven containers of this stuff that I will never drink.  I cannot stress how bad this was to me, but maybe you will like it since so many others do.  I wish that I would have purchased an individual bottle before buying a whole case, but that was my own fault for not doing so.  Don't make the same mistake I did!

review/summary: Decent decaf
review/text: My sister liked these a lot more than I did--she likes a far milder coffee than I do.  I had to use two of them per cup on a smaller water setting (as I do even with many caffeinated varieties) to get the flavor I like.  So three stars from me and four from my sister.  A nice, smooth tasting selection of decaf if you like mild coffee.

I like getting the sampler so I can find which kind I like the best, and then can order more of that.<br /><br />My only complaint about it is the price, which is why it's only 4 stars instead of 5. Overall it's been great.

review/text: The $11.33 price is for only one pack of these.  I'm used to paying much less in the store, about $3 a pack.  These are my favorite sushi wrappers though.  I have to drive out of my way to get them, so I thought buying them through Amazon was a good idea.  I should have read the description more carefully.  Another Amazon seller has these in a 4 pack for about the same price but not with free shipping.  I saw this one and decided to purchase it because of the free shipping.  It wasn't until it arrived that I saw it wasn't for a 4 pack.  I'm returning it.  It's a great relief that Amazon is good about returns.

review/text: As a long term vegan I use this product for salads and sauces not as a source of B12 (nutritional yeast doesn't contain B12 unless it's fortified with it).<br /><br />I love the quality and consistency (I've been a long term buyer). I would highly recommend you check out Barry Farm for gourmet and hard to get foods (no, I don't work for them or have any investment in the company).<br /><br />I live in a area where it is impossible to get wasabi, nori or other specialty Asian products, so I'm forced to purchase online. I'm glad that there is a Barry Farms in cyber space.

review/text: I wanted to try a recipe which called for Nutritional Yeast - something I had never heard of before.  I did a little research to find out more about nutritional yeast and I was intrigued. It is very tasty.  I sprinkle it on my fruit breakfast every morning. I have used it in soups, sprinkled on vegetables, on pasta. It adds a unique flavor, which I like very much.  I have to trick my boyfriend into eating well and this is a great way to add Vitamin B12 to any dish.
