review/summary: Would not buy again
review/text: I ignored the other reviews about how these were now being made in China - I had checked the warnings and was comfortable that Dogswell hadn't been mentioned.  I've bought them many times, and my dog loves these treats!  Unfortunately, the most recent batch I got last week smelled really awful - like a mix of chemicals and rotten meat.  None of the bags I've gotten before smelled anything like this, and it was so strong that it filled my apartment with the odor.  I threw them out and would not recommend buying them.  It's not worth the risk.

review/summary: One loves it, one hates it!
review/text: Yes, another new cat food folks.  Another new invention to see if your cat will approve.  Once again, I have a "yeah" and a "nay."  My male, who was raised on meat, hates this stuff.  He won't go near it and actually will jump back away from his dish if I put it in there!  A bit dramatic, I think, but you at least get the picture!  But, my female who is a junk food lover thinks this stuff is all there should be for sale on the shelf!  She gobbles this stuff up like there's no tomorrow.  The one thing you should know about Fancy Feast is that it is pretty good food for your cat.  Although my female likes junk food like Meow Mix and Whiskas (check with your vet - he will tell you how bad those foods are), I'm very glad she will eat this since it has a high protein level.  Why my male hates it, I have no idea.  Just grab a can at your local grocery to test it out before ordering an entire case.  Recommend!

review/text: I picked up a bread machine at Goodwill for $10.  Works great and I love the fresh bread (and all the varieties of bread!  But buying the little packets of yeast or the little jars, is one of the most expensive components of the bread.<br /><br />So I bought a double bag of yeast here for about what two small bottles would have cost in the store.  That about halved the cost-per-loaf.  There's no discernible difference between this yeast and what I was using before. I just filled up the old bottles with yeast and stuck it in the fridge as my "working supply" and stashed the rest in a zip lock  bag and stuck it in the freezer.<br /><br />Of course, bread isn't the only thing you can use yeast for.<br /><br />I'll leave the rest to your imagination!

review/summary: COMPRESSED yeast... not your typical "active dry yeast"
review/text: I bought this thinking it was your typical active dry yeast you get in the store, but I was mistaken.  It is compressed, meaning you have to add extra water to it when you start out, let it sit, then you can proceed to use it like you do the yeast in the store.  Still excellent yeast for an excellent price, just not quite as convenient as I would have liked.

review/summary: Never Fails !!!!
review/text: As long as you use correct water temp. this never fails !!!! I've baked for 45 yrs now at least and Red Star has always been my brand of choice. I am so glad to find it in large size multiples !! Far, Far more cost effective for a home baker that cooks every day than the single packets or tiny jars the store has in stock. I have found that storing the open pouch in a plastic zippy bag in the refridgerator keeps it as fresh as the day I opened it. I have kept an open bagged pouch in the fridge for over a year through 2 moves in a cooler with the rest of the food and its still as good as ever. Only caution I have is if you are used to using store yeast you might need to cut the quantity of yeast down in your recipies using this product as it is that fast rising. I've found that I need 1- 1 & 1/2 TBSP of this to every 2 packs of store yeast. Another money saver using this.

review/summary: Best I have used.
review/text: Yeast is a matter of taste.  Bread will taste differently with different yeasts.  Before buying this buy a packet in a market, around $1.50-$2.00, and try it out.  For my tastes, and apparently for the tastes of my friends, this is the best yeast I have used. And I have used all of those usually found in super markets, and some from foreign food stores.  I bake bread about every four days, so for me this package is a great buy. It's the same yeast you pay $3+ for a 4oz jar.  This is a win win, makes good bread at a very low price.  If the quantity is just too much for you, split it up with bread baking friends.

review/summary: Good but too salty
review/text: After trying the chipotle one I decided to try this one. It was good but rather salty for my taste. Also it kind of reminded me of tarter sauce a little. Though I am sure many would like this, it is just too over powering for my palate. I love mayo and go through it quickly but these have been sitting in my pantry for a LOOOONG time. I opened one months ago and have only used it maybe 4 times. Not sure what I can do to cut the flavor and salt. Maybe add some sour cream or better yet Greek yogurt. I am not one to let things go to waste ( yes the true spelling of the word WASTE. So many times I see reviews with WAIST rather than waste. Has become a pet peeve of mine. lol ) Anyway 3 stars, had it been more balanced and not so overpowering and salty it might have been 5 stars.

It has not been available anywhere in the Bay Area for many years, so I was very happy to find it for him on Amazon.<br /><br />I only wish it could be a "Subscribe and Save" item, because the shipping costs nearly double the price, making it a rare purchase instead of a staple.  I think my husband would use a jar every two months or so.<br /><br />Not being a chili paste fan myself, I can't tell you what makes this brand so special, but if you Google it, you will find several desperate entries and blogs coveting it and bemoaning the fact that it is hard to come by.

review/summary: I love these oats!
review/text: These are the most delicious steel cut oats I have found, and they're certified to be gluten-free too!  They're yummy and satisfying and give me long-lasting energy all morning.  Since I'm always rushed in the morning, I put them in the pan at night and soak them in water.  I use more water than the directions call for (maybe about four times as much water as oats).  If you're going to add raisins, you can soak those right along with the oats.  Then in the morning I just turn the heat on, bring them to a boil, cover and turn down to the lowest simmer.  I like to cook them for 20 minutes, and they cook while I'm showering.  They don't need to be stirred at all as long as you keep the heat really low and use plenty of water.  Afterwards, I let them sit in the pan until I'm ready, and then before I eat them, I mix in a tablespoon of chia seeds.  Not only does this add even more soluble fiber and omega 3 fatty acids, but it thickens up the porridge perfectly.  Yum!

I can make it very simple with some agave or sugar, or with a handful of homemade "trail mix" - dried tart cherries, chopped almonds, and coconut.<br /><br />I always check prices first but Amazon is usually well priced on this brand compared to my local stores.<br /><br />Very [leased with this product and highly recommended.

review/text: So why only 4 stars?  Those who are suffering from celiac disease know that oats are controversial because they are usually cross-contaminated with gluten because of the machines that process these grains.  Bob's is the only company I am aware of that has actually built an entire facility just for the processing of gluten free products. As much as those in the celiac world appreciate these efforts, there is some research showing that different oat cultivars have varying degrees of toxicity for celiac sufferers. (see the link [...]) I have emailed Bob's about this research to see if they know whether the cultivar(s) they process are the offending ones but have not received a response yet.  When I do I will be sure to update this review.

review/text: So far Steel Cut Oats is my favorite healthy breakfast! I love to mix in a little bit of grade B maple syrup.  This bag has a lot of servings in it.  Since only myself and my seven year old daughter like oatmeal I make according the the directions put the rest in the fridge and I've got a few meals! I really like the texture and the crunch.  I'm not a huge fan of rolled oats.

We have also used it as a substitute for some recipes that call for barley.<br />Thanks to Bob's Red Mill gluten free products.

review/text: I eat this everyday for breakfast - I soak the oats in water overnight, then it only takes 1/2 the time to cook in the morning. I add raisins, flax meal, bite size pieces of granny smith apple, and cinnamon.<br />This feels me up until lunchtime. sometimes, I can't even finish the serving. Very filling.<br />My 2 year old loves this - I put a small amount of honey in hers, with organic raisins and organic dates. (From Bob's, of course!)She gobbles it right up!<br />Thank you Bob for making such a wonderful and healthy product!!!

review/text: The flavor is great. The only problem is that they seem to break too easy, but only in the box. They are hard to chew and go better if you can dunk them in coffee or milk. I received my shipment and a lot were broken. The pieces were still big enough to eat though. I think it is the nature of the biscuit to break easily and not necessarily Amazon's shipping. Although, maybe the manufacturer could pack the individual biscuits better.

review/text: My husband and I are HUGE fans of salt and vinegar chips, so I was very interested to try the Madhouse Munchies variety when I came across the brand in the natural foods section of my grocery store.  I was a little skeptical at first because some natural food chips are super greasy.  Boy was I wrong this time!  Madhouse Munchies are crunchy and flavorful but don't leave behind a greasy mess.  We take the Sea Salt & Vinegar chips with us to every cookout and tailgate party and they are always a big hit!  We always leave the parties empty handed!!

review/summary: First 2-3 deliveries were great.  Last 2 ... not so much
review/text: Decided to try Madhouse Munchies based on the description and the positive reviews.  No ... the opinion of an Olympic skier made no difference whatsoever except to wonder who out there actually believed that an an olympic skier is a more qualified determiner of potato chip quality than anyone else.  Anyway - my first delivery showed these to be good chips.  5 star ... or nearly so.  Second delivery supported the first.<br /><br />I'll give it three stars an an average.  Chips, when well made and fresh are probably closer to 5 stars.  I can't quite recall where it turned but it was either the third or fourth delivery.  This next delivery showed up with the box itself soaked with oil and every single bag within the box slit down the back seam.  It should have been nearly impossible for the person packing it not to notice and its difficult for me to believe that 12 bags spontaneously burst down the back seam in transit.  I reported it, threw them all out and Amazon refunded the money (thanks Amazon).  Next delivery, while not split down the seam, were very very greasy.  The chips were practically dripping oil.  Most recent delivery ... same thing.  I'll chalk the split seam issue down to logistics but the last two scream of manufacturing process changes or cutbacks or simply a malaise in the process.  Whatever it is ... that's all it really takes to lose a customer.  Lay's makes an excellent kettle chip, best I've had to date, and they sell it at the local small market where we pickup our milk for $2.29 for an 8.5oz bag.  That's a better price per oz than I was getting here.  I'm off the Madhouse Munchies bandwagon.<br />Giving this 3 stars as an average but this chip has been on a 5 star to 1 star slide.  Clearly they know how to make a good chip.  For whatever reason they just stopped doing it.

review/summary: The ULTIMATE chip!
review/text: I was first introduced to Madhouse Munchies on a visit to Vermont. After the trip, when the cravings started to hit, I went online and have been buying them online ever since. Braving the abuse of friends who frown on an online potato chip habit, I now find myself eating them alone (even before 5 o'clock!) and hiding them all over the place in case I need a nibble or two to get me through the day. I am always afraid of being found out, and work to hide my obvious potato breath. I know the ads say to munch responsibly, but I will admit that I am an addict (step #1, obviously). To all of you whom I have hurt, I'm sorry. But forget rehab: I will continue to let the chips fall where they may.

These are thick chips made double thick by all the flavorings which is just so over-done, it is falling off into the bottom of the bag. You get about 6 actual chips with loads of orange flavor dust in the bottom of the bag, and it's not the kind that you can dump into your mouth at the end, it is sooooo salty. I bought these for vending (1 oz size) because the Kettle Brand BBQ (which IS good btw) has never come back in stock since I purchased them this past summer. The price is not bad on the madhouse chips but now I have way too many that I will not be able to sell very well (72 pack).<br />I'll probably end up giving them away.

review/summary: These are the best chips ever!
review/text: I am gonna keep this short and sweet. As a long time fan of all chips that are salt & vinegar, I have to say I found my one. Not too salty or pungent with vinegar, but just the right amount of flavor and crispiness. I am so glad I decided to try a box of these. You guys have a winner here.

review/summary: The perfect potato chips.
review/text: I discovered these chips for the first time while vacationing with my wife in New Hampshire last fall.  Wherever I travel, I'm in search of excellent potato chips, and these clearly rank with the best I've ever eaten.  Taste wise, these chips have the right balance between the natural potato flavor and the French onion flavoring, with just the right "crunch."  And what truly amazed me was how such a great tasting chip could have so many natural nutrients and so few calories per ounce.  When we returned to Ohio, I ordered a whole box of the 5-ounce bags to give to friends and relatives this Christmas.

review/summary: Extremely disappointing - chips were made in 2007 and the oil in them was rancid
review/text: I am very disappointed with this purchase.  I don't think it is the product itself but rather how old the chips were that were shipped to me.  The first bag I opened were pretty good and I was feeling happy with my purchase. However, when I went to eat another bag I opened it and it had a very strong smell of rancid oil that dominated any salt and vinegar smell or flavor.  I then opened 2 more bags and they had the exact same issue.  Chips in these bags were essentially non-edible or at least not in<br />anyway pleasant to eat.  Rancid oil can't be a good thing to consume.  Looking closely at the chips sent to me I saw they were manufactured in 2007 and have an expiration date of January 2011 - clearly they have already expired.  This item is not returnable so I will be throwing all of the remaining bags of chips out.  That means I will have spent almost $42 for one good 1-ounce bag of chips.  So if you are thinking of buying such an item on amazon first inquire about how old the product is that will be shipped to you - I will definitely be doing that in the future.

review/summary: Mad Munchies Sea Salted Potato Chips
review/text: My grandson has multiple allergies to all the grains except rice (plus nuts, garlic, etc).  When I discovered these potato chips on amazon.com, I was thrilled.  Only three ingredients, none of which he was allergic to.  I've been purchasing them ever since.  Try reading the ingredients list on other chips to see what I mean about ingredients!  Anyway, he's happy to take them with his lunch to school.  He can eat potato chips too.  And they are VERY good.  Thank you Mad Munchies and amazon.com.

review/summary: Yummy chips... but not all that different.
review/text: These chips are very good.  Crunchy and tasty. Just the right amount of salt. Yet, I really don't see much of a difference as far as the chip being any healthier or a lot more tasty than other kettle chips. They leave your fingers very greasy. (I guess all kettle chips do that though). The bottom of every bag was full of broken, greasy pieces of chip. Maybe my shipment just got banged around too much. They DO taste good and it is hard to put them down.  I finish off a bag every time I open one. (I am not a big eater either) I try to eat a sandwich with them as to not polish off a whole bag at one setting:)Overall, I would try these again.

review/text: These chips did have a terrific bite but still a bit on the greasy side but that's what Kettle chips are. My all time favorite is the Lays salt/vinegar but no longer in the stores where I reside and the company on amazon that sells them only has the 1.5oz (too small) and by the time you pay shipping...not worth it. Overall the Madhouse Munchies not bad and the 5oz size is quite lg. There was a promotional special when I ordered so got the case at a great price on Amazon.

review/text: I bought these for our office and they are extremely tasty.  Their only drawback is price.  Even with the sale I got them on, they cost nearly twice as much as the "normal" brands for half as much product.  However, they are still quick to be bought by the staff because they taste so darn good.<br /><br />If they would only make 2 oz. bags for the same price!<br /><br />One last thought:  I live in the Rocky Mountains and the shipping went over the passes in Colorado.  Some of the bags lost their air and became vacuum packed as they came back down.  The chips were OK, but the bags looked like they had nearly nothing in them!  This is the case for many air packed and sealed items I buy East of the Rockies.

review/text: I consider myself somewhat of a potato chip expert having indulged my craving for over 55 years.  I first discovered Madhouse Munchies Sea Salted chips during a two year stay in Vermont close to where they're made.  I missed that lightly salted flavor when I moved back home.  It was a pleasant surprise to find them at Amazon.  If you like potato chips with a crunch, that aren't so thin they have no substance and with just the right amount of salt, this is it.  I rate these chips among my top three favorites.

review/text: I've recently had to change my diet and cut down on salt.  I'm a salt-aholic so this wasn't easy.  I found Madhouse Munchies chips in a Gourmet Kitchen store and I was amazed at how good they taste.  They have about half the sodium of other chips but taste delicious and satisfy the salt craving.  The store that carried these is far enough away that I don't get there often so I checked the internet.  I'm able to get a case of 12 bags delivered right to my door for a reasonable price.  Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Madhouse Munchies Sea Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips
review/text: Do you have the Munchies?<br /><br />Light, non-oily, crispy with a balanced salt content, and perfect taste bud tang, Madhouse Munchies are highly recommended for those with a salt-and-vinegar fondness. This snack is made from select North American potatoes and is quite tasty, the way human nature intended.<br /><br />The only possible downside to this delight is the ingredient LACTOSE, which affects those allergic to milk.  Perhaps the company may consider an alternative version of these chips to satisfy a greater population.<br /><br />However, as they say, "because we cook with healthier oil [non-hydrogenated canola], chips are cholesterol free, 0g trans fat p/s, and has no MSG, preservatives, or artificial colors.<br /><br />Enjoy!

These chips are cooked in oil that is healthier (don't tell the kids) and taste way better than the average chip.  No oily taste like others, just potato and awesome spices.  I even stick them in the kids lunches.

review/text: I bought these chips because of all the positive reviews (and because they were cheap, with Amazon discounts), but I'm underwhelmed by both the Madhouse Munchies chip flavors I've purchased:  the Mesquite BBQ mentioned here, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDKZZK">Madhouse Munchies Sea Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />The chips are perfectly edible (unlike some other chips I've tried, I won't have to give away every bag because I can't use them at all at home), but thin and insubstantial -- at least compared to the much superior Kettle brand chips I've been buying from Amazon, such as their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBVO">Kettle Chips, Sea Salt & Vinegar, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> and their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4FI">Kettle Krinkle Cut Chips, Salt & Fresh Ground Pepper, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> -- and the 'fire sweet' smokey quality of the barbecue flavor is a bit overpowering (especially with a weak chip underneath, offering nothing to back it up with other flavor notes).<br /><br />I'd prefer to get much more satisfaction and flavor in return for my caloric over-indulgence than is offered by Madhouse Munchies snacks so far.<br /><br />Unless you've already tried Madhouse Munchies brand from your local grocery store and loved their chips, I wouldn't advise purchasing this in bulk just yet.  There are far better chips available here for just a little more money (when you take advantage of sales and discounts).
