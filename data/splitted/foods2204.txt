review/summary: Great Ingredients, Super Messy, and Easy to Choke On
review/text: I really, really wanted these to work. They have fantastic ingredients, they taste great, and they're hard... to start off with. Once my 9 month old baby starts chewing on these, they get soft, squishy, and on every single thing they get near. They're perfect if your kid is in a high chair with a bib and can have a bath afterward. The other downside is that they do break off in big chunks and it's easy for the baby to bite off more than he can handle. I'll keep using these when my son is a little older because I think they're probably better suited for an older baby who is teething, rather than someone under a year.

review/summary: messy and a choking hazard
review/text: The first time I gave one of these to my 10 month old, she was already eating cheerios, graham crackers and rice rusks.  The crumbs got everywhere. She was able to bite off such a large chunk of the biscuit that I had to sweep it out of her mouth because she had difficulty chewing it and it did not seem to be breaking up or dissolving like the rice rusks.  I continued to let her have the rest of the biscuit and the same thing happened again.  I finally had to throw out the biscuit.  I should have thrown out the whole box.  A few weeks later our nanny gave her one of these under supervision while she was in her high chair.  It broke off into a couple pieces, one of which got lodged in her throat.  She went from coughing to gagging and not breathing as her panicked face turned from scarlet to purple.  Fortunately, the piece dislodged itself before our nanny had to do any back blows or CPR. We stopped buying the rice rusks because of all the bad stuff that's been doing on with food products from China, but we'll be going back to the baby mum mums.

review/summary: This product is a choking hazard!
review/text: I chose these as a substitute for zwieback toast, which has apparently been discontinued.  Gerber makes a very similar teething biscuit, but after comparing both, I found Earth's Best to be much healthier.  My son LOVES these biscuits, but I will be throwing the rest of them away.  For the second time today, he broke off a piece larger than a quarter after sucking on the biscuit for only about a minute.  My son is eleven months old and does great with chunky food, but there is no way he would be able to chew these hard biscuits with his gums.  I am thankful that I do watch him like a hawk when he eats anything, because this product is dangerous!  I will not let my son have these again.

review/summary: Yes, choking hazard indeed!!!!
review/text: This is more useful as a dog biscuit. It is very hard, which ok, if it stays in one piece it's good for teething. But as many other reviews say, when they suck and gnaw on it, it becomes soft enough that VERY large pieces break off and remain in their mouth. And these big pieces, once in their mouth is still hard enough that there's no way they can chew with their gums only. Just eat one yourself. This is just downright dangerous. Why would you anyone create a product like this for kids??? If you bought this, please just eat these yourself and not give it to your kids.

review/summary: They're OK -- not great, not bad but OK
review/text: I got these after Planters stopped making their Ragin' Buffalo flavor. The Planters I give 5-stars too without any hesitation. These are more of a 3 1/2-star flavor. These are a bit more hot and less flavorful than the Planters but the real issue is the peanuts themselves. They're quite large and seem to be slightly overbaked -- while having an oversized peanut doesn't seem like it would be bad it takes away from the flavor in my mind and they're just not as satisfying as I'd hope.

review/text: I had a TERRRRRIBLE experience buying with this company and product. The picture given is misleading because it leads you to believe you are getting four pod boxes. However, you only get ONE and for SIXTEEN DOLLARS. That is ridiculous, considering most packages are 4 boxes for about $25. When I called back to complain, I had absolutely terrible customer service as well. The man was arguing me through the entire phone conversation, which is the one thing you do not do in customer service.

review/summary: Hellishly hot, but tasty sauce
review/text: I had heard of ghost chilis for years before finally having the nerve to try Dave's Insanity.  I was amart enough to try it in the dead of winter (California gets 40-ish, not too cold).  My first encounter with dipped chicken wings still broke me in a running sweat.  I could not feel my tongue anymore, and I suffered the after-burn for thirty minutes tnereafter.  Tearing was constant over that half hour span.<br /><br />I would recommend diluting this monster and not using it as a dip, like I did.  Use an eye dropper to measure out Dave's sauce with your favorite barbecue recipe.  You will be shocked by how little of Dave's your system can tolerate.<br /><br />All this dilution is a pity because there is a definite flavor to this touch of lava.  At present, I can consume an entire plate of barbecue or wings with about 20% of Dave's Insanity.  Actually, one of the best uses of hot sauce is a tiny dlution of Dave's with your salad dressing.<br /><br />I do love spicy, but there is one drawback to a plate of Dave's.  Cast-iron stomach or not, the heat will invade your innards.  No amount of iced beverages will tamp this sensation down. Please be careful as many people will not tolerate ghost chiles in any dilution.  The biggest problem appears to be uncontrollable coughing jags.<br /><br />A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Finally, keep your dogs from the leftovers; a simple swallow could be the last bit of food your dog will ever consume.  The consequences might be fatal.  This is no joke.

review/summary: Oh, yeah.
review/text: I just got this stuff in the mail for my birthday. I know, an odd Bday gift, but I love this kind of fare. First thing is, shake it up really well or even stir it before you pour it because all of the oil builds up at the top and you wont get the full effect if you don't thoroughly mix it. Let me say that I am a heat eating heavyweight, so to say. I knew this stuff was going to be HOT. I reminded myself to be wise about the amount I used. I normally carry cayenne pepper in my purse as a personal condiment and I use a stockpile of habanaroes every week. Everything I eat is not just spicy, but tongue numbing hot. I will say. I bought two cups of chili and added ONE TEASPOON of Dave's 2009. I thought that would be a good place to start. Wow. Not so bad at first. Spicy, but pleasant. Then it hits the back of your throat and you have to cough. Then your nose is running. Then you are sweating. Then your ears and hair start to burn. It sounds nightmarish, I know. But, I love it and this was totally worth it. This stuff goes a long, long way. In no way should you use this stuff as a dip or drizzle it on top of anything, like your pizza. I believe it is best enjoyed when you combine it in small amounts (or large if you're F-ing crazy) to dishes like soup, pasta sauce, chili, bbq sauce, mashed potatoes, or any blended side dish. I think that is the best way to enjoy this. Anyways, I love it. I don't know if I wanna dropkick Dave in the nuts or give him a bear hug!

review/summary: You want the hot? You can't handle the hot!
review/text: Brilliant. An amazing deal if you plan on actually using it instead of just collecting it on the shelf because it takes so very little each time. A single drop diluted in maybe 1/2 cup of some other fluid takes it below so-insane-you-will-regret-tasting-it hot. As a reference point, since people's heat tolerance differs, I use about 2/3 tsp of the regular Dave's Insanity on a burger with no ill effect. So if you're in the same region, dilute less at your own peril. Also it stains like nobody's business so watch your clothing/kitchen table.

review/summary: Straight out of Hell
review/text: BE CAREFUL!! This is a very, very hot sauce. I eat tons of hot food and own a small collection of these uber hot sauces. And I can confidently say that this is the hottest stuff I've ever owned, by far. For comparison, I can eat 4-5 habaneros straight up in a bowl of noodles with no ill effects other than the typical burning butt the next day.<br /><br />  True story:<br /><br /> While at work, I nearly died hours after eating a few doses of this sauce. By doses, I mean I was dipping beef jerky strips into the neck of the bottle and coating the first inch+ of each strip. I may have eaten about 8 of these strips over the course of the day. Then in the evening I felt a severe burning sensation in my stomach, or maybe it was my intestines. I immediately went to the restroom and tried to relieve myself of this pain. It only got worse. I had the most severe cold sweats I've ever had in my life. Like a horrible fever, but with goosebumps. Then I had a hard time taking breaths! I had to command my body to breathe! My insides were in too much pain to involuntarily breathe. I had to rest my head on the handicap bar in the stall (eww, I know). Necessary because I began to slip in and out of consciousness and I had to make sure I didn't just collapse onto the floor.<br /><br />  This process would ebb and then recur again a few times during the evening. I called my Wife and kids in case I didn't make it. Just so they would know that I was a moron and killed myself eating hot sauce. I caught a decent break from the symptoms for about an hour, so I decided to drive home. I live a half hour away from the office, but it's a very easy drive so I chanced it. Minor versions of what happened above occurred twice while I was going home, but it was relatively manageable... Until I got about a mile away from home and then the real stuff came back with a vengeance!<br /><br />  It was pretty late in the evening by now, so luckily there were no cars on the road. Good because the pains roared back, and I started to have trouble breathing again. I had to roll all of the windows down and stick my head outside like a dog just so I could suck in some air. By the time I parked I was hurting bad and gasping for air. I went to the door and my Wife and kids opened it up. I stumbled in and up the stairs on all fours. My kids were laughing at me saying that I was acting like a gorilla. They say the craziest things don't they?<br /><br />  After that spell subsided, I tried to lay on the couch and watch some TV to take my mind off of the pain. But then it hit me once again. My Wife was watching all of this BTW. I fell off of the couch and all I could do was squirm on the floor in agony. I started to realize something. My arms and legs were moving completely on their own. I watched my right arm just swing in random directions and it was kinda funny. Like watching myself on video. I see myself but I can't control myself. The funniest part of the night was when my Wife, while watching all of this, said "why do you do this to yourself?" So I promised her, never again :)

review/text: For a seasoned pepper fanatic like me the private reserve Jolokia ghost pepper 2010 is a rich addition to a well stocked hot store. I find the taste surprisingly balanced for a product with an estimated 700,000 Scoville score. The Jolokia is unmistakably present in the flavor without dominating it. Use with caution as it is at the edge of becoming a food additive instead of hot sauce.

review/summary: Whew, that's hot!
review/text: First off I love to break out in a big sweat and this does the trick with flying colors! I had tried the Original Dave's Insanity and had a healthy respect for the profuse sweat it would cause to run down my bald head.<br />I brought this Ghost pepper version to work for a few of us avowed hot sauce lovers to give a try. A couple of us added it to our Mexican rice and chicken, while one friend decided he would douse his burrito with the devils love juice. The fourth friend was a bit more judicious and put a few drops on the side to dip his food. When I bit into the chicken I thought that it had good heat, not too over the top. I continued on with a few more bites and was enjoying a leisurely sweat down the back of my neck until it hit me. From the back of my throat I felt a slow creep, I started to flush. My entire body felt like it was a sweating from every pore. My eyes watered, my nose ran, my tongue thickened....this is good stuff!<br />The friend that doused the chicken? Well, he was in bad shape! He actually started to turn green and pant. I think he stopped breathing for a few moments. I am AED and First Aid certified and was thinking I was going to get to try both out on him. We got him some water and made him stand up. His eyes were tearing heavily and so swollen that they were almost shut (the best thing was he actually shut up for a few minutes)! This was getting really good. He guzzled a few glasses of water and kept rubbing the sweat from his face. We alternately laughed at his predicament, and expressed great concern for his well being. After all, we are very caring people. Hehehe<br />After about 10 minutes he dumped more sauce on his chicken and went right back at it. What a nut!<br />As for me? Well I had a full body sweat. It was kinda like I had prickly heat for a full 30 minutes after I finished eating. There was nothing to put out that fire! I was duly impressed and also respectful of this Dave's Insanity Ghost Pepper Private Reserve 2011. I will be introducing my hot sauce loving friends to this, of course after giving them a serious warning.

review/text: This stuff is HOT! But then, you know that or you wouldn't be considering buying it, right? Don't purchase this if you don't like spicy. But DO purchase it if you love spicy or know someone who does. I bought this for my spice-loving fiance's birthday. He is always looking for the hottest foods out there and can't get enough heat. In fact, he usually tells waiters at Thai and Indian restaurants to "make me cry."<br /><br />This made him cry. Of course, I made him some mac and cheese and he put 5 drops in it... you're only supposed to use 1/2 a drop (whatever that means). He ate the entire dish, but was wincing and going very slowly. By the end, he said he felt like he was losing his hearing! I know... you're probably thinking "why would you want that?!?!" I don't know, but he loves it!<br /><br />The thing is, Dave's Insanity Ghost Pepper Sauce also tastes quite good and has a pretty fabulous flavor. I tried a bite of the mac and cheese and, though my mouth was burning off, it was GOOD! With only a drop of the sauce, it would have been a really enjoyable, flavorful dish.<br /><br />Also, the sauce comes with caution tape. You have to love that! If you or someone you know loves HOT, you need to get this! As far as my fiance and I have seen, it's the best out there!

review/summary: Decent heat, not what i thought
review/text: I purchased this item expecting to be blown away. The heat is 8/10 but very managable. Flavor was good, very pronounced taste of Ghost Pepper. I think its best used as an ingredient rather than a condiment. Maybe people react differantly to hot sauces but, in no way did this cause me to feel i would pass out or anything. I experianced a nice mouth burn for about 10-15 min and a warm stomach burn for an hour after.

And I like it stupid hot. This is one of the tastiest sauces so far. I lave Dave's Insanity and Pure Cap. Please don't underestimate this as it is fabulously hot, 5 alarm. It has a pleasant taste. Yes! I put some on my finger and tasted it. I love it! Please be warned that everyone in my family says my taste buds are scorched. You were warned. If your a scorcher you love the sauce.

review/summary: Insane.
review/text: I've only started enjoying spicy foods over the past 2 years or so.  I try to take it easy because I have had many acid reflux and stomach difficulties over the years.  I usually can't handle anything hotter than hot giardiniera or sport peppers...even jalepenos is pushing it.  So my husband made a large crockpot full of chili and used about 4 drops of this sauce.  What ensued was the most intense and scorching feeling I have ever felt.  Every bite was painful.  Spicy isn't a strong enough word to describe this sauce.  But I loved it!  Granted, I had to eat my chili with bread and a few tall glasses of 7up....but it was SO tasty.<br /><br />One day later - well I'm certainly not feeling normal, but I expected much worse.  I've seen my husband and his friends play "chicken" with ghost chili pepper, and that's insane.  But "chicken" with this sauce is practically suicidal.  Do NOT eat this straight; it must be diluted in food.  I truly believe this stuff is dangerous....

review/text: I had no problems with this seller however, I did have a incident when my bottle arived. I opened it, smelled it, then put the cap back on. It looked alittle clumpy so I shook the bottle to mix it up. Well it turns out the cheap ass plastic cap broke when I put the lid back on and I didnt notice the crack in it. So hot sauce.. over everything, stained my carpet, got on my bare feet, my skin burned all night. I got this stuff all over my hands when I treid to clean up the mess and ended up getting it in my nose eyes and skin. Burned everything, I was in different kinds of pain most of the night. Please send me another cap, I fashioned one out of duct tape and tin foil but it not as good as another cap. You dont want to make a mess with this stuff.

review/summary: Mild flavor makes me yearn for the original
review/text: I first discovered Rooibos tea while on safari in Africa. During the safari they would take a break and bust out some coffee and tea. On the first morning I tried the tea, and I was hooked. The flavor was fruity but not too sweet. Drinking it was very smooth, and a wonderful experience. I didn't drink any coffee the entire safari trip, just Rooibos tea (and I love coffee).<br /><br />So I'm on a quest to find that taste once again. After trying another brand, which had some additives I didn't like, I searched for pure Rooibos tea. I thought I found it in this product, but turn out it's still not quite there. This tea is definitely pure Rooibos, but it's not wrong enough. It's like a watered down version of what I had in Africa. If I use two bags per cup, then it's closer, but still not great.<br /><br />My quest continues to find the perfect Rooibos tea.

review/text: After finished several cans of DoMatcha Organic (which we REALLY love!!!), we decided to try the 2nd Harvest because of the cost factor.  Along with the decreased in price and increased in quantity, we also noticed a significant diminish in the aroma, earthy good taste, and potency.  It's noticeably bland as compared to the higher quality DoMatcha.  But....if you've never tried the other grade and/or don't like the stronger taste, then this one isn't bad for the price.  We prepared the tea the traditional way, with just hot water and whisking.  In addition, it has more bitter taste than the green can DoMatcha.

review/summary: Impressed with the taste and quality
review/text: This is an excellent matcha. I have tried several different mathcas of varying quality and from different suppliers, and this is one of the best. Everything about this matcha surprised me.  From the package inside the tin keeping it fresh (expected it loose inside the tin), to the super bright neon green color and complicated, somewhat sweet taste.  There is really no drink I enjoy more than a good matcha and this satisfies completely.<br /><br />Aside from all the apparent tastes there are two sensations that lurk right below the surface but permeate the entire experience - freshness and pleasantness.  They aren't tastes but a kind of experience that can't be seperated from the taste of the tea.  Is this what is called the 5th taste, umami?  I don't know but nothing else is as pleasant as drinking a fresh cup of this matcha.<br /><br />I know there are other better matchas out there but is anything more expensive than $10/oz really worth it?  I mean, will you actually be able to tell the difference between this and a ceremonial grade matcha selling for $30/oz? For me this is already too expensive to drink every day, but not so expensive that I can't enjoy a great cup occasionally. But if you already have a $3-5/day coffee/latte/frappe/stale teabag habit, then replacing it with this will be well worth it.

I don't believe the quality is nearly as good as Do Matcha and along with it all the health benefits.  It appears this generic matcha delivers a great deal more caffeine as well.  So, I'll be ordering Do Matcha next time!  If you are wavering over trying to decide about the Do second harvest, STOP!  It's a great product and the best value in matcha.

I prefer the DoMatcha ORGANIC Green Tea, but it is too expensive to make smoothies everyday.  2nd Harvest works just as well, and you get so much more!  I use just a teaspoon per smoothie. You will enjoy this Green Tea, you won't be disappointed! (PS-the only reason I gave 2nd Harvest 4 stars is because I prefer Organic!)

review/text: It's not that $60 matcha that I've seen online and never had, but it's pretty darn amazing!  Way better than Starbucks! This stuff spoiled me.  I hate Starbucks now.  My fraps were less than half the calories of a Starbucks' small drink and WAY healthier.

review/summary: PERFECT MATCHA FOR SMOOTHIES AND ICE CREAM!
review/text: OK, I've bought the much more expensive "ceremonial" grade, but unless you're using it straight (and even then, I like the taste), I think it's got GREAT color and taste.  I primarily use it for smoothies, but also mix with half orange or lemon juice/half water and just pour a tsp or two in a water bottle, shake and drink (if using lemon, I add honey).  MUCH better deal because it's second harvest (and you should check out nutritionally, not such a bad thing) and love the sustained, slower energy boost than I get from coffee (that takes you high than leaves you flat).  This keeps me going all day. Oh,and I mix with Haagen dazs frozen vanilla yogurt and it's one of my favorite desserts.

review/text: A little wary of the fact it's 2nd harvest and not "top of the line", I found this tea to be a vibrant green and full of matcha flavor.  It's a small container, but I'm surprised how little powder it takes to make a potent drink!

review/summary: Very nice matcha
review/text: Very smooth tea. Can drink plain. Make a latte nearly every day. It has bright green color (see photo), and very solid, reusable packaging. The internal bag the tea comes in is about 1/2 the size of the canister, which is misleading. I keep it in the bag along with a small bamboo spoon.<br /><br />Tip: If your matcha clumps, try adding the tea to cold water, stir, then heat. Be careful as it can boil over easier. As with flour and lumps, if you add it to hot water there is risk it will form a clump. The bamboo chasens really help to stir up the tea. They are 10 times better than a spoon. This brand rarely clumps.<br /><br />Made in Kyoto, Japan.

review/summary: Beautiful!
review/text: I'm no expert in tea, especially in matcha. But I could tell it was great from both the physical appearance and the taste. Even though it's not the first harvest I think it's still superb especially for people like me who are not so knowledgeable about these things. I mix it in a large cup of water with chia seeds and a little crystal light. I'm sorry if that sounds strange but I think I get the best of both worlds that way: omega3 from chia seeds and antioxidants from matcha!

review/summary: awful taste and expensive
review/text: I can appreciate the expensive DoMatcha organic first harvest.  I won't say it's delicious but the flavor is obviously high quality.<br /><br />This cheaper 2.8 oz DoMatcha is acrid and astringent.  It tastes like regular bancha green tea and reminds me of a really bad dark chocolate (strong in a bad, not chocolaty, way).  I'll finish this stuff off since it probably is decent quality in health terms but I wouldn't buy it again for a nickel.<br /><br />There seems to be two strong opinions on which DoMatcha is superior and better tasting.  If you are looking for flat out strong flavor and "kick" then the 2.8 oz is probably your favorite.  I prefer the smooth and flavorful but subtle first harvest.  It's expensive but they are both relatively very expensive.  You are paying for the health and flavor quality and the absence of offensive taste which is hard to find in matcha.  If the flavor isn't that important, why not buy the cheap matcha by the pound instead of both paying a lot and not getting much?

review/summary: Excellent Product--Addicted
review/text: I originally started drinking matcha because of my love for all things green.  I ordered the highest grade DoMatcha product and was instantly hooked.  The earthy flavor, the smooth taste, the rich green color.  An excellent product by-and-by.  After placing several orders, I switched to this grade due to price point and size.  I order two at a time and go through them in a month.  The taste differs only slightly, foams great.  Still an excellent, excellent product.<br />PLUS... the shipping is so fast.  I get low on my last tin, place an order, and before I know it (and just in time), I have my new matchas at my doorstep.<br /><br />Thank you DoMatcha for your great product and customer service!<br /><br />(P.S. The subscribe and save option is worth it!)

A decent buy if you are a health nut.

review/summary: Black lava and Red Alaea - both great!
review/text: These are both very nice salts.  As promised, I can taste a hint of charcoal in the black lava and a hint of clay in the red.  I certainly don't consider myself to have a refined palate, but there is no mistaking the flavours. A little goes a long way - another reason this salt is well worth the extra expense.  I guess I'll have to try the bamboo next.
