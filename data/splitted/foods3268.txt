review/summary: The "Best" Chocolate Chip Cookie!
review/text: We received these cookies on a Delta Airline flight out of Narita, Japan a few days ago. It's the best chocolate chip cookie we've ever had. It's not just loaded with chocolate chips like most, but the cookie itself is light chocolate, with also some chocolate chips. It is not overdone with chips though. It's crunchy, but not hard. It will go good with icy cold milk!

review/text: I bought these candied orange peels because of the price.  I didn't know if they would be very good.  What a pleasant surprise I got!!  They are wonderful.  They are juicy and tender.  I bought them in a 2 LB pack because the shipping was more economical that way.  We like to dip them in chocolate.<br />  I am very pleased with these and I shall purchase from this company again.

review/summary: Disappointing Flavor
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Cameron's flavored coffees, but this flavor was new to me. As usual, the beans were shiny and fresh right out of the bag.<br /><br />The smell out of the bag and while brewing was absolutely fantastic, and I got my hopes up for a rich chocolate and cherry flavor. However, the chocolate was mostly undetectable and the cherry flavor tasted like cough syrup. The cherry flavoring is so strong that I have abandoned these beans for drinking - they are now air fresheners. A very disappointing flavor. Buy Jamaican Me Crazy or Chocolate Caramel Brownie instead.

Although a few of the tins were dinted upon my receipt and you had to eat two or more of the mints to really enjoy the mint flavor, everyone truly enjoyed them. I was asked by numerous people, where they were purchased. Because it was a religious event, the Mint Tins were very appropriate. Should the need arise again,, I would certainly choose them again.

My advice to others: don't trust "SimplyBeautiful", don't trust their products.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I got a refund on this purchase.  Still think the stuff tastes like nasty medicine, which may be what some want (long history as herbal cure-all) but not me.  Still don't want to deal with "SimplyBeautiful" again.

It has a great kick (1000 mg of Taurine as well as caffeine and ginseng) and find the 8.3 oz. can to be just the right size and is easily transportable. It also tastes less artificial (some energy drinks taste like fizzy cough syrup). This has a clean taste and I don't feel gross chugging it down.<br /><br />I've been drinking this for over a year and a half now. It cured my jet lag on a trip to NYC in 2005. I'm glad I found it here on Amazon because even though it's stocked at Whole Foods, I usually end up grabbing the few remaining cans on the shelf.

review/summary: Tastes like healthier, fruitier Red Bull
review/text: Blue Energy is a nice energy drink that packs a punch that lasts about 3-4 hours then tapers off with no sugar crash. Tastes like a healthier, fruitier Red Bull, which is a good thing. It has about half as much caffeine as most other drinks. It's natural, not organic, and while not specifically touted as being allergen-free, it certainly appears to be as I've drunk several cans with no ill effect and I have multiple food allergies (to gluten, dairy, soy, etc.).<br /><br />For an organic energy drink that delivers on taste and performance without a ton of caffeine, try Opta Energy, which comes in two flavors: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0078DWMUI">Opta Energy, Organic Berry Fusion Energy Drink, 12/12 Oz</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GTU65Y">Yumberry, Passionate Orange, 12.00 OZ (Pack of 12) ( Value Bulk Multi-pack)</a>. These are 1.5 servings per can sizes so that can be helpful if you need an extra little boost later without committing to a whole can. Also, they keep remarkably well after opened in the refrigerator. I've reviewed both flavors.

review/summary: Blue Sky energy Drink
review/text: This drink is not one of the best I have used. The taste is medicinal. I have better results energy and calorie burning wise with Celcius and VPX drinks. The Celcius available for really great value at Costco and the VPX, among many others, at Amazon, or Vitamin Shop. Blue Sky enters this market with a poor tasting product and hopes to overcome it's shortfall by claiming it is all natural. Too bad.

review/summary: This Does the Whole Thing
review/text: I use this -- for the most part -- instead of bread. I am Bi-Coastal and I keep these in the freezer both home in NYC and out West. I will have one or two a day and that is it for bread products. Two is 120 calories. You can use them to wrap anything you like. If you want some tensile strength just leave one on the counter for a while before using. This has cache. Who wouldn't want a crepe as a sort of ultimate gourmet taco? Not knockin' tacos or bread, but if you are a minimalist like me you want few things that are great. These take up no room. You can order them in bulk. Among my uses -- to wrap concoctions I create and make a meal. YYou do not neeed much of a concocktion. Max two tablespoonfuls. To put melted cheeze on and wrap up and make a meal. To put a spoonful of icecream on and wrap up and make a treat. To put a bit of preserves on and roll up for my equivalent of a treat. And you know what? When you do not need any, they are still there, taking up little room and available whenever you get the urge. Bread substitute? Well, everyone needs bread. I still go out for breakfast in NYC and will have a Bialy. But before I used to do three bialy's worth of bread a day. I have cut that by more than half. As far as I know this is the only product like this. I am well satisfied. Class act from California.

These are easy to use especially if you need a large quantity of crepes.  These crepes make excellent cheese blintzs, too. Yummy!

review/summary: way too thin, almost like eating paper
review/text: I just moved back to the USA from a country in Europe where you can actually get original French crepes, and was quite excited to find these ready-to-use crepes in my local grocery store. What a disappointment! Right off the bat, the first crepe was stuck to the plastic wrapping, so it came out of the package in shreds. The crepe is way too thin, almost to the point of being tasteless. Will not buy it again for sure.

I'm a picky eater and can almost always taste when something lacks flavor as well as taste like it's full of preservatives.  These crepes are just the opposite and are super easy to store and make.

review/text: My fault for not realizing how small the 7-lbs "jugs" are -- I was thinking of them as the "small" jugs, which in my mind are the 14-lb ones. I've never even seen 7-lb containers before.  They are so small, 1 literally filled up the litter tray when I changed it -- almost. So I completely overpaid for in essence 1 21-lb jug of litter -- over $20! Again, my fault for not reading more carefully, but it's a TOTAL rip-off. Don't make the same mistake!

review/summary: Good basic litter
review/text: In my experience (dealing with over 300 cats daily at an animal shelter), this is an above average cat litter.  Most cats dislike strong-smelling litter.  They will go outside of the litter box rather than deal with litter that has a strong scent.  This litter does not have an overly strong scent, like Fresh Step, so cats tend not to mind this one so much.  In addition, it has a finer consistency than a lot of litters (especially pellet litters, like Feline Pine), which is also a plus for most cats. There is also minimal dust to irritate the cats' eyes or noses.<br /><br />The one negative aspect, and the reason I only gave it 3 stars rather than 4 stars, is the price.  It is fairly pricey compared to similar generic alternatives.

review/summary: best clumping litter period
review/text: I have tried over a dozen different brands on my two 6yo cats and tidy cats scoop is the only one without any flaws.  tidy cats scoop is low dust, low perfume, low tracking, non-irritating, strong fast clumps that hold together during scooping, with average size bits and no sand.  this litter is for garbage disposal only - do NOT attempt to flush this down your toilet or you will eventually clog the S-trap.  my only regret is you can't get it shipped online for less than double what it costs to pick up at any Target.  I highly recommend using the following litter scoop with tidy cats scoop; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035M36BK">Ultra Pet Little Pearls Litter Scoop, 1-Count Scoop (Pack of 6)</a> and get a 60gal covered plastic storage box from HomeDepot/Lowes, cut a foot wide oval hole in the top for the perfect large capacity low odor easy to clean litter box costing you under $20 to make for a larger DIY version of; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ZS20I">Clevercat Top Entry Litterbox</a>

review/summary: Tidy Cat VS Fresh Step Scoopable Litter...Fresh Step wins hands down!
review/text: I was so disappointed with Tidy Cat scoopable litter that I was about to go back to the regular litter, but decided to give it one more go with a different brand. The trouble with Tidy Cat is that the soiled litter would turn to a thick, sticky mud that was very difficult to scoop and would leave a lot of mud-like residue behind. I would end up emptying the entire litter box, clean it out, and start from scratch which defeated the purpose of scoopable litter.<br /><br />Fresh Step proved to be a major improvement. It is so much easier to scoop and doesn't turn into the sticky mud that Tidy Cat would form. I can actually scoop now and not have to empty the entire litter box.<br /><br />Both Fresh Step and Tidy Cat controlled odor. Tidy Cat's plastic container was a bit easier to transport. Fresh Step prevents litter mess and waste; thus, saves money as pound for pound it scooped better and last longer. Fresh Step wins hands down as it is by far the most scoopable litter.

review/text: This is the only litter I've used since I got my cat, Indy, and it works very well. It clumps almost instantly (hence the name).  Very easy to sift out.  I used to get the big 20lbs (or more) bucket, which was ardous to pour into her box.  I like this smaller jug because it's easier to handle and refill the box with what i need quickly.  I live in an attic apartment.  I keep her litter box at the bottom of the staircase in the back of my apartmen.  My apt has never smelled like a cat bathroom to me or any guests i've had. Indy seems to like it too :)

review/summary: Great litter, but wasteful packaging.
review/text: We had been using the Arm & Hammer Super Scoop brand through the subscribe & save option, and found that it did not clump sufficiently, making clean-up for two cats difficult.  The Tidy Cats clumps better, and we've had fewer urine odor problems as a result, but I was disappointed to realize how wasteful the packaging is for this particular item.  It is three heavy-duty plastic bottles which each weigh only seven pounds.  I didn't realize how small a 7-pound jug actually is until we received the first shipment.  Since I've yet to come up with any ideas for reusing the empty litter jugs, and don't like the environmental waste of using so much plastic (even if we try to recycle it, plastic recycling is so inefficient), we may have to find some other litter solution.

review/summary: Quality food without the unnecessary additives
review/text: Cats are carnivores.  If you check out the ingredients list for many of the common brands you find at the grocery store, you'll see the first couple of ingredients are *not* meat, but rather grains.  As well, the meat typically is made up of by-products, which are not suitable for human consumption.  Yes,  I know, we're not going to be consuming our feline companion's food, but the reality is with cats and their funky digestive tract issues, their food should not contain grain or meat by-products, plain and simple.<br /><br />There are a number of outstanding grain-free cat foods out there, but this one in particular our cats eat happily.  One of our cats was significantly overweight, and with NOW recommended by our veterinarian , my fiancee gave it a try. At the time he began this food, we were actually living on opposite coasts and I hadn't seen the cats in roughly 8 months given my travels.  When I saw our cat after that absence, I was shocked to see how slimmed down he was and how healthy he had become.  Using this food, in combination with that feeding bowl in which the cats have to stick their paws into to retrieve the food (looks like a flying saucer) has been the key to success!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product is not widely stocked at pet care places in our area, but I am delighted that Amazon carries it.  I've been able to order it, trouble-free, and the food arrives fresh and ready to be consumed.  I highly recommend this brand and encourage you to read the ingredient labels on anything you feed your pet-companions.

review/summary: Great ingredients, I think.
review/text: I bought a small bag of this to try with my cats.  One is 16 years old and the other 10.  Both seemed to enjoy it as a snack, so I went back and bough the large 10lb bag, thinking I was doing them a favor.  The ingredients are impressive, however, as I slowly moved them over from their traditional Purina One to this product, both of them developed a severe case of the runs.  So, I portioned them back to a larger portion of the Purina One thinking they needed more time to adjust to this new food, however I can't seem to get them back to normal.  So, I have 95% of this bag and am not currently feeding them any of it.  I also had to get some remedy for the diahrrea, which is taking time to kick in.<br /><br />As I mentioned, they seemed to love the taste, but it has been a big problem for their digestive systems.

review/summary: Great for older cat with sensitive skin
review/text: About a year ago, my 12-year-old cat developed an itchy rash on her forehead.  The vet ruled out more serious health issues, and speculated that it was an allergic reaction or food sensitivity.  And so began a year of cat food experiments...<br /><br />We tried a range of grain-free foods with various protein sources.  Some didn't help the skin; some she didn't like. The local pet food store suggested this.  The big selling point was that it doesn't have any "meals"-- no "chicken meal" or "fish meal" or "turkey byproduct" or whatever.  She has been eating this for the past 6 months or so, and her skin has cleared up remarkably.  And the fact that she taps on my cheek until I wake up and feed her in the morning suggests that it is also quite delicious.<br /><br />It is expensive, but it has helped her skin issues enough that it's been worth it.  (A trip to the vet costs quite a bit more!)  If you have an older cat that seems to have developed a food sensitivity, this is definitely a good option to try.

review/text: As any cat owner will tell you, cat digestive systems are a royal challenge.  Now! Dry Cat Food is a unique product that doesn't have any fillers, no grain at all, and the meat that is used contains no by-products.  Essentially, it's human-grade.<br /><br />Cat's are carnivores, plain and simple.  And this food addresses that beautifully.<br /><br />This particular formula, for senior and overweight cats, has made a huge difference in the quality of our cat's health.  My cats love the taste, never turn their nose up from this product, and my formerly over-weight cat is now looking terrific, and both he and his brother are very healthy - healthy coat, bright eyes, etc.<br /><br />Unfortunately this product is not sold every where (yet)but I am grateful I can get it here on Amazon!  I highly recommend this brand.

review/summary: Great for cat with Irritable Bowel Syndrome
review/text: I've purchased the Now! Grain free (10 lbs) turkey with duck & salmon dry cat food 3 times now over the past 4 months.  Wanted to see how our cat with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) would do on it.  He loves it, and will chow it down to the point where he would get fat, if we let him.  Have to portion it out to him thru the day.  Other cat loves it, too, and she no longer vomits on a regular basis.  Definitely a good quality product which is sold at our veterinarian's office, but I buy it online with Amazon for better price. Sidenote:  we're gradually starting to reduce the amount of budesonide medicine given to our cat with IBS problem to eventually see how he does without the medicine & if he's okay just being on Now! grain free food.

review/summary: Great tasting, balanced protein & fat, LOW phosphorous, great for cat with kidney problem
review/text: My cat just love them, chomping down the kibbles. He has started to gain weight & muscle back, and I am very happy with the results. I also add 1/4 cup of NON salted chicken soup after the food. I'll be doing another blood test in 6 months. Will do future update.<br /><br />My two years young cat has high blood level BUN (60) and creatinnine (1.9), vomiting and not eating, and vet recommended changing food. He was on high protein diet, and I was surprise to learn that some type of cat are more sensitive to protein/phosphorous level. Chose "Now! Dry Cat Food for Adult Cats, Grain Free Turkey with Duck" because it has the lowest phosphorous dry adult cat food I can find, without going the prescription food route. The phosphorous level is 0.65% dry matter, considered to be on the low but acceptable. The protein(30%) quality is high, grain free and acceptable fat(18%) level. Most other non-prescription dry kibbles phosphorous range from 0.60% to 2%. Only prescription food can be lower than 0.5%. Phosphorous is important to health, but must be on lower range for pets with that are phosphorous sensitive.<br /><br />Price of food is on par with other grain free, non rendered meats pet food. I witnessed fantastic results in  my cat, who is now normal weight masculine happy active cat :-) ... woo hoo!!! MEOW!!! =>o&lt;=

I rather spend the money buying EVO until P&G changes their formula.

review/summary: Cat's coat has never been softer!
review/text: After searching for a grain free cat food that made our cat happy, we discovered Now!. He loves it and it has made his coat super soft. He eats less compared to the grain stuff, and he seems satisfied for longer. We haven't switched for 3 years. When our cat lost a few of his teeth, we tried a soft food, but he preferred this softened with water to canned food, even.<br /><br />The side benefit was the smell from his litterbox dropped dramatically compared to the brands we tried previously.

review/text: Be sure to note that the reason they can call this 'grain free' is because they use potato and pea starch instead. (Just read the ingredients.)<br /><br />I ordered some without realizing this--when you open the bag you will be knocked off your feet by the smell of instant mashed potatoes.<br /><br />If your goal is to get your cat off starches, this isn't the one.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: First, let me say ... To those of you who are reading reviews to gauge if you should by this or not, please don't base if you buy it or not on those reviewers who gave 1 and 2 stars only because of the SHIPPING! That has nothing to do with the juice itself! If you want to review the problem with shipping, don't leave it here, take it to amazon's customer care!<br /><br />On to the actual review. GREAT! I've purchased maybe 8 different brands of 'organic' juice in the last month alone and all have fallen flat. I finally found this one at the Whole Foods Store. When I'm out shopping for something new, I usually go to amazon.com to search for the product and read the customer reviews while I'm standing in the store with the product in my hand. This time, I was in such a hurry that I didn't because I actually thought that this would taste as bad as the other organic juices no matter what the reviews say. Thank goodness I was surprised. My daughter loves it. I tasted it and it tastes great. No sugar added? Yet it still tastes like fruit juice and not watered down crap. Thanks for this! Will continue to buy from the store.

review/summary: burst in shipment
review/text: I should have heeded the other review. Two of the pouches burst in my shipment, soaking all the boxes and pouches. So I had to open all four cases and take all 24 juice pouches out as soon as I brought it into my house, find the ones that burst, and wash the juice off all the others. I couldn't store any of them in the boxes they came in, since they were wet with juice. Unlike the other reviewer, my shipment had nothing else but the juice pouches in it, so I don't think it was items shifting that caused the problem.  Maybe something with the temperature in shipment or maybe the pouches themselves are weak?  The juice tastes great, and even though I don't really mind losing two, the mess is a problem and I won't order these again.

review/text: My children really like the juice. So I would give it 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately, one juice from each box leaked. When the juices were shipped, they were also shipped with 3 other bulk snack items in a large box. The juices were the heaviest items in the box. The other items were crackers and cereal bars. I'm not sure if this was the reason why the juices popped or if they pop regardless of the shipping procedures. Good luck with your purchase.

Nostalgic contrast to the Red Vines in the day of the "grab bag" and 15 cent candy bars from the ice cream man that could be bought in the store for a nickle.  They were received fresh and within two weeks.  They are a little smaller (shorter and thinner) than the vines in the traditional small grocery packaging, but the taste is not compromised.  Price is average and the shipping cost was a bit on the high side, so there is definetly no bargain here, otherwise enjoyable.

review/text: I really recommend this noodle.  It is very delicious... My family's favorite is still the original flavor and not other spicy or shrimp flavor.  Just boil, once it's softened strain the noodle then mix with the seasoning.  The smell is so aromatic.  The packing is misleading though cause people might think there're additional ingredients other than the seasoning itself.  Normally we'd boil the frozen mix vege together with the noodle and fry some eggs to accompany it.  My toddler loves this noodle.  You can buy an individual pack at 99 ranch grocery store.

review/summary: Thoroughly Awesome Noodles
review/text: This is my second 30-pack of Mi Goreng noodles. The first I bought was BBQ Chicken flavor, and I was seriously impressed with their taste. My roommate and I polished off 30 of them in less than a week, so I just had to grab another case. These (the regular flavor) are quite good, although I do prefer the taste of BBQ Chicken. Each package comes with an adequate amount of noodles and seasoned oil, sweetened soy sauce, chili powder, and sauce mix. The oil and soy sauce packets are horribly designed. Anyone who can open them and squeeze out all of the liquid without getting it all over the place is seriously talented. Very Asia (the company that ships these) is pretty speedy, although these arrived slightly damaged (the sauce packages were busted in a few of the noodles). The BBQ Chicken case I ordered, however, was completely undamaged, so I guess it's hit or miss in that department. Anyway, buy these things. They are delicious and easy, and much better than plain old ramen noodles.

review/text: I first became addicted to Mi Goreng in university. Attracted initially by the cheapness of the product - which appealed to my frequently empty wallet. Soon after I was hooked. Even now as an employed person with a steady income, I still enjoy these noodles. They take me back to a simpler time when furniture was sourced from the side of the road and washed clothes was a luxury.<br /><br />High quality noodles with a great, complex flavour and just the right amount of MSG. Great for quick snacks, or as an additive to stir frys.<br /><br />Note: there is no egg inside the bag - no matter how hard you look.

review/summary: Still Very Good, but Not The Same...
review/text: I fell in love with these while going to University in Australia. Eating three packs a day was not a rare event for me to say the least! These were my dietary staple - especially because you could easily add steamed veggies, garlic, shrimp, fish, crab, fried/poached egg, etc...to make it a more substantial meal.<br /><br />What I love about this instant noodle is that it is similar to Ramen in price and preparation but stepped up several levels in taste and complexity. I loved that there were five seasoning packets - a seasoning powder, fried onions, and three liquids which were chili paste, sweet soy sauce, and oil.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is IMPOSSIBLE to find that five-packet version in the states! When I ordered these here (also ordered from several other specialty sites) they only came with four packets :( No fried onions, and the chili paste was instead a chili powder. While they still taste great, they are not the incredibly addicting noodles I was used to as a poor college student in Australia. I still crave that same taste I got from the version sold in Australia. I wish these were the same so badly, but they are not.<br /><br />I have also noticed a few other reviewers saying it does taste differently than what they remember. I still absolutely recommend these though, because they are still delicious and I always have a case available in the house. Would switch in a heartbeat though if I could find the original five-packet version!

review/text: Tastes OK. Heres an idea of what it taste like if you've never had it: You could probably achieve a similar taste with common instant ramen  (maruchan, sapporo ichiban). Cook without seasoning. Drain. Add half seasoning packet, dash of veg oil and a dab sweet soy sauce. The sweet soy sauce is the main difference from other noodles.<br /><br />More importantly the online price @ $20 is double of what you would pay for at an asian grocery (i know not everyone has access to them but still good to know you're being ripped off). Furthermore the street price in indonesia is about 17 cents for each pack ( .17*30= $5.10) whereas this price is 67 per pack
