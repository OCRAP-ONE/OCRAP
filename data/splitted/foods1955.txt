review/summary: Love it and addicted to it but wont buy it from here at $40 +S&H
review/text: Yes it is the replacement for the original General Foods International Cappuccino Coolers and I am addicted to it I think. It is little bit different, I think they lower the sugar content in this new one and it has little bit more coffee taste to it vs. the original but I still love it. But what's with the price? I use to by this for around $15 pr box of 8 and now it's like $50? wtf when did this happen, I am still buying it locally at the original price and now I found out that even Wall Mart is selling it for about $1.80 a box! I guess I won't be buying it from here any more!

review/summary: Seller Rip-off
review/text: This is the same product as the Cappuccino Coolers.  Just the name has changed and the packaging.  They are available in most Walmart stores that have a grocery store.  They are also sold in Rainbow stores in MN, in Publix stores in Florida and some Hyvee stores in the midwest.  I have never seen such a high price as these sellers are asking. Notice that Amazon is not the seller.  The price has not changed much since Maxwell House added their name.  They are still only $1.89 - $2.09 in all of the stores I mentioned.  Shame on these sellers for suggesting $49.95 for 2 boxes. They aren't that hard to find!! One seller asks $6.09 for shipping and the other wants $16.99 for the exact same product to ship.  You can probably go on line to Walmart or Publix or maybe Rainbow and see if they will ship you a case.  I guarantee it won't cost a fraction of the $49.95.  Good luck.

review/summary: Different than the old one, but still good
review/text: Kraft got rid of the General Foods brand and replaced the Cappuccino Coolers under the Maxwell House brand and the new name Iced Latte.  I agree with the other reviewer that the flavor changed a little bit.  IMO it's not quite as good as the old one, but it's still good enough that I drink one everyday!  (Well, I only drink 1/2 packet at a time.)  I suggest serving it over ice and topping it with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles!<br />BUT, this is a ridiculous price!  A box costs $2 at my Walmart and other grocery stores.

review/text: I've been drinking these things since they came out in the late 90's.  Something has changed with the formula when it went all 'iced latte'.  The french vanilla tastes odd compared to it's prior version.  I now drink the hazelnut exclusively, because the product didn't change with the name change.  Just a warning before you go buy this flavor in bulk, the french vanilla is different!  Agreed, this product is very hard to find but worth a bulk purchasing trip when you do know where they are sold.

review/text: These sellers are taking advantage of ignorant people, or trying to, I guess. One box is less than two dollars at Walmart. Please shop around.<br /><br />This coffee is very good. A touch too sweet and not a lot of coffee flavor, but I enjoy drinking it. It is a very cost effective way of having an iced coffee. The french vanilla flavor is my favorite and much better than the hazlenut. For some reason, the hazlenut flavor leaves a powdery taste and is a little chemically. If you like more coffee taste, you can try Starbucks Via. Their caramel iced coffee is very good but I do experiment with how much I add because it can get bitter..

review/text: I have been looking for something to replace the General Foods French Vanilla Cappuccino Coolers that have been near impossible to find on line or in my local area.  In fact, I think that this is the same product as the French Vanilla Cappuccino Coolers, but in a similiar package and under a new name.  I believe that both General Foods and Maxwell House are owned by Kraft, so it appears to be the same product.  I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys a quick pick me up in the morning or in the late afternoon.

review/summary: Excellent, With A Variety Of Uses..
review/text: I am admittedly a big fan of Barry Farm products.  They make just about any food, veggie, dairy product, or spice in either a freeze dried or powdered form.  As an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys carrying along a little taste of home into the savage wilderness, this is a company that I am well familiar with.  Not everything they make is delicious, or worth it. My experience with them however is that most of their products are just about the finest, and many times the only ones around.  This cheddar cheese powder is definitely one of their best.  Many reviewers here mention making macaroni and cheese, and popcorn with it.  Although I have used it for those purposes like everyone else, I have also used this powder as an addition to many soups that call for cheese, or grated cheese. (It makes a very flavorful substitute for grated cheese in many recipes.) Hamburger and sausage soups are a good example.  Many times I have concocted delicious one pot meals using this powder while out in the wilds on a hike, or camping. They are remembered as some of the best meals I have ever had. It is also very good when sprinkled on home made pizza, and I have an excellent recipe that includes this powder, butter, flour, and salt, that makes a delicious cheese spread for crackers and super bowl parties. Barry Farms cheddar powder is strong and flavorful, and a little goes a long ways.  A one pound bag will get you through many a recipe and outdoor adventure.  However since the shipping on this is a little high, (and the powder so reasonable) I suggest buying two pounds or more at once and storing it in a good air tight container.  You will save a lot on the shipping, and this powder will last for months if stored correctly.  I highly recommend this cheddar powder for those that enjoy the simple pleasures of popcorn and mac and cheese, as well as the more adventurous among us in the kitchen, and over an open fire...

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I've been looking for this for 30 years.  I boldly assert that this is IDENTICAL, flavor-wise, to the Kraft mac-and-cheese powder.  I'm pretty sure I've tried every form of boxed mac-and-cheese and can't begin to count the thousands of boxes that I and my family have gone through so I'm pretty confident in the accuracy of the prior sentence. In our house, whenever we make mac-and-cheese, we use extra packets of cheese, leaving orphaned boxes of uncooked noodles for later use.  In the last two weeks, we've burned through three pounds of the Barry Farm cheese and a bunch of boxes of unloved pasta. Here's what I've learned:<br /><br />1. As other reviewers have mentioned, you really can't use this exactly like you would the real Kraft powder. It will clump into little chewy cheese nuggets that don't quite work like the Kraft powder. You should mix the powder with a small amount of water/milk, making a paste, prior to adding it to your cooked pasta. As the cheese powder rehydrates, it will thicken a bit. If you plan to use it later, make it slightly runnier than you'd like.  It'll firm up.<br /><br />2. You don't NEED salt, milk, or butter.  I prefer adding a bit of butter to the cooked pasta, but it's just fine to add the cheese, alone, to the noodles.<br /><br />3. This is fantastic for leftover mac-and-cheese.  Kraft veterans know that leftover Kraft dinner is never quite the same as a fresh pot.  The Barry Farm powder, however, completely turns that notion on its head.  Add some of the paste to day old mac-and-cheese, reheat, and it's as good as when it was first made.<br /><br />4. This is great for independent children.  :) My 6-year-old can take some cooked pasta (stored in a zip-top bag), stir in some of the cheese-paste and reheat it for a quick one bowl snack/meal, very much like EasyMac, only significantly better tasting.<br /><br />5. You'll use more of this to flavor your mac-and-cheese than you would if it were the real Kraft powder.  Not a lot more, but it doesn't seem to be a 1:1 conversion.<br /><br />Yesterday, I ordered six more pounds of this stuff and will continue to keep it in our pantry for as long as it's available.  If it came in 50-lb sacks, I'd buy that, too.  It's a fantastic product and I'm thrilled to have found it.

review/summary: good, cheaper option
review/text: I'm on my 2nd bag of this stuff.<br /><br />This IS the KRAFT cheese powder! I at one point emailed Barry farms concerning something about it, and they told me it they buy 50 lb bags of the stuff from Kraft and break it down into 1 lb bags. All the same, its cheaper than buying the little round canisters of cheese powder that kraft sells for popcorn.<br /><br />To compare to the stuff in the blue box mac and cheese, so I suggest 1/4 cup of cheese powder to 1/2 cup of pasta (uncooked) -- but you can experiment for yourself.<br /><br />In terms of making mac and cheese, I suggest mixing it up with a little oil and milk (as suggested on the Kraft Mac & cheese boxes) and making sure the sauce is smooth BEFORE putting it on the cooked pasta or it will clump. The stuff for the blue box contains something to make it mix in smooth that the stuff for the popcorn doesn't have, so you do need to work a little to make sure the texture is smooth.<br /><br />It is kind of sad that the shipping for this is so expensive (over twice the price of the item itself) but thats more about the post office than the company that sells it. Even so it still comes out cheaper than buying the little blue Kraft tubes of the stuff -- your not paying for the extra packaging.

review/text: Oh, how I love thee, Cheese Powder! Let me count the ways: macaroni and cheese on the cheap, added to soups or casseroles instead of real cheese, sprinkled on popcorn or homemade corn chips--or just lick a finger and dip into the neon orange powder and lick again--delicious!<br /><br />To make 2 servings of Kraft-like mac and cheese: cook 1 cup pasta (mini ziti is fun), reserving a bit of cooking liquid when you strain it. Then add 3 tablespoons of cheese powder and a pat of butter. Stir until the cheese powder is dissolved (though it's known to clump a little, here and there). Add a bit more water if needed, or if too watery, just turn the heat back on and boil it away. We've always added in cooked meat or flavorings to taste. We love ham bits and fresh ground pepper on ours.<br /><br />Tastes just like the "blue box" Kraft, but is way cheaper and more convenient! Word has it that this actually comes from Kraft itself. They buy it in bulk and repackage it as needed for resale. Nice!<br /><br />Now if you're looking for cheese powder for making the cheese sauce that you'd put over broccoli and the like, that would be this powder here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9ZM7M?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8

review/text: I bought this because I would buy Kirkland (Costco's brand) instant mac 'n' cheese and almost always only use the cheese powder as a quick way to make mac n cheese with my favorite pasta. When it came in the mail (quick shipping), I noticed that it has no packaging date, sell by date, or expiration date. I found that a little odd and was iffy to use it but tried it out anyway. From reading other reviews that it tasted similar to them as using store brand powdered cheese, I made my recipe with the usual amount of pasta and put an equal amount of cheese powder as the box would have. It tasted bland to me and my boyfriend. We added more powder but still nothing much. Then some salt this time and it was a TAD bit better but not much. Given the vague packaging of this product and the bland taste of the powder, I'll stick with using individual boxes of mac n cheese powder.

review/text: This Cheddar Powder is the BEST I've tasted. I've had some from other manufacturers, but THIS is (in my opinion) the best.<br /><br />To be PERFECTLY CLEAR, this isn't a pure cheddar powder. Pure cheddar powder is light and airy, and has a lot of fat, but little taste.<br /><br />This Cheddar cheese powder, on the other hand, is actually a mix of ingredients, including buttermilk solids, cheese, whey, and salt (among others.)<br /><br />Each powder (pure, and this one) has its uses, though I find I use this one a lot more often.<br /><br />What can you do with Cheddar Cheese Powder? Well, if you like Macaroni and Cheese, then you can make the mix even cheesier, just by adding a teaspoon or so of this powder. You can sprinkle some of it over a baked potato just before adding a dollup of sour cream for the BEST baked potato in your life! Of course, you can add it to popcorn for some amazing cheddar popcorn, but that's already been mentioned. (Personally, I prefer this product over something like Cabot's Chedar Cheese Shake, since this product is a bit more concentrated flavorwise. [Don't get me wrong! I **LOVE** Cabot cheese! I've been to the factory about 6 times! But still... This cheese powder beats theirs, imo.])<br /><br />Another great tip is making your own "Doritos." Take some of this powder, some sugar, a little bit of tomato powder, and a little garlic powder, and mix it in a bowl. In a coffee grinder, combine and grind some hot red pepper flakes (the kind you'd sprinkle over a pizza,) and some dehydrated red bell pepper flakes. Combine the ground spices with the cheese mix. You can experiment and add other things like smoked paprika or blue cheese powder to get a different taste out of your nacho cheese mix. Just add a few tablespoons to a bag of nacho chips, shake to coat, eat, and enjoy. (Also works great on baked potatos, french fries, and rice!!!)<br /><br />Cheddar Powder is one of those great spices to have in the house. It adds a bit of salt to whatever you sprinkle it on, so it works great when "plain old salt" is just too boring. But be forewarned: don't put it in a sprinkle container like a salt shaker and leave it on your table... it has a tendency to clump up.<br /><br />Store it in an airtight container, and you'll be good to go!<br /><br />The beauty of this Cheddar powder is that it also works great in bread recipes. (Hey! I've even sprinkled some of this down on plain raw pizza dough before I baked it [on the grill, by the way.] FANTASTIC!)<br /><br />For Cheddar Biscuits, get some Bisquick and add some of this Cheddar Cheese powder to the batter before cooking. YUM to the nth degree! :)<br /><br />(Oh, and, for what it's worth, whenever I buy it, I always get the 5lb bag. Shipping is just way cheaper that way.)<br /><br />Great stuff!

review/summary: Spray Popcorn with Pam then toss with Cheese
review/text: I love this Cheese!  I have tried a few and nothing is as good.  I pop my popcorn in a pot with as little oil as possible so the cheese doesn't always stick well and I end up with a lot in the bottom of the bowl.  I found that if I spray a little cooking oil spray on the popcorn as I toss it in my bowl it sticks much better.  I prefer the olive oil.  I have also found that I can use less cheese powder if I toss in some onion powder.

review/summary: Uncharacteristic tangy, sour taste.
review/text: I bought this cheese to use as a flavoring for microwave popcorn. I know there are lots of good reviews for this product, but I thought is was terrible.<br /><br />Taste is a matter of taste.<br /><br />This cheese has a very tangy, sour, taste to it. Very uncharacteristic of cheddar cheese. When used on popcorn, the tangy-ness of it overrides the little cheese flavor of the product. It is a taste that is very inappropriate and uncharacteristic of cheese flavored popcorn. You are much better off just buying a quality bag of cheese popcorn. Also, it doesn't stick to the popcorn very well and half of the cheese is left in the bag.<br /><br />I decided to use this stuff to make mac and cheese. I made it very simple. Butter, milk, and this cheese product. With gentle prolonged heating, and cooking down the milk to thicken, the cheese melted very well. Creamy with no lumps. The tangy, sour taste, was overwhelming. I had to throw out the mac and cheese. At least I was able to eat the popcorn.<br /><br />I can't recommend this product. If you are looking for powered cheddar cheese, try a different product before you try this one.

review/summary: yes, it does macaroni
review/text: Seems some folks in the review space have a problem when a pound of cheese powder comes in, when they ordered a pound of cheese powder.<br /><br />Let me break it down for you. If you dump this stuff straight on macaroni, you'll get stubborn clumps and a thin cheese gruel that's much more watery than your kraft stuff. You need a thickener, I use a tablespoon of flour for each serving. You need to break up the clumps in the cheese powder. I accomplish this with a blender bottle, basically a wire whisk in a shake bottle.<br /><br />Now here's how I make one serving of macaroni. Your mileage may vary, my measurements are guesstimates as I always "eyeball" my quantity.<br />3 tbsp cheese powder<br />1 tbsp flour<br />milk, if desired<br />salt, to taste<br />enough water to get it to the right consistency, not sure how much<br />1/2 cup macaroni elbows<br /><br />Cook the elbows, dump the water, blend the cheese sauce ingredients with like a whisk or something, dump in with macaroni, simmer until it gets gooey. Add butter if you want.<br /><br />I've paid the kingly fee to have barry farms ship me five pounds of the stuff so far, it works for macaroni.

review/summary: ARTIFICIAL TASTING STUFF
review/text: I read another review of this product that stated that this product's first and main ingredient is whey.  Whey is a by-product of milk (remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey).  Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude.  Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff.  I couldn't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review.  It's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese.  I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for.  I just didn't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review.  There are no ingredients listed on the label.  Now I understand why most liked the product.  I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange/yellow powder in the packet inside the box.  And most have come to think of that taste as cheese.  Finer tastes however will reject this stuff, I think because it has little cheese.  Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well.  The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese.  Plus the aging.  Whey requires no aging or cultures.  Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orange/yellow color.  This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag.  I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling.  I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming.  If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff.  I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact.  By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein.  In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained.  I'm not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first.  I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists.  Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th.  I really don't like the taste of whey powder.  It is crude and acidic.  And that is to me what this stuff tastes like.  I doubt whether I'll buy any more of this.  To each his own taste, though.  I don't purport to know what anyone else prefers.

review/text: While this maybe more versatile it is definitely not cheaper than buying boxed mac and cheese. The only benefit you get is that you get to pick what kind of pasta you use it for. When i got this I thought this would be great to have, now i can make wheat pasta with this mac and cheese. That was the only benefit....<br />This powdered cheese is in my opinion too expensive and not natural or organic or anything of that nature. It is exactly the same cheese youd get in the Kraft box. It has yellow dyes in it and all the other chemicals and preservatives ...<br />Do yourself a favor spend the extra buck and buy the Hodgson Mill Wheat Mac And Cheese Dinner. No dyes no artificial colors or flavors. Its whole wheat pasta and white cheddar cheese. Its not half bad either for a wheat pasta but none of the artificial stuff like this cheese.

review/text: I chose this brand of cheese powder over Trio, which I'd used in the past and really liked, because this was less expensive. It came with no directions at all so I winged it remembering how I'd used the Trio sauce. This ended up thin and very salty. I had to eventually add thickener to get the consistency without making it horribly salty, but that made it more a "gravy" than a "sauce". I'll still use it up, but won't buy it again.

review/summary: Not as flavorful and not as much versatility as you would think
review/text: A long time ago, Burger King had this little promotion going on that had a little packet of cheese powder that came glued to a paper bag with your order so you could dump your fries in, add the powder, and shake the bag up and coat the fries in cheesy decadence.<br /><br />I've been trying to find the equivilent of these packets on the market. This wasn't it. Not only was this NOT it, this isn't a very user friendly product, and it's uses are very linear.<br /><br />>The powder will NOT work in any sort of shaker, unlike the cheese powders you see for popcorn. This makes dispensing the powder a little annoying because it pretty much as to stay in the bag.<br /><br />>While it does taste like cheese when you dap a bit on your finger, the flavor ends there when added to any foods (in a moderate amount)<br /><br />>Tossing it with anything wet/fried with result in large clumps of cheese gathering at the bottom with less than 5% of what you used actually sticking to your food.<br /><br />>Adding it to soups for flavor proved to be just as problematic because the powder mimics the old "Ovaltine" habit of clumping up in little bubbles of itself and won't mix in.<br /><br />Basically, this product has only one real intended use it seems: if you want to make your own macaroni and cheese that tastes just like Kraft, here's the powder in bulk form. Still need butter and milk.<br /><br />So I suppose if you are REALLY pinching pennies, this is a cheaper alternative to an already cheap meal. But there is no diversity whatsoever and to me, that's disappointing enough to keep me from ever ordering more.

review/summary: ALMOST like Kraft..
review/text: I pretty much agree with all the other reviews, and I am glad I read them before I tried to use this.  No, it isn't quite as smooth as Kraft mac and cheese powder, but it's still great for what it is.  I put it on steamed veggies, and it is just yummy. I may have to take a little extra time to break up a few little lumps, but honestly, I kind of like getting an extra strong taste of cheese powder with the occasional lump.<br /><br />I use it in a wild rice mix, and it is delish.  I found if you mix it in stuff, hot stuff, and let it sit a minute or two, it is sometimes easier to sort of smooth it out.  If you really HAVE to eat it lumpless, mix some ahead of time in broth or liquid by adding liquid a little at a time to the powder,and smooshing out the little tiny lumps. It'll probably take you quite a while, but if that is what you want, that is what you will have to do.<br /><br />Any way you cut it, this cheese is great! (pun intended)  A tad on the salty side, so don't add salt to whatever you are cooking until you taste this in it first.  I bought two bags, and am almost done with the first.  Great on popcorn, too.<br /><br />Try it, you'll like it!

The texture itself isn't bad, but it clumps slightly, so it's difficult to sprinkle onto food.  I've tried it on buttered toast, popcorn and eggs.  When it comes in contact with moisture, it forms small, hard, chewy clumps.  I haven't tried it on pasta, but I have to assume it would do the same thing.  I don't think I'll buy this product again, only because I can't think of anything I can use it with.

review/summary: Makes an Excellent Cheese Sauce
review/text: The price was right, although shipping increased the cost quite a bit.<br /><br />I've used this in a few recipes to make a cheese sauce. For enough for a few bowls of noodles take roughly 2-4 tablespoons (I usually just eyeball it) of this cheddar cheese powder, 2-4 tablespoons of butter (melting the butter first helps), and about 1/4 cup of milk. Stir that up until smooth and you've got a very good cheese sauce.<br /><br />It does turn out a bit thin that way. My guess would be a little bit of cornstarch would thicken it up just fine or just adding less milk to begin with, but most of the recipes I use it in benefit from a thin sauce.<br /><br />Regarding the taste, this stuff is great. I've had a few other brand's cheddar power mixes and a lot of them had a odd taste, but not this brand. This has a smooth cheddary flavor and that's it. I can't think of what else you'd want in a cheese powder.<br /><br />I think you'll be satisfied if you choose this stuff.

review/summary: Great on Popcorn and Low Points on Weight Watchers!
review/text: I love cheddar cheese on my popcorn, especially when I can't use a lot of butter but my local stores no longer carry powdered cheddar. I recently joined Weight Watchers and needed something that would liven my popcorn up without adding a bunch of extra points.  I saw the Barry Farm Powdered Cheddar Cheese on Amazon and after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try. This cheese is awesome on popcorn!  It's very flavorful but not overly salty and the best part is 1/4 cup is only 1 point! My only complaint is that the powder is very fine and tends to be difficult to sprinkle but that wouldn't stop me from buying this again.  I would say it's a bit sweeter tasting than the Kraft powdered cheddar I used to buy locally but not overly so.  I haven't used it for anything else yet but I plan on using it to replace the cheese packets I "borrowed" from my husband's mac & cheese boxes next time he asks for some.  I don't think he'll notice a difference.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: I wanted to make "instant" macaroni and cheese with whole grain macaroni, and had been wondering for years why we couldn't buy packets of cheese powder (like the ones inside the boxes of Kraft).  Was thrilled to find this product!  (One suggestion to the seller is to include basic recipe instructions.)  I did some research, and it takes about 1&1/3 cups macaroni and 1/4-1/3 cup of the powder, (plus 2 T. butter and 1/4 cup milk) to be equal to a box of Kraft.  You can jazz it up a bit by adding a few dashed of parmesan or some grated cheddar.  Maybe a little garlic and a few dashed of Tabasco, if you like it spicy.  I searched the web and found lots of tips.  This is also good sprinkled on popcorn!

review/summary: Cheesy.
review/text: It took me a good few tries to come up with the perfect sauce (in my opinion) for macaroni and cheese.  Per (relatively normal) serving of pasta I use 1/4 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of cream cheese, and 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese powder.  I flavor with salt and pepper to taste, OBVIOUSLY add hot dogs to the pasta, and revel in the fact that this bag of cheddar cheese powder is enough to make months of homemade cheesy pasta whenever I'm in the mood.  The bag isn't releasable, but just stick it in whatever storage container you have in the cupboard and you're set.

review/summary: Best Cheese Powder
review/text: For many years we'd buy several boxes of whatever store brand mac and cheese and use the power packets in double, triple, or quadruple portions.  We got some of this from a friend and find it excellent to add in to make things MEGA cheesy.  All you need to do is add butter and milk/cream.  (Sorry for you margarine/oleo etc people who also buy skim milk too but that just isn't the same).<br /><br />It also works great on other items.<br /><br />If you look at the ingredient list on your mac/cheese boxes you will see more ingredients like flour before the cheddar cheese.  You can't find this hardly anywhere else.  It's a a great product they repackage in smaller portions.  With the shipping it's best like others mentioned to order 2-3 pounds minimum.<br /><br />We just made our first batch we bought that was delivered today.  It's soooooooo wonderful (two kids approval).  We will be ordering much more soon I know.

review/text: I splurged and got this for Thanksgiving after dinner coffee.  I was expecting a really excellent flavor but found this coffee to be only ok.  We used Poland Springs bottled water in a drip coffee maker so it wasn't the water.  The coffee was smooth as expected but didn't have the flavor I remembered with another Blue Mountain purchase I made years ago.  I wonder if it's because it was shipped pre-ground and not beans as I kind of expected.  At this price, Newman's Organic blows this completely away and at a fraction of the cost, I will bring that for my next gathering.

It's probably because of the other ingredients:  dextrose, poultry digest, etc. "Product of Mexico."  The "large dog" ones are about 2 1/2 or 3 by 6 inches each.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: We have 4 dogs, one had terrible plaque build-up, it isn't gone after 2 months of using this product but is remarkably better. The dogs love the treats. We buy them 8 bags at a time so we won't run out.

review/summary: My dog loves these
review/text: My dog usually doesn't like any type of dental chews, and all my attempts at brushing her teeth have failed miserably.  I saw these Petrodex chews were pretty inexpensive and had good reviews, so I decided to try them out.  When I got them, I was surprised that my Boston Terrier would actually eat them.  In fact, she loves them.  Problem solved!

review/text: All my girls (6 maltese dogs) just love these chews and they're so much cheaper than at Petsmart. Even the girls with not too many teeth left that I am fostering from a rescue can handle them..

review/summary: My dog loves them!!!
review/text: My dog is so picky when it comes to chewing bones and such.  I thought he would never chew these but wanted to give them a try.  He loves them and since I can't manage to effectively brush his teeth, I am very thankful.
