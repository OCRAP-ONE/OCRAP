review/summary: Can't have just one!!!!
review/text: What a great product, usually kids food doesn't have much of a taste. That is not the case for this excellent product, my husband and my 14 month old son can't have just one, they absolutely love it!!!!!! As a mom I know he is having a great snack, which is healthy with not dyes, pesticides and is made out real fruits. I don't have to chose between taste or healthy because the Yummy Yogis contains both.

review/text: I've never seen these in stores and only found them on Amazon because they were suggested to me based on previous purchases. My son LOVES them. I've even found myself snacking on them. They are delicious! They are very easily dissolved in his mouth so I never worry about him choking. We always have them on hand in the diaper bag now. The snack size pouches are perfect for that.

review/summary: the PERFECT anchovies
review/text: These anchovies are something else. The fillets are fleshy, not dried up in salt like most of the anchovies I have eaten before. The consistency of the meat is preserved very well. While most anchovies are salty with the characteristic, wonderful ... stink, these anchovies are also flavorful in addition to being only stinky. I am not sure how this is done - perhaps by shortening the time the fish is cured in salt?<br />The price is unjustifiably high though - one can get 2 lbs of Moroccan anchovies for the same price.<br />Nevertheless, these are (from far) the best anchovies I tried.

review/text: Great white cheddar taste. Don't drain!! If you don't leave a little water in the bowl, the sauce will be too thick and dry. If it looks a little thin don't worry because it will thicken up and taste great.<br /><br />In my opinion, this product is much tastier (and better all-around) than the national brand White Cheddar macaroni products. And Annie's is the only one that makes White cheddar in single-serve-microwave packs!

review/text: For constant work travel, one of my packed meals consists of this Annie's mac n cheese, a tuna packet, and some kale chip crumbs.  I microwave the macaroni, stir in the cheese powder, tuna and veggies, and it is usually warm enough to heat through.  It is a good meal size for me, lightweight, and simple to prepare. These are also good for storing in a desk drawer for "I forgot my lunch on the counter at home" days. I've never eaten Kraft EasyMac and can't imagine doing so-I enjoy Annie's.

But that's okay, because having this healthier alternative, with no nasty chemicals or hormones is worth a few trials and errors.<br /><br />Serving size is small for an adult and a bit large for a child, but so? Make two and steal some of your kid's.

We send it to school (hot or cold), and I keep a few packs in my office desk drawer for days when I can't get away for lunch. Whenever we have friends with kids over for dinner and someone won't eat what we're serving, we always have this reliable back-up on hand. Nearly instant (3 minutes in microwave) 1 serving easily feeds 2 toddlers, so you have happy kids in no time.

review/text: I really wanted to like this.  You have to buy a case at a time which equals to 30 servings.  I would advise adding a little bit more water to the macaroni as it came out of the microwave too dry.  Also, if you really like to add extra salt to your food, you'll probably like this because it has a very salty taste.

review/summary: because I didn't get the Product
review/text: I case anyone from the company reads these. This is the 2nd time I have ordered annie's, shipping took awhile, but this time it didn't arrive at all. Amazon e-mailed to say it went back as unable to deliver. Welllll you have to get it to the right state first of all, then the correct town, before you can actually look for my house.. Duh. This time it went from Dallas to Commerce City,Colo. Then 4 days later it is signed for in Irvine,Tx. I hate to say, but Commerce city is still a good 300 mi. from my home town. Dhl here in town is also way lousy for claiming they attempted delivery, when they have not. They claimed to have attempted to deliver the last Annie's shipment i got, even had a time down, and I was home that entire day and never saw hide-nor-hair of their van. that time the boxes had gone to Salt lake City, then Pocatello Idaho, before circling around and finally arriving here. So be prepared to have it take awhile, or maybe even not at all if my experiences are any example.

review/summary: Delicious Anchovies, well packed in tins, Great Deal
review/text: Yes, these anchovies are salty all right, but that is what one expects when one purchases anchovies in a tin. Salt is not going to kill anyone. I think it is just sea salt which comes from the ocean. Salt helps to preserve the anchovies so that you don't have to refrigerate them until you open the tin. If the choice of preservative is between sea salt and some other kind of preservative like sodium nitrate, I think I know which one will be healthier.<br /><br />The anchovies are just as tasty as King Oscar anchovies, but in this bulk package they work out to be much cheaper per tin. At my local grocery store, I have to pay $1.79 for a 2 oz. tin of King Oscar anchovies, and then a 4% food sales tax on top of that. I did the math and this deal worked out much better for me. It is quite simple to figure out the unit price and then compare that price to the grocery store's. I think the anchovies might even be a little better than King Oscar's. The cardboard package they arrive in is nice and firm and efficient, taking up only just enough space to store the tins, and fits well in a nook. Anyone that loves anchovies in sandwiches and pizza as I do should consider this brand which is A-OK.

review/summary: El Pescador Anchovies
review/text: I have now purchased three brands of Anchovies packed in olive oil from Amazon.<br /><br />My first batch from Amazon were great but costly (Crown Prince)packed in olive oil in 2 oz cans.  They were not mushy and had just the correct amount of salt in them.  They have been the most expensive ones I have purchased to date.  Then I bought some Season Brand 2 oz can anchovies.  They were salty enough but a little mushy and not firm.  Now I have purchased three cases of these El Pescador brand anchovies lacking salt.  However they are firm. Others have mentioned these are not very salty and that is a true statement.<br /><br />So far my preference is Crown Prince but they are expensive compared to these other brands.  If you don't mind an anchovy with less salt then normally expected these will be just fine.  Some will find anchovies with less salt desirable.  Others may get used to an anchovy with less salt then normal.<br /><br />I do like anchovies packed in 2 oz cans. It is a great size for one pizza.  All three brands have been acceptable to me for one reason or another but Crown Prince has been the most perfect for me.<br /><br />Would I buy more of these for the money?  Sure I would.  Most likely I will experiment with other brands too.  Crown Prince will be my standard of comparison.  Life without anchovies is unexceptable.<br /><br />Lee<br />Houston, Tx

I probably don't know that much about anchovies, but seriously, I don't think they are supposed to be THIS freaking salty. I mean these are so salty that I was puckering up! I even wanted to puke at times! I couldn't even finish the whole can because it was just too salty. Now don't get me wrong, these are defintely good quaility anchovies, very tasty, not too fishy and I loved the oil they came in. But I wish they sold a version with reduced salt... I don't want reduced salt because I'm some kinda health nut or something...I want reduced salt because it would taste 10 times better!

review/summary: Transcendental - you gotta try it.
review/text: I'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before, but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha. An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation.<br /><br />I, personally, do not buy the 28oz size - even though it's almost the same price as the 17oz size. (it's not a total freebie - Shipping is a bit higher on the 28oz).  While Sriracha has preservatives and doesn't need refrigeration it does oxidize a bit and at the pace I use it the bottom third of the 28oz gets a bit stale for me, while I suck the 17oz down while it's still fresh.  If I lived in a house with more spice hounds (I'm the only one around here) or if I were cooking with it more often in larger recipies the 28oz would be a big bargain.

review/summary: This is the new Ketchup
review/text: I was going to High School in California about 15 years ago when a Vietnamese friend of mine INSIST that I try this. I'm pretty open minded to new kinds of foods so I gave it a try. "Tongue Ought Shurocka?" I said. "DUDE!" "Not even close!" he said as he laughed like hell. I still have no idea how to pronounce the name but it has been my favorite Hot Sauce ever since. Over the years, I have been seeing it pop up everywhere from PF Chang's & Applebee's to Firehouse Subs. If you like hot sauce or any kind of spicy foods at all, then you MUST try this. I INSIST.<br /><br />Imagine going through your entire life without Ketchup or BBQ sauce? Just take a second and actually think about how plain so many foods would taste like without them. "The Rooster Sauce" is like that. As you can see from the other reviews, it has about the same applications as BBQ sauce or Ketchup would have for a person who likes it hot. No other hot sauce that I have ever tried has the same texture, heat and most importantly FLAVOR as this one does. It brings out the flavor in nearly anything that you put it on, from the obvious Tacos, burritos, Chow Mein, Chili, Meat & Poultry, to Clam Chowder, fish sticks or even.. OMG Peanut Butter Sandwiches? (haven't done that one yet but it's probably ... interesting).<br /><br />Let me try to describe this to somebody who hasen't tried "The Rooster Sauce" before. First of all, unlike standard hot sauce, it has the texture of Ketchup or BBQ sauce which makes it cling to any kind of finger foods, chips, etc. perfectly. The taste is what is the kicker though. A garlicky, sweet, HOT flavor that is vastly different from anything else. Since it comes in a convenient squeeze bottle, it can be applied to anything, anywhere. This stuff is a god send when living in a world of quick, frozen, packaged, fast food which is dull, bland and virtually tasteless. This is also great for anybody on a special diet who wants to add some flavor to a very limited menu.<br /><br />As far as the Heat is concerned, let me warn you that this stuff is pretty darn HOT. It's made from Red Jalapeno paste so it's not ridiculously hot but it definitely has some serious heat. If you don't like hot, spicy food then this stuff probably isn't for you. On the other hand, a little goes a long way. Just a few drops add good spice and flavor. A WHOLE BUNCH ... may take a little getting used to. I've gotten to the point where I literally submerge things like chicken wings into this stuff. It will really make you sweat out those toxins.<br /><br />"The Rooster Sauce" would also make a good gift for the person who has it all. A few years ago, I was living all the way across the U.S. and my Mom sent me a bottle. It sounds silly but it was one of the most cherished items in my house. If giving it to somebody who has never tried it before, it may very well be like introducing someone to BBQ or Ketchup for the first time. In other words it's a thing that they will always remember.<br /><br />Now as far as complaints? Well as stated in another review, the cap can get a little bit gunky, so you may have to run it under the sink a few times to get it nice and clean again. Not a real big deal. The other isn't a complaint at all but because they don't use any artificial colors, the sauce can darken after a few months. It will go from the original bright red to a deep red color. I haven't really noticed a difference in taste though. Since this is hot sauce, you can store it unrefrigerated without worrying about it getting spoiled. I actually prefer to have the color change slightly then to have it filled with artificial junk to keep it looking nice. If you really have to keep the nice bright red color, then I suggest keeping it refrigerated.<br /><br />One last thing to keep in mind. This product is MADE IN THE U.S.A. In an economy as bad as this one, we need all of the help we can get.

review/summary: Will not go a day without it.
review/text: I am still amazed at the number of people that have not experienced "The Rooster", as we have come to call it.  I have been using it for over 10 years, and have to say that it is hands-down the best, most versatile hot sauce in the world.<br /><br />The best part about this sauce is ability to not only add some heat to your food, but also blend seamlessly without overpowering it.  Pasta dishes, tomato soup, chili, to name a few that really benefit from The Rooster.  Come to think of it, I probably put it on 9 out of 10 meals I eat.  I have a bottle at my desk (which my coworkers' lunches have come to benefit from, as well), a bottle at the dinner table, and, of course, one on standby or travel.<br /><br />I only have two small complaints, and both are packaging related:  the green cap, in recent years, has become  a bit of a hassle.  Nothing major, but just noticeably problematic.  No one believes me, but I swear they changed the green cap.  Anyway, over time, the cap tends to leak out the red chili oil form around the threads.  It also seems to clog up faster than I have experienced before.  I tend to have to remove the cap and clean it out at the sink in order to unclog it and remove the excess chili oil from dripping down the side of the bottle.  Nothing serious, but when you use it as much as I do, it can be a bit of a nuisance.<br /><br />Anyway, I swear by this stuff: it is my "island condiment" (the only condiment i would ever need should I get stranded on an island.)

review/text: This is my favorite multiple use hot sauce, hands down. Don't be fooled into thinking this is low brow either, they use this on Iron Chef and they know how to make a meal!<br /><br />A few foods I recommend trying this on:<br /><br />Chicken Shawarma<br />Gyros<br />Sushi (mix some in with your wasabi and soy sauce)<br />Cheese Quesadilla<br />Macaroni & Cheese<br />Eggs on toast<br /><br />An few extra notes: It is very hard to distinguish Sriracha from ketchup just by looking; it is similar thickness, color and consistency. I would give it a 3/5 on the hot scale, with 2/5 being a med-hot buffalo wing, 4/5 = 1st degree chemical burn on the lips, 5/5 = strait additive only sauces. If you can take the hottest of store purchased salsas and buffalo wings this will be similar and have no long term discomfort/burning.<br /><br />Usage may vary, void where prohibited

review/summary: The most addictive hot sauce there is
review/text: What's in this stuff? I'm not a hot sauce fanatic, and I don't even like overly spicy food, but this stuff is positively addictive. There is a sweet component to it, and a garlicky component that makes this more than just plain tabasco or hot sauce.<br /><br />I particularly like it on sliced avocado, scrambled egg or fried egg, and on stir fries, especially plainer ones with tofu and veg. It's also absolutely delectable on shrimp as a cocktail sauce mixed with ketchup, or on fish in general.  When we go out for Vietnamese pho (a broth with rice noodles, bean sprouts and various meats and garnishes) we squirt in a good lashing of this sauce to liven up the broth.<br /><br />I even saw a "pyramid" of food groups cartoon, with sriracha sauce squirted all over the pyramid, and I can only agree with the sentiment. There's practically no food, save chocolate ice cream, that isn't improved by a dash of this.

review/text: My son got me started on this stuff as he and I always loved hot sauce when he was growing up.  This stuff is great on just about anything and I love it.  We all make ribs with a family cooking process where the meat just falls off the bone.  This sauce just makes them taste perfect.<br /><br />We haven't found anything that this sauce doesn't go good with and we use it all the time. I like it in bean soup, chicken wings, Chinese food and even Mexican food. You can even mix it up in mayonnaise for a hot dipping sauce that is creamy.<br /><br />This is our favorite real hot sauce and it doesn't have the overpowering taste of vinegar as some do.  I like to mix it with other sauces and spice up our meals and barbequing.  This is the best and you will love it if you love hot spicy food!

review/summary: If it's edible, this hot sauce belongs on it!
review/text: Excellent quality and depth of flavor.  Add flavor and spice to any food without loosing the food's original taste.  Unlike other hot sauces vinegar is not the main flavor.  Add to real Mayo with a little onion juice and a pinch of chili powder for a great "southwest sauce".  Add with equal amounts of balsamic vinegar (instead of oil) for an excellent glaze that goes with any healthy dipping food or sandwich.<br /><br />Tips: 1) the more red the chili sauce the hotter, the more orange is a little less hot.  2) leave the screw cap in open position all of the time, otherwise the temperature change when going from the frig to room temp can cause a tiny amount of sauce to spray out when you open the nozzle and small amounts to ooze from the cap.  3) another user had a good suggestion by buying the smaller bottles to always ensure the freshest product.

review/text: This is the first food product I ever purchased on Amazon.com.  The item came sealed and in perfect shape - I would have not accepted anything else.  I bought the 28oz bottle for $6.50.  I add this to soups and Chinese dishes which are just not spicy/hot enough.  This product is a little sweet, has a strong garlic flavor, has a vibrant and natural red color, but needs to be tasted to be judged - Taste is ultimately subjective.  Look at the ingredient list to get a better idea of what this product may taste like to you.  One of the real benefits:  You can add a little to a lot of food and still enjoy its taste.  One can use this as a dipping sauce, because its consistency is not watery - Before using, make sure to shake it a little.  I bought this around a week and a half before writing this review and the product's expiration date is in 2013.

review/summary: Walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha
review/text: Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NIND">Bon App&eacute;tit</a> magazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!<br /><br />Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show and shared, "If you walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on."<br /><br />There are many sellers offering sriracha on Amazon.com. I recommend you compare the shipping charges of each. You can save by buying in quantity (and sharing with friends and relatives). Many supermarket chains are now carrying sriracha for $5 or less per bottle, again depending on the size.<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it is on a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />Last year, New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed "Thai ketchup." Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.<br /><br />Fried Calamari<br /><br />1/2 cup calamari<br />1 cup milk<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup semolina<br />Vegetable oil for frying<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Soak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.<br /><br />In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.<br /><br />Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings<br /><br />6 chicken wings<br />Oil for frying<br />3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce<br />1 tablespoons sriracha<br />1 tablespoons butter, softened<br />Baby mache or other lettuce to garnish<br /><br />Fry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars

review/summary: Not as hot as I feared and quite tasty!
review/text: For years I'd seen what I jokingly called the "screaming chicken" hot sauce out at various restaurants, but I was always too intimidated to try it, even though I love hot sauce.  The mostly non-English labeling and contents made me think it was probably wicked hot. As with so many things I was put off by, I'm kicking myself now that I've tried it, as Sriracha sauce isn't that hot and in fact has a nice touch of sweetness to it that makes it a great addition to Thai and Chinese dishes.  Truthfully it's nowhere near as hot as Tabasco sauce and on the Scoville Scale of hotness it ranks only at the 1,000-2,5000 range making it medium (Tabasco is the next level up).  As a self-confessed hot-head hot sauce lover I have to admit Sriracha has a really unique consistency that is thicker than Tabasco, yet blends well in many Asian dishes.  I typically love northern Thai food and Sriracha works well with it and with Szechwan as well.  Sriracha gives a nice pop of hot without being overpowering like some hot sauces or the truly hot Thai chilies that rate up at 50,000-100,000 on the Scoville scale.  If something is a bit too bland for my taste usually a bit of Sriracha gets my mouth watering. As I've learned, if you like to spice things up ask your server about the sauces and chilies and try a small little sample, but don't live in fear of hot sauces.  Perhaps the best thing about Sriracha is it's a known quality and consistent, unlike the bowls of sauces and chilies in some Asian restaurants (believe me...I've had some that really took my breath away and I like it HOT).  And certainly don't be intimidated by the "screaming chicken"; it might well become your new friend!

review/summary: Delicious hot sauce!
review/text: I first discovered Huy Fong's sriracha hot sauce at a local restaurant and I love the flavor and spice it adds to soups, noodles, meat or vegetarian dishes, sandwiches and nearly anything. Sriracha hot chili sauce is a good balance between hot and too-hot; this does not ruin but enhances the taste of food. My one complaint is the salty taste it leaves; salt is the third ingredient in the sauce and it is overused. Still, this is a reasonably priced condiment worth trying.

review/summary: Asian Hot Sauce Win
review/text: I had a roommate in college who practically drank this stuff. Our cupboards were constantly filled with the stuff. His daily ritual was to eat it with white rice and plain tofu after class every day. After a few months I got curious and wanted to try his "bread and butter" myself.<br /><br />The Huy Fong Sriracha sauce gave life to a pairing that I always considered drab and lifeless. I'm not much for spicy foods, but I thought it still delivered a nice kick- not overbearing but your mouth is definitely feeling the spice. While maybe not good before a date, the strong garlic flavor in the sauce is nicely balanced with the hot peppers. For a simple hot sauce, it's surprising versatile. I put it on all sorts of stuff now: pizza, pasta, and even steaks just to name a few.<br /><br />I now follow in the footsteps of my college roommate- I keep a bottle of this stuff in my cupboards at all time.

review/summary: One of the best hot chili sauce!
review/text: Googled "best hot/chili sauce in the US" the other day and Huy Fong Sriracha popped up. I read that this brand is one of the best hot chili sauce so I figured I would give it a try. I was hoping that a supermarket near my apartment would sell this brand, and to my delight it does.<br />I understand now why this is one of the best hot chili sauce out there. man! its so spicy and hot that I must have drinking water near me all the time I'm eating this sauce. Not only I like the spiciness, it has a little garlic taste to it too. Plus the squeeze bottle is a plus. I'm never gonna buy different brands again. This will do.

Works well in soups, on pizza, with many types of Asian food, and pretty much everything else you can put hot sauce on. The only thing I have found it doesn't really work well with is Mexican food and as an ingredient in buffalo sauce.

review/summary: The other great mild hot sauce
review/text: This is a great tasting mild hot sauce.  While it is milder than Tabasco sauce, or Cholula's hot sauce, Sriracha tastes a bit hotter because it is thicker, making it a perfect candidate to put on a sandwich or burger.  I tried this for the first time on a chicken sandwich a few days ago -- the sandwich was aleady great and the "Rooster Sauce" complimented the sandwich perfectly.  I have not tried it on seafood but the hot sauce was actually created with seafood in mind -- it does seem like it would be a viable alternative to cocktail sauce!<br /><br />I generally prefer much hotter hot sauces, but there is no denying this is a great tasting hot sauce and is perfect for lunch sandwiches.

review/summary: The perfect sauce, full stop
review/text: After rave reviews from friends, I picked up a bottle of this exotic looking sauce in the supermarket. After using it in all three of my meals in one day (eggs, chili, and pasta), I am now a dedicated fan of this chili sauce. There's an initial garlic note, followed by a curious sweetness and then the wonderful, wonderful burn of chili peppers. It's as complete a hot sauce as you're likely to find. I recommend trying it on the tip of your finger first, and on its own as a condiment before mixing it into other sauces. It serves every purpose well, and is the only everyday hot sauce I'll need.<br /><br />Those who appreciate spicy food will find this sauce to be something of a culinary religious experience.

review/summary: Rooster Sauce...
review/text: As you can probably tell from the other reviews, this stuff is the new ketchup. It's popping up in restaurants and other venues, and for good reason: its tastes amazing! I can take really hot stuff, but this sauce isn't about killing your taste buds (or killing you). Instead, it lets you actually experience the flavor of the chilis front and center, while also complementing it with a strong garlic taste. I love to put this on hot dogs and hamburgers, as well as ramen noodles. Of course, feel free to experiment, I still experiment putting this on anything and everything if I think it might taste good.<br /><br />Believe it or not this sauce is made in America, despite its non-American-looking bottle. Its also as a pretty simple ingredient list that doesn't make you cringe when you look at it. I would recommend buying this (the 28oz bottle) as it is a much better deal than buying the smaller (17oz) one.

review/summary: Great Flavor and Heat - Highly Recommended
review/text: Huy Fong "Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce" is offered in just about every Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in my area, and with good reason! Unlike at lot of hot sauces, this has a great chili pepper and garlic flavor that compliments most of the dishes I like (particularly good on Pork Lo-Mein) and also provides a good amount of spicy heat. This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the borderline for several of my friend.<br /><br />This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out doesn't have enough "zing". It is also great to spread on chicken when grilling but watch the smoke when opening the grill lid, it is like OC spray if it gets into your eyes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: A Potent Hot Sauce - it should be in every kitchen. Far better than Tabasco. The 28oz is only a few cents more
review/text: This hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a cayenne pepper delivery device. A few drops add a lot of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.<br /><br />While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a vinegar note - this product has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle sweetness with garlic notes to this sauce. While Tabasco can taste harsh if you add enough to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato is simply the sun ripened chilies and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />I like this product and I'd recommend its purchase but I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem, in any way, exceptional. There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic sure beats the vinegar aftertaste evidenced in Tabasco.<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to have it on hand.<br /><br />As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably only want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too "hot" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh but sweeter note

Even with shipping they are still the cheapest. I oredered 3 bottles and shipping was only $18.84. The next closest deal was almost $25. So if your a spice, or Hot sauce Connoisseur like myself, and want a great deal, then go to Buy Asian Foods. I am not in any way affiliated with any stores, or online sales. I live in the Midwest, and came across the 28oz bottles at a new Asian Restaurant that opened locally. Before I seen them, I could only find the 17oz bottles for $2.64 a piece.

review/summary: The Legend of Sriracha
review/text: Tuong ot Sriracha, Tyrant of the Ancient World, was born before civilization as the offspring of an ordinary chicken raped by a fire-breathing Tyranasaurus Rex.  Through study of the occult and dark magics now forgotten he extended his life unnaturally to become practically immortal.  Terrorizing the ancient villagers was not enough - he formed a cult of horrid worshipers whose tounges had to be cut out so that they could drink of his blood and gain some of his power.<br /><br />Sriracha was challenged by Atlanta, the Water Serpent of the West, and defeated in a battle lasting three hundred years and ending on Cinqo de Mayo.  On his death he dissolved into a giant bowl of tasty, yet spicy chile paste which was gathered by his followers and put into a temple in the Himalayas to be guarded for his return.  It is to this day bottled by the Tongueless Monks of Tuong Ot and shipped to the uninitiated so that his soul can be spread out among the world to effect his return.<br /><br />Last night, Sriracha was reborn into the world.  At 3:00am, my stomach weakened by ibuprofen taken to prevent a headache, Sriracha found new life in the pits of my bowl.  A horriible pain - his unholiness pecking through my gastric wall no doubt - jolted me awake.  I finally passed out, probably from blood loss.  When I awoke a single stream of red substance was trickling down my nose.  Blood?  No.  Sriracha sauce.  His unholiness has returned to the world.<br /><br />Some facts about Sriracha<br /><br />- The bottle has instructiosn for reading an upright chest film for signs of bowel perforation<br />- His favorite saying is "Pa-caw!"<br />- It is good on any food, including ice cream - though it will melt a bowl of ice cream just by sitting the bottle in the same room with it.<br />- Those who eat Sriracha's unholy paste have to relive the pain of Sriracha's death until the next time they take a dump

review/summary: It's all WRONG!
review/text: Forgive me if I'm stuttering while I type - I'm on the run and working with a fever; I'm losing light and the dogs are baying in the distance...they're onto me.<br /><br />It's been...gawd only knows how long.  A day?  A week since I've had my beloved Huy Fong sriracha sauce...?  I don't know - time is irrelevant when your Jack is gone.  And in my case, there is only one Jack.  "The Rach."<br /><br />It was Visitor Day.  I'd been two months Rach-free (RF) and was looking forward to seeing people again - real people, not the sanitized, medicated zombies in the Ward... the stupified, insipid drones and their robotic dips of french fries into the sugared slick called "Ketchup."<br /><br />"Good enough..." the nurses would say.  "Remember, the taste is good enough..."  and nod in prescribed approval at our "progress."<br /><br />I hated the tastelessness of it all.  But what had my yearning gotten me so far?  Here I was, a Pathetic Wreck of man, who's hope and potential, wasted by the addictive pull of the bottle with the white rooster...<br /><br />"Lucille is here to see you, Wily."<br /><br />Oh gawd. Not her!  She was The One - did they not know?!  Was this a sick test of my will?!?!<br /><br />"Hellooo...wiLY!"  She sauntered to table, dismissing the porters with that look - did I see a smirk?!?  No!  In an unconcious flinch I snatched an individual portion-pack of mayo and began squishing it nervously - she slid onto the plastic seat with a sneering contempt and lifted the hamburger bun.  A slab of processed cheese product atop a rapidly cooling foodservice grade grade patty.  Of beef.<br /><br />Her eyes flicked at the condiment tray like a snake tongue tasting the fear of its prey - little packets of red, white, yellow and blue...and then...she... oh gawd...  she reached into her coat...and... damn her!  Damn her!  The shamelessness of it all!<br /><br />"Want...this?"<br /><br />The green nozzle peeked from her bosom and...I swear...it... it... did it laugh?  Did it howl?  Did it...<br /><br />(lightning flash, thunder - the sound of roaring rain, the gutteral humphs of bloodhounds)<br /><br />Time stretched and distorted - the space between the bottle and my reflexive snatch disappeared as if my arm had become the tongue of a chameleon; my hand the sticky  mass, the 28oz bottle of Rach in her coat, the prey...the food...the LIFE...<br /><br />SNAP!<br /><br />Foul, foul temptress...she'd removed the silver seal! But could I care!?  No.  At the moment, the deed was no betrayal of my Rach Sobriety but an act of glorious courtesy, saving myself the precious milisecond that it would have required to remove it before twisting the nozzle, dispensing the red SOUL onto my hamburger patty in a fantastic, psychedelic *splurrrrrrrtppplp!*<br /><br />Mwwwahhhhaaaaa...I shuddered in ecstasy, the wonderful aroma of rich, sensuous, spicy, sweet, delicious, holy Huy Fong Sriracha sauce filled my nostrils as Life itself fills the lungs of a submerged man breaking the surface of water, sucking in breath....<br /><br />Two bites and the cheeseburger was devoured...Rach spread across my face in a Joker-like grin, sprayed across my hospital whites, the result of a gruesome orgy of deliciousness...<br /><br />The alarm sounded like a WW2 air raid klaxon - "Flavor in Ward C!  Flavor in Ward C!"<br /><br />"QUick!  I've left the window open!"  She pointed to..well, one of the windows that was open and with 28oz Huy Fong Sriracha bottle in hand, made my break - landing in a spray of glass (in my haste, I jumped through the wrong window) and ripping of cheap nylon screen.<br /><br />How did I traverse the 100 feet to the fence?  How did I scale the concertina wired confines?  I have no idea.  It's all a blur.<br /><br />So.  Why the One Star (I keep giving Sriracha One-Star and people are starting to get a clue why)?<br /><br />28oz is lame!  It's just not enough!!<br /><br />I'm thinking a 3gallon bag...and a Camelback(tm) pack... this...this...28oz for the worlds most fantastically zesty and (it should be obvious by now) ADDICTING condiments?!?!<br /><br />More, please.

review/summary: Not necessarily useful
review/text: I decided to try this as an alfredo sauce, even though I usually make my own alfredo and other sauces. It is definitely just a "starter". There was a thin, soupy texture even after I added about 2 cups of shredded Italian blend cheese (to a product that is already supposed to contain three cheeses!). Even after several minutes of sitting, it did not thicken much and I had to serve the pasta in a bowl. The taste is also somewhat bland; you will need to add spices. I put in a tablespoon of garlic powder along with some black pepper and onion powder.<br /><br />Overall it really did not save me any time or steps in cooking. It's an interesting idea, but it needs to be more of an actual thick sauce in order for it to be a helpful time-saver. It's hardly different than the plain heavy cream that I would have used in my regular alfredo sauce recipe.

review/text: One bag of these at the grocery store costs $3 at most.<br /><br />These guys want to sell you three for $30? Seriously?<br /><br />Why would anyone in their right mind pay $10 for a 12oz bag of chips?

review/text: This is the best taco mix that can be bought on the retail market by a regular customer. I tried different taco mixes and McCormick is the best one. I get this mix at Costco for $3.75 per 24-oz bottle.

review/summary: Great product - wish Costco hadn't discontinued it!
review/text: We found these at Costco initially and loved them (so much that once they were discontinued, we tried another brand's taco seasoning and were very disappointed).  Thank goodness you can find this on Amazon - I didn't really want to search for another way to make the taco meat!

review/text: This is a great product! No more hunting down the isle and find the taco packets each time.<br /><br />More flexible - use as much or as little as you want to spice it up to your liking. Also great on steaks and chicken for an extra little zing on the BBQ, not just ground beef!

review/summary: Very tasty!
review/text: The product arrived just as advertised, two 24 ounce containers of McCormick taco seasoning. It was well-packaged and sealed upon arrival. It was spicier than I thought it would be, but still exactly what I wanted. I eat eggs every morning for breakfast and top it with this seasoning. Talk about a wake up!

review/summary: A very good seasoning for home made tacos.
review/text: Purchased this product because it's the original taco seasoning. McCormick did/does offer a premium that reads it's main ingredient as cornmeal. One would think premium to be over the original, but it's not.<br /><br />This seasoning does not have cornmeal in it. The seasonings don't seem to be as strong as I remember and that may be due to formulation, quality control or age.<br /><br />There's only two seasonings I use: McCormick and Lawry's.

review/summary: Dissatisfied With Costo
review/text: Happy Happy Happy<br />Amazon will be my new suppler!! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ56VC">McCormick Taco Seasoning Mix, 24-Ounce Units (Pack of 2)</a><br />Ingredients: Spices (including Chili Pepper, Cumin, Oregano, and Red Pepper), Onion, Whey Solids, Salt, Sugar, Paprika, Garlic, Potato Starch, and Citric Acid.<br /><br />I too am Dissatisfied With Costo not carrying this product anymore.  I grabbed What I thought was the taco seasoning I had grown so fond of only to find that Costco now sells mccormick taco seasoning MIX premium. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ56VC">McCormick Taco Seasoning Mix, 24-Ounce Units (Pack of 2)</a> IMHO adulterated with Yellow corn meal as the first ingredient.  I'm NOT going to pay a premium price for corn meal!!<br />Ingredients: Yellow Corn Meal, Sea Salt, Chili Pepper, Onion, Garlic, Spices (including  Cumin, Oregano, and Cilantro), Demarara Sugar (Unrefined Sugar), Smoked Paprika, Red and Green Bell Peppers, Cocoa Powder, Chipotle Chili Pepper, Salt and Jalapeno Pepper<br /><br />You be the Judge but I find myself using much more of the latter product to get anywhere the taste I got with former product...

review/summary: Tacos with great flavor
review/text: I like this way of keeping my seasoning mixes instead of the little packetts. I can use more or less depending on how much meat I am using and McCormick makes good seasons in my opinion. It is less expensive than the little packetts also.

review/summary: Good base but add more seasons
review/text: We make a lot of taco or taco-like meals and this is a great mixture.  Typically we add more seasonings of our choice to the dinner.  This isn't very spicy - at least to us - so we tend to add ground chili pepper or other spicy varieties to the mix.

review/summary: Unsavory, bland
review/text: Purchased this product at Costco like the other reviewers.  I too hate buying packets at the outrageous price of $1+ per, so when I saw this for $4, I jumped.  Unfortunately, the flavor is quite bland, it's missing that certain something that distinguishes between tacos and "meat with some spices in it."  I checked the back of a McCormick packet, and not only do the directions differ, but the ingredients (and ingredient order) differ as well.  This isn't like buying the packets in bulk at all, it's like buying a completely different product.  I do like the McCormick packets, but even the generic store brand packets are better than this bottle, and my kids won't even eat the tacos I make with them.  Won't buy again.

review/summary: Something has changed in the last few months
review/text: I've been eating Chicken of the Sea chunk light tuna for years.  I preferred it over other common grocery store brands because the tuna came in good sized chunks (similar to the consistency of solid white albacore of other brands) and was generally very good quality.<br /><br />In the last several months, something has changed.  As another reviewer noted recently, what you get now is a can full of finely chopped up mush that is much darker in color and not nearly as tasty.  I thought maybe it was a fluke and I bought a bad can, but I've gone through about 10 straight cans over a 4 month period, and they've all been of the same substandard quality.  Perhaps the company started cutting corners or using inferior quality fish to improve its profits; whatever the reason, I cannot eat this trash any more and am on a search for a better tuna fish.

review/summary: Not up to standard
review/text: I'm well into my sixth decade of life, and tuna has always been a favorite food.  By now I've found Chicken of the Sea to be my favorite brand with larger, lighter, firmer chunks.  That's not what came in the case I got.  Perhaps this only happens when the product is discounted deeply (I paid about fifty cents per can), but what I got was darker flakes of mushy tuna floating in water.  When I squeezed out the water by depressing the lid the tuna filled less than half the depth of the can.  I suppose I got what I paid for, but with each can I open my opinion of Chicken of the Sea goes down another notch.

review/summary: Great stock up item
review/text: I bought this as kind of a food storage "survival" item, but we keep eating it.  It seems that having a case of tuna on hand is good when you haven't been able to get to the grocery store for a while, or someone just wants something different or a quick snack.  I will definitely continue to keep this in my pantry at home.
