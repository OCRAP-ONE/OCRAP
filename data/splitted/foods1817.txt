review/summary: Less than expected
review/text: Item description does not match product received -- certainly not a medium.  All four packages which filled three small boxes were very small single servings and one package was pretzels -- not really a "sweet."  Even though this was purchased during a discounted promotion, the price for value received was still poor.  Need to pay attention to the product weight versus "medium" designation.

review/text: I ordered this for my boyfriend for father's day. The food was disgusting. We didn't even bother trying the "black taffy", which was nothing more than very bad licorice. The next were some kind of nuts with a sweet shell around them. They were disgusting. They had no flavor and what flavor they did have tasted a bit like dirt. The next two things were chocolate chip cookies and some other type of cookie. We figured how bad can they screw up a chocolate chip cookie....Well they were dry and tasted horrible. I ended up throwing out everything, and you have to understand we don't throw out food, at all. I was terribly disappointed. I just figured that I trusted Amazon, so I should be able to trust the products they sell. This was not the case.<br /><br />After leaving complaint with this company they refunded my money and were very helpful.

It makes it palatable as I am not a black coffee fan.<br />It's good chilled too. It has a nice orange flavor which gives it some zip that the other International Coffee's don't have. They are just very sweet with out much flavor.

review/text: I ordered these steaks for a dinner party. I contacted the seller to let them know that my guests had more than enough negative comments on the steaks. They had said that they were inedible, that they were grainy and fatty. There was also a comment that they had shrunk considerably in size. We spent well over $300 for this product only to be extremely disappointed. We wound up throwing the half eaten steaks out.  When I contacted the seller, they could careless on what my guests had said. Couldnt care that we wound up throwing away over $300 in steaks and did not want to credit my account nor re-ship the product to satisfy a commitment.<br /><br />BUYERS BEWARE.....DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.  VERY EXPENSIVE FOR POOR QUALITY.

review/summary: Halloween in a cup! (may be caffiene free?!)
review/text: ** I have edited this review to make it shorter, I had some background of my history with tea as well as how I typically make my everyday drink to give others a sense of how I make that tea. all that information is now located in my profile. I have also changed this to a review assigning  points for scent and taste (W/WO sweetener Cold/Hot)<br /><br />Ingredients are not listed completely on item so here they are in the order on the label word for word: Organic Honey bush, Organic Rooibos, Buckwheat(contains no wheat!), mace, cinnamon, ginger, toasted rice, pumpkin flakes, pumpkin flakes, caramel pieces, pumpkin seeds, candied peanuts, sweet potato, natural flavors, stevia leaf.<br /><br />*I have no idea what mace or the "natural flavors" are.Reading over the ingredients I am led to believe it is decaf or at least very low on the Caff-o-meter. Rooibos and Honeybush are both naturally caffeine free and in my short research buckwheat is as well (or very low). I'm not against caffeine at all but I appreciate knowing what it is and isn't in<br /><br />-Smell - In bag (4) Steeping (3.5) - when you first open it  the bag smells amazing! Steeping  also provides an enjoyable scent<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened : Hot (3)/Cold (3)- This has a natural sweetness to it but not super sweet, I still prefer my added sweetener, but drinking it plain I now know what people talk about when they are saying the teas have a natural sweetness and nutty flavor to them. this may be attributed to the stevia that is in it as well.<br /><br />+Sweetened: Hot(4)/Cold (4.5)-It seems that my sweetener or maybe the pinch of baking soda, adds a bit of body and boldness to the flavor and exemplifies everything.  I am deducting 1 point from the cold because while this tea tastes amazing, I think I'm more enjoying the Rooibos flavor and not detecting as much pumpkin as I may like, but it is definitely there. While not my thing I bet this would be amazing with some milk added to make a chai.<br /><br />*I prefer my teas Iced and  1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-2nd steep(4) - The hot tea on the second steep is somewhat of a letdown but the cold is still tasting great, if possible even better (I steeped for 10 minutes).<br /><br />Overall Average: *3.5 stars<br /><br />Overall: I love Halloween and was looking for something to get me in the mood, and this one does not disappoint. Before this I was just adding pumpkin pie spices to black tea, it got me by but I knew there was something better out there. I am pleased with this tea, as mentioned earlier I believe this is decaf, also due to being rooibos based (no tannins) it will stand up to longer steeping times without getting bitter. One thing I would recommend to the seller is to offer other sizes on amazon, but I am very glad that they offer this "sample" size because I am hesitant to purchase the other brands on here that are in larger increments.<br /><br />Feel free to read my other reviews I will be adding more as the season progresses (this is my first).

review/text: This tea did not have as much as a pumpkin flavor as a nutty flavor.  I had to add pumpkin spice pie and a little all spice to get the flavor I desired. But it did have a decent taste. It steeps nicely and it's not over powerful. It's a good fall tea. But if you are looking for that real pumpkin flavoring you will need to add your personal touch.

review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046LFBY4">Roland Ginger Tea/Canisters, 2.5000-Ounce (Pack of 8)</a> had no scent or taste of ginger whatsoever, so I had high hopes that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046LF8HY">Roland Spiced Clove Tea/Tins, 2.5000-Ounce (Pack of 8)</a> would compensate and I could create a blend of chai using both teas from Hong Kong.  Oh well, at least I can get a whiff of cloves with this batch, but I will need to use a lot of other spices to make a delectable chai.  If you're looking for a strong clove tea, look elsewhere.  Should you want some cute tins for gift giving and the flavor isn't a great issue, perhaps these will work for you.  In creating my gift bags, I'll include both tins of teas with some fresh spices.  My purchases of Roland teas are now complete and I would not recommend them.  They really could be marked simply as black tea leaves with a slight floral hint.  I expect that after the tins are opened, it's only a matter of days before they all taste the same.

Unfortunately, these are not the Now and Later Cherry candies I remember. Now and Laters (unless you specifically get the soft and chewy ones) are supposed to be solid hard candy. What I received was melted and squishy, and the texture was *nothing* like I recollected, which was probably a result of improper storage or being kept too long. That said, the taste was adequate, which is why I gave it 3 stars as opposed to 1.

Unfortunately, when I asked the restaurant's owner where she got her fermented black beans, all she'd tell me was "Chicago."  Well, that narrowed it right down!  I'd given up the hope of ever making anything at home even noddingly similar.<br /><br />Then I found Lee Kum Kee's Black Bean Chicken Sauce.  I was astonished at how good it was!  And it's easy, too!  On the package they suggest dicing shallots and stuff, which I did the first couple times I prepared it.  Then I got lazy and just chopped up a fist-sized sweet onion.  Outstanding!  The only other things I add are soy sauce to taste and about a tablespoon (again to taste) of Szechwan chili sauce.<br /><br />'Scuse me now.  I'm down to my last envelope and need to order some more right away!

review/summary: Very Good Hot Sauce
review/text: According to its makers, Cholula has been available in Mexico for three generations and imported to the U.S. for about 12 years. Named after a region of Mexico known for its ruins and ancient sites, Cholula is quickly becoming a hot sauce staple in the U.S. The bottle is a classic, with the yellow label, picture of a woman, and wood cap (the wood contains a plastic cap so that the sauce won't be contaminated).<br /><br /> The main ingredient of Cholula is the piquin pepper (also sometimes spelled &quot;pequin&quot;), which is a dried chile with the formal name &quot;capsicum annuum.&quot; In terms of flavor, Cholula is definitely distinctive. The dried chiles add a slightly smoky essence with more dimension than Tabasco or similar hot sauces. The heat level is fairly moderate, which allows the sauce to season your food while not overwhelming it. However, the sauce sometimes seems a little watery or bland.<br /><br /> Cholula adds great flavor to a variety of foods, although I like it best on scrambled eggs; a plethora of recipes are available on the official website. With only 20mg of sodium per teaspoon, Cholula is one of the best sauces available for persons trying to avoid sodium. However, it may taste a bit plain to persons who enjoy a high salt content in their hot sauce.

review/summary: Versatile and not overpowering.
review/text: (First of all, somebody is chasing me around and negging all my reviews so don't pay any<br />attention to that one NO vote.)<br /><br />This is one of the best easily available hot sauces for regular people with normal tolerance<br />for spice.<br /><br />Cholula uses a blend of arbol and piquin peppers. Piquin peppers are actually very spicy, so I'd<br />imagine that the amount of pepper per batch is fairly low, because this sauce has no spice at all<br />for Heat Freaks like me, but a decent little kick for regular civilians. I would compare the spice<br />to a low-level, mild kick, similar to a standard Tabasco sauce or vinegar/cayenne/arbol pepper<br />combination.<br /><br />What it lacks in burning heat, it makes up for in solid flavor. Like basically all hot sauces, it<br />has a tangy vinegar base but contains a generous amount of spice for a robust, smokey tomato sort of<br />flavor. Piquin peppers are very flavorful in addition to being hot. I think they did an excellent job<br />of retaining flavor, even if they downplayed the spice.<br /><br />If you live on the planet Earth, you're in luck. Cholula is available just about everywhere. I'd honestly<br />like to push for this sauce to become the go-to hot sauce instead of the less flavorful, just-as-spicy<br />Tabasco sauce. This sauce's wooden cap makes it stand out just a bit more than the standard hot sauces<br />gracing the shelves of grocery stores and bodegas. Can be found locally for under $3.<br /><br />Good for pizza, salsas, chicken, steaks, sandwiches...with xanthan gum thickening this sauce, it works<br />really well as a strong alternative to ketchup or mustard without being like either one of those. Very<br />low heat rating so conditioned for most palates. If you are looking for flavor more than spice, this is<br />a great alternative to Louisiana style sauces. I highly recommend it! BTW, after rediscovering this great<br />sauce (after 20 years as a Tabasco snob) I have upgraded this review to .....5 Scovies

I'm not a fan of energy drinks in general, so others who are may like this.  I found the consistency too thick, and the flavor too metallic/salty.

review/summary: Awesome flavored candy from a company called Albanese (not the country of Albania).
review/text: I ordered these from a tip from a friend that these were some of the best gummi worms on the market.  I was hesitant - if I did not like them that would be a LOT of junk worms.  I was pleasantly surprised - the flavor on these is better than ANY gummi product I have ever had - and I have had a LOT over the years - and have the waistline to prove it LOL.<br /><br />This is really a LOT of Gummi worms, and I can't really speak as to how long they will stay good.  I decided to vacuum seal one bag into more reasonable sizes and it is working REALLY well.<br /><br />Just make sure you understand - this is 2 bags of 4.5 POUNDS of Gummi worms - a LOT.<br /><br />I have tried a few other things and so far every product is of phenomenal flavor above and beyond any other candy products I have tried.

review/summary: Soft And Sour
review/text: These are delicious and soft sour gummy worms, which come in two bags of four and a half pounds each. The flavors are lemon and a red cherryish flavor, lemon and green apple, and orange and blue raspberry, which is a rather odd flavor combination. The best thing about these gummy worms is that they are sour all the way through, so you can bite them or suck on them without all the sour going away. Would buy again.

review/summary: Pretty nice
review/text: With many sour gummy worms, you'll either get worms that are not sour enough, or are so sour they hide much of their fruit flavors.<br /><br />These particular gummy worms maintain a strong fruit flavor. When you open the bag, the fruity smell comes pouring out. It's quite nice. It smells like fruit punch. When you bite into them, they hold a fruity flavor very well. The flavor is not dulled out by the sour coating.<br /><br />On the "sour" scale, I'd rank these as moderately sour. They're not the most sour you've ever had, but are sour enough to taste it despite the strong fruit flavor. I'd give the sour a 3.5 out of 5. It seems like they tried to strike a balance between fruity and sour, and it gets pretty close.<br /><br />If you are looking for gummy worms that are VERY sour, you'll want to look at another brand. But these are pretty nice overall if you want a good fruit-sour balance.<br /><br />One word of caution. 9 pounds is a lot. Actually, this was the first time eating sour gummy worms that I've ever experienced that "sugar rush sickness" like when you eat too much cake icing. This took me by surprise. So you will want to eat in careful moderation. As you should anyway. I mean, it's 9 POUNDS OF GUMMY WORMS. :)

review/summary: Awesome gummies
review/text: First off, know that you are getting A LOT OF GUMMIES. You have been warned.<br /><br />These taste great. They have a sugary coating, and a sour flavor that permeates the entire gummy. Compared to something like sour patch kids, these are softer, don't initially burn your tongue with an intense flavor, and don't get annoyingly sweet. The sour flavor is there in the entire gummy. That's about it: they are soft and sour; the best gummies I have had.<br /><br />If you would are worried about these being too much, they are really just sugar, so they can keep for a very long time as long as they are in a sealed container.

review/summary: Satisfied my craving
review/text: Well, I was sitting there studying and suddenly I had a craving for sour candy. Since my roommate wouldn't share his, I figured I'd go to Amazon and this is what I ended up picking.<br /><br />These worms are great. It's a little on the sour side compared to the sweet side, but it's a good limiter that helps you stop when you've eaten enough.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was that the different colors are actually different flavors. Blue is raspberry, red is cherry, yellow is lemon--well alright this might be par for the course, but prior to eating these I hadn't had sour gummy candy in over two years. It was a nice surprise to see these worms actually had flavor (a bit too much lemon though)<br /><br />It's a lot of worms. I leave the bag open, which I probably shouldn't, but I only notice them getting a little tougher (actually kinda nice), with no drop in quality.<br /><br />Basically, you'll get exactly what you think you'll get. And it'll be nice.

review/text: I read all the reviews and decided to try these myself.  They are very soft, kinda squishy.  I am used to buying the Trolli gummi worms from Costco, in the huge bag, but they don't seem to carry them anymore.  These are better tasting in my opinion.  They are slightly sour.  I like really sour candy, and these are not even close to really sour.  Did I mention that they are soft, soft, soft?  I prefer a little harder gummi worms, but not a big deal.  It must be because they are so fresh from the factory.  You get 2 bags, and that is a lot of gummi worms.  For the price, this is a good deal - and with free shipping, how can you go wrong?  Good fruity flavor, with a hint of sour.  I will buy again.

review/summary: Best Sour Gummi Worm I Have Ever Had!
review/text: As a long time Haribo purchaser on amazon i would routinely buy the 5 pound bags of Haribo gummies for $15........then i recently discovered Albanese........not only are you getting twice as much candy for the same price, the flavor is twice as intense!!!! If your a sour gummie fan these worms are a must try!!!!<br /><br />Unlike Haribo these sour gummies have the sour flavor not only in the sugar like coating on the outside of the worm but the sour flavor is prevalent throughout the inner gummie worm itself, a intense but not overpowering sour flavor that you taste until the last bit is gone.<br /><br />If you've never heard of Albanese brand gummies and your hesitant on the purchase......trust me.....you wont be sorry.....absolutely the best gummies! They have the most intense flavors i have tried so far gummie wise that i have ever eaten in my life and the price can not be beat! These are a must buy.....and check out the regular assorted flavor gummies as well......unbelievable.

review/text: This is the third time I've ordered candy from Albanese and although all their products have been amazing, I still have to say that these are by far my favorite. (I've ordered the 12 Flavor Gummi Bears and the Sour Gummi Bears).<br /><br />However, I ordered this product around mid-October and when my worms arrived they were molded into a thin rectangular box shape. I had to peel off each gummy worm and some melted together. Nonetheless, they are still delicious and I don't mind at all. I understand that some people might.

review/text: Just so you understand me, my last meal on earth would be sour gummy worms and diet coke. But these worms were lame! First of all, they are so sour that you can't taste the flavor of the gummy candy. So even though there are 3 colors of worms, there's really only one flavor. I actually started running water over the worms before eating them, just so the ridiculous amount of acid wouldn't shred my tongue. Secondly, contrary to other posters, the worms I received weren't at all soft. Maybe the ones I got were old. I won't be buying any Albanese candy again.

review/text: I love Mexican food, especially when you are waiting on your main course to come and the place you are eating serves up piping hot tortilla chips with salsa.  This is almost impossible to replicate from out of a store shelf, in a cold bag, however, after trying these On The Border chips, I will say, this is the closest thing to restaurant style chips I have ever had.  The freshness, the taste and hint of lime, simply outstanding, right off the shelf.  Not sure how they do it, but these chips really are the crispiest on the market without making your own at home.  Highly recommended for those folks wanting a good chip for salsa without going out to eat...

review/text: I was expecting 36# of hard candy -- 24 count of 24 oz packs.  In fact, I got 24 count of 5.25 oz packs. I didn't notice the low shipping weight which would have tipped me off to an error in the copy.<br /><br />That aside, this candy is sweet at first and then as it disolves, it is more intense and sharp in flavor.  Nice as a mint, but not as a "candy".

review/summary: Wonderful first food...
review/text: My son started on solids at 4 months and I wanted to give him healthy, organic first foods before I decided if I would do the whole "make my own baby food" thing.... I have been very happy with this brand. My sons seems to like it more than the Earths best brand, and the veggies (Peas, carrots and sweet potatoes), he likes even more than the fruits. I have stayed with this brand as much as I can, as he really seems to prefer it over others.

review/text: These are heavenly--and healthy!--snacks for our nut-avoidant household.  I have anaphylaxis to tree nuts, so it's terrific to have access to seeds prepared in a facility with no nuts!  They're perfectly seasoned, portable, and power-packed energy for when we're hiking or otherwise on the go.  My children love them, and they gobble them up.  Perfection:  I get to feel virtuous in my parenting, and they get a delicious snack.  I have no financial interest in this company; we just love their products!  Thank you Gerbs!

review/summary: Restaurant Quality
review/text: My wife and I like to enjoy Italian style appetizers yet avoid the ones really high in fat.  So we tend to choose things like bruschetta, tomato with fresh mozzarella, etc.  We also make the same at home.  There were several places around us where these dishes were always better than what we were making at home.  We realized they were using something other than regular balsamic vinegar.  It had to be a reduction of some sort.  So, assuming they were making this stuff in the kitchen, we asked owners of two restaurants how they made their glaze.  To our surprise they both showed us a bottle of this stuff.  It's sweet, a little pricy but you don't need much.  It's extremely flavorful.<br /><br />Two sliced tomatoes, a tablespoon of olive oil, a little garlic, salt, pepper and some of this glaze makes the best quick and dirty tomato salad you've ever had.  We are snacking well these days!

review/summary: Fantastic on pizza, etc!
review/text: What a worry-wart, the reviewer concerned about the plastic bottles.  The product is in plastic so it can be squeezed onto foods.  Seriously - now we've got to worry about any food packaged in plastic in addition to everything else?  OK, rant over.  If you can overlook the horrors of the packaging *shudder*, then prepare yourself to delight in a wonderful, versatile, VERY shelf stable and delicious product.<br />Does it have the complexity of very old, aged, syrupy balsamic that costs well over $100/bottle?  Not quite, but for 10 bucks a bottle, it's a hell of a deal and sure to impress any guest.  I LOVE it drizzled over my homemade pizza, especially on top of prosciutto, figs, carmelised onions, etc.  I put it on after cooking.  It's ok for dipping, but personally I find it a little thick for this.  Salads, YAY!  bruschetta, YAY!  Sandwiches?  YAY!!!  Excellent product.  Snap it up - the second bottle should keep nicely at least a year.  I first found it at a Seattle specialist food importer and they told me that people get addicted to it and keep coming back looking for it.  The price here on Amazon is comparable.

I found one at a grocery store - it was "ok" but not great, so I ordered this.  Absolutely fantastic.  My very picky husband now complains that I don't make pizza often enough.  I've tried several other recipes using this glaze - blockbuster every time.  Very rich and flavorful.<br /><br />I have now discovered that Roland makes different flavors of Glaze - i wish they had a variety pack... this fascinates me.  I may have to try them.

Once shipped, I got the gum within a couple days and they sent me an extra 12-pack of peppermint spry with an apology sticker. So that was nice of them.<br /><br />After tasting the spearmint gum, within seconds the flavor disappeared which I was kinda bummed about, but now I know. So far the longest lasting taste has to be from the peppermint (the classic spry flavor).<br /><br />Hope you find this review helpful :)

review/summary: Loaded with sugars and contains undeclared fats; not a health food
review/text: People, learn how to read nutrition labels. Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the "Fat Free" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type "snackwell devil food nutrition facts" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that "Fat Free" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other "health-conscience" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore "helpful review" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics.

review/text: I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.  I thought that was kinda "iffy", and the cookies were a bit worn (they had that patina of old chocolate), but they were edible, so, okay.  In April, the expiration date was sometime in the far future (September or October of 2011), so I figured the March shipment was a fluke.  In May, the expiration date was *again* 12 March 2011!!  They were PAST expiration.<br /><br />Of course, I'm a carb freak so that didn't stop me from eating them, but, C'MON!!  I'm almost scared to get my next shipment.

At one time FD had duplicated Nabisco's packaging, now its in a green and white box. These Devil's Food cookies cost $1.00 as oppposed to N's supermarket prices of close to $4.00 if not on sale. They are probably made in the the same factory. Plus they have a money back guarantee.

review/summary: Snackwell's
review/text: I had trouble finding Snackwells in the 12 in a case package.  I was VERY thankful to be able to get them through Amazon.com.  We love these, as they are delicious, and it is a great way to limit the amount per serving.

review/summary: Repeat Purchase - Great Deal!
review/text: I think that these cookies are a great deal through Amazon, because the packages are the exact same size and count as the ones sold at our hospital, where we spend far too much time. I'd suggest this bulk purchase to anybody who wants to break free of the $1.25 to $1.75 per pack that a vending machine or the cafeteria will wring out of you...even a convenience store gets right around that same amount, too, so again, just about the best price I can find!!!! =)

review/text: The most convenient way to buy and use cookies.  I like the fact that I do not have to open a whole box to have two cookies.

review/summary: Yummy cookies
review/text: I remember seeing these cookies and imagining how nasty they must taste. I tempted myself into trying some and was quite delighted. Granted, they are not the best cookies (that title belongs to Keebler's Soft Batch) but they are certainly an excellent substitute for those who like to eat cookies and not worry too much about weight. They're quite expensive at the stores (between $3.5-4.5 a box) so I ordered them in bulk from Amazon which bought per box cost down to $2.50.
