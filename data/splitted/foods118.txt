review/text: Why put that other chemical garbage in your body when the pure original tastes this good.  The price was considerably better than the price at my local grocery store.  I ordered again after I checked local prices so I would have some to store in the pantry.  Yummy.

review/summary: Highland Sugarworks Syrup is the best
review/text: This syrup is so good. I do not usually like maple syrup but this one is delicious. It does not have an overly strong maple flavor but is very sweet. I will puchase again based on flavor,its organic,great price, made in USA/Vermont. Maple Syrup just does not get any better than this. They do need to use stonger shipping boxes and wipe the jugs. I had sugar ants in my box but not in my syrup.

review/summary: Excellent product, wish it came in glass bottle
review/text: I was looking for organic pure maple syrup that was made in USA, not Canada because I had read that syrup doesn't need to be 100% in Canada to be called 100%...anyway, that's why I bought this product, company is very reputable looking as per their web site and the price beats any store in my area by far!  I just wish it came in glass and not plastic though it is a good plastic at least #2.  Also, gets a little messy around spout as there isn't a nice pour spout on this, but small price to pay for the money saved.  We use this every day for oats or waffles/pancakes.

review/summary: Extraordinary Maple Syrup!
review/text: The Highland Sugarworks Organic Maple syrup is by far the best maple syrup my daughter and I have tasted.  We have tried many brands including maple syrup produced by individuals, and this syrup is the best!  I had an opportunity to purchase it a few months ago at Amazon.com for about $13; unfortunately, the price has gone up like everything else grocery related.  It is so good that I hesitate to try other brands because I do not want to be disappointed.  I will be buying more in the near future.

review/summary: Delicious maple syrup --- I'll never go back to HFCS!
review/text: This maple syrup is absolutely delicious. I must admit that when I first purchased it, I had no idea about the different grades of syrup and the nutritional content of each. I was just looking for a good pancake syrup that was actually natural and not HFCS (which tends to make my kids wild.)  We buy organic when we can, too.  The "real" maple syrup at our local grocery store was almost $7 for a small glass bottle.  This Amazon deal just made more sense.  I have been buying it for over a year now and my kids love it.  The flavor is great and a little goes a long way, so I find that we actually use less than we used to.  The syrup is a little thinner than I expected (probably because I'm used to the thickness of corn syrup.)  Try it and see what you think!

review/summary: A truly natural sweetener...
review/text: As we try to eliminate white sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and artificial sweeteners from our diet, organic maple syrup is a wonderful natural sweetener. Have tried other brands, grades, and nonorganic. Highland Sugarworks is by far the favorite. We always go back to this one. Perfect on pancakes and waffles, oatmeal, add to a smoothie, drizzle on ice cream. With Amazon's autoship, the price is reasonable. It's delicious. (The kids still prefer the yucky table syrup with artificial everything. Oh, well. We are no longer buying that junk so they'll eventually appreciate the good stuff. Tip: never start with the yucky stuff.)

review/text: i LIKE The real stuff.  This is so flavorful and REAL SYRUP.  only buy the true stuff that is regulated to not be diluted or altered.  This is real maple syrup and I love the dark amber color.  I'm now getting it shipped every month on automatic shipping.<br /><br />I use this syrup in my green smoothies that I blend in my Vitamix.  Pancakes? Oh, of course I do!!!  I've used it in my marshmallows I've made (see my other reviews on the best Marshmallow cookbook I got on Amazon), the maple syrup marshmallows are to die for.<br /><br />I cure and smoke my own bacon on my Weber Smoky Mountain Smoker (that I also got on Amazon) and use this syrup to cure the pork belly.  Add a bit when frying the bacon, too, for that maple goodness.<br /><br />Make the best pork chops...toss a pound of chops in the nesco cooker on 250 degrees, top with a can of sourkraut and half a cup of this maple syrup and a bit of fresh black pepper.  That's it.  let it cook all day.  Ohhhhh my it's good eating.  Don't forget to make some biscuits to go with it!!!<br /><br />Buy quality, this is quality and it's worth every penny.

review/summary: This is areal maple syrup!
review/text: I rarely get excited enough about food products to write reviews, but this maple syrup deserves it!<br /><br />I've been buying real maple syrup for years. At the supermarket, Whole Foods, Costco, what have you. I've NEVER been satisfied with the artificial stuff. All these years I thought I had tasted good maple syrup. Well, I hadn't. I've never been a stickler for the "Grades" or locations, but I guess I've been mostly buying Grade A mediums and darks from Canada.<br /><br />At first glance, the maple syrup is really dark. A bit watery, but I think good for pancakes and such (what I bought it for). However, as soon as you taste it, WOW! Flavors of maple trees with the cool wind in your face come to life. And it's not as sweet as the competition, which is good for me, since I want more of that mapley taste!<br /><br />I will be buying this syrup as my go to brand for a while to come.

review/summary: Best Maple syrup ever!
review/text: My son and his family like to have a relaxed family breakfast on weekends, and pancakes are often on the menu. They love maple syrup and have developed a taste for the "good stuff" - real Vermont maple syrup. It seems that Vermont has the strictest rules about what goes into Maple syrup (believe it or not, they aren't all pure Maple out there!) and of course, the grade A Dark Amber is the best of the best. I couldn't resist picking up this jug of syrup for them as an additional gift for under the Christmas Tree. They were thrilled, and I understand they used it for breakfast the very next morning. I think I will do this again in future Christmases, it was so well received.

review/text: In the interim between ordering this, and it's arrival, I purchased an organic syrup at the local store. So my expectations were low.  This Highland Sugarworks product truly is a marvel.  Every drop is beyond comprehension.  The thick rich delicious maple blends with something deeper, and richer almost smokey.  Wow - what a super incredible treat.  I actually wake up quicker knowing that a little Highland Sugarworks is soon to follow.  I can't believe it's organic.  An incredible home run!  This is one of the finest products (organic or otherwise) that I have ever eaten in any category.  Thank You.

review/text: It's been years since I have had real Maple Syrup with my pancakes.  Since I don't have pancakes often I splurged.  Ahhh wonderfu!  Actually when you think about it 32 oz. is a lot.  So it's really not that expensive when you consider the difference. It will last a long time in the fridge.  So now once a month some friends and I will enjoy the wonderful flavor of real maple syrup.  I was pleasantly surprised at the calories, thought it would be much much higher.  Life is short treat yourself.

review/summary: Less water = optimal maple flavor
review/text: This is the very best maple syrup you can buy commercially.  Vermont has the strictest laws governing their maple syrup, which relates to the amount of water (basically cooked down so that it is less thin and more pure taste).  Whenever I've tried maple syrup from Canada or any state other than Vermont, the syrup has more water and much less flavor.  This does need to be refrigerated, so spoil your family if you want to make them feel special...simmer the amount you'll use in a pan with some fresh orange zest and a smidge of Korintje cinnamon and Double-Strength Madagascar Bourbin Vanilla, and fresh orange zest.  For more recipes, please feel free to visit me at [...] =:)  This is great in steel cut oats or with baked apples too.

review/text: I bought this product as a result of all the great reviews it got.  Trust me (and them), you will not be disappointed.  We normally bought a similar type product (i.e. organic, grade A, dark amber) from Trader Joe's and Highland Sugarworks' syrup blows it away for basically the same price.  Definitely try this one out, you won't be sorry!

review/text: I was raised on the sugar water for $1.50 from Wal-Mart. Then my wife, from New England, introduced me to real maple syrup. Now, the challenge is to figure out how to afford it.<br /><br />Amazon's Prime automatic delivery option has a price cheaper than my local Wal-Mart or HEB, and that's with free 2-day shipping.<br /><br />I don't know which grade to order, but "A" seems like it ought to be OK!

review/summary: My New Favorite Maple Syrup!!
review/text: This was my first purchase of Highland Sugarworks Organic Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup, but I promise you that it will not be my last.  It was very flavorful, but not overpowering and a perfect addition to my French Toast this morning.  If you like real maple syrup (not the fake corn syrup garbage) you will not be disappointed with this syrup.

review/summary: A Reasonable Luxury
review/text: I am by nature frugal.. some may even say cheap. I pondered on this purchase for some time before ordering it. Although the jug seemed small when it arrived, it is full near to the rim and contains a full 32 oz of high quality, organic syrup. It's taste is excellent.. full flavored and sweet (no it isn't going to help your glycemic index.. haha.. but look at it this way.. you get more taste for less syrup so maybe you can rationalize some sugar)<br /><br />My only complaint is with the jar opening.. it has a very large hole and the "snap down" cap will not prevent leakage should you upset it..  It also has a tendency to drip and to get syrup on the outside of the cap when poured. This complaint is minor.<br /><br />The price is not unreasonable IMO when compared to other sources.. and with free shipping that is just one more plus...  this amount of syrup will last a very long time for me.. and it doesn't spoil :D<br /><br />I don't use it for a regular item like morning pancakes, etc but instead use it as a special touch on those occasions when I think "the real thing" is needed.<br /><br />I perhaps should not say so, thereby revealing myself as uncouth or a Philistine, but truthfully I enjoy plain old "Log Cabin" which does have maple syrup as a component of its flavor (#6 on the ingredients. hahah). I reserve the real thing mostly for company.

review/text: The cover was slightly off tilt and the syrup leaked onto the bubble packing.  Packing was wound tightly around the container but does little for the cap not being tightened enough.  Container should have a foil safety shield installed which would end the leaking problem.  If my second auto-shipped one leaks, I will be cancelling the order.  Being opened enough to leak comprises quality, leaving it open to bacteria.

It is packaged in very thin, flimsy box, wrapped in bubblewrap but the syrup is running out of the bubble wrap so it cannot be mailed.  I see that this "is not eligible for returns".  Thanks Amazon.  This is the second time I have ordered syrup that has been either leaking or the top is broken and cannot be closed.  The top on the first bottle I received fell apart when I opened it.<br /><br />Went to Whole Foods and purchased delicious Grade B 32 oz. for $19.89.  Of course they had Grade A Dark Amber and many other grades and brands, but we decided to try the Grade B and are are delighted.  Delicious on waffles.

review/summary: Good taste, not-so-good Grade
review/text: My parents gave us this syrup (Dad's an Amazon Prime member, he gets EVERYthing on Amazon!) and we really enjoy the taste but we try to get Grade B syrup and wish Highland Sugarworks would come out with a B grade. We actually wrote them recently to make sure we just haven't missed it. Grade B is the healthy maple syrup, the REAL STUFF, and at first tastes a little darker than this and others you've had (which are almost surely the cheaper and more processed Grade A) but is far better for you and much healthier. If they can maintain this quality but offer a Grade B, we simply will NEVER get anther syrup brand again. As it is, we combine our Grade B which we get mail order from a place in Vermont right now with this since this has such a zesty taste to it.

review/summary: Good cat food
review/text: I switched to this cat food from Purina One mature formulation. Chicken is the first ingredient! Many other cat foods have rice or chicken by-products as the first ingredient. This food is specially formulated for the older, indoor cat. The other good thing about this food is that it is low in protein (27%), which is important for older cats because of decreased renal function; Purina One mature formualtion has too much protein (37%). My cat really likes the taste and he had no problem switching to this food from Purina One. This is a high-quality cat food and although it is a bit more expensive than other brands, my cat is well worth it!!

review/text: I adopted a mature stray this year.  He was a great cat, but scruffy, and his bowel movements were absolutely toxic.  I was feeding him Purina One, but on the vet's recommendation we switched to Royal Canin, and the difference in the cat is amazing.  His coat is thick and soft, he no longer sheds, his dandruff is gone, and we don't need gas masks to clean his litter box.  I would never have believed that a change in food could make so much difference, but it did.  Great stuff.

review/summary: Great alternative to prescription foods
review/text: My 19 year old cat was on a prescription diet for almost 2.5 years for his reduced kidney function. It was a great food, but the vet that carried it was 45 minutes away and my other 15 year old cat had loose stools with it. So, after reading MANY labels, Royal Canin Mature seemed to be the best one to go with. It's not as expensive as the prescription and it worked wonders for both cats. My eldest has since gone to the Rainbow Bridge to wait for me, but he enjoyed this food until the end. I tried to switch my other cat to a different, less expensive brand that also has lower protein and natural ingredients, but he eats only enough to not be hungry; he is not enjoying his food. So, I'm switching back to Royal Canin Mature. I'm glad to be able to get it from Amazon, it's definitely cheaper than the local, but nationwide, pet chain store.

After we took him to our vet where his extensive injuries were tended to. After he was neutered and he recovered, he had started developing what looked like dandruff on his coat.  After trying several foods, we came across this one.  I am happy to report he and his coat are doing great! He loves this food and his coat is so shiny and wonderful.  We named him Sylvester, he is just adorable.  The most cuddly thing in the world.  We are so happy to have him and so glad to have found a product like this for him.

review/text: This food has worked fairly well for my two not quite senior feral rescues, one of whom has CRF and one of whom has IBD (eating pigeons and food left on the ground apparently isn't so good for young kitties' digestive systems and other internal organs, I guess).  It is a lower protein and phosphorus food, but the first ingredient is real chicken (unlike some renal foods that are made with mostly by-products).  It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg, compared to other special foods, and my CRF kitty, who often rejects a perfectly delicious food once she has tasted it in reverse, has been willing to keep eating this even though she's been sick on it more than once.

review/summary: Cat with Sensitive Stomach Stopped Vomiting!
review/text: I had been offering my housecats the Fancy Feast canned foods with the Fancy Feast kibble always available.  My black Coonie-mix cat would regularly vomit up the clearly identifiable, undigested, highly dyed, cutesy shaped, Fancy Feast bits (usually on my cream colored carpet!)  This cat also had already had to have one tooth extracted and I wanted to try to feed him something that would set better on his tummy.  After doing some web researching, I ordered our first bag of Royal Canin Indoor Mature Cat 27 a month ago.  We went through the gradual change over thing but I don't think it was really needed as the new food was readily accepted.  The first bag has been eaten and joy, and the upchucking has ceased!!! Even his  hairball "gifts" are getting smaller and much more infrequent.<br /><br />My other Maine Coon is 12 and oddly enough, hairballs never seemed to bother her but, she was eating less and less.  She was becoming less active and just didn't seem to be interested in eating kibble or canned and she was noticably loosing weight! Her vet said she could be heading towards a thyroid problem but he wasn't ready to put her on medication yet.  I am happy to report that my sweet girl has really taken to this Indoor Mature Cat 27 diet.  It is helping her get back to her normal, Maine Coon size and she does seem to be feeling much better, even joining in on some playtime with the young'uns!<br /><br />Who knew a change of diet could work such wonders?  Clearly, the attitude of "kibble is kibble" is out the window.  How could I ever return to feeding my cats a food that would make them vomit?!

This kibble is made smaller and breaks apart easier than the other brand, and they both love it!  I had tried high end brands like Wellness, Core, and a few others in the past, but they wouldn't go near them.  I do feed them canned also.  I think that a combination is best for them.  The vet couldn't believe that they're 15 years old, so I must be doing something right!

review/text: I am not a foodie, but I do like to eat.  Some would say that I love to eat.<br /><br />The basics: Each packet contains regular microwave popcorn and an envelope of cheese powder to be sprinkled over the popcorn.<br /><br />Flavor:  The cheese flavor doesn't taste like any cheese that I'd like to eat, if it tastes like cheese at all.  I can't quite place the flavor, but white cheddar?  Not at all.  If real cheese tasted anywhere near this bad, I wouldn't need to go to the gym.  Even people that eat blue cheese would stay away from this stuff.<br />I bought a single package from my grocer thinking: Hey it is only $1.19.  What could I lose?  Well I lost $1.19 plus tax!<br />Flavor is a complete bust.<br /><br />Popcorn:  Nice and fluffy.  If I hadn't sprinkled the mystery powder over all of the popcorn, I would have enjoyed snacking on the plain popped corn. But nooo, in my enthusiasm to finally free myself from the grips of my local gourmet popcorn dealer, I sprinkled the pack of powder on all of the popcorn.  But I digress...  I counted 31 total un-popped or partially popped kernels.  The popcorn would have been awesome if not for the `cheese powder'.  (Of course, your results may vary according to your microwave oven and superior button pushing abilities.)<br /><br />No stars for flavor<br />Five stars for popcorn.<br />Overall: One star. There is no need to pay an upcharge for powder that will render your popcorn inedible.

review/text: a nice sour hint and rather pleasant. It's a unique mint that could evaporate in the mouth quickly and be most satisfying. No sugars, made with natural lime oil and Xylitol, natural fruit and vegge color, ciric acid - nothing else - made in the USA,  tin manufactured in China.  Now to keep my fingers out of the tin - has become a favorite addiction.

review/text: After a fairly decent experience with the grape version of this same candy, gave the lime flavor a go.  The flavor is fairly light and only a bit tart.  More like smarties than the intense sour flavor I'd have preferred.  Still, decent enough, and sugar free.

review/text: Usually diet sugar candies disappoint me (even natural ones).  However, we were not disappointed with this candy.  It does dissolve really fast, but the flavor is fantastic.  My kids think they are great as well as all adults who have tried them. My only objection is that they are so addictive.  I have to use self control to not eat too many at once.

review/summary: Product is OK but company was WORST policy ever
review/text: I was on subscribe and save for these mints, but have switched to Spry due to Xylitol USA's awful company policy and customer service. If you buy something from Xylitol USA that arrives in bad shape and you want to return it for a refund, the company will tell you that they do not accept food back. When I insisted that the product was old (in my case two bags of xylitol sweetened dark chocolates that were old, whitish and tasteless) they said that they would NOT refund my money and, amazingly enough, offered a 25% discount on my NEXT purchase. I disputed the payment and my bank took care of the situation got me my  money back. No more purchases from this company for me.

review/summary: A fantastic olive oil for the price.
review/text: I'm an American which means I don't know squat about good olive oils.  Well, that used to be true.  Now I know a little something about them that I'd like to share with you.  I was a typical person... I bought olive oil at my local grocery store but I didn't really know anything about it.  In time I learned about cold-pressed olive oil being preferred.  Next i learned a little more about the deeper concepts of olive oil.  I sampled various relatively expensive domestic brands, the kinds available at my local Harris Teeter.  But my experiences weren't very fruitful.  I simply wasn't moved.  Until I decided to give in to a wild hare and order a foreign bottle of olive oil.  And WOW!  What a difference!! Such a fruitful nose and a beautiful color.  I never knew it could be like this.  I simply didn't have a clue that this could exist.  But what I ordered was fairly expensive.  At least compared to what I could get locally.  THIS PARTICULAR olive oil was my second foree into non-domestic samples.  And not only is it better than the first REAL olive oil I tried, it's cheaper.  If you choose this olive oil you're going to pay about 30% more than what you can get locally.  With shipping costs and all.  (Minus sales tax, yay!)  But this olive oil is very high quality.  And although it costs a tad bit more that what you can buy locally, the lift in quality makes it worth it ten times over.<br /><br />I just ordered my second bottle and I see this as being something I do every 3 or 4 months.

review/text: Calbee has so many delicious flavors, I wish I could buy them in the states. This one tastes good, it's paprika if you were curious, if you're german yes it's basically the same thing they sell back in Deutschland. As for me, I like this snack a lot but I would l really like to taste more of their 'eccentric' flavors from Calbee which left me drooling in appreciation, like this plum and pork flavor (watashiwa nihongoga wakarenai) I'm guessing at what the flavor was from the drawing but it's very delicious- sort of sweet with a hint of meat flavor. Motto!<br /><br />Definitely recommend in any case, this paprika bag of chips is pretty conservative for anyones palette and most likely won't offend anyone but rather addict people.

review/summary: Perfectly Butterscotch!
review/text: Butterscotch is not my favorite flavor, because I associate it mainly with cheap candies. I was really hoping this matcha would be more like the fresh butterscotch syrup you put on ice cream sundaes, and I was right! The flavor is so smooth and perfectly butterscotch-y. And not at all like cheap candy. No, this is rich decadent creamy sweet gooey butterscotch. The matcha base keeps it from being too heavy and sickly-sweet, it's the perfect balance of health and decadence.

review/summary: Sweet Sinful Delight - No Guilt!
review/text: If you love butterscotch hard candies then this is the matcha for you! Its my new secret sinful delight! This is EXACTLY like those butterscotch hard candies from childhood!<br /><br />I think if I had to pick one matcha that I would never share with others this would have to be the one. Although there are so many I have yet to try I think so far this is my favorite. I just made myself laugh though because I have said that with almost every new matcha from Red Leaf Tea I have tried. Seriously though, this is so very yummy, and sweet, and just really the one that I feel will always hit the spot for me! What is even more cool is that when I mix it in my latte concoction - which is how I usually have my matcha, the butterscotch flavor comes out even more and is not by any means hidden underneath the milk or vanilla creamer!<br /><br />I always do try matcha straight before mixing it in my latte and I will say that the butterscotch flavor is stronger in the latte mixture than straight which I found interesting and odd at the same time.<br /><br />I don't know how Red Leaf does it but their flavors are all natural and while I certainly appreciate the health benefits to matcha I am finding I reach for it more and more simply for the flavor but I can't deny the excellent energy boost! Its like an energy drink without all the sugar which means you don't come down and fall on your face later in the day! This is a different kind of energy boost, one that makes you more alert and on the ball and it does not end abruptly finding yourself feeling lower than before you had the drink as energy drinks do. This trails off nicely and in a mellow fashion allowing you to ease into the afternoon or evening!<br /><br />I am now drinking at least one matcha per day, after my morning black tea!

review/summary: So buttery...
review/text: Butterscotch is another one of those flavors that I adore. Butterscotch anything is pretty much a guarantee I buy it. I love the rich buttery-ness of it. In my drinking days, butterscotch schnapps was my go-to drink. I love it. Mix it with a bit of milk or hot cocoa...oh yes. The best, though, is around the holidays, mix a touch of it into egg nog. Ooooh, now that's an idea, egg nog matcha. Red Leaf Tea, I will love you forever if you develop an egg nog matcha by the holidays! I can't have real nog any more, so I've been hunting for a good tea substitute.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. Butterscotch is love for me. It's another Dad memory, he loves it and it makes me think of him...or maybe I'm just homesick this week. Butterscotch pudding is the only pudding I'll touch and if an ice cream shop offers butterscotch topping, I'll risk the dairy allergy to get a cone covered in the stuff. Liquid gold, it is. And seeing the success of Red leaf Tea's Caramel and French Vanilla flavors, I have complete confidence in this blend being amazing. I think this definitely calls for a hot tea latte, despite it being stupidly hot outside. Am I in Toronto or back in Tennessee? These hot days are killing me...I should be able to handle them better!<br /><br />No, I went for a cold matcha instead, it's too hot out there to bother with hot drinks, though this one was made to be enjoyed hot. Hot with a touch of rum and milk. Mmm...anyway. Yes. Cold, it's less than stellar, but it's still yummy. Very buttery and rich, but not too rich. I want to sip on this all day, but I need to save some for when it's cool enough to be able to handle a hot drink. It does taste like candy, but it's not overwhemingly sweet. It's just tasty.  I'm not wowed by it like I am with some of their other blends, though. This one's good, but I need to try it a few more times before I decide if I'm going to keep it on my shelf or not. Perhaps a warmer water temperature will help, or a better ratio of tea to water. Still, it won't be hard at all to convince myself to drink this one! I might even be convinced to share it.

review/summary: Good on the "healthy" side but probably an acquired taste
review/text: Over the past year my wife has been pushing me (kicking & screaming) into a somewhat more healthy diet with the purpose of helping me lose weight and gain control of my cholesterol. Having me try a number of these fiber bar type things is one of the ways. For the most part I am not a big fan of them but am always on the lookout for one that will appeal to my fat/sugar-loving taste buds. Pamela's Whenever Bars is the latest of a long list of hopefuls.<br /><br />On the plus side; wheat-free, glutton-free, and non-dairy. They include Omega 3 fatty acids and no Trans fats. It's also low in sugar, low in sodium, and low in saturated fats. This is probably a good and quick snack for those with special dietary needs.<br /><br />On the negative site; the taste will be an acquired one, at least for me. It's not a bad taste by any stretch of the imagination but in my opinion it's not one I look forward to either. Maybe it's the lack of sweetness to the bar, or at least not enough sweetness that makes it more of a necessary snack instead of an attractive one. We'll see if it eventually grows on me.<br /><br />Overall, a decent and healthy snack that is not terrible tasting. Could be better but based on other bars I've tried, could be a lot worse.

review/summary: I love them!
review/text: Gluten free products can be hit or miss.  I'm fairly new to living the gluten free lifestyle, and I've often been surprised by how bad some gluten free products can be.  I've had good luck with Pamela's products so far.  I noticed several people didn't like Pamela's Coconut Whenever bars, but I loved them!<br /><br />I think the size is just right for a snack, and they are moist and chewy.  The coconut flavor seemed authentic to me, not artificial.  There was just the right amount of chocolate to round out the flavor.  The chewy texture was just right as well, although every now and then I hit a piece of a hull or something that was unexpected.<br /><br />I've pretty much given up on most baked goods since giving up gluten.  I have no idea if I would like these bars as much if I were still able to eat 'regular' food.  Overall, I think they are very good for a gluten free product and it's something I'd like to have again.

review/summary: A flavorful bar, but misrepresented
review/text: PAMELA'S OAT CHOCOLATE CHIP COCONUT WHENEVER BAR, with a glass of cold skim milk, was my after-dinner dessert this evening. While it served its purpose as a cap to the evening meal quite nicely, it left me somewhat bemused.<br /><br />Not to put too fine a point on it, coconut was the only flavor discernable by me in the gustatory experience. Though obviously made with oats and containing chocolate chips, a taste of neither of those two ingredients came through.<br /><br />The "mouth feel" of the bar is pleasant enough. It's of medium density - as compared to the heavy density of a Bobo's Oat Bar (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGW714">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Banana, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>) - and moist. Though the oat fiber is recognizably present in the texture, it's the flaked coconut that's most perceivable. The chocolate chips, while visible, contribute nothing at all in my opinion. (Again, if you're seeking a taste of oats, go to the Bobo's Oat Bar, which is very strong in that regard. If you're seeking the taste of chipped chocolate, don't dither about; go to a chocolate chip cookie, gluten-free if desired.)<br /><br />Pamela is apparently promoting an alternative snack for the nutritionally conscious and/or challenged as the packaging all but screams "Wheat-Free", "Gluten-Free" and "Non-Dairy", though the last claim is asterisked and clarified in the ingredients list with "chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment."<br /><br />The box also lists "180 mg Omega 3 Fatty Acids", "9 Grams Whole Grains" and "0 Grams Trans Fats", apparently for each 40 gram, 180 calorie, single-serving bar.<br /><br />To allow the buyers to feel altruistic when purchasing the product, it's also noted in the fine print that "Pamela's Products donates to Celiac Sprue and Autism Support Organizations." Celiac sprue is caused, of course, by dietary gluten intolerance.<br /><br />While I'd otherwise award at least 4 stars to this bar, I'm only going as high as three because the product's taste potential seems so badly misrepresented by its name. Unless you especially like coconut, you may do better seeking gratification elsewhere. And if you dislike coconut, definitely steer clear.

review/text: I love coconut macaroons and chocolate but I don't like to put on a lot of calories. These bars are a delightful snack, especially if you are trying to avoid gluten and/or dairy. The amount of sugar in a bar is low, probably in part due to the use of agave. I'm not really fond of agave and don't feel they really need it, since there is also some sugar in the chocolate chips. There is also a little too much salt for my taste but I still think this is a great quick snack for rare occasions.<br /><br /> I make my own cookies with apple sauce, using a variation of a recipe on the side of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDS6Q">Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 40-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> but I leave out the sugar and salt and I add some coconut. These are even better and chewer than Pamela's but then, of course, they DO take about 20 minutes to make. If you don't want to go through that bother, Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut bar should do the trick for a quick snack.<br /><br />The Amazon listing says there are six bars in a box. However, the box is clearly labeled and says five. The box is right.

review/text: The bars are about 3/4th the size of a Clif bar and have the same sort of consistency. The smell of the coconut is pretty powerful when you open the package and the bars themselves don't really have a decent taste. I don't know if this is because it's gluten-free or what, but it tastes sort of like a dry tasteless oatmeal cookie. The chocolate didn't help add to the flavor. It's moist to the point where it feels damp and you can easily break it apart but I thought it was kind of bland and I felt like I needed to wash it down with lots of water.<br /><br />I'm a guy who likes snacks, and I'm a sucker for chocolate chip granola bars. This should be right up my alley. But it doesn't taste that great. If you're under certain dietary restrictions, you might feel differently but I wouldn't buy this as a snack.

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: I should point out from the get-go that to the best of my knowledge, I don't suffer from any sort of celiac sensitivity in the slightest. However, I'm very aware that this is a problem for many people, some of whom are unaware that they have a problem but know they're not functioning as they should. I do know what it's like to be unable to digest food that you like (in my case, any sort of meat) and wheat is even more difficult to avoid, so I can sympathize.<br /><br />Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars are meant to provide a tasty, healthful snack for the gluten-intolerant. They're sweetened with agave and the ingredients are palatable to both celiac sufferers and those who just want a snack that's devoid of white sugar. These bars are guaranteed gluten-free, come individually wrapped, and are packed five to the box.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are actually pretty tasty--their lack of ingredients like stevia ensures that they have a pleasant sweetness that's gentle and tastes completely natural. And the other flavors are well-balanced as well--there are plenty of chocolate chips of good quality and the presence of coconut is a plus. But the fact of the matter is that Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars suffer from a fault that's pretty consistent in individually wrapped desserts of this kind: they're just too damp and lacking in crispness. Yes, I know that we all want chewy cookies nowadays and that cookie dough is held to be a gastronomic pinnacle to some. But I prefer my "soft" tempered by some external "snap," so this isn't the ideal snack for me. It tastes nice but the texture, for me, falls short (your own mileage may vary).<br /><br />Regardless of my personal quirks, the fact that the food industry is accommodating those with food sensitivities and doing their best to do so in such a way as to use quality ingredients is fantastic. For those who like a damp, moist cookie, these just might be your idea of heaven--gluten-intolerant or not. Not my first choice for a nosh but this, I reiterate, is a purely personal call.

In the sample I received the bars were very balanced with chocolate and coconut flavors.  The grains are soft and chewy, speckled with seeds that give a faint crunch.  They are sweetened just enough.  I find them most welcome to my gluten-free life, as I've never had a gluten-free grain bar that was any good.<br /><br />I am not thrilled that they are sweetened with agave.  Based on reading I've done I just don't find that it's saving me much in the way of health or natural foods.  It's also still packs a decent whop on the glycemic index, if you have to be careful about blood sugar.  As well, these bars had almonds and potential traces of dairy.  So if you need to steer 100% clear of such these may not work for you.  They are not protein bars, so they wouldn't be a good meal replacement, or even a healthy snack if you are monitoring carbs.  They are, however, great for when you just need something a little sweet.<br /><br />If they are priced in the store as they are on Amazon, they are the same as and/or less than other traditional grain bars and gluten-free snacks.  I'd also like to point out that the item description says there are 6 in a box.  There are 5, as the box clearly states.  I would most definitely get them again, and I'm curious about trying the other flavors.

review/summary: Gluten Free A+, Snackwise C
review/text: This was not your usual granola bar looking snack.  It was somewhat misshapen making it look more home made.  It was soft which was a plus.  I liked the coconut.  My son, two of my grandchildren and my wife did not like the coconut.  On first glance it seemed yummy, what is not to like about oat, chocolate and coconut?  Obviously in my family the coconut was a negative.  Son liked the taste but not the coconut. Wife didn't like the taste and neither did the 5 & 7 year old grandchildren.  If you are looking for a gluten free non-dairy snack and have no issues with coconut or calories this is a good choice.  The 180 calories put it about 40 calories higher than our favorite granola bar and 80 calories higher than my favorite snack bar.  Uber-sensitive son was dismayed with the lack of protein and he was concerned about the 9grams of fat.<br /><br />Wrapping it up, for a gluten free snack it is pretty good but if you are not concerned about gluten you probably will want a different snack.<br /><br />Addendum:the counter woman at my favorite pizza place is on a gluten free diet and loved them.  So that confirms it, as a gluten free snack it got the prize!

review/summary: Delicious and Satisfying!
review/text: I am really pleased with these bars.  Too often, in my experience, Gluten-Free bars are either cardboard-like or have odd tastes.  Not so with these.  They are rich and the flavors are really nice. It's almost like eating a candy bar. They arent' huge bars, but they are quite satisfying.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that they are a bit high in calories for the size - 180 with 9g of fat.  So it's not a 100-calorie snack bar.  They do, however, provide 4% of daily iron, which is a nice plus with a snack bar.

review/summary: Yummy!  Tastes like a Almond Joy bar
review/text: If you crossed an Almond Joy candy bar with a cookie, it would taste like this. I'm happy that its less sweet than most cookies or candy bars. I don't like overpowering sweetness. Instead this tastes slightly sweet with lots of nutty, coconut flavor and a bit a chocolate.  Love that its Gluten-Free and 180 mg of Omega 3 fatty acids.  It has lots of organic ingredients and is sweetened mostly with agave.<br /><br />I only have one gripe:  Manufactured on the same equipment with peanuts. I really appreciate that they tell me.  I just wish they didn't do it, because that means its to dangerous of a product to keep in our house.  (Guess that means I need to hurry and eat them all).

review/summary: Not Bad For Health Food
review/text: My package arrived today and being a chocolate/coconut fanatic and hungry at the time, I immediately ate one and shared one with my husband as well for his viewpoint.<br /><br />Pros: Pretty yummy, especially for a health food product. Rich in coconut and oat. It feels as though you are eating more than you are, has a satisfying effect.<br /><br />Cons: The wrapper is much bigger than the product, causing my first reaction to be, "this is it???" But like I said, it was filling.. but it needs a bit more chocolate. However, my husband argues that it would no longer be health food then.<br /><br />NOTE: There seems to be a misadvertisement here. It's a pack of 5, not 6. Read the fine print on the box in the picture for verification.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I really like the Pamelas Products Whenever bars. They have a chocolately coconut taste and not too sweet which is great. Only 8 grams of sugar. It is filling and I would order these in the future.

review/summary: Oh boy are these good!
review/text: My only complaint about these little bars are they are too small!  They are lightly sweetened, not sickening sweet like a lot of these types of snacks are. I'm not big on desserts or things that are very sweet.  I love dark chocolate and things that are lightly sweetened, closer to the way things are naturally.  There is just the right balance of oats, coconut and chocolate- but not only chocolate- dark chocolate. It was a little strange to have five bars in a pack. I thought someone had eaten my last bar when I went back for the sixth.  I love the fact that they are sweetened naturally without processed sugars or artificial sweeteners.  And, they're gluten free. But, I didn't feel like I was sacrificing anything when I ate them.

review/summary: Pamela's Whenever Bars Oat Choc Chip Coconut ... conquer the crave
review/text: For a healthy, alternative snack bar that is wheat-free, gluten-free and non-dairy and contains a host of dull ingredients like gluten-free oats and organic agave, I think Pamela's has done a superior job perfecting taste with their Whenever Bars (Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut) ... and (thankfully!) NO high fructose corn syrup to boot!<br /><br />The bars certainly live up to their "moist and chewy" label description. I mean, come on, how much magic can you whip up on such a limited and boring ingredient budget?  With these limitations in mind, Pamela's has created a pretty delicious snack that may not be the most filling thing to eat, but then again, how many snack bars (healthy and of the junk food variety) really do the trick and fill you up like, let's say, a decadent hot fudge sundae!<br /><br />Although the chocolate was a bit sparse, as far as the amount of coconut - think macaroons! For coconut lovers, this snack bar should be on the top of the shopping list. I would have given these  Whenever Bars a five-star rating, and the only reason that I knocked off one star was that my 16-year-old daughter, who was my fellow taste tester, complained about an aftertaste. At least now, I don't have to worry about MY Whenever Bars disappearing!

review/text: These were so good. They tasted like oatmeal cookies with coconut. They are rather small and for the price that might not fly with some people. But you pay for healthy these days.

review/summary: It does not taste like Chocolate Chip to me
review/text: I thought these bars might be a good substitute for the Honey Nut Cherrios bar that I have for breakfast, I was wrong.<br /><br />Although they are both 40g bars the Cherrios bar is more filling.  They are about even on Calories but the Whenever Bar gets 80 of its 180 from fat, whereas the Cherrios bar gets only 35 of its 160 from fat.  The Whenever Bar has 15mg of Cholesterol, whereas the Cherrios bar has none.  The two bars are about even on Total Carbohydrates.<br /><br />To me this bar does not taste like Chocolate Chips - maybe that taste is overwhelmed by the heavy Coconut flavor.  If these were called Coconut bars, with a hint of Chocolate - maybe I would give them a higher rating - but, to me, the flavors are not as the product name would lead me to believe.<br /><br />I really was underwhelmed by this product, and unless you are a big Coconut fan, you probably want to buy something else.

review/summary: Only OK
review/text: These bars by Pamela's Products are OK.  They are very chewy and moist.  Also very stick-to-your-teeth.  However, taste is limited.  There is a general bland undertone, overall, but somewhat heavy on the oat flavor also with a bit of a coconut undertone.  There is no noticeable chocolate taste (to me).  However, the chips' soft slick variance from the other chewiness is obvious.<br /><br />Bars (of any kind) can be very personal to folks in taste (like or dislike).  Try and see for yourself.

review/summary: Yes, moist, chewable,but unpleasant taste
review/text: I tried this product because I love Pamela's baking and pancake for making chocolate chip cookies (and pancakes), and I was hoping this cookie would be good.  Well, the "good" is it has some decent ingredients (some fiber, aguave, rice blend flour-- no high frucose corn syrup) but the "bad" is it tastes terrible.  I couldn't even finish the one cookie (it comes in a small rectangular bar, maybe 2 and a half inches long by an inch plus wide and 1/2 inch thick.  I'm usually pretty good with words, but although I like the texture, moist part of this cookie, the flavor is indescribably dreadful; I wish I could be more precise, it negatively tickles the taste buds.  You don't feel you would get sick eating it, but you might consider using it as a torture on someone. I would ask my wife to try it, but I want to live.  There are other better products on the market that taste much better, power bars, etc.  Some people may question aguave being "good," but I think it is better than staight sugar or corn syrup--correction--there is some evaporated cane sugar in the product as well as coconut sugar. It has 180 calories, so keep that in mind.
