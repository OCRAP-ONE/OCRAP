review/text: I love these noodles so much. They are the perfect winter comfort food. I only use half of the seasoning packet, so it's not too spicy. Also try cracking an egg in the soup, mix in some mushrooms and other vegetables. So yummy!

review/summary: Ramen noodle with a spicy kick!
review/text: This is like Ramen noodle soup but with a spicy kick.<br />-You can control how spicy the broth is by adding less or all of the seasoning pack.<br /><br />I found adding the "vegetable" pack doesn't really add or take away from the flavoring.<br /><br />On a side note the package says to boil 19.5 fluid ounces of water. This converts approximately to 2-1/2 cups of water.<br /><br />I would rate this product:<br />4 out of 5 for TASTE.<br />3 out of 5 for VALUE.<br />5 out of 5 for being made in the USA!<br /><br />Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun is $17.99\20 which comes out to be .90 cents\package.<br />Maruchan Ramen Noodle Soup is $15.97\36 which comes out to be .44 cents\package.<br /><br />Seems like Nong Shim can be more price competitive.<br /><br />Overall though I am likely to order again.

review/summary: Not authentic spiciness
review/text: The spice packets that come with the noodles are NOT spicy at all. I'm guessing the flavor packets were dulled to appeal more to American tastes, but they definitely are not on the same level as what I'm used to. Very disappointed. With the normal noodles, I could only use half a packet or risk burning off my taste buds, with these a full packet barely tingles my tongue. With the cold weather coming up I was really looking forward to bowls of hot spicy noodles, now I have to make do with the dulled down versions.

review/text: My roommate in college used to buy the Nong Shim Shin Cups and I loved them a lot, but didn't want to cook in Styrofoam every day.  These noodles are soooo good, but beware, they contain MSG.  I think everything is ok in moderation, and really love the taste of these noodles.  Sometimes I buy beef or chicken stock, and cook the noodles in that instead of the soup flavor pack included.

review/summary: The best ramen EVER !!
review/text: Mashithhaa !!<br />Tried this when stationed in Korea on a "remote" tour for one year (first of two times... remote being you couldn't bring your family). I have been hooked on this ever since. My friend and I survived on this and Goobers peanut butter and jelly (the one where both are in the same jar) sandwiches!! Love the spiciness first of all, and the noodles are bigger and tastier than the 20 cent americanized brands. I have tried many additions to this such as: mixed vegetables, tuna fish (uh.. not with mayo), hot dogs, mushrooms, olives (black and/or green), pickles, hot pepper rings. No, I never put hot dogs, eggs, or tuna together... ugh!<br />When I was stationed in Korea there was some smaller restaurants around the bases that would serve Cheese'Ramien. they cooked the noodles and added the spice packets. Then they would drain the water (some of the spiciness was left behind in the noodles) then right away added cheese to the steaming hot noodles in a bowl and mixed. Voila! Cheese Ramien... Korean style.<br />I am retired from active duty military now but the commisaries (on base grocery stores) stock this item and I have been eating it probably at least once a week ever since that first Korean tour 20 years ago. Chajamyun/g (ja ja myun) is also awesome !! They make an instant version of that also, not spicy, but made with a black bean powder.<br />Korean food ROCKS !!<br />By the way, it's cheaper in the Military Commisary too.

review/summary: Not your everyday ramen (but it should be!)
review/text: I first picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQORDE">Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun</a> in a local Asian Specialty store near my office. I needed a cheap lunch and this was my choice.  Since that day I continued to buy it a couple packages at a time to keep at work for those days when I don't have a lunch planned. Now though I have an entire case because Amazon had such a great price. It's easy to cook up in the microwave and very filling. The one change I make is that I only use about 1/2 the seasoning pack, any more and it's too spicy for me to finish the entire bowl. Also I'm one of those "picky" people that doesn't like mushrooms and there are usually a couple small dried pieces in the vegetable pack that I pick out.  Minor I know, BUT if you don't like mushrooms it's something you should know.<br /><br />While I still buy the "other" ramen for home because my kids like it, Nong Shim has won me over with theirs and it's my treat to myself.

review/summary: By far the best Ramen I've had
review/text: I admit it.  I love Ramen noodles.  I ate enough of them in college where they became a part of me.  I regularly still buy Ramen noodles just because I like them.  I saw these listed on Amazon so I was curious.  Hmm, a new Ramen that I've never tried and gets good reviews...I need to try these.  They are fantastic.  I really like the spice in these.  I eat a ton of Thai and Indian food so for me these aren't spicy and are just perfect.  I used the whole packet and found the spice level just perfect.  Anyway, as others have said these are much better than your standard Ramen noodle.  If you like Ramen noodles at all I highly recommend you pick up a box of these.  But, as others have noted, if you don't like really spicy food you might want to start off with just a half packet of spices and see how it goes.  Another great product I found through Amazon!

review/text: I love spicy food and where I live you can not find spicy ramen. My Korean b/f said that these were the spiciest noodles he has had in America. I did not take it too seriously and I was not going to buy ramen online. So as insisted that I try it and he sent me a box of these from Amazon and wow they really are spicy! I like to add kimchi and egg in mine personally but you can put chicken, lamb, shrimp, white fish or beef in this.<br /><br />  I suggest if you want to do meat to add a bit of oil in the pot with the seasoning packet and cook it like that first after it is almost cooked add the water. and cook the noodles separate and drain them add the noodles in a bowl than top with the broth meat and veggie. It is a little extra work but really worth the time. (the reason to cook the noodles separate is because i find that cooking the noodles with the meat makes the meat chewy)

review/summary: Add some Spice to your Life!
review/text: I love noodles, although I really have to be careful of the amount of sodium I eat.  Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun, Gourmet Spicy Picante noodles add a little kick start to your day!  To start, don't add the entire spice packet because it may be a bit too spicy for you; I don't use a lot of water (just enough to cover the noodles), so I don't use the entire packet for that reason.  I have learned that the Asians add a poached egg to their noodles.  I tried it and I find that just adding that little bit of protein keeps me satisfied longer.  These are really not your standard noodles, so if you want to add a little spice to your life, try them.  They cost a little more than the standard noodle, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for!

It can be made in less than 8 minutes on the stovetop. 3 minutes for water to boil and 5 minutes to cook.<br /><br />I am a fan of spicy foods but these noodles can be a little too spicy.

Also great (and more of a meal) with egg stirred in near the end. I could eat these every day, but alas, that would have dire consequences.<br /><br />Taking the nutritional drawbacks as a given, these are 5* for price/flavor.

review/text: i have eaten this product for 3 or 4 years and i LOVE it!  i am so glad i found this on amazon so i do not have to worry about finding it in stores anymore.  our grocery here charges $2+ for 1 packet of it!  can you say rip off!  i only cook the noodles 3 minutes after i put them in the boiling spice mix.  and i have been adding raw shrimp to the spice mixture and that makes this a great meal!  my son started eating this at age 10..he calls it moms spicy soup...he loves it too.<br /><br />so here is my question..have they changed the noodles?  the last bunch i got (get the pack of 20) the noodles have been almost slimy..  i never cooked them as long as they say, sticking with 3 minutes which had worked for years..  now i have tried cooking less time, more time and the oodles are just ... different..  as i said, almost slimy feeling or something like that..  i don't know..  anyone else notice that?  and didn't these used to come from thialand?  they are made in america now and the directions on the back are more american-ized..  i am wondering if they changed the noodles if they did move the product to made in the usa..<br /><br />another update!!  whatever was going on seems to have only been with that one shipment and not all of them.  i have gotten a couple since then that have been fine.

It's made this the most affordable of this type of superior three-minute ramen one can get, especially in Hawaii where most food is imported and thus, more expensive. I've become an instant ramen snob (an oxymoron?), and this brand has great quality noodle texture.

I use a little more water than called for by the directions, then add a few tablespoons of dried diced bell peppers for a bit of nutrition when adding the noodles and packet contents.  (The extra flavor is nice, too.)  When the noodles are cooked, I turn off the heat and add a beaten egg, stirring quickly.  The package makes two lunches for me.  A hungrier or bigger person could eat a whole package, although the sodium total would be high. I can get these in one of my local grocery stores, but they don't restock when sold out and since Amazon's price is the same, I bought a case here.

review/summary: It hurts so good!
review/text: I will preface this to say that I like spicy things. From salsa to buffalo wings, I usually like the hottest variety of everything. Imagine my surprise then when I heard of this magical "splcy picante" ramen. I figured it couldn't possibly be that bad, so I ordered this box of 20 to check it out.<br /><br />When it came in, I eagerly prepared a package as I normally make ramen. Needless to say I was unprepared for what came after I had my first spoonful. I honestly wondered if I could finish it... whew. The quality of the noodles was fantastic (a far cry from any of the brands you can buy at the supermarket) but that broth! Spicy didn't even begin to describe it. So there I sat, sweat pouring down my face as I polished off the last of it.<br /><br />Feeling exhausted, yet quite proud of myself, I checked out some reviews and saw many warnings about the heat in this stuff, in addition to the most helpful suggestion ever--only use half of the seasoning packet! I actually use even less than half, and that's still plenty of flavor and plenty of heat for me--making the bowl not only bearable but actually pleasurable to eat. Also cuts down on the heaps of sodium present in there.<br /><br />I really love these, but they're just plain unhealthy so I don't eat them very often. But as long as you don't dump that entire packet of fire in there you've got a pretty spicy tasty bowl of awesome.<br /><br />And if you do use the whole packet and enjoy every drop? You're a mensch in my book!

The hard brick type noodles you boil in water for 6 minutes.<br /><br />Now, I love spicy. I add spice to almost everything I eat. I have lived in the middle and far east.. so when I cooked up my first packet of these I was surprised to find I was reaching for the water. Wow, these are spicy. I normally like to drink the soup at the end but was unable to. The 2nd packet I had was not too bad or I got used to it. For the 3rd packet, I mixed in a raw egg just before microwaving and it made a huge difference. It seemed to take the kick out of the spice and I enjoyed it much more.<br /><br />If you like noodles and spicy, buy these.

review/text: Noodles are fine and filling. They make a simple and cheap meal with some vegetables, slices of meat, and eggs thrown in. The spice packet is a bit overwhelming if you're starting out, so stick to using a quarter of the packet first. The dehydrated vegetables are a nice touch, though they do take a bit more time than the noodles to be rehydrated. Instead of following the instructions on the package to the letter, try throwing in the veggies a bit before time, say 2 minutes or so ahead, or while the water is boiling set the veggies in a separate container of water until it's time to cook the noodles.

But anyway this stuff is AWESOME and it is not for any one who hates spicyness because this stuff is hot! But its packed with soo much flavor,it makes those 15 cent ramen noodles taste like noodles in salt water. These are worth the extra cash because this is quality.

review/summary: Yummy al dente noodles in my bowl!
review/text: I bought these on a whim because they were a deal of the day.  Boy am I glad that I did.  As a big fan of Maruchan and Top Ramen, I read the reviews and saw that these were very close to the real thing.<br /><br />The noodles have such a great consistency and cook in just 4-5 minutes.  Very al dente, even after they sit in your bowl for 5 minutes cooling down.  Another plus for me was the fact that there isn't only the flavor packet but a vegetable packet as well.  That vegetable packet adds another dimension to the soup.<br /><br />As other reviewers have stated before, this is for the Spicy Picante pack.  If you can't handle spice then I suggest using a 1/4 of the spice packet.  If you are a seasoned professional then use the whole thing.  My first time around I did that and found myself actually finding it overwhelming and I ALWAYS eat everything hot and spicy including Jalapenos.  So from now on, it is half a packet for me.<br /><br />Take a chance... they are great; can't wait to try other flavors now!

review/text: Stacks of these shin ramyun are stored and sold at each and every Korean airport Duty Free Shops (in a different packing style). I for one am not complaining for buying it at an average of under 1 buck a bag. Extra spice needed if you are really in for the hot flavor. Cooking it in a stone pot with an extra egg, some fresh kimchi and some beef (or spam;) will bring out the real korean taste.

review/summary: My new favorite ramen, thanks to amazon
review/text: I originally decided to purchase this particular brand of ramen after seeing all the other positive reviews here on Amazon. I was a bit apprehensive at first, fearing that I wouldn't enjoy it since I had never tried this brand before but I'm glad this turned out to be delicious. The spiciness, although explained in the reviews, was still a bit surprising when I first tasted it. I'm glad something is actually spicy for once instead of just claiming to be spicy and having the spiciness equivalent to a chocolate bar.

review/summary: Tastes like More!
review/text: My late father in law used to have a rating system for meals: if it was particularly tasty, he'd say "This tastes like more!" That's exactly how I felt the first time I tried a spicy picante ramyun. I ordered these on a whim when they were featured as a gold box deal. I'd enjoyed ramen noodles in the past, so even though I'd never tried this brand, I figured for less than a dollar a package, I could afford to take a chance. Boy am I glad I did! They were spicy, flavorful and delicious. I immediately wanted a second helping and had to talk myself out of it. I used less water than it called for but the full spice packet, and I think that combination intensified the flavors. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of the strange dried meat bits that popped up every once in a while. The tough texture of the mystery meat kind of threw me off my game, but luckily I only found them when I was almost finished. I'd recommend these to any ramen lover (adjusting the spice to taste for some).

You cannot taste the meat but just how hot they are. The same can be said about these supposedly top brand ramen noodles.

review/summary: Excellent Noodles
review/text: These are excellent inexpensive noodles but they are quite salty for someone who rarely adds salt to food, even when cooking, as I do!  They are more expensive than grocery store Ramen and taste a good deal better but seem to have about the same destructive amounts of salt- 2020 mg or about 80% daily salt intake/bag which claims to be 2 servings but I assume that most adults would consume the lot unless using this as only part of a meal rather than a quick comfort food.  Other reviews alerted me to this and following their recommendation, I only used 1/2 the soup base package.  I added some dehydrated green onions and dried oinions when preparing on the stovetop and added a fresh egg, covering it with the noodles after removing from the heat.  This had excellent flavor and with half of the salt, I did not feel like my blood pressure would be so imperiled as I had used the whole soup packet.  I like and regularly consume very spicy food (I frequently consume 4-5 jalapenos with a meal) but as prepared it was quite delicious and spicy enough.<br />  There are other brands of noodles that I frequently buy from Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BCE97K">Annie Chun's Korean Sweet Chili Noodle Bowl, 8.4-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a> that I relish but the salt is still high and the price is somewhat higher.  I will alternate varieties in the future.  I only eat Asian Noodles no more than once a week since I do have some sodium issues.<br />  I am on disability and do not get out often from my house in the country so I have tried many of the long shelf life foods that Amazon sells.  They sell many dehydrated vegetables in medium sized quantities that make them easy to have on hand and still be way cheaper than grocery store prices.  I even found some non refrigerated tofu <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTY7Y">Mori-Nu Tofu, Lite, Silken, Firm, 12.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> that I have received but not yet tried.  The customer reviews claim that it is excellent quality and it is actually cheaper than the fresh brand offered in the local grocery.  I expect to add some to my next bowl of noodles and the soups that I frequently make from scratch.

I tried them with egg earlier tonight after reading one of the other reviews on amazon, and it was amazing! Highly recommended for people who love spicy food, but also recommended for those (like me) who don't... just add half the seasoning packet!

If you're not good with spicy food then I would not recommend this ramyun because you will be sweating like pig!  If you love spicy food and if you love ramyun then this your best bet.  Won't regret it!

review/summary: Filling noodles and flexible (no pun intended)
review/text: These noodles are quite spicy and a big bowl of food.  They are, however, a very flexible base for simple meals.  You can control the spiciness (and sodium level) by how much of the seasoning packet you put in and you can add cooked meats and other vegetables to the soup to make variety.  I've found that poaching an egg or two in the soup is very tasty, as well.  Far superior quality of noodle to most grocery store brands.

THE ONLY difference is the spices - oh wait I can buy the same spice for one dollar a jar from McCormic.  Anyway the food is fine - but at over one dollar a pouch - it is FAR from worth it.  Go to Walmart of the local grocery store and buy the ones for one tenth the price.

review/summary: Beware, not the same as the one from the Korean Market
review/text: Just receive the noodle and try one.  The package looks similar but not the same as the one that I got from the Korean market.  I just finish the box of Shin noodle that I bought from Korean town so I know the differences right away.  I thought I got a good deal and save a trip to Korean town.  Guess not, I am wrong.  I am going to the Korean town this weekend to get the real stuff.  A little disappointed, I really want my authentic spicy red Korean Shin instant noodle tonight...<br /><br />This Shin noodle is made in the USA and it is a American version of the very popular Korean instant noodle.  This American version is only one-third as spicy and the noodle get soft and mushy very fast like the regular instant noodle.  The dry vegetable package does not go soft even after 10 minutes.  To use the dry vegs in the future, need to soak it for at least 30 minutes so the dry mushroom will get soft. The spice package is orange color, the real Korean Shin noodle is bright red in color and the noodle will not get mushy after 10 minutes.  I think it is something to do with the red pepper that the Korean use and not the picante in this USA version.  It is spicy but taste totally different than the Korean kind of red pepper which make it so special.<br /><br />Really want to return it but since I got it with the lightning deal discount, I will eat it like regular instant noodle to save the hazzle.  So beware if anyone reading this is Korean or have tried the real Korean Shin instant noodle.  This is not the real thing, do not order this and do not pay full price for this American version of the Shin noodle.  Before I was skeptical when reading some of the reviews with only 1 star, now I know they are right.

review/summary: I'm sold on the taste but not all the hype.
review/text: I ordered these noodles after reading stellar reviews.  Some folks in the reviews almost acted as if these noodles were sent from God.  I've eaten Ramen Noodles for quite some time and have found them to be a super inexpensive meal at .10 a package and sometimes cheaper.  I also like other readers mentioned don't always use the entire seasoning packet because of the high sodium content.  I found these noodles to have even higher sodium content.  Which I guess isn't too bad if you don't plan on eating the soup.<br />These noodles to me tasted just about the same as Ramen Noodles except the noodles were a tid bit larger in size.  If we are reviewing just the flavor packet, I would say it was pretty good.  Especially for those who like spice like myself.  I am use to eating super spicy foods and have a high tolerance to spice.  So they were right on par with what I am use to as far as the heat goes.  But I can see someone who doesn't eat spicy foods to find the seasoning super hot and spicy for them.  I like the idea of the dehydrated veggies that are enclosed to accompany the seasoning.  I am giving these noodles 3 stars because they are just overpriced Ramen in my opinion.  Plus the sodium content in the noodles is just unacceptable.  They surely can come up with lower sodium options. And lastly I give it 3 stars because of the price.  I would not expect to pay more than .50 cents a package for these noodles in a retail store. I would definitely buy these again but not in bulk.

review/summary: These are ok...
review/text: I love ramen type soups.  I've tried many over the years.  This Gourmet Spicy Picante is ok. The noodles are your regular, fried ramen...a tad thicker then common grocery store noodles.  One trick I use is after cooking the noodles, I rinse with water well...it takes that starchy flavor away that I don't care for and makes a fresher tasting soup.  The heat of this is strong, use a quarter packet to start, you can always build up.  Not much more flavor going on except the heat of the chili.<br /><br />I do love the Hoo Roo Rook noodles; they aren't fried and the noodles are round to fit your saucepan.  They aren't in the same heat category as these noodles, but they are nice for a more 'tender' palate that likes things not-so-spicy.<br /><br />*NEWSFLASH*  Okay, I'm coming to the end of this box of Spicy Picante and realized that I would sort of miss having my mouth burning while eating soup this winter...so on that note, I just may buy this noodle again -- it's a heat that kind of grows on you.  I did order the spicy seafood flavor and will see how that one goes.  All in all, this is an acquired hotness that takes getting used to if you're not used to heat (like me).

review/text: I purchased several different Korean Noodle Soups but I prefer this "Bag" version of this soup over the "Big Bowl" version. The product is a great soup with much flavor, a nice spicy hot taste and lots of noodles. I modify the soup a little by adding some cut-up pieces of 3 or 4 green onions and some cut-up pieces of roasted chicken breast "after" making the soup to make it higher in protein. I usually have this and other Korean soups every day for a great "power lunch". Love this soup, fast and easy to make in a pot or by pre-heating the water in a microwave and then pouring it over the dry soup in a bowl.

review/text: Although admittedly not very healthy, having tons of sodium and MSG, it is delicious, quick to prepare and cheap. Just throw a bit of everything in the pot when you make it. You can boil dumplings with it. You can throw in any type of meat with it. You can add in beaten eggs for a different soup texture, or just crack an egg right into the soup before or after cooking depending on how cooked you want your egg to be. Add milk to the soup if you want a more milky flavour. Add a few slices of cheese on top after it's prepared and enjoy the melted cheesy deliciousness. You can also add literally any type of vegetable you can think of. If you're not feeling like having noodles with that soup base you can use the noodles with your own broth or make fried noodles. Then you can save the soup base for seasoning any future dishes you make.<br /><br />These noodles make for some really flexible meals when you're tight on time or ingredients. I wouldn't be alive without them!

review/text: After seeing these hyped up over and over again as the "best" ramyun noodles, I had to try them. Verdict after two boxes? They're OK.<br /><br />Every review on here is how flavorful and SPICY these are. Well, they do taste pretty good. Do they taste that much better than the 10 cent ramyun at the local grocery store? To my taste, they don't. I will concede they are slightly better and certainly more filling.<br /><br />As far as spicy.. I'm so confused on this. Every review says to use half a packet as these will burn your mouth off. So needless to say, I was expecting HEAT! These aren't spicy at all. To give you a frame of reference, I'm usually sweating after eating "hot" wings at Applebees. If you've ever gone to Buffalo Wild Wings, I have a difficult time eating the "Asian Zing" wings. I can't tolerate heat very well. However, I have a pretty mild burn going on in my mouth after eating a bowl with full spice, and it's not unpleasant enough to warrant a drink.<br /><br />So, all in all, not bad noodles. Don't think I'd ever pay $20 for them again, though.

review/text: This is the best ramen that I've had and it's the kind my family has been eating for years. It is definitely more spicy than other types of ramen out there but it is so good and you can always add less seasoning if you don't want to have it as spicy. It's really quick and easy to prepare and it's perfect for college students because you can eat it on its own or add more ingredients (like eggs) that you want to dress it up.
