review/summary: Warning - contains Soy
review/text: For those who are looking to avoid soy, this product contains soy lecithin which is not listed in the product ingredients in the Amazon description.  The candy packaging does not indicate "organic non-GMO soy" so it likely derives from (as does most soy) genetically modified sources. Soy lecithin is a waste product created when crude soybean oil is "degummed". After some searching, found some outstanding chocolate with no soy lecithin - Alter Eco.  This chocolate has a variety of flavors - midnight crunch with quinoa, dark chocolate mint, cacao, etc .  I have tried all three and they are excellent.  I do not think they have a coconut - which is why I bought the Oskri.  Alter Eco is USDA organic, fair trade, vegan, gluten free, soy and GMO free, no chemicals at all, no emulsifies.  Very good - should not be this hard to find food that is pure, simple and has no nasty additives.  Oh,before I read the fine print on the wrapper, I did try this, good flavor, fairly tough and chewy consistency but not bad flavor.

review/summary: lots of sweetness with no sugar
review/text: I bought this when I realized that Splenda contained enough "filler" sugar that it was wrecking my diet. The liquid forms worked great, but I needed something to sweeten a gallon of iced tea at a time, and counting out that many drops sounded miserable.<br /><br />This stuff works great! I use 1/8 tsp. plus 1/64 tsp. (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MOYI5W">Amco Measuring Spoons for Small Amounts</a> are great for this purpose) to sweeten a gallon of tea, and it's as sweet as a heaping cup of granular splenda (or sugar). I see more of it in my future.

review/summary: nice idea but WEAK!
review/text: First, I'll give the manufacturer some credit for making a no-additive, sucralose-only product. The problem with this product is: it's just too weak, in flavor that is. 1 gram of this "pure sucralose" tastes about as strong as 1 gram of a Splenda packet, for comparison.<br />If you don't mind spending a lot for a little bit of pure sucralose taste, then maybe this is for you, but cost-conscious customers might want to look elsewhere for a no-carb, non-calorie sweetener.

review/text: Probably the next best thing to fresh organic peaches are these canned ones.  They're not overly sweet but have a nice natural fruit sweetness.  We try to go organic as much as possible for our kids and they really enjoy these peaches.  Plus since they're not overly sweet, we don't worry as much about them being overloaded with sugar.  Very good quality and we will keep buying these for our family.

review/summary: Complex, strong and spicy
review/text: A little education in Ayurveda - In Ayurvedic principles, the Kapha 'element' is said to be similar to clay (elements of water and earth). It helps to hold our constitution together and provides structure, fluid balance, endurance and strength. It is the slow, stable, calming, sweet and cold aspect of the self and governs our resistance to disease and promotes self healing.<br /><br />An imbalance in kapha leads to respiratory illnesses, excess cough/cold symptoms, weight gain, general feeling of laziness/heaviness.<br /><br />Kapha tea is an excellent antidote to a kapha imbalance - the tea itself is spicy and invigorating with strong notes of cardamom, ginger followed by cinnamon and lemon verbena.  It's spicy, complex and my new favorite!  I ordered a bodum tea press so I can brew this tea at work.

review/summary: choking hazard
review/text: I purchased a bag of the blueberry & apple tiny fruits excited to try something different for my 9 month old child. Seeing that the product said that it was for ages 6 months, I thought it would be o.k. since my child is well passed that age, eats finger foods and is crawling. Unfortunately, the blueberries do not easily dissolve in the mouth. This product is a choking hazard. The company's mission is good. Hopefully they will be able to fix this issue.

review/text: My 10 month old twins LOVE these tiny dried fruits!  I love that they are organic!!  We've had the strawberry mix, the apple and the blueberry mix and they love all of them, but are particularly fond of the blueberries mixed in.  They pick out the blueberries before eating the rest.  These are freeze dried so they aren't gummy, but if you leave them out on a tray they will get gummier over time (maybe the moisture from the air?)  My twins didn't have a problem chewing them, but they've both had a lot of teeth for a while now.  One had 8 teeth at 7 months, the other had 6 teeth at the same time.  We started eating these at about 8 months old.  They have never choked on these (where they have with mum mum's and other types of crackers)

My only problem is wanting to eat them before I give them to my daughter.  They are not messy and are the perfect size for little fingers.  The fruit melts very quickly in my daughters mouth and is so easy for her to eat.  All the flavors are excellent but this is our favorite.  Both the blueberries and apples taste fresh and sweet but with no added sweetener.  Great job designing a healthy snack for young children.

I was looking for organic freeze dried fruit for my daughter and just couldn't find anything that wasn't overly crunchy and hard to chew or that didn't get stuck to my daughters teeth when she ate it. Then I found the Little Duck products, the answer to all my freeze dried fruit problems. All 3 Little Duck flavors are so good. I usually share a bag with my daughter! They are the perfect snack for outings when fresh fruit is not an option to bring along. Way to go Little Duck Organics...I recommend your products to all my friends!!!!

I don't have to worry about added chemicals, too much sugar, or other things found in baby/ toddler snacks.  Even I love them!!  Just make sure to close the bag because any moisture softens them up (still good, but they get sticky!)

review/text: I am so done purchasing ANY and ALL other fruit snacks for my 3 and 1 year old now that I have found Little Ducks ! I was given a bag from my friend Stephen in NC.  He told me that they were the BEST snack nutritionally and financially for my little babes.  I opened the bag and started sampling them myself.  I wanted to taste what I would be feeding my children.  Before I knew it,  I had eaten HALF the bag myself !!!  I got myself composed and feed them to my two little ones.  They both handled the tiny snacks into their mouths, and soon the bag was COMPLETELY  empty !  Let me just say,  WE love them.  So glad to see we can purchase them on line for easy and convenience.  They will remain a staple in my home.  We eat them straight out of the bag, put them on organic yogurt, and also mix them in our oatmeal and cream of wheat.  Great product for EVERYONE to enjoy!!

review/summary: Great blend, even if you don't usually like the "Starbucks" style brews
review/text: I must admit I'm not a fan of the brewed coffee at Starbucks. It has a one-note taste to me, and that taste is: Burnt. I'm not even a fan of most of their beans. There are only two blends they sell that I love: The Christmas Blend (a little different every year, but always good) and this one. It doesn't have that heavy, dark, bitter signature Starbucks taste, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll be disappointed. It's mild and bright, which is just what I want when I go down to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005IBX9">Cuisinart Brew Central</a> at 6 AM for a cup. Because of this blend's mildness, I always add an extra tablespoon or two to the pot, to make the flavor a little richer. It's not necessary, but I think it improves the taste.<br /><br />Incidentally, darker roasts do not have more caffeine, even if psychologically they seem to have a bigger "kick." This blend may be easy to drink, but it's got plenty of punch in the caffeine department -- my definition of a "good morning"!

review/text: Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar make the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 "The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames."<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available. With German reunification, it is easier to get this great marzipan again. Highly recommended!

What a fantastic flavor!  The Latte is 2 WW points and the Dark hot chocolate is 1 WW point.  I can even use the highest water option and I still get a rich full taste.<br /><br />If you are looking for an alternative to coffee, this will not disappoint!<br /><br />The only way I could be happier this Holiday Season if Amazon started carrying this product with Prime shipping!

If you don't run a cup of plain water through the Keurig after every hot chocolate usage, you will clog up the spout/needle and the machine stops working.  If you do that consistently, you should have no problem.  I had to troubleshout this with the Keurig people over the phone.<br /><br />Ellie

review/summary: Not such a dragon
review/text: We've purchased dragonwell green tea from other vendors and the quality has been much better.  Of course we paid quite a bit more for it as well.  This just goes to prove "you get what you pay for". This bag has a lot of stems and other debris, so would not recommend.  Pay the higher price and get the better quality tea.

review/text: I have been trying different types of green tea to find one that is not too overpowering and where i can still reap the benefits of drinking green tea.  this one is it.  i put a packet of splenda in the equivalent of 2 1/2 cups of tea and even when i steep for up to 30 minutes (i get sidetracked when getting ready for work in the mornings) it is great, much more tolerable and less viscus than sencha.  i think i could even drink this one with no sweetener added.

review/summary: Magic in a bottle
review/text: Having bought various types of vinegars hoping to find the right one but never did until now.  My local hyper market sells various brands of balsamic but some have a heft price tag, the more aged typically the more it cost.  Honestly have bought some cheap ones but got a glorified bottle of plain vinegar or was un-naturally sweet.  Made a pot of my homemade(from scratch)pasta sauce, while it's also been really good 2 tsp of Alessi made it great.  Can't believe the taste it gives to a tomatoe based sauce, was eating by the spoonfuls before adding to the pasta.  Wanting to experiment some more, I have been wanting to make some roasted red pepper remoulade to jazz up a BLT or Roast Beef sandwhich.  This was the key ingredient even more so than the roasted red peppers.  The balsamic cut the fatty taste of the mayo(not a fan of may alone except potato/pasta salad)and added an interesting sweetness but not like sugar.  Ate couple spoons of that as well.  Not to worry I am not a double dipper even in my own house.  I think this will wake up a roast beef gravy and who knows what else.  Now I know what to buy and can also afford.

review/summary: Rich and delicious
review/text: Finding high-quality decaffeinated teas in a variety of flavors was something of a chore during my pregnancy so, naturally, I was thrilled to find this winner.<br /><br />I've tried many vanilla teas, both decaffeinated and caffeinated, and it's often hard to find one with a really high-quality vanilla flavor.  This tea succeeds on all counts.  The vanilla is rich and aromatic.  Immediately upon opening the tin, the superior quality of the vanilla becomes apparent in the delicious odor.  Once brewed, this is a very rich cup that benefits from the addition of just a touch of honey or sugar to really enhance the sweetness of the vanilla.  It's delectable.  This is one tea that's worth every penny.

review/text: Harney & Sons Paris tea is what first got me hooked on tea, so I thought I would try a couple of their other flavors.  This one is pretty delicious. I'm not sure how, but the vanilla flavor somehow makes the tea taste thicker.  I know that sounds weird, and maybe not super delicious to some of you, but I mean it in a good way. :)  I guess it makes it taste more luxurious...like the consistency of good hot cocoa.

Hands down the best tea I've ever tasted. I like mine with a pinch of sugar or honey and cream. Just wish it was cheaper on Amazon, I get it at Woodman's Market for $5, every time, no price fluctuation like Amazon.

review/text: Just read the previous review which stated that Quaker was using high fructose corn syrup to sweeten the cake.  Maybe this was true at the time they wrote their review but as I have the pack in front of me, the label states "sugar" followed by "fructose" so there is no corn syrup to be found in these tasty snacks.  As someone with a sweet tooth who admittedly loves to snack, these are a godsend!  Definitely give them a try :)

review/summary: not too bad
review/text: If you're accustomed to a typical American diet of sugar and salt and grease, you're first impression might be that these rice cakes taste like packing peanuts. And that might be your second impression, too.<br /><br />However, once you put a few miles between yourself and the typical "goo and glue" diet, you may grow to like these rice cakes. The caramel flavor is my favorite, but the apple cinnamon isn't too bad either. They're good snacks and they're fairly healthy and they're good for your body and digestive system.<br /><br />To my horror, I see that they're sweetened with high fructose corn-syrup which is mighty disappointing. I'd think that the demographic type that's interested in eating rice cakes is also going to be the demographic type that's sophisticated enough to read labels and sophisticated enough to know that HFCS is a dirty word and an unhealthy sweetener.<br /><br />I wish these mega-monster corporations would go back to SUGAR and just add the 1/10th of a penny cost to the retail price. It'd be worth it to me and others, who struggle to keep their weight "normal."

The three wafers per piece are thick and crunchy rather than lightweight and paper-thin. In addition, the filling is scant and dry. The wafers lose their crispness very quickly when exposed to air, so must be eaten immediately upon opening. Given that these wafers have ingredients similar to those of the Manner competitor, they are overpriced and inferior in taste and texture. Other household members don't like them either, so I will have to give them away. Will not buy again.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best.  It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol.  But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects.  If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar.  If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste.  Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste.  If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste.  This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar.  You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia.  It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter.  You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it, in spite of their "100% satisfaction guarantee". I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.<br /><br />Also:  It is a bit misleading that they call this particular item "powdered".  Regular powdered sugar is pulverized and has cornstarch added to give it that silky feel, as well as calcium phosphate to improve its flowing ability.  What they mean here, though, is that it is a much finer grain than their regular erythritol.  It is still a grain, however.  I buy it because it dissolves faster than the larger crystals, but both are good products.

review/summary: A perfect, natural sugar substitute
review/text: Now Foods' erythritol is a sugar substitute made from corn. By fermenting the corn's sugars, the manufacturer produces a naturally-occurring sugar alcohol product. Sugar alcohols taste exactly like sugar, but without the calories and blood sugar spike. And they are alcohols in chemistry terms only, not to be confused with the kind of alcohol one finds in adult beverages.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Tastes just like sugar and has no unpleasant aftertastes, unlike stevia.<br /><br />* Has a glycemic index of zero. Great for diabetics or those simply wishing to eliminate excess sugar from their diets.<br /><br />* Contains virtually no calories.<br /><br />* Made by a manufacturer committed to a wide range of sweeteners and food products, so the company is experienced and trusted in its field.<br /><br />* Erythritol occurs naturally in many foods. The FDA recognizes it as a viable and safe sugar substitute. Erythritol-based sweeteners have been on the market in other countries for years.<br /><br />* Unlike some other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, it will not cause gas if consumed in large amounts.<br /><br />* Not only does erythritol not promote tooth decay, it actually prevents it, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />* Can be used in baking.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Not quite as sweet as sugar. You need about a quarter to a third more erythritol by volume for an equivalent.<br /><br />* Though it tastes exactly like sugar, erythritol has a slight, mint-like, cooling effect on the tongue. In foods where that effect would be undesirable, erythritol would need to be combined with another sweetener to diminish the effect. (This effect seems to vary from person to person, too.)<br /><br />* In some clear liquids such as tea, adding erythritol will initially cloud the liquid, though the cloudiness fades quickly. (That issue probably comes from the release of oxygen bubbles as the product dissolves.)<br /><br />* Though it dissolves, erythritol does not do so as rapidly as sugar. It will retain its granularity in some foods. (Some people recommended powdering it to compensate.)<br /><br />* Because it involves more steps to make than corn syrup or sugar, this is not a cheap product. Perhaps in the future, economies of scale will drive the price down.<br /><br />Many companies are discovering the benefits of erythritol as a natural sugar substitute that lacks the nagging questions that dog artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame. Now Foods' erythritol is one of the best values in this natural sweetener on the market, available at a much lower price point than some competitors' products. Though not cheap compared with sugar or some artificial sweeteners, as a healthy alternative, it more than makes up for its higher cost.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.

review/summary: Really Good Sugar Substitute - Highly Recommended!
review/text: "Erythritol" has become our sugar substitute of choice since I became diabetic a few months ago. In crystal form, it seems about 70% as sweet as regular sugar. My wife uses a little bit of added sugar to bring the sweetness up for the rest of the family in things that need it, but I am happy with it as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in most things.<br /><br />I have not noticed any glycemic impact to my blood sugar or "laxative" effects seen with other sugar alcohol sweeteners (which is a very important consideration :-)<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great product!  From corn, not birch
review/text: Erythritol tastes like sugar, just like xylitol.  It is not, however, toxic to pets as xylitol is.  Also, it does not have the gastrointestinal effects (bloating, gas, etc.) that can come with intake of large quantities, as is the case with xylitol.  Both are quite safe for people, however.  Dogs cannot eat chocolate, either, due to toxicity, so xylitol is just another thing that works for us but not for them.  But erythritol is safe for both people and animals.<br /><br />The downside to erythritol is that it costs more than xylitol and is only 70% as sweet as sugar, whereas xylitol is closer to being the same sweetness as sugar.<br /><br />I haven't had much luck baking with either of them -- but maybe others have had different experiences.<br /><br />Both xylitol and erythritol taste great - I can't tell them from sugar.  Stevia is also a healthy sugar alternative, but it definitely has a taste -- not pleasant in large amounts (bitter).<br /><br />Not all brands of xylitol and erythritol are equal.  Many come from birch trees which often is extracted using sulfuric acid.  The ones from NOW Foods are from corn, which does not require sulfuric acid.<br /><br />This is a good company and I have been very happy with them.  On the other hand, I did not have a good experience with Emerald Forest's products or customer service.  Their products come from birch trees and have a very unpleasant odor.  I much preferred the products from this company - they taste great and don't really have an odor.

review/summary: Great but Grainy
review/text: After using erythritol in several recipes I've found that it tastes far better than alternate sweeteners like Splenda.  It is a little less sweet than sugar or Splenda so you might have to add a bit more to get the same taste.  The only problem with erythritol is that it doesn't break down easily in frostings or recipes that don't require some amount of cooking or baking.  I've found running it through a blender to break it down into a powder or mixing it with warm water before mixing it in removes the grainy texture and makes the erythritol easier to work with.

review/summary: Just wish it were cheaper
review/text: Since switching to a low carb diet, Erythritol and Xylitol have become my friends.  Each has its own pros and cons, so I mix them.  Erythritol doesn't cause as much gas, but it leaves a cool sensation in the mouth which can be distracting.  Xylitol is good for your teeth, but may make some people feel like the Hindenburg.  Both taste sweet and don't leave an aftertaste.  So I figure the best bet is to buy a bag of each and mix them together.  Note that both these products are small crystals which do not dissolve very easily in liquid.  The best way around this is to pulverize them with a coffee grinder.  Just a few seconds will break up the crystals into a powder which will dissolve just fine.

review/summary: Not a good flavor, Xylitol is much better
review/text: I'm giving this three stars because it's so low in calories and doesn't cause gastrointestinal effects. It worked fine when I made my own mint chocolate with unsweetened chocolate and mint extract. That tasted good. But, it was terrible when I made chocolate biscotti (Xylitol works fine). I had to throw the big batch away. It has a strong "cotton candy" aftertaste.<br /><br />The gastrointestinal effects of Xylitol can be mostly overcome by gradually increasing the amount you eat over time. It tastes much better than Erythritol. But, as I mentioned, you can make a very interesting bitter mint chocolate with it. The erythritol doesn't dissolve so at first the taste is very bitter not sweet chocolate. Then, as the erythritol dissolves in your mouth, you get a burst of sweetness and cooling effect. The cooling effect of the erythritol is so powerful that is enhances the mint. The chocolate overcomes the "cotton candy" aftertaste if you don't use too much erythritol.

review/summary: Overhyped and rather tasteless
review/text: I decided to purchase this product based on a blog by one of the<br />supplement oriented doctors on the internet, hyping erythritol as<br />superior to xylitol, which I use regularly and find the closest<br />to sugar in taste with almost no aftertaste and no side effects<br />to my knowledge.  The problem I find with erythritol is its lack<br />of flavor.  On cereal, I barely notice any real sweetness, even<br />when I put as much as a tablespoon and a half on a normal size<br />bowl.  When I use Ideal, the name of the xylitol brand I use, it<br />has the same sweetness as sugar in the same proportion.  Don't get<br />me wrong, erythritol isn't unpleasant, it just has very little<br />sweetness relative to how much you use.  Not worth the price unless<br />you want just a hint of sweetness compared to what you get with<br />sugar or xylitol.

To my taste, it is about a half as sweet as sugar so it takes more but I've detected no digestive upset whatsoever, which is not true for many other sugar substitutes.

review/text: Well, I'll begin by saying that I was really looking forward to this product. I tried TruVia's erythritol/stevia sweetener when I ran out of the stevia sweetener that I used before and wanted to get something instead of plain sugar. I figured that I liked the mix and wanted to try this powder because I had already ordered stevia from amazon. When it got here I used it right away, and did not taste the difference. I was very conservative in adding this to my coffee because I didnt know how sweet it was. After adding 3 large spoonfuls into my coffee I gave up, and I usually add 1 spoonful of sugar to my cup. if you want a sugar free sweetener that you can even make at home, get stevia. I have used it from local health food stores and always ended up with that funny aftertaste from stevia. the one I ordered from amazon, sweetleaf vanilla creme didnt have that aftertaste, and I used 12 drops in my coffee looking for it, typically I only use 4 drops in my coffee.

review/text: I don't eat gluten-free, and everyone who knows me raves about my baked goods; in fact, I have a small, custom order baking business.  I first tried this brownie mix when I was planning my Christmas gift baking last year and a cousin announced she had to eat gluten free. I was hesitant to invest in a lot of expensive ingredients I might or might not use again, so I purchased a box of this brownie mix, then tried to think of ways of how to doctor it up and make it into something that I hoped would be special.<br /><br />I came up with an idea, shipped the brownies off to her, and waited to hear if they were any good.  (I warned her that it was my first experiment in gluten free baking.)  Well, let me tell you...that grown woman went through the entire batch of brownies in under two days - they were a hit!<br /><br />I tried another recipe this week for her birthday, which is today, and the results are just in:  in her words, "You hit it out of the park with these!"  Happily, my reputation as a fabulous baker now extends into the gluten-free realm...with a little help from Arrowhead Mills!<br /><br />Here are two ideas to get you started:<br /><br />#1 - Get a box of this brownie mix, and also a box of the Arrowhead Mills chocolate chip cookie mix.  Prepare each mix according to the directions on the boxes.  Place little mounds of the cookie dough randomly in a 9 X 13 pan, then spoon the brownie mixture around the mounds to fill in the empty spaces.  Bake.<br /><br />#2 - Prepare brownie mix according to directions and pour into a 9 X 13 pan.  In a separate bowl, mix 8 oz. of cream cheese, one egg, and a tsp. of vanilla.  Drop dollops of the cream cheese batter onto the brownie mix; run a knife or spatula through to give a swirled, marble effect. Bake.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying this again; I have a lot more recipe ideas I want to try out on her, and may even offer fancy gluten free brownie creations to my customers.

review/summary: Great gluten-free brownies!
review/text: I just went GF about three months ago and I am slowly researching different mixes to find what I like best.  This happened to be the first mix we picked up at Whole Foods, and my husband (who is not GF) loved them just as much as I did.  These brownies were easy to mix and very tasty.  After trying other GF brownie mixes, I found that this is one of the few mixes that actually comes out "fudgy" (which we both love)... while other mixes, like Bob's Red Mill, are more cake-like.  I definitely recommend this mix!

review/summary: Yummy GF brownie mix that I'd pick over wheat varieties any day!
review/text: My husband has Celiac disease, so we try lots of products.  We found this mix recently and loved it.  I added a few extra chocolate chips.  My kids had no clue it was GF, and I didn't feel the need to make a second pan of "regular" wheat based brownies.  As with most GF bread products, don't over cook.  We like these better than Betty Crocker, which are kind of sugary/grainy, though still pretty tasty.  We also like them better than Pamela's (though I liked Pamela's fine, personally...my hubby was indifferent, and he's got to eat the stuff.)

review/summary: Love them!!!
review/text: My son is on a GFCF diet and LOVES these brownies.  I also enjoy them.  They taste almost as good as regular brownies, but are safe for him to eat.  It is wonderful to be able to easily prepare treats for him that he loves.  They are very easy to prepare and bake nicely.  I typically prepare the entire package, and freeze some for a later date.

review/summary: Tasty Brownies
review/text: I picked these up because my wife is trying (sort of) to eat gluten-free.  She loves these brownies, and I have to admit that they are pretty good.  Maybe not quite as good as "real" brownies, but still pretty good.

review/summary: The BEST Brownies
review/text: These are the best gluten free brownies. They are the only ones my daughter will eat. I have tried many but these are like the real thing. She even wants to eat the batter. They are easy to make, moist and taste great. Even her friends eat them. I had to order them online because I am unable to find them anywhere and these are the only ones she likes!

review/summary: Frog Flavor
review/text: A friend recently got me hooked on these gummy frogs. I was curious about the flavor so I e-mailed Haribo directly! They did reply... The green gummy is apple, and the white marshmallow is passion fruit. The price here is great too!

review/summary: A Bag As Big As Your Head
review/text: You know, I had wondered when clicking through to this product from Haribo's website -- just how big is a 5 pound bag of Gummibaerchen?  Well, it's about as big as an adult human head.  Big! And heavy!  (And buying two gets you free shipping!)  The only better bulk price one can get (that I'm aware of) is at the Haribo factory in Bonn, Germany (and if you like Gummibaerchen, I suggest you visit).<br /><br />As for the candies themselves, Frogs are not my favorite.  An entire bag of them yields no variety at all.  If Amazon starts selling the classic bears (which are a multitude of flavors and are smaller and easier to chew up) I would buy those over Frogs in a hot second.  (The sugar-free kind are not the classic version, and some people have digestive problems with the artificial sweetener. NB this is not the case with Frogs - they are sugar-sweetened.)<br /><br />A note about the Haribo "catchphrase": the German "Haribo macht Kinder froh und Erwachsene ebenso" is better translated "Haribo makes kids happy / and adults likewise".  So, "The happy world of Haribo" is just a rhyming addition to English-language packaging.  INFORMED.
