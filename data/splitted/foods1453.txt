review/summary: If it looks good, is it good for the cats?
review/text: My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term "all about tuna fish".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.

review/summary: Tempted to eat them myself!
review/text: This is quite a unique brand of cat food. Their tagline is "People food for cats" and they are quite right. They smell and look delicious.<br /><br />There are basically two types of canned cat food in my experience, the first kind is the solid kind where you tip the can into the plate and the food retains the shape of the can. The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate. For me this second type is preferable because it has a higher content of liquid which I consider to be healthier for the cats urinary system. This cat food is of this second type.<br /><br />My cat is a very finicky eater and he takes time to adjust to new foods.<br />This package contains two flavors; the first is chicken pot pie which looks just like real chicken pot pie, right down to the light gravy, there are cubes of real chicken breast and it really looks like pot pie. My cat laps up all the sauce then moves on to the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Second flavor is sesame chicken: This smells really good and the chicken is not chunked but in thin strips. My cat loves the sauce and will drain it all dry but is not too fond of the chicken. He will probably adjust to it over time. This is why only four stars.

review/text: Well, it's difficult to review something like this coz after all, I didn't eat any of it.  But I have three judges at home and as it stands, it's two to one on this food.  One cat likes it and the other wants nothing to do with it.  The dog loves it though!<br />It comes in those little tin cans like Fancy Feast, and you get an decent enough amount I suppose.  It seems a tad pricey, but that's for you to decide.<br />So there you have it-Approved by one dog and one cat.  But bear in mind the third cat is a VERY picky eater.

review/summary: Not a hit with both cats, but blame them not the food!
review/text: One of my cats who eats everything loved this food. The other more picky one, not so much.<br />My cats are old though, and weren't raised in this era of healthy cat food, and most of the time wont touch the stuff. So I was happy that at least one of them liked it.<br />I like how all the ingredients are fresh and how there are only a few; not a list 30 things, where half of the words are unpronounceable. The food doesn't smell as bad as most cat food, the kind where as soon as you open it wafts through the house. It also has fresh chunks of chicken and fresh corn and carrots. The gravy in it is very watery and not thick like most cat foods, so it spilled everywhere the first time i opened it. Since then it hasn't, because I haven been more careful.<br />I wish both of my cats liked this food because I know it is so much better for them than what they do like! But I give much kudos to Petit Cuisine on making healthy food for cats.

review/summary: It's a 100% HIT!!!
review/text: This food looks and smells DELICIOUS, even to mom's vegetarian nose! Frankly, most canned cat food makes mom heave and gag, especially when it's heated for a sickie, so she's actually looking forward to having to nuke some of this.<br /><br />She started with our picky eater, who, not coincidentally, hasn't been here very long and who's never eaten canned food since he's been here, no matter what flavor it was. It took him a minute, but he, too, enjoyed it. The rest of the herd came flying into the kitchen, even the deafie!! The baby with cerebral palsy got so excited she forgot to remove her toes and tail from the door of the feeding cage, did a flip, and almost took a header to the floor.<br /><br />THANKS Petite Cuisine!!<br />Love, the special critters

review/summary: Five out of six cats say "Yummy!"
review/text: Both entrees were popular at my house, with all my furkids except "Mr. Picky!"  This product line should also be popular with humans, because it has a pleasant odor, and it looks like "people food," as the box says.  If you're concerned about issues such as "gluten free," it's that, too.<br /><br />I did feel that the "Chicken Pot Pie Entree" had a lot of liquid in proportion to the amount of solids, especially for the price.  About half the can is broth.  Kitties who prefer minced meals would probably not like this.

review/text: My cats seem to enjoy this food as much as their erstwhile favorite, Wellness wet food.  They are pretty fussy so I am pleased.  I also like the fact that the the ingredients seem to be nourishing (no by-products) although since some reviewers have mentioned a possibly dangerous ingredient, I think I will do a little more research before ordering this again.

review/summary: Great Ingredients...If Only They Would Eat It....
review/text: I had a whole case of this to try, so thought it would be fun to try it on as many cats as possible. Thus, by recruiting 5 friends, we ended up trying Petite Cuisine chicken cat food on 13 cats--7 males & 6 females; 4 inside cats, 5 outside & 4 inside/outside. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food--namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.<br /><br />I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat--a 2 year old male--ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male--a 16 pound inside/outside orange tabby--would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the broth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of broth, which I think is brilliant, since all the cats I know always like the broth of canned cat food or tuna best.<br /><br />I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked. It has great ingredients and smells like human food. I hope to try Petite Cuisine seafood catfood one day...I think they all might like that much better.

My cat eats dry food and this is a treat for her.<br />It is expensive though. It seems like a very high quality food for cats.<br />I would recommend this to someone whose cat is very fussy.

review/summary: People Food For Cats!
review/text: They aren't kidding! The albacore smells better than people food! My cats LOVE this cat food, and it is gluten free, so there is no worries about our cats getting poisoned! Great stuff! I'll likely be buying this cat food instead of their regular brand, especially for treats. If your cat likes a lot of sauce, there is plenty of it here, and it's not just water. If you want to give your cats a healthy canned food, this is the best one by far that I've fed them... Better than even the high-end fancy foods. The cans are small, but the nutrition is better than most cat foods. They even use yellow-fin tuna for the albacore! 1st rate cat food!

review/summary: sesame awesome and chicken pot water
review/text: The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the "chicken pot pie" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the brand ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up.

review/summary: 3 cats give 5 stars to 5 out of 6 flavors but  should I?
review/text: This review covers the two chicken flavors offered here as well as four fish flavors in the variety pack offered elsewhere on this site.  My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of "menadione sodium sulfite in pet food" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page.

review/summary: The Cat's Meow
review/text: All four of my cats loved this canned cat food!  The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.<br /><br />The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.<br /><br />I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends.

review/summary: Source of protein and hearty enough to serve as one meal
review/text: First of all, your cat should hopefully like fish-flavored foods, because obviously this variety pack is all seafood - yellowfin, snapper, tuna, and shrimp. And if your cat is picky about which fish he/she likes, you won't be breaking the bank by discarding the cans of the flavors he/she doesn't approve of. There is also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I">chicken variety pack</a> available by Petite Cuisine, which contains Chinese chicken and chicken pot pie dishes. Give that a try if your cat is simply a lover of all foods.<br /><br />The food actually could pose as human food if someone was unaware they were being served cat food. But do yourself a favor and just buy a can of tuna or whatever it is you like - leave the cat food to the cats. The dishes are quite moist with chunks of meat/fish and broth. They are a source of protein and are hearty enough to serve as one meal for a small cat. You may try adding dry food if one can isn't enough. Or simply use two cans and order more as necessary.

review/summary: Five Paw Salute !!
review/text: My selection, which contained 12 cans each of Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken, arrived quickly, and I looked forward to seeing how my kitties would like it.<br /><br />I liked the fact that:<br /><br />(1) Petite Cuisine has NO Wheat Gluten,<br /><br />and<br /><br />(2) it's made from "Human Grade" ingredients -- which means even I can eat it if I really wanted to -- and truth be told -- I DID sample a bit from each of those 2 selections -- and both selections tasted better than anything I have tasted when I buy a Brand Name can of canned chicken for myself.....<br /><br />But ok -- this Petite Cuisine is for my kitties, so let's see what THEY think of it:<br /><br />Well, I had no idea what to expect when I opened the first can --  Chicken Pot Pie (and word of caution -- open the "Chicken Pot Pie" can over the sink--there's alot of Broth inside and it sloshes out if you are not careful).<br /><br />However, Big Bad Baby Twinkle was standing behind me watching my every move, and once the top came off the can, her Supreme Largeness, BBBT, surprised me with several OCTAVES worth of Mew-sical praise for the tempting smell.<br /><br />Yes - I know you are supposed to mix new cat food with their old food, but I had no desire to mix this pristine, tasty, fresh diced chicken and veggies entree with any of their stinky canned stuff - so Big Bad Baby Twinkle and Sweet Cee Cee feasted on 1/2 can of "Chicken Pot Pie" each, along with the liquid broth. I waited for a reaction -- nothing untoward happened. They licked their chops and came after me for more of the same.<br /><br />Now, it has been noted that there is alot of "water" (Broth) in this can of Chicken pot Pie -- I am familiar with "Spot's Stew" and that brand also has alot of liquid in its can. I have no problem with this Chicken Pot Pie broth -- if anything, it helps to hydrate my kitties (cats, being descended from desert animals -- get most of their liquid from their food-- and as long as the sodium content of this broth is low, then they can slurp it to their hearts delight -- and they certainly did, as the dishes were licked clean)<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken, was less liquidy and looked very nice, shredded with its vegetables -- it had special smell, which actually was just the smell of Sesame Oil. But my cats inhaled this as greedily as they did the Chicken pot Pie. I was impressed that Sesame oil would be used (along with Soy oil) as an ingredient. I'm looking forward to seeing what these oils will eventually do to nourish (former abandoned, street-kitty, but thoroughly vetted) Cee Cee's somewhat dull coat. * * *<br /><br />And to top off the Petite Cuisine experience, each box comes with a coupon worth $2 -- $1 off when you buy a four-pack, or four cans of Petite Cuisine from the supermarket -- and another $1 coupon will be sent to you if you fill out your name and address on the first coupon before you present it to  the check out clerk.<br /><br />The only thing I take an issue with is the origin -- Thailand -- why not keep this "at home" and produce it in the USA?<br /><br />* * *UPDATE -- Dec 18 2008 -- Cee Cee's coat grew out a little more, is BEAUTIFUL and silky!! Since the only new thing in her life is this food, I can surmise that this diet of Petite Cuisine DID help flesh her out and beautify her fur (She is a former street-kitty, and has always been a little wan (although she goes to the vet regularly) since she was rescued and I brought her inside.)

The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back.

All the ingredients are "real" -- no meat by-products, wheat gluten, preservatives, dyes.  There is actually quite a bit of broth, which concerned me when I opened the first can because I thought the can was mostly water.  However, it's real broth and evidently pretty tasty, because my cats practically inhale it -- they love it!  Once they finish the broth, they start working on the chicken and always clear the whole plate.  I'll definitely buy more of this.

review/summary: Delicious, says my cat; messy, says I...
review/text: It's a cute idea to produce a cat food that is similar to people food, and Petite Cuisine seems to fill the nutrition needs of cats, if you can believe the label. However, the "in sauce" makes things a little messy, especially with the "Chicken Pot Pie" entree. There's so much sauce (aka gravy/water/whatever) that my cat would pull the pieces of food out onto the floor and slurp up the sauce afterward. There's just too much liquid in this cat food. The Sesame Chicken is a bit more solid.<br /><br />Whatever the consistency, my cat gave this product high stars, if licking up every morsel and drop is any indication. And I have to admit it smells pretty darn good, not like a lot of cat foods. (Of course, funky smells have never bothered my cat -- the more odorous the better, in her opinion). The daily serving size suggestions are a bit too generous:  1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight. That means 3 to 6 cans for an 8-pound cat, and if you've got a healthy 10-pounder, that means 4 to 8 cans a day? No way.<br /><br />I don't think we'll be using this as a daily food, but rather as an occasional change of pace. It's certainly palatable, but the messiness is a negative. I say 3 stars, and my cat says 5, for a 4-star average...

review/summary: Premium tuna -- well worth the premium price
review/text: We were visiting Astoria, Oregon and toured the Cannery Museum. They were selling mixed 6-pack boxes of Skipanon tuna, salmon and sturgeon to raise money for a memorial, so I paid the $30 figuring at least we could eat the fish. My husband and I didn't expect it to be anything more than a regular old can of tuna, but we were wrong, wrong, WRONG! This stuff is amazing! At $5 a can, I guess it should be amazing -- but I've found that it's rare to get what you pay for most times. It's the best canned tuna I've ever had -- and the salmon is to die for! If you are looking for high-end salmon or tuna for a special occasion or holiday appetizers, salad or sandwiches, splurge on this and you will not be disappointed. Neither will your guests. Chunk it up and sprinkle it lavishly on a bed of fresh lettuce and veggies for a high-protein, low-cal salad that will not leave you feeling like you are on a diet. It's not for everyday use (not on my budget, unfortunately), but for an occasional splurge, it's perfect.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/summary: Sensitive eater
review/text: This is one of the few brands of dog food that actually makes my 13 year old 100 pound rottweiler feel good. He has very sensitive skin and the high dollar "vet recommended" brands just make his skin break out and itch all over . My dog was raised on all purina products , particularly Beneful "original". The fact that he is a breed that normally lives 8-10 years and he is 13 years old speaks volumes about the diet he was raised on. He has never been to the vet for those 13 years other than for vaccinations. I highly recommend Beneful original and healthy weight and healthy radiance brands. The active dog formula did however irritate his skin just like the expensive "blue" or vet recommended brands. Other than that , an endangered species animal research scientist , who was also a very close personal friend, recommended purina years ago because they found that to be excellent food for their animals (dog and wolf breeds included). Turns out that friends advice was wise and accurate.

review/text: A mung bean is a fuel capsule full of all the nutrition required to create life. By germinating the mung beans you unlock the nutrients & enzymes that lay dormant within the bean. Once germinated I blend them into a batter with a little salt and water. In a large skillet I heat 1/3 cup of coconut oil at high heat and pour a couple of tablespoons of the mung bean batter on the skillet (like a small pancake (about 4 per skillet) I fry them till golden brown on both sides. I love them  plain or drizzled with maple syrup or honey.  I also love them when mixed with chopped raw spinach and green onions. I add a beaten egg white, cumin powder and cayenne pepper.

review/summary: This Kelp Caviar was delicious!
review/text: I can only explain that my feelings for caviar are more like cravings. They come and go, but when they hit, they hit hard. I was online searching for caviar in hopes of finding some that would be less expensive. That's when I learned about Kelp Caviar. Other testimonials raved about it -  so I had to try it. Of course I came to Amazon and here it was. There are different brands, but I chose this one. I ordered the most familiar to me...the sturgeon flavored. I ordered two jars in anticipation of loving it and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This is good stuff! It does not have the sharp "pop" of real caviar, but the look and taste is amazing. On a cracker with cream cheese I really don't think anyone but those who are most familiar with caviar (like on a daily basis) would know.  The only minor downside is shipping. It nearly equaled the cost of the caviar. HOWEVER! I will be ordering this product again. My delivery came on Thursday...it's now Saturday and both jars are gone. Finally, an affordable option (other than lumpfish) for those who just happen to love caviar, but aren't in the top 1%!

review/text: I've bought plants online in the past (never through Amazon or The Orchid Gallery) & have had some frightening results. However, I fell in love with this orchid & decided to give The Orchid Gallery a try. First of all, they were very cautious about sending the orchid on a day so that it wouldn't sit in the post office over a long weekend. I really appreciated that. When the plant did arrive I was blown away with how large and healthy it was. It also had no problem with acclimating & is already putting on new leaves.<br />Though the experience was amazing & I look forward to doing it again, I wish that I was able to choose the way the plant was to be shipped. The postal service here is less than spectacular.

review/text: TastyKake pies are awesome! They're snack pies with a soft tasty crust and a delicious filling. I ordered them from Amazon, and requested the pies be delivered before Father's Day, as they're my husband's favorite snack. They arrived on time (day before Father's Day)carefully packed, and very fresh. There may be some things in the world you cannot count on, but Amazon isn't one of them.<br />Rita H - Medford, Oregon

review/summary: BEST GUM Out There!!
review/text: I was SO excited to find this here at Amazon!  I really dislike sugarless gum, and that is all they seem to have in the stores anymore!  This is the good ol' original sugared gum - GREAT for blowing bubbles, flavor lasts a LONG time, and the deal can't be beat - comes to around .25 cents per pack!  I also love that included in each is two packs of the original (CLASSIC bubble gum taste) as well as Watermelon and Cotton Candy (for the kids).  This is definitely something worth ordering by the case, and will be a frequent order of mine for years to come!  :)

review/summary: A bit confusing, but good.
review/text: I was a bit confused, I guess, when ordering the gum.  I was under the impression that my order would total 15 individual packs of gum, not 15 sets of 4 individual packs (60 packs!!).  Also, you advertised that there were 4 different flavors when there are really only 3 (2 packs of original, and 1 pack each of watermelon and cotton candy).<br /><br />Other than that, what I did get is really good, and delivery was quick.  Perhaps best of all, my students were happy with it, and I have enough for my students next year!!

review/summary: Be Careful When You Buy In Bulk - Non Returnable
review/text: I do not believe that this is the same gum from years ago.  It has a terribly sweet synthetic overpowering smell.  I discovered that I am allergic to one or more of it's ingredients.  The flavor lasts about 60 seconds and then it's like chewing a big wad of rubber.  Since this is non-returnable, it is going in the trash.  I gave the gum one star because at least it is still made here in the U.S.A.

review/summary: Too many calories per serving
review/text: For a cereal that seems to be trading on the suggestion that it is a healthy choice, this product fails.<br /><br />Calories and fat are too high for a 3/4 cup serving of cereal, and that is because the fat and sugar content are too high.<br /><br />Get Fiber Plus Cereal, Cinnamon Oats Crunch, 11.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3) instead. The taste is outstanding and the nutritional components are much better. The calories are less than half of this cereal, fiber is as good, sugar is much lower, and fat is very low. The Fiber Plus cereal has been an important part of my success in losing 40 pounds in the last 6 months. My wife also changed to Fiber Plus for breakfast most mornings, and has lost 33 pounds in the same period of time. (No, the cereal is not responsible for all of our weight loss, but it gets credit for helping us control our calories at breakfast while still getting good nutritional value).<br /><br />I can have a bowl of the Fiber Plus, half a banana, AND milk for 40 less calories a bowl than this Uncle Sam cereal is dry out of the box.

review/summary: Good Stuff!!
review/text: Just got my boxes of cereal yesterday.  If I had a sugar scale for this cereal where 10 was "Frosted Flakes" and 1 was cardboard, I'd give it a 4.  If you removed the dried strawberries it would be a 3.  It's not too sweet for me.<br /><br />Overall I think that the nutrition level of the cereal is excellent.  Caloric content combined with its whole grain contents holds me over 5 hours until noon without cheating.  It has an excellent ratio of non-soluble to soluble fiber.<br /><br />It has its own distinct flavor that won't get boring and this cereal can be mixed with yogurt or whatever your favorite mix is and will be tasteful.<br /><br />It is lightly crispy and does well in milk.<br /><br />It's a keeper.  I'm glad I brought it.

review/summary: Nice, but there are better choices
review/text: In terms of wholesomeness and nutritional value, this sweetened Uncle Sam cereal is miles ahead of 99% of what sits on the shelves of average grocery store's cereal aisle.  The amount of sugar is  relatively small -- 7 grams. The ingredients are wholesome and natural.  Here they are:  Toasted whole wheat berry flake (whole wheat kernels, salt, barley malt), flaxseed, evaporated cane juice, freeze-dried strawberries, natural strawberry flavor.<br /><br />Why only 3 stars?  It's the flavor and fat.  A 3/4 cup serving has 240 calories, 5 grams of fat.  There just is not enough flavor to justify those numbers.  Thankfully, 8 grams of dietary fiber offers significant health benefits.  A nice counterbalance.  BTW, 3 grams are soluble and 4 grams of that fiber are insoluble.<br /><br />For a healthy, tasty breakfast cereal I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTMLM">Food For Life Ezekiel 4:9 Organic Sprouted Whole Grain Cereal, Original, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> with only 190 calories, 1 gram of fat, 6 grams of fiber, and 0 grams of sugar. It tastes better than Uncle Sam Strawberry and, of course, I can add my own strawberries when they are in season.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3FS">Uncle Sam Toasted Whole Wheat Berry Flakes & Flaxseed Original Cereal, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> is also a better option; albeit with more fat and sugar than the Ezekiel.

review/summary: Magical Passion Tea
review/text: The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.<br /><br />I do think you need two tea bags for each cup of tea to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients.<br /><br />Caffeine Free. You can drink this as you type into the night...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Our 1yr old Savannah loves this canned food. We didn't even have to ease him into it. The first bowl was licked clean...juice and all. We alternate the Salmon with the Chicken for a little variety.<br /><br />We, as owners, also like this food in general. They offer real fish and not some mush or pre-formed mystery bits.  I found an analysis online that showed this brand to be very close, nutritionally, to what a wild cat would have in nature.  It has much more protein and much less fat and carbs than most staple brands.  They also add the necessary vitamins and compounds that keep your cat feeling and looking good.<br /><br />As others have noted, this stuff looks good enough for humans to eat, so I have no problem feeding it to the cat. It is also easy on your wallet when you buy it in bulk.

review/summary: Tahitian Vanilla Extract
review/text: For years I used the stuff you just bought at the grocery store.  I always felt it was "o.k.", until I was at a friend's house, and she was using a really good grade of vanilla, and I realized I wasn't limited to whatever the grocery store was selling.  So I decided to see what Amazon had for sale, and came across this vanilla.  My first purchase was the set Totonac has, with the three different vanillas.  One was from Mexico, one from Madasgar and one from Tahitia.  While they are all good, we all really liked the flavor this one gave to whatever I was baking.  So, when I ran out of the set, I just purchased this one vanilla, since it was our favorite.  The price is right, and you get 3 bottles, so I felt that while it is more than I would likely spend at the grocery store, I don't think it is a whole lot more, and we like it so much more!  If you aren't sure which vanilla to buy, I think you might like this one!

review/summary: The best vanilla extract I've ever purchased
review/text: I must admit that I have paid top dollar for vanilla extract in the past; to feel like I was with the help of perfect ingredients; an accomplished cook.  To be honest I've never been able to tell the difference between any of them UNTIL now.  Usually when tasting my finished product I never tasted a hint of vanilla so I kept adding a little extra to try and up my results to utter fantastic, but nope, no real taste of vanilla period.  I researched a few days before purchasing Totonac pure Tahitian vanilla extract.  When the order arrived I took off the cap to check the aroma of it's contents.  Smelled quite the same as other vanilla's so I figured it would be the same.  I fixed some peanut butter cookies to try to see if I could tell a difference.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  There was a hint of vanilla taste with the first few bites which made me very happy.  Finally an Extract that delivers!  I'm going to try their other extracts in the future but honestly this is a very high quality vanilla, even over the Extract from Williams Sonoma that I paid a fortune for.

review/text: I love Sweet Leaf tea and appreciate that they do not use high fructose corn syrup in their products. The citrus flavor is very smooth and mild and is the most refreshing tea ever! I'm so happy Amazon is selling the tea because I can't find any 64-ounce bottles in my town!

review/summary: Twice The Price
review/text: It's a great product but why would I buy this from Amazon when I could buy it for $1.50 at my local H.E.B. or for $2.00 at Walmart?  Maybe you should renegotiate the price with Sweet Leaf or accept a lower margin.

review/summary: an elegant presentation of a lovely cup of tea
review/text: Harney & Sons teas make some of the best tea I've tried; Paris is my favorite but I enjoy trying new flavors, especially ones that are decaffeinated so I can enjoy them more often. This white tea blend has a very delicate flavor, right out of the tin I'd say the strongest note is the very slight aroma of chocolate. When brewing there's a hint of fresh grasses, more like Japanese green tea, and when fully steeped it develops into a soft, well rounded vanilla.<br /><br />The tin is very elegant and looks pretty on the counter - a nice keepsake to remember the fine cup of tea.

review/summary: Purchased for Will & Kate's Wedding
review/text: I threw a Will and Kate wedding watch party and purchased this British tea for the event.  Everyone who sampled the tea loved it as did I.  Now every time I drink it I remember that fun morning.  This is a feminine, possibly slightly floral tea that is light, spring like and delicious!  Very unique.

review/summary: Drink to your health!
review/text: My office has some days where someone or the other brings exquisite tea and shares with others in the break room.<br /><br />Today it was "Wedding Tea" in the break room for me to try. This was the first time I tried a cup of WHITE TEA. I must say the flavor is very mild and unlike BLACK TEA like regular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00286KM8E">Lipton Black Tea </a> this tea leaves are not heavily processed which tends to keep the original aroma giving you a good refreshing new taste.<br /><br />The taste of this Wedding Blend White Tea from Harney & Sons is more like 'chocolaty' but the tea color is close to white more or less pale green color after brewing. I enjoyed it to the last drop on my cup.<br /><br />Looked up online to see that 'White tea' has more of those antioxidants when compared to green or black Tea. While there is no clinical proof for the better health benefits from drinking white tea as of yet but researchers  considered it to be more beneficial.<br /><br />The vintage looking TIN which holds the 20 Sachets has exquisitely made designs and the Sachets themselves are uniquely crafted for dipping into a hot cup of water.<br /><br />While this will not replace your daily caffeine intake (White tea apparently has low caffeine content) that you get from your regular BLACK tea it surely makes a wonderful item for gifting someone especially on their wedding day.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review!

review/text: I don't understand why an ingredient list would not be included with these products.  What about people with allergies?  Is that where we are in this country?  we'll eat anything if it sounds tasty without knowing what's in it???

review/summary: SUPERIOR SOY MILK
review/text: I have been drinking Soy Milk for about 18 years.  I don't think there is a single soy product in the grocery, natural food, organic food stores that I have not tried.  Recently I found that my favorite Silk Soy had cross contamination from coconut & almonds both of which I am highly allergic to.  After a trip to the ER I went on a quest for another product and purchased Soy Dream from amazon. I purchased three (3) cases and not one was broken unlike the other reviewer.<br /><br />For Baking I use West Soy Unsweetend as who wants their scalloped potatoes sweetened.  For those of you who bake & cook Soy acts just like milk in cakes, scalloped dishes, etc.  I never use milk.<br /><br />But for my cereal, a pick me up during the day, to drink with my evening snack I use Soy Dream.  The taste is great and it has a little more substance than other soy products.  I often drink a half a box for a lift during the day when I am busy.<br /><br />I heartily recommend it.  My husband drinks it too and loves it on his cereal and uses it also for his Oatmeal Muffin snack in the evening.<br /><br />Amazon's shipping is great on this product and as a prime member I receive mine in two days.

review/summary: terrific product & terrible shipping!
review/text: In the first place, I am completely satisfied with the taste of this product. As said by another reviewer, the taste is quite milky and not beany at all. In addition, the price is comparatively cheap.<br /><br />What frustrates me is the terrible shipping. When I got the package, 2 boxes were leaking and all my other products in the package were drenched! I cannot imagine what kind of shipping service can cause 2 well-packed boxes to leak?<br /><br />If shipping service could be improved, I recommend this product to anyone who likes milky drinks.

review/summary: Best soymilk I've ever tasted
review/text: I've been an avid drinker of Silk, probably the biggest brand name of soymilk, for years.  I would use the unflavored Silk for cooking, the very vanilla for cereal, and just drink the chocolate as a stand alone drink.<br /><br />Always curious to try new products, I gave this one a shot but was expecting a taste similar to the unflavored Silk.  This is, by far, the best tasting soymilk I've ever tried.  It has a natural sweetness, but it's not so sweet that it would prohibit it from being used for any recipe.<br /><br />I will definitely be be purchasing this product again, probably quite frequently.  My days of drinking Silk are over.

review/summary: Best tasting, most like milk.
review/text: Of all the soy milks I've tried, this is the best tasting one, the one that tastes most like milk, not beany at all. This is what I put on my cereal.  I particularly dislike the vanilla-flavored milks on cereal.

review/summary: Perfect for school lunches
review/text: Ordered these for school lunches as buying soy milk at school is not an option, and they are impossible to find in the supermarkets around here.  My son loves the taste and the case of them is a little more than the amount we need for the month, so it works out well.  Sometimes some of the boxes are a little crushed, but we've had 3 deliveries and none of them have been punctured or ruined.

review/summary: Irritant
review/text: Good-tasting soy milk, but contains carrageenan which is a cellular irritant. Carrageenan is suspected to be implicated in colon cancer, and possibly other cancers since it irritates other than GI tissue.<br /><br />The same company has a carrageenan-free rice milk, called Rice Dream, Original, Classic. It's a great alternative to this one. It it also tastes good, and does not have the hormone-mimicking properties of soy.

review/summary: Happy with the product but expiring soon!!
review/text: I bought this so I can pack single serve soy milk on my almost 2 day flight across the Atlantic for my toddler who is allergic to milk.<br />It worked well BUT I just noticed that it expires in less than 6 weeks from when I placed my order!!! I wished that that information was listed because I will not be able to finish it before it expires. What a waste!! :(
