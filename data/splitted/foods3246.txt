review/summary: Get serious -- it's chocolate!
review/text: Oh for heavens sake; these are supposed to be reviews of chocolate, not legal complaints about buttons found in a chocolate bar bought *at your local store*, not through Amazon.com.  Yeesh.<br /><br />Scharffen Berger 70% (that's 70% cacao) is the perfect degree of darkness, in my opinion; their milk chocolate tastes pretty much like everybody else's (maybe a little better), and their 82% is too caffeineated for me (I would find myself clinging to the ceiling with fingers and toes, like a Gekko); but if you have a higher caffeine tolerance, you might like the bitterness of the 82% more than the 70% -- experiment!  (I haven't had occasion to try the 62% yet, but I would probably consider it not dark enough.)<br /><br />This is sipping chocolate, not chugging chocolate:  It's best to nibble a little bit with each tiny bite, focusing all of your attention on the flavor, consistency, fragrance, and the aftertaste.<br /><br />Valrhona is another good chockie, sweeter that Scharffen Berger and (in my opinion) with a simpler taste.  If I were cooking something with chocolate, I would choose Valrhona; but for eating straight, I prefer SB.<br /><br />Valrhona (from the Rhone Valley, hence the name) is a classic European chocolate -- French, in this case.  Scharffen Berger is American, despite the name, from Berkeley; in 2005, Hershey bought them out; but I don't believe the parent company has monkeyed with the manufacture of SB chocolate.  Wikipedia says that Scharffen Berger was the first American chocolate manufacturer to open in 50 years that creates its own chocolate "from bean to bar."  They taste very different, each being at the top of form for the region (Europe or America).<br /><br />I think Valrhona has a wider selection of flavors in their chocolate, but they all tastes a bit too sugary to me; Scharffen Berger is more a dessert than mere chocolate, but neither one is a simple candy bar.<br /><br />The prices are comparable to buying the same chocolate from Whole Foods or some other store that sells gourmet chocolate.  However, since it's sold by third-party grocers, you can't get free shipping; at least I don't see any reference to it.  And shipping is pricey:  eight dollars for chocolate costing up to thirty dollars worth... so if you can find it at a local store, you're better off buying it from there.<br /><br />But if you live in a chocolate desert, this is an alternative, if you must have a truly fine chocolate.

review/text: I recently bought scharffen berger chocolate from the store near my house.  It tasted yummy.  However when I was sampling it, I almost broke my tooth.  There was a metal button in with the chocolate.  It was hard to get hold of them to tell them of my problem.  If you find something they want to get it away from you fast and give you a small amount of money.  I didnt like how they handled it.  Customer service is really unsatisfying so dont bother.  JUST BE CAREFUL!

review/summary: Does the job!
review/text: So, my dog, in an excited frenzy over the doorbell ringing, knocked onto the floor and broke my beautiful celadon whisk stand that I received as a gift in Japan (it was part of an entire tea ceremony set).  I was a bit upset, since the entire tea ceremony set held a lot of sentimental value.  I forgave the dog (it could have been worse -- he could have broken my chawan) and went onto Amazon to find a replacement whisk stand.  I bought the pack of 3 in case this ever happened again.<br />The product is very nice, almost identical to my previous whisk, so it fits in perfectly with my tea ceremony set.  It does the job at keeping my whisk looking like new, plus the pack of 3 keeps you set in case your dog decides to break more fragile objects.<br />These were packaged very well, and the price was great!

review/summary: This stuff made me very ill.
review/text: I got very ill from drinking this kind of Propel. I was drinking many different flavors and decided to try the powdered kind. I was so sick that I spent days in bed, and getting blood tests at my Doctor's office. One day the nurse told me to drink a lot of water and since this contains no sodium or sugar I drank about 32 ounces of it. I became sicker than ever and tried not drinking any more of it. Over night I was cured. I had itchy hives on my back and upper arms and I thought my dreded kidney disease had returned. Beware of this stuff, I don't know why it affected me that way but, I have a whole bunch of it that I'm going to trash first thing tomorrow.

review/summary: Great price, great coffee!
review/text: I bought this item to take apart and create several gifts with it.  In other words, with these 30 packets, I was able to create 5 great gift baskets by just adding a couple of coffee mugs in each one.  To buy this to use as a single gift is fine as well, but, you will need to figure out a different way to present it.  It comes in a sturdy, sectioned cardboard box (in the photo, it looks to be wooden, but it is not), and so the packaging isn't particularly pleasing to the eye.  However, the coffee packs themselves are lively and colorful, and they will make a fantastic gift in another type of a container (i.e. basket or something).<br /><br />I decided to keep 5 packs of the coffee for my own use, and I have to say that the 2 that I've tried thusfar were outstanding!  Very smooth, with strong, distinctive flavors.  Specifically, I tried the Amaretto and Mocha so far, and both were great.  This sampler pack is pretty inexpensive, and it's a great way to give a little something to your coworkers at Christmas.  When I purchased this item, I paid $24.00, but I see that it has increased in price since then.  I probably would be less inclined to buy it now, although the coffee really is outstanding.

I really enjoy my coffee and I have tried plenty of them, but this coffee is some of the best I have ever tasted. You can smell the rich fresh aroma when you open the bag. Finally, somebody gets it with flavored coffee. I have never tasted more delicious flavors. All of the flavors that I have tried so far are great, but I am not a big Amaretto fan so I won't be drinking that one. I had nothing but compliments from my wife and friends. Thanks Black Mountain Gold for making a product with old fashioned quality.

Well, we were ready to just write this off and get her something different, but Rodgers Family Co called my mom the same day and apologized for UPS and offered to send another order free of charge, even making it to where she had to sign for it through UPS. The woman my mom spoke to was incredibly nice and made everything good again. This is a great company.

review/text: If I am correct this is a new addition to the Olive Garden wine selection. I believe this wine is an excellent starter wine for any individual who does not like stronger red wines. In terms of sweetness it is a little less sweet than the moscato that olive garden carries. Personally, I love this wine. I had a glass after dinner and for me it was the perfect wine. Not too sweet, not too bitter, but just right. If you are new to wine I would recommend this wine or if you are looking for something a little sweeter. Hope this helps someone.

review/text: I recently went to a small girls night wine tasting party.  I learned that I like Sweet Red wines the most.  I tried this wine and finally found that I do like wine :-) I always wanted to find one that I liked and had all but given up. The others I had tried to me were very bitter. I wanted something that tasted fruity.  I will say however that my Favorite Sweet Red to date is Serena Sweet Red (Italian also).  I found the Serena while looking for the Roscato. The store I was at did not have the Roscato and the Serena was on sale.  Both were for me excellent choices as a first time RED :-)

It goes down smooth, doesn't burn at all and has no unpleasant aftertaste.

review/summary: Great Taste, Terrible Packaging - Warning!
review/text: This is my first foods review and it comes out of disappointment and anger.  I bought two Kirkland 30oz. containers of "Pure Sea Salt" and "Coarse Ground Malabar Black Pepper."  Both have contributed to a number of my dishes.  However, there is a price to pay once you screw off the cap and pour.<br /><br />It seems that Kirkland may not have engineered the twist off caps to correct diameter specifications for the plastic containers they twist onto.<br /><br />Warning when twisting off these Kirkland caps, they might pull the plastic top off that's meant to filter the seasoning through holes which give a controlled sprinkling effect.  Instead, on numerous occassions, I've had the unpleasant experience of taking off the cap and pouring, then realizing too late that my dish is covered in mounds of Kirkland's signature seasoning.  The phantom plastic I found stuck to the inner top of the cap, laughing at me.<br /><br />The first time I thought, silly me, I've put too much pressure on the cap when twisting and look at this mess.  I felt I could laugh along with the phantom plastic. The fourth time, when it happened with the salt instead of the pepper I cursed Kirkland and felt the phantom cap was definitely laughing at me, not with me.  The good news is that regardless of the amount you overpour, you'll still have plenty of seasoning left to make the mistake a few times more. Don't do what I did and say you'll be more careful next time, it ain't you its the laughing cap.<br /><br />So I recommend if you've already purchased this product that you transfer the seasoning into a more trustworthy container that'll pour out without causing you to be laughed at and begin cursing Kirkland.  Hopefully it won't take you more than two occurrences to remedy the defect.  If by chance a Kirkland representative reads this review, please pass this discovery on so that just maybe your Research & Development folks will come up with something more..........user friendly!  That is if the R&D department isn't too busy trying to catch their breath after laughing at us consumers.<br /><br />(Great Seasoning Plus Bad Packaging Equals Inedible Dishes)<br /><br />Thanks for letting me vent Amazon.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: This paste is wonderful in so many different foods.  I combine it with lemon and rub it on a roast chicken or baked cut up chicken or on a thanksgiving turkey.  I combine it with chipotle peppers with some adobo sauce and spread it on thinly sliced pork for a few hours then grill it for tacos al pastor along with grilled thinly sliced red onions and sliced grilled pineapple.  I use it as part of the seasonings for the chicken that goes in tamales.  I use it for about a dozen other recipes.  This stuff is amazing and brings life to so many dishes.<br /><br />This spice blend originates in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico (according to my Mom) and is widely used in Mexican cooking.  It was originally a Mayan condiment but has spread in use.  It consists of Annatto seed along with a number of other spices.  It is commonly also called Recado Rojo.<br /><br />Once opened, I store the leftover paste in the refrigerator for best results.  That keeps it tasting fresh and helps keep it from drying out.

review/summary: Yum-In-A-Box
review/text: I first stumbled upon this mix a good ten years ago when I was a more strict vegetarian. I have since become a little more lenient in my diet but this is an old favorite. I do the beginning as suggested, boil 2.5c water and then add the chili mix (1 box) but from there, I do my own thing. They suggest using 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of beans but I find that I get a much more mellow but still hearty, flavorful chili and it either feeds several more or leaves a good bit leftover by adding the following: 1 can of Great Northern beans, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes, and a bit of powdered garlic (I picked the different beans for flavor/color/texture variation and the garlic is based on your personal tastes). If it's too thick for you, add up to 1 can of stewed tomatoes so that it thins it without diluting the flavor.<br /><br />Anyways, it tastes great fresh out of the pot with cheese and sour cream or on top of a baked potato. Unless I am serving others, my son and I always have leftovers but they freeze well if we don't want to eat them in the next couple of days. The real taste test was serving this to both my grandfather and my dad...they are big meat eaters who would have refused to eat it if I had told them up front it was vegetarian. Both liked it enough to ask for seconds and I've since made it for them and others on multiple occasions. :)

review/text: This is the best vegetarian chili I have tried. The box says to add 1 can of tomatoes and 1 can of bean. I like alot of tomaotoes in my chili so I always add 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes. Black beans are awesome in this but you can use any kind you like. I like to spice mine up a bit with cayenne pepper too. My boyfriend who is a meat and potatoe guy loves it, and usually he will never eat my vegetarian food.

review/summary: Delicious and easy to doctor up
review/text: I love this chili!. For me it's flavorful enough to handle an extra can of beans (or corn) in addition to the one can each of beans and tomatoes suggested on the box.<br /><br />I started out making it just for myself while the other four people in my family would eat our traditional beef-and-bean chili, which they swore they would never give up. At some point, I started secretly using the vegetarian chili as a base for chili con carne. In addition to the box recommendations, I add 1 lb cooked ground turkey, a can of Bush's chili beans, and an additional can (or even two) of plain (black, kidney, or pinto) beans. My whole family enjoys a hearty chili meal (with leftovers!), and I am happy knowing they are eating less saturated fat, and overall less meat than they otherwise would. They know what I'm up to now, and are fussing because I'm OUT of Fantastic Foods Vegetarian Chili. Who would have ever thought it?

review/summary: Santa Fe in a Box
review/text: Fantastic Foods' Vegetarian Chili (they call it chilE in New Mexico,thank you very much!) is delicious&filling. It's simple to prepare, and the cook is free to embellish. For a vegetarian chile,it's more substantial than the usual triad of beans/tomatoes/corn. The recipe on the side of the box (for Southwest Nachos) is helpful for building on the basic recipe (such as adding lime/lemon juice,sour cream,shredded cheese,cilantro) The cheese&sour cream are also helpful in cutting the slight saltiness.<br /><br />This Vegetarian Chili is one of the best out there. It makes plenty to last. Yes,there are leftovers-- or you could make nachos with it for a party. It's not as spicy as it claims to be,so feel free to add spices of your own. Fantastic Foods' Vegetarian Chili is a delicious culinary odyssey to the Southwest!

review/summary: Okay but way too salty for me
review/text: I have used Fantastic Foods products in the past, notably the sloppy joe mix, but this chili mix is so salty I am up all night going into the kitchen for water.  Also, and I noticed this with the sloppy joe mix too, the clear bag inside of the box gives way so that some of the mix spills out and I assume this would impact the freshness.  I finally ended up dumping all the bags out into one airtight container and when i use it I just scoop out what I think I need with a measuring cup.  I find I can use it in soup to add texture and being in soup the salty-ness is diluted.  I won't buy it again.

review/text: I did a terrible thing when I ordered this Fantastic Vegetarian Chile from Amazon.com.<br />We had ice and snow thick and I decided to try this chile. This was before I ordered my beans and tomatoes. I took the packet and added water and about burned my toungue off. Not due to the heat--but due to the flavor.<br /><br />I was ready to cancel my regular delivery's and took the time to order the beans and tomatoes and sliced tomatoes.<br /><br />OH MY gosh---I only used about half of the chile mix, added 2 cans of diced tomatoes, one can of sliced potatoes and some beef flavoring along with the water.  WOW--it was so good.<br /><br />I guess I will get twice as much use from this chile as I can only use half of it.<br /><br />I am beginning to realize--we can use our imaginations and really prepare food the way we like it. I ate some last night and had some for lunch today.  Great stuff--

review/text: My (military) unit is hosting a chili cookoff as they often do, and I wanted to insert my vegetarian version, mostly so I will have something to eat too, but also because I've loved this brand for years and I know it can fool a meateater in a minute.  I went bopping over to my local Publix (the only place I've been able to find it) where they have not only completely redesigned the aisle structure, but dumped the brand altogether.  What a shame.<br /><br />Something told me to just check Amazon.com.  Not only is it available, but in CASES, and at much less than I paid per box at the grocer's!  And they will have it here by tomorrow.  Just doesn't get any better.<br /><br />So glad living in the middle of nowhere doesn't mean I have to go without my fav vegetarian and vegan foods.

review/summary: Partially Hydrogenated Oils!!!  aka Trans Fats
review/text: Be aware of the Legal Disclaimer at the bottom of this product's ingredient list.  It warns that it is not fully disclosing ALL of the ingredients in Fantastic World Food's products for a reason. I had been buying this product for years from health food shelves and never thought to thoroughly read the ingredients until recently when my eyes fell upon "partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil" right there on the box of their Vegetarian Chili mix.  This is Trans Fats, and no amount of this chemically modified fat is safe for the body! If you are trying to avoid that ingredient and looking to purchase this food based on its false health food marketing, you can verify this bad news for yourself by checking out the product in the natural food section of your store.  This is a very poor business practice as they know people are avoiding trans fats like the plague... hence the legal disclosure.  Inexcusable!

review/summary: Superior quality food -
review/text: After many fits and starts, I 've totally switched my two Flat coated Retrievers to Orijen.  Fantastic quality food and although price per pound is higher in reality w/o the cereal and other fillers of so many other dog foods, its actually only nominally more expensive.  I weaned my K-9s (ages 2 and 6) off other commercial foods and  have found their stools now on 100% Orijen are  normal, not  odorous (during the transition there is some  how do we say "stink" as this food contains  beneficial probiotics that initially are  dealing with  the  grain based old  foods in the K-9s digestive tract).  Also my k-9s  sleep inside at night and travel quite bit with me to training and searches - nothing worse than a dog  flatulance and  there is none and I mean none of that with this food  Yeah!  My K-9s are my Search and Rescue partners and this has given them  excellent stamina,  better coats and they both  relish  it.  I'm using New Zealand dried lamb  bits for training and reward treats but occasionnally  use just a few  Orijen  kibbles instead and you would think I was serving them  prime rib.  Wish I could find a local vendor in RI - shipping is a little steep but many of the vendors will offer you a  significant discount on the second order so I order two bags at a time and  change-up the flavors  from time to time so the  K-9s don't get jaded.  Can't say enough how pleased I am with food.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I have a 8.5 month old Aussie mix. She's about 42 lbs now. This food is magic!! I love it! She's never been "food motivated" and so she's always been a little reluctant to eat her kibble, but she honestly LIKES this stuff. She'll do tricks for it like it is a treat. More importantly, her poop is GREAT on this kibble. Finally, it's easy to pick up! This food is a godsend.<br /><br />We've previously tried Innova EVO, California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and Adult, and Canidae All Life Stages.

review/summary: Best in Class Dry Dog Food
review/text: Pet food has an immense range of quality that we like to roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage; (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product; and (3) "price is no object" foods that make no compromises.  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog or cat food anywhere.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with nothing but the highest quality ingredients.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food out there.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product (the whole list is good, but I have to stop somewhere so this review doesn't get too long):  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for "hill's science diet dry dog food."  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.

review/summary: Incredible, Incredible Food!!
review/text: My pup (3 year old maltese) has a serious allergy to grain and a generally screwed up digestive system. The first year of his life was sort of trial and error when it comes to the right kind of dog food for him and a lot of long nights with upset stomachs. Eukanuba (which can barely be called dog 'food') nearly killed him and he ended up having to get fluids injected because of how dehydrated he got on it.  Hundreds of dollars to the vet later, we did research on dog food and the common grain allergy. We have tried all of the good grain-free brands, like Evo, Wellness, Merrick, etc. Orijen has been the best of the bunch.<br /><br />If you are worried about your dog having too much protein, I haven't really had a problem at all despite my little dog. He has been on Orijen for over two years and he is pretty much all lean muscle (all 13lbs of him!), despite being mostly sedentary outside of daily walks. He has clear, tear-stain free eyes, a shiny coat, and has never been sick since starting on this food. I can't help but think his excellent quality food has been keeping him healthy!<br /><br />Orijen is expensive, but worth it!

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: As for the quality of this food if you're unfamiliar with holistic foods, this stuff is top quality.  It has many forms of meat, no grains whatsoever, and no controversial ingredients, etc...  You know the drill, a top quality food that is unavailable in grocery stores.  Actually one of the best on the market amongst hundreds of different kinds.<br /><br />This stuff is pricey but your dog will eat less so it sort of offsets the price a bit.  With regular food your dog is eating corn, potato peelings, rotten rice, and animal guts and blood swept off the floor of the slaughter house.  That food is so low in nutrients your dog must eat tons of it and poop out all the poison that shouldn't be in the food.  With a great food like Orijen your dog will eat less, absorb most of it, and have fewer and more solid stools.<br /><br />There are a few people who are a little weary of Canidae.  Canidae now makes a grain free formula which is excellent.  It's almost as good as Orijen and cheaper as well.  If you want one of the better foods on the market and a good price, Canidae grain free is your ticket.  But if you absolutely want the Lamborghini of dog foods then Orijen is your buy, although Canidae is a Porsche and still pretty darn good.

review/summary: MAGIC FOOD!
review/text: Our five year old Thai Ridgeback was getting a little chunky after a particularly snowy winter. The owner of our dog walking service mentioned Orijen food as a way to slim her down.  We had been feeding her Science Diet, 1/2 sensitive skin, 1/2 light food.  We always considered her to be reasonably healthy and active.  Twice before I had attempted to switch her to "fancier" holistic foods and both times she began losing hair.  I suspected lamb as the culprit but it could have been some other ingredient.  I have never reviewed anything before or felt passionate enough about a product to sing it's praises until now.<br /><br />The minute you open the bag you notice the food smells wonderful.  It looks high quality.  The dog LOVES it.  It's is excruciating to wait for that first bag that is mixed 50/50 to be finished so you can completely transition.  We knew right away that this was a good choice, but as time went on I was stunned at all the aspects of her health that improved.  1) Ashy-ness that she had developed on her elbows went completely away. 2) Her coat grew noticeably thicker and shinier over several months. 3) &lt;Gross-out Alert> Her stool is firm and smaller; she stopped farting, and no longer experiences anal sack leakage.  4) After a year of feeding her this food she is now visibly leaner and looks awesome for 6 years old.  This is the best thing we could have done.<br /><br />Now the economy of it.  Science Diet is $45 bucks for 30lbs.  This stuff is $65.  BUT, since she digests more of the product we literally feed her 2/3's the amount we used to, and she seems more satisfied, doesn't stand by her bowl and beg for more.  It's basically a wash on price!<br /><br />In response to the reviews that claim this food is dangerous, I have a hard time believing those aren't planted by a rival company.  She just got a full check up and three year rabies shot at our vet.  There isn't anything wrong with her liver.  The vet said they were not familiar with Orijen yet, but they agree that she is noticeably healthier and the higher protein content is perfectly safe.  It's about what is not in this food that makes the difference for me.  No pesticides, no cheap stabilizers, no filler grains, no ground up bones and connective tissues.  I'm not a vet or nutritionist but I am a first-hand witness to the positive effects of this wonderful food.  Thank you Orijen!!!

review/summary: Amazingly wonderful!
review/text: Our dog was having trouble with grocery store purchased dog food. She would eat it and a half hour to four hours later she would throw it up. This cycle went on for months. We took her to the vet and they ran all sorts of tests and everything came back negative. So the vet's solution was to put her on a stomach medicine...for the rest of her life!<br /><br />Not wanting to put her on drugs for the rest of her life (she's only 2 yrs old) I started doing some research and discovered that many dogs have a food allergy to grains, especially corn and corn by-products which are in just about every commercial dog food.<br /><br />Then I stumbled onto grain-free dog foods and this led me to Orijen. All I can say is "Wow!"<br />I tried a small sample bag first (purchased at a store an hour away) and she loved it. Best of all, it stayed down.<br />Then I bought a larger bag. Yes, it's more expensive but she eats a smaller quantity so overall each month I'm not spending any more money on dog food.<br /><br />In the 6 months we have had her on Orijen Adult Formula, she has not thrown up her food at all. Not once! (She also likes the Orijen fish formula too)  I find that simply amazing. Her coat is shiny and glossy now and she clearly feels good!<br /><br />The only negative for us is that it is not available locally and I have to drive an hour to a larger city to buy it. Occasionally I have ordered it online. But we have a new pet store opening up here soon that will be carrying it so that will resolve our "where to buy it" issue.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that VETS also suggest a grain-free diet for dogs having stomach/digestive issues instead of just automatically reaching for the Rx pad. My two cents.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: My terrier mix is a very picky eater, so we have tried almost every one of the higher quality dog foods out there and my dog likes this best. This is also one of the best made dog foods in my opinion. 70% meat and zero grain. The only thing was figuring out the correct amount to feed her each day. As this is a very high protein food(42%), the portions we feed are half of "normal" protein food. My dog is very active, so she has no problem burning off the high calorie count of this food(almost 500 cal per cup). So even though the cost per bag is high, it is really no more expensive than "normal" brands in the long run. Watch for weight gain in larger dogs, my friend tried this stuff with his big Lab mix and he put on to much weight. My only complaint would be that my dogs coat doesnt seem to shine like it did with some other brands. I now top this food off with a squirt of salmon oil and her coat really shines. The best thing about this food is that my dog just loves the taste. I would recommend trying.

review/summary: Be Careful
review/text: This food has EXTREMELY high levels of protein. Not all dogs need a high protein diet, and in fact for some it can be quite dangerous. While my dog was on Orijen, my vet discovered that he had elevated liver enzymes. Many dog food health websites advocate high protein foods, but these can be very dangerous. Dogs that don't have a lot of energy and/or have little body fat (like sighthounds) do not need this much protein, and processing it can be very bad for their livers. This is a high quality food, I love that it is made by a small company in Canada, and many people have had great success with it. But know that it is NOT for every dog! Please be careful and keep in mind that more protein is not always better if you are considering this food!

review/text: We were unhappy with the food our breeder used. High percentage of corn. After reading lots of labels, in theory this seemed to be just what we were looking for. We went through a careful, slow transition, but this turned out to be way too harsh on our Havanese's GI tract. He ate it just fine, but we would see a progression to larger and more greenish stool, then loss of form until he had a true liquid event. That was the end of that!<br /><br />For anyone with a toy breed, if you would like another option, we eventually transitioned over to Wellness Small Breed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AN2PUE">Wellness Super5Mix Adult Health Small Breed Formula Dry Dog Food</a> . This turned out to be both a food he loves and the transition was effortless. He is behaving very puppy-like @ 3 years old which I feel is a good thing. The Wellness  food brand was never part of the 2007 animal food recall list for melamine (rice gluten) and is corn, soy and wheat free.

review/text: Ok, let me start this review by stating that NO DOG FOOD WILL WORK FOR EVERY DOG.<br /><br />We have been bouncing around from food to food since Canidae sold their product to Diamond Dog Food.  We have tried everything from Eukanaba to Merrick to Innova, and Orijen has given us the best results.  Orijen has an excellent breeders program, in which if you are accepted you receive your 7th bag of food free.  This is a huge savings and brings the cost of Orijen down to near what most foods sold at PetCo or similar companies cost.  Also, we were hesitant to try Orijen or any grain free food for that matter because of all the claims of kidney issues.  Do your research, don't take my word for it, but protein is broken down in the liver, not the kidney -- claims that it causes kidney failure are grossly inaccurate.  Dogs with existing kidney issues may have a harder time excreting broken down protein, but that would affect all dog foods.  Remember, if your dog is sick, your vet puts the dog on chicken and rice or boiled hamburger and rice (these foods are rich in protein).<br /><br />Another interesting point is, we have bulldogs that we show.  These dogs are particularly, let's say, "beefy".  We were worried that this food would slim them down too much and make them not look like a show standard, but it did not.  2 cups/day is perfect for them.  Remember calories are not an exact science and your dog will not absorb every calorie from any dog food (thus why they poop), so don't be worried if you have to feed more or less of any particular food.<br /><br />Do your research, you won't find a better food, made with better ingredients than Orijen for anywhere close to this price.  EVO is much more massively produced, and its meat ingredients are purchased, not raised by the company like Orijens.  Never preserved, never frozen, fresh meat is what Orijen is about.

review/text: I started feeding my two dogs on this food a couple of weeks ago. I have a 4 year old havanese that is an extremely picky eater, and a six year old shepherd mix who has almost always been at least a few pounds overweight. I was giving them Eukanuba Naturals before this, which isn't cheap food. We have tried many different foods over the years for our havanese, and she barely eats any of them, always had to entice her, but she absolutely loves Orijen. For the first time ever she runs to the bowl and just gobbles it down. With our shepherd we have tried many different diet dog foods, and feeding her less and less, but no matter what we did she would never lose those few pounds, but after this short time on Orijen she has already lost 2 pounds. Orijen has much fewer carbs than the other foods out there, less than half the carbs of what we were feeding her, and carbs are empty calories for dogs. This food is great. My dogs absolutely love it, and I love what it is doing for them. And no gas!!

review/text: My 12 year old Golden was diagnosed with Lymphoma.  As far as cancer is concerned, it's one of the worst... prognosis is generally 4-6 weeks after diagnosis untreated, up to one year with chemo.  My husband and I decided we were not in a financial position to do chemo, especially to only buy our pooch one year, so I started researching alternative medicines.  One thing I read over and over was to switch to a grain-free diet.  Well, we had been feeding him decent food, but not grain-free.  So, I bought a bag of this.<br /><br />10 weeks later the tumors in his neck have shrunk without any medication, and you'd never know this dog has a death sentence.  He can digest it just fine, his coat looks great, he actually slimmed up a bit (which is great because he was a little chubby) and he just looks and feels fantastic.  I'm not saying this is a miracle cure-all and that the cancer won't get the best of him one day soon, but I am forever thankful to this company for making such high quality food that is making his time left easier and enjoyable.  Oh, and he LOVES this food.  Like, circles, cute noises, tail boogie-woogie, hopping etc.  It's almost like he's a puppy again. :D

review/summary: You get what you pay for: incredible ingredients but a little pricey.
review/text: The first time I read the ingredient list for this food I said: "Son of a... I WOULD EAT THIS!" No joke, there isn't a single ingredient name you won't recognize and there are no artificial preservatives (the food, in fact, contains ingredients that have never been frozen and so it is vacuum-sealed in the packaging--which incidentally makes the bag quite easy to carry). I have yet to meet a dog owner (in person!) who hasn't told me their dog eats this stuff like it's crack-cocaine!<br /><br />Since it is a little pricey (despite the fact that you actually have to feed your dog LESS food than any other brand with a high grain content--which is used as a filler in all your standard grocery-store dog foods because corn is so cheap), I do a half-and-half mix of Orijen with another incredible dry dog food called "Taste of the Wild".<br /><br />All I can say is that my Siberian Husky LOVES this food so much that when she's done she just sits there looking at me for a minute before letting out a very satisfying belch. I swear I laugh every time she does it. Finally, I can also say, and this is only anecdotal, but after I switched to this food (I was formerly feeding her Eukanuba) my dog's shedding decreased significantly. Husky's usually "blow their coat" once or twice a year with mild/standard shedding in-between; it was this mild/standard shedding that decreased.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand to anyone with a medium to large breed dog that has a high-energy level.<br /><br />(Edited for typos and some added content).

review/summary: Orijen and small dogs
review/text: As I write this my 17 lbs Bischon Poodle is in the vet hospital after liver shut down yesterday. Looking for the best food on the market for my dog I researched and read the rave reviews for Orijen all natural food. I decided to place my dog on it. She has been on it for a little over 3 months. She refused to eat the past couple of days. I took her to the vet. The high protein level in Orijen food had put my dog into liver shutdown. I fed her according to recommendations. Protein needed for a small dog is 10-13 % Orijen 39%. No where does Orijen put a warning on their food stating that it could be detrimental to small dogs. I would never recommend this product for a small dog. I would never use it for any dog of mine. The normal level of liver enzymes should have been 70-100. My dogs after being on Orijen for 3 months 750. The risks are too high think carefully and make sure you consult your vet. I would hate to see anyone go through what I've experienced with my dog.

review/summary: Best in Class Dry Dog Food
review/text: Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) "price is no object" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for "hill's science diet dry dog food."  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.

review/summary: The best grain free dog food
review/text: Orijen makes by far the best dog food you can buy. It's expensive but well worth it, especially when you take into account how much you will save on vet bills and the great boost it will give to your dogs overall health and well being.. It is grain free which is very important as grain is not part of a dog's normal diet and besides mostly being filler, grains can cause allergies and other issues. My 5 year old German Shepherd is on Orijen Adult and has done incredibly well on it, stunning coat, great energy, consistently firm, and virtually odor-free, poops. I also have a large male Golden who is now 13 1/2 years old and doing fantastic. He at Orijen Senior until about 3 years ago when we switched him to Orijen Senior. Other than a little arthritis in his hips and knees (to be expected) he is perfectly healthy and his last blood panel came back incredibly good. My vet says we are doing all the right things (daily walks and exercise, filtered water, Orijen Senior food) especially since large Goldens typically only live to 10 or 11. When we are out walking quite often we meet much younger goldens (6 to 8 years) that look much older than he does. It really does show what a difference diet and exercise make both in humans and in our canine companions. We have a new puppy (that we adopted from the Best Friends Animal Society) and she is on a mix of Orijen Puppy and doing great. Highly recommend Orijen Adult, Senior and Puppy.<br /><br />Note:<br />Many years ago we fed our dogs Canidae because it was decent quality and we were financial limited. But, when the Canidae manufacturer suddenly changed their formula (added more grain and fillers) all of our dogs had bad reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, scratching, skin allergies etc). Numerous trips to the vet and lots of dollars for tests only to find out they were all having a reaction to the poor quality ingredients in their food. That was when I began researching dog food ingredients and decided to go grain-free with a company that only makes dog food. Could not be happier with my decision to spend more on Orijen. Very wise decision on my part, and my dogs are much healthy now than they have ever been.

review/summary: This food saved the day
review/text: I am not the review leaving type, but I do read them - therefore I must in good concience tell of my experience. This food is a life saver for my cocker. Our vet and the vet specialist suspected an allergy and he was on Hills ZD prescriptive food, the allergy manifested itself mainly with ear issues, not unusual in a Cocker but the ears went from normal difficult cocker ears to close to end disease ear canals with an ablation recommended. We did surgery to remove tumors in his ears, we tried expensive medication, he was still in pain.  Then, my vet ran out of the ZD. I looked around for another food and read about Orijen. We gave it a try, after two weeks the change was significant, his nose is no longer cracked and dry, his eyes no longer weep and his ears don't hurt him anymore!  They get better each day and I can only attribute it to this food. Try it, I am thrilled I did.

review/summary: Love it!!!  Shiney fur and no "dog" smell!
review/text: We switched our dogs to this food after reading about what is in grocery store brands.  I believe they were on Beneful. (garbage) The change was amazing! They have been on Orijens for around 3 yrs now and they are doing great!  We have a bassett mix, and elderly lab mix, and a beagle.  The changes in their fur were amazing! Their coats went from dull and dry to soft and shiney. We get comments all the time on how shiney and soft they are. Another nice effect is that since there is no corn in the food, our dogs do not smell at all anymore. Dogs cannot digest corn properly and thats why you get that "dorito" smell with the cheaper foods.<br /> Our older lab mix's arthritis improved drastically and he has such a spring in his step for an old guy (13yrs.) I honestly believe Orijens has added years to his life.  The beagle always had a touchy stomach too, and after the first 2 weeks or so he was doing better than ever on Orijens. They also all love it.  It is so worth the price to me as my dogs are healthier and happier.

review/summary: Great food for a Pomeranian
review/text: I have tried out food from Iams which is pure garbage, to hills science diet, which was not bad, to wellness, which my dog didn't like at all as it was hard for him to break down.<br /><br />When i read about Orijen and just by looking at the ingredients, i knew this product had to be good. My dog loves it so much, that where before he would eat half off the daily dose needed with other products; with orijen, he eats all of his daily dose and begs for more. this food is trully a great product for him and i am glad that there are companies out there who actually care about animals and what they put in their stomachs and not just money oriented. Sure it is expensive, but in order to use expensive products, money has to be paid out and all companies are not going to be running a business for free. i believe that if you can afford to feed yourself good food, then the animals that live with you should also not be deprived from good food either.<br /><br />thank you Orijen - Great product and i would recommend it to anyone.

review/text: BY FAR THE BEST FOOD OUT THERE!!!!  I HAD MY 2 PITBULL PUPPIES ON BLUE BUFFALO, NOT A BAD DOG FOOD, BUT IT GAVE BOTH MY DOGS MAYOR GAS.  IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIND ORIJEN AT ANY OF MY LOCAL AND MAYOR PET STORES.  IT TOOK A PETCO EMPLOYEE TO TELL ME THAT A SMALL SHOP IN RIVERSIDE CA CALLED ELLIOT'S HAD IT.  I DROVE OVER THERE AND SURE ENOUGH THEY HAD IT SO I BOUGHT THE 15LB PUPPY BAG, AND I STARTED TO TRANSITION THEM AND BY THE 2ND WEEK ON THE FOOD THE GAS WENT AWAY.  I THOUGHT THAT MY PUPPIES COATS LOOKED GOOD WHEN I HAD THEM ON BLUE BUFFALO, BUT WITH ORIJEN THEIR COATS ARE UNBELIVABLE.  TILL THIS DAY MY PUPPIES DO NOT PASS ANY GAS AND IT ALSO SEEMED TO CONTROL HOW MANY TIMES THEY POOP.  SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE FOOD IS EXPENSIVE, BUT I THINK IF YOU LOVE YOUR DOGS LIKE YOUR KIDS OR FAMILY YOU WOULDN'T THINK ABOUT IT TWICE.  I THINK THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT, BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.<br /><br />ERIC PITBULL LOVER

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: I have a 4 year old mini Doxie who was terribly picky about eating dog food, Heaven forbid. For the first 2 years of his life he would rather starve than eat so, of course, he ate mostly table scraps. Most of the scraps were a beef dish or raw hamburger. At about one year old he developed a nasty skin rash with lesions that flaked and the hair would fall out. A couple of Vets said it looked like Staph and we tried SEVERAL rounds of antibiotics and medicated shampoos. None of them worked. I finally got frustrated and bought a bag of Orijen adult formula and flatly refused to give anymore people food. Eventually he gave in and decided to try the Orijen. Within 3 weeks to a month his rash was totally gone, his loose stools firmed up and he has a healthy doggie appetite and diet. At his last checkup I told the Vet about Orijen and he was intrigued. Stated he had never heard of it but wrote the name down to look into it. If your dog has any health issues that are undiagnosed or seem untreatable, give Orijen a try.

review/summary: Allergy solver.
review/text: My dog was shedding excessively and constantly had allergy problems, even on the once a day vet allergy pills. Switched her over to this food and she does not even have to take the pills anymore. Make sure to adjust the amount you feed according to the back of the bag as this will make your dog porky if you give it too much and do not have a very high activity level. Was very easy to switch her over. Mixed it in 20/80 with her old stuff and she picked out all the Orijen and ate it and left the old stuff on the first day. She was eating it regularly with no bad side affects from then on.

I went to every pet store and ordered every natural food I could find but nothing work. The poor thing had horrible gas and runny poop for months. Not to mention the non-stop chewing and itching.<br /><br />Anyway I finally found out about Orijen on a Border Collie website and I have to say this stuff is magic.<br /><br />Within two days my dog's stomach settled, her fur is coming back to life and she is bouncing around like a puppy again.<br /><br />The itching is still going on but far from what it was and from what I have hear it takes weeks for the allergens to completely leave a dogs system.<br /><br />I fully recommend this product!

review/summary: Feeding Costs and Guidelines
review/text: Orijen seems to be what experts want us to feed to our dogs.  It smells nasty so we keep it sealed and the dog loves it more than Newman's Own (N.O.) Organic dry (no bad smell, dog doesn't like it).  We've always mixed N.O. with some (decidedly stinky) wet food.  Anyway, I've read that some dogs have intestinal upset with the Orijen food due to high protein content.  Others quote the high price of the food.  I agreed, but changed my mind when I read the feeding guidelines.  Here is a big tip from the Orijen people. "We recommend that you feed twice daily. Simply divide the amount suggested on the feeding guide into two meals, spaced eight to twelve hours apart. You may need to adjust portions as you learn your dog's ideal daily "maintenance" amount, always keeping in mind that a lean dog is a healthy dog!<br /><br />TRANSITIONING FOODS<br />"Dogs are often fed the same food, which means a sudden food change makes it difficult for their digestive systems to adapt. That's why it's important to introduce the new food gradually. Going slowly will give your dog or cat time to adjust to their new food and will also reduce the chances of digestive upset.<br /><br />"Start by mixing 25% new food with 75% old food. Slowly change the proportions over the next three to five days by gradually increasing the amount of ORIJEN and decreasing the amount of old food. At the end of this transitioning process, you should be feeding 100% ORIJEN." ~Quoted from the website of the Orijen dog food.<br /><br />COST PER SERVING<br />We plan to continue the small amount of Orijen and see how our 30 pound Border mix rescue handles eating about 1/2 cup of food twice a day instead of the 1 and-a-half cups of N.O. that sits all day until she decides to eat it.  So far, the transition period is going very well.  She does a pretty nice job picking out the Orijen kibble and leaving the N.O..  So, for 1c. per day, if a 1/2 c. measure of kibble weighs approximately 1 oz on my non-scientific kitchen scale, then 30 pounds of food for 63 dollars is about 16 servings per pound or 480 servings per bag - which is 63/480... about 13 cents per serving @ 2 per day = 26 cents per day?  N.O. is (subscribe&save .11 cents per ounce, but my dog needs (but won't eat unless mixed with wet) needs 3 times the amount (1 and-a-half cups per serving which is 6 oz. on my kitchen scale "20-40 pound dog 1-1/3 to 2-1/4 cup) per serving or per day, I don't know, but we feed her 1.5 cups twice a day (6 oz. x .11 cents per oz.= 66 cents x 2 = $1.32 N.O. per day) is still more costly than Orijen at .26 cents per day. So for us, at least, the transition is cost-effective.<br /><br />Given that a half cup of food per serving is so little food, I'll probably supplement her meals with something else. Should I let go of the N.O. kibble just yet?

review/text: My wife and I are Lhasa Apso breeders. We switched to Orijen a few years back during that Chinese wheat gluten scare. Turned out to be an excellent decision. Our dogs love it and contrary to what someone said, there have been zero negative health issues. We've even got our Vet recommending it now. Yes it seems to be a bit expensive but you're not buying it quite as often because the dogs eat less. It's still not cheap but not as bad as you might think. Their largest bag lasts our 6 Lhasa's just about a month. I was glad when the Fish flavor came out a while back for a change of pace and recently have seen a beef flavor hitting the shelves that we haven't tried just yet. Very highly recommended!

review/text: Orijen dry dog food is relatively new to me, (approx. 8 months) but not only does my German Shepherd love it..right out of the bag..but I always taste a sample myself! (Not something I would normally do with just any dog food). You'll find after opening the sturdy bag, the aroma of the Orijen dog food catches your sense of smell like a freshly brewed cup of coffee, or a piece of your favorite meat or fish.  I usually buy the blue bag of free-run chichen and fish product because I find it contains the most appropriate ingredients for my German Shepherd. When the box of food is delivered, she is immediately scratching the box to help me open it..she knows it's for her and can't wait to get her teeth into it. LORI, Phila.

review/summary: Going back to this brand...
review/text: My picky, finicky Chow Chow could barely be coaxed to eat any of the other foods I bought for her until I brought home a bag of Orijen. You would have been under the impression that I was giving her a bowl of raw (or cooked) meat if you saw her eat it and didn't know better. I've been using the brand for years now until recently due to the economy I've purchased a couple bags of high quality, less expensive food for my Pit Bull who has always had a healthy appetite... not too picky, so I thought it wouldn't make a difference, but after a few weeks now he's been throwing up bile the last three or four days in a row, and just today he threw up his food, so I'm going back to Orijen for him. I noticed there is some pro-biotic ingredients in the Orijen brand as well, so that may make the difference. Either way, I've trusted Orijen since my Chow gave me the "tails up" years ago! I also found satisfaction that Orijen was never on the dog food recall list several years ago when pets were dieing from a cheapened ingredient filler coming from a source that people hadn't known about prior... so I trust the makers.

review/text: When I first adopted my dog, I did a vast amount of research to find out what was truly best to feed him. He's a chihuahua mix, and as I was reading such mixed reviews about whether small dogs would benefit from a high protein diet or not I decided I just had to try it for myself. He did have a little trouble with digestion while I was transitioning him to the food, he was eating Royal Canin prior. He's been eating it for about seven months now and he's doing phenomenal. He has great muscle tone and energy. His coat is silky and shinny when it had been coarse and dull. Yes, it's on the pricey side but if you closely watch what you put in your body as humans why wouldn't you want your best friend to benefit from great food.

I eat high quality food, and I would never do less for my dog. I feed this to my labrador, and she loves it. We have tried other high quality brands -- such as Evo. While Evo is a great food, Orijen is just better. You can tell the difference. My dog is in perfect health. She is active. She has tons of energy. And her coat and teeth are radiant. People compliment her coat all the time. She is perfect. Orijen has changed her life. I will NEVER stop using this food!<br /><br />When she was younger, I used the puppy version as well. She loves this stuff. Eats is quickly and always wants more. The only thing she likes more than Orijen is my grilled chicken breast!<br /><br />Finally, if your dog has any issues with seizures, this is probably the best food on the market for your buddy. Do research on the web. And believe me -- you'll see the difference.

review/summary: One of the best dog foods you can buy.
review/text: I have been feeding my dogs Orijen for over two years now.  I was at a bar with a buddy and he was telling me how he switched his food to Evo and so I did some research on better dog foods.  I decided on Orijen.  I can't really tell if my dogs coats are better or they are more healthy.  On paper it seems to be the best food and it makes sense.  The food is sooo expensive and they jacked up the price about 6 months ago.  It does help they seem to eat half as much as my old dog food.  So, that cuts the cost in half compared to my old food.  A big bonus of this is there is half as much poop to pick up. That is huge as I am really lazy.  The other thing I noticed is both dogs had some nasty farts.  That pretty much stopped on Orijen.  Oddly my buddy said it will get worse with the higher protein diet, but it got a ton better.  I mean by dogs could drop some room clearing farts.  There are cheaper good dog foods out there like Blue.  I have thought about switching to it because it is 30 bucks a bag cheaper.  For now Evo is worth the money.  I can drop 70 bucks at a bar on any given night.  70 a month feeds both my large dogs.

review/summary: AWESOME FOOD!!!
review/text: I switched over to Orijen Adult formula almost a year ago (next month is my free bag...yay!) and I couldn't be happier. My 2-year-old boxer, Cooper, thrives on it. His coat is shiny and glossy, his eyes clear and white, and he has more energy than any other dog at the dog park. I'm not at all sure it's because of this food, but he lost some weight last spring and has since been a lean, mean, muscle machine. I'm talking LEAN. The vet says he's fine, and although I get lots of comments on how skinny my dog is, the proof is in the pudding. No dog can outlast Cooper, and he's just so incredibly healthy, I don't mind some bones sticking out. It's better than being overweight. He's an athlete. I think when I got him off grains last spring, his body shed some weight that it obviously didn't need. I would highly recommend this food! He loves it...I can even use the kibbles as treats. Combined with Grizzly Salmon Oil, I hope Cooper lives a long and healthy life!

review/summary: Amazing rocket fuel for dogs
review/text: My 6 year old cardigan welsh corgi was originally on Eukanuba, which was recommended by our vet. But she had dry skin, a dull coat and not as much energy as a dog her age should have. She also tended to become a bit overweight on it.<br /><br />Based on a recommendation from a corgi breeder & my own research into the premium brands, I decided to try Orijen. What a difference! Her coat is now quite shiny and healthy looking. No more dry skin. Lots of energy, and she has lost a bit of weight & looks more muscular & healthy overall.<br /><br />She also loves the taste - no problem getting her to eat it. But feed according to how your dog looks, not how much it says on the bag. This is high protein stuff & your dog will gain weight if you feed according to package directions. My 25lb corgi (yes, she's a bit on the petite side), gets only 1/2 cup twice a day.<br /><br />No, the initial purchase price is NOT cheap. But because we feed so much less (no grains or fillers), a bag lasts just as long as what we were spending on Eukanuba. FYI - I just got a bag of their 6 fish food to try & she is wild over it.

review/summary: So far, so good!
review/text: My dog has eaten this food for 19 days. So far he has not gotten an ear infection, but still shows redness on his paws. He loves this food. He somehow could smell it through this lovely packaging and followed me around while it was carying through the house. His appetite also matches the recommended serving suggestion, which is wonderful. I am going to order another bag, so we can see if the paw and mouth allergies go away. He may have a food and environmental allergy as well. I feel good about the ingredients and how my dog responds to the food. I think this bag will end up lasting an entire month or very close to it.<br /><br />The shipping was also super fast, so not only am I happy with the food, but the seller as well!
