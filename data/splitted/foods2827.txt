review/summary: These chips are GREAT
review/text: This chips will save you from eating regular fatty chips. They come in 11 different flavors. I purchase them on a recurring basis to save money. If you want to cut down on calories and keep good taste, these are the chips to buy.  Only 2-3 points per bag on Weight Watchers plan.

review/summary: Still nothing better than a real potato chip
review/text: I had never tried popchips before and was curious so I thought the variety pack would be a good option to try several of the flavors. I love potato chips, but I know all that fried stuff is no good for me, so I tried the popchips. While I found some of the flavors very tasty, especially the spicier ones, I just did not find them to be a replacement for potato chips. I probably wouldn't go out of my way for popchips, but if they were the only thing around, I would eat them.

review/summary: Great snack, but not all the flavors are delicious...
review/text: My girlfriend had tried a pack of the sour cream onion out of a vending machine while we were on vacation and they were delicious.  So, I came to amazon looking for them and stumbled upon this variety pack.  Wanting to try all the flavors offered before I bought a box of one flavor, I decided to purchase this pack.  I am glad I did.  We discovered many flavors we liked.  Unfortunately, in a variety of 11 flavors, there naturally were a few flavors we didn't like.  However, overall it was a pleasant experience.  Now that we know which flavors we like, we will be buying more of those flavors.  Any one who wants to try the Popchip line, I encourage to try this variety pack first.

I am very glad I was able to order this, but ones that I thought I would really like - like jalape&ntilde;o - were not great.  I like the plain, cheddar, salt & vinegar and many others.

review/summary: Surprisingly good chips
review/text: I have been buying popped chips at my Weight Watchers meetings (their brand) and loved them so when I saw these on Amazon, I had to try them. I loved having the assortment to sample--barbeque was my favorite--but they were actually all pretty good. I have not reordered them simply because they have almost doubled in price in just over a month. They were great at 50 cents a bag--I'm not so sure if they'd be as good at almost a dollar.

review/summary: Just Cannot Get Into These
review/text: I bought these because I like chips and saw all the reviews and wanted to have a few small bags of various flavors to snack on. I actually had never tried Pop Chips and that is something I should have done before purchasing such a large quantity. A great many of these flavors and the chips themselves taste terrible to me. I gave them to a few friends to see if it was just me but they were not crazy about some of the flavors either, but they happily took my offerings because; Hey, free chips. They did tell me that there are certain flavors they would never pay for though.<br /><br />Maybe it is because they are not baked or fried, and I am use to other baked and fried potato chips, or maybe they are just too healthy for me, but I am not a fan of these flavored slices of healthy potatoes.

review/text: This is a great tasting item. I like having the variety pack and if you have a family I think the variety would be a positive.  However, for me I am using it to determine which flavor to order next  time.  So far the BBQ has been my favorite but everyone has different tastes.  The chips are crisp and flavorful.  The low fat content is the selling point for me as I love snacks but need to watch what I eat.

review/summary: Certainly healthier than most alternatives
review/text: After DH's heart attack, we've had to make major adjustments in what we eat. The Popchips snacks are the best thing we've found to help us mend our high-fat, high-salt ways. DH was the one who often would sit down and consume half a bag of salty potato chips at a sitting, and he especially missed his crunchy snack, but once I'd get started I was bad about it, too.<br /><br />The single-serve Popchips are perfect for us. DH finds the original potato chip style to be preferable to the stronger-flavored varieties (like the chili lime), but I like having the variety. Also, I think my favorite is the sweet potato, which he can't stomach. To each his own.... I think there are enough of the chips in one bag that two people eating a sandwich and piece of fruit could split a bag to add a little crunch to lunch&mdash;especially if choosing a stronger-flavored one.<br /><br />The variety pack is a great way to discover which types of Popchips you like the best. After that, just order what you like in greater quantities. Popchips are available at our local Ingles, but they cost a whole lot more than they do in the 24-packs here on Amazon. This is an item that would be good to get through Subscribe and Save.

review/text: My title says it all! I am not a snacker but can't leave these alone! Most potato chips are too greasy, too salty, too...too...you get the idea. There are many advertisements for 100 calorie snacks, some which are barely food, but many of these popchips are 100 calories!<br /><br />On the Food Network was a recipe for potatochos, nachos from potato chips. These paks would easily do this or dessert nachos with potato chips and chocolate.<br /><br />I purchased the snack packs because all the flavors are included, many I've never tried, and the smaller size limits the munchies from a run-away snack attacks...I hope! So far I have no preference for flavor...what about you!

I only gave this product a 4 out of 5 becasue the portions are so small.  Because of this, you may need two bags to equal a regular 1 oz bag of your favorite chips.  Size and all, I will purchase again and will adjust to the portion size in my quest for better snack choices and portion control.

review/summary: Great way to sample all the flavors
review/text: This was a fantastic way to sample all of the flavors, and introduce them to my fiance. As it turned out, we really liked all of them except Sweet Potato (but I don't like anything that tastes like extra-sweet sweet potato... it was far sweeter than raw sweet potato to me) and Salt & Vinegar (just not our taste - but I saw lots of reviews that many people LOVE that flavor). Overall, it was a great way to test them out, and super convenient (even took a few bags in our carry-ons on the plane for snacks. I looked at the variety pack options online, but all include at least one of our non-preferred flavors, so I'll have to stick to single bags at the grocery store, or commmit to an Amazon case of a single flavor. I would definitely recommend these for sampling - and especially for families. What isn't one person's taste may be the favorite flavor of another!

I start experience severe pain in Nov of last year and it was sometime during December that my daughter told me that Jennie had recommend Mastic Gum to get rid of her digestive problems. I have always had a problems eating any type of beans, raw vegetables and other food(bloating,flatulence etc). I ordered my gum in December right after the Christmas holiday . My daughter told me that she saw result after a month. I can honestly say that I started seeing result after the first week.  Now a month later I can eat beans, salads and any other type of roughage with-out bloating and most definitely the flatulence. I most certainly will be ordering a larger supply soon.<br />Thanks again!<br />Lola G

review/summary: Rishi is WAY better
review/text: This is a good tea.  The tea is very fine & actually gets through my fine mesh tea strainer.  Rishi makes their bowl tea with big fat leaves, not tea dust compacted together, similar to partical board.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.  I'd give it 3.5 if I could.  Rishi tea is far better.  Right now Amazon isn't offering it.  If you find you are able to try it, please do!  This is a VERY dark tea.  As black if not blacker than coffee!  The flavor is bold and intense.  You will either love it or hate it.  I don't think there is an in-between.  This tea is fermented/composted first giving it it's bold flavor.  Sounds nasty, but it works!  I've also read that this tea is used to support weight loss if your looking for a tea for that purpose.  Not for the faint of heart! By the way, I wouldn't call it a "flowering" tea.  It isn't shaped to open up like a flower.  If you leave it loose in your mug you will have to strain it.  It's in a bowl shape that isn't tied, but individually wrapped in paper.  You must remove the paper to brew it.  A tea brewer or bag is recommended.

review/text: Hirt's Gardens has been a great seller to deal with. The Bahama Berry starter plant is only one of several plants I bought from them and they all came well packed and in very short time. I was unfamiliar with this species but it is stunning as a small leafed variety that takes well to trimming. The leaves are so glossy that I had to grow it out for a while to believe that they weren't sprayed with high gloss shellac. It will mature for a few seasons for the tree to be eligible for a bonsai pot, but it will be worth the wait.

review/summary: bonsai plant
review/text: I placed this order along with 2 other plants from the same seller early part of this month.  After 3 weeks I noticed the leaves becoming brittle and dry.  After receiving the plant I transplanted into a ceramic dish and followed the instructions to keep the soil moist and kept it by the windows with indirect sun.  I contacted the seller recently to inquire on what should be done.  After sending the seller photos of the plant as it is today the seller agreed to refund if the plant does not recover in a couple of weeks.  This is the reason I've rated the seller and this purchase a 4 star based on the seller's customer service.  I know I will purchase from this seller again and the other plants I've purchased are doing very well.

review/summary: Smaller than expected and minus Chervil
review/text: I was a little disappointed to find that the amount of spice is actually quite small. I find it difficult to figure out size and weighting with spices on line because some of it can depend on packaging.  But with the cut of the spices, you really only get about 1.5 T of spices.  Flavors and blend are otherwise good though I was further disappointed to find that this blend lacks Chervil - something I didn't notice before ordering. Had I seen that, I would have ordered a different mix from another company.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: Dogs like the product but it is not a long lasting chew.  My mild chewer who isn't a fan of chews takes only about 1-2 hours to go through the large chew (a size bigger than recommended).  If I gave this to a large aggressive chewer it would have been gone in no time flat.  But since my picky eater enjoys it I will continue to purchase as a treat once in a while (can't afford to buy regularly).  Price is also ridiculously high for what you get.  Especially since the ingredients are very simple and basic.

review/summary: Best safe dog chew that lasts!
review/text: I have a 7 month old cavapoo, he is about 19 pounds.  I have searched high and low for a safe long lasting chew.  I was at a pet expo and decided to give this product a try.  OMG my dog loves these.  It takes him at the least 3 or 4 hours to complete sometimes it seems most of the day.  I occasionally take it away after he's been at it for several hours to give him a break, and then give it back to him later.  I buy the larger ones, there is no smell and usually there are a few tiny pieces to be picked up off of the floor after he's finished.

review/summary: Excellent chew!
review/text: My husky/GSD puppy loves her himalayan chews (we call it her "cheese"). She gets great pleasure gnawing on them, and a large one will last her a week or so. They are supposed to be digestible, but I do find 'bits' in her feces. They don't appear harmful though, and have a smokey scent (not unpleasant). I first found these through bestbullysticks.com, but now buy them wherever I can find the best price as they are rather expensive for what they are (boiled milk and lime juice).<br /><br />Two paws up for the cheese!

review/summary: Lasts a long time and my dog loves it
review/text: My Lhasa-poo loves this treat (though my Cockapoo, who's more picky, does not).  If your dog isn't all that finicky, try giving him/her this treat.  It's long-lasting, odorless (unlike the bully sticks), and consists only of yak milk and lemon juice.  Don't know how that could possibly taste good, but I do know that it lasts for days on end and keeps my dog occupied.  I imagine that it's also great for the teeth. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Misleading Picture and Description
review/text: This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is "russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA".  Notice that this product title starts with "Alaskan Salmon", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of "Grained Salmon Caviar"  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see "made in USA" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was "sorry I was out of town".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.

review/summary: Not exactly what I ordered...
review/text: As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say "Product of USA." This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star.

review/summary: It's organic, but it changed my pie too much
review/text: I used this organic pumpkin in a pie this week.  Normally, I use Libby pumpkin, but wanted to try organic this time.  I prefer Libby.  This organic pumpkin from Farmer's Market really changes a pie.<br /><br />First, the entire texture is different.  It isn't nearly as smooth, and it is a bit dry.  The other ingredients are the same, so I know it's the pumpkin changing my pie's turnout.<br /><br />The flavor is also different.  Oddly enough, it doesn't have as much pumpkin flavor!<br /><br />Honestly, it makes my home-made pumpkin pie taste more like a cheap store-bought.  Really not nearly as good as when I use Libby pumpkin.  I'm say to say this, as I really prefer organic products, but when it changes the texture and flavor this much, I cannot recommend it.  Too bad I still have another can.<br /><br />If you do end up purchasing some to try, I'd recommend adding just a little extra sugar to your pie to help enhance flavors.  Add a little more cinnamon, too.

review/text: I am a Chinese and has more than 10 years' experience of drinking tea.<br />This Ta Hung Pao (means: big red robe) is OK at this price since you don't have much choice in US. A high end Ta hung pao is often green with dark red edge. This is a kind of very cheap one. Actually its cost may not exceed 6 bucks in China. But it still has the golden ring if you brew it correctly which is a symbol of quality.<br />To brew this tea correctly,<br />1.you have to use a pot.<br />2.Warm it and fill it halfly with tealeaf.<br />3.Pour in 95-100 C degree water until immerse tea leaves. Wait for 10-15 secs, steep and discard the tea.<br />4.Pour in 95-100 c degree water again.<br />5.Wait for 1 min and serve.<br />You can have the second steep with longer brew time. Normally from 1:30 to 2:00. The third steep may be OK but it won't last for the forth.

review/summary: good strong oolong
review/text: This is a strongly flavored, astringent oolong tea.  It is reasonably priced (that is priced as a beverage) and the same tea being sold at several times the cost by various vendors pushing it for its weight loss properties. It produces a cloudy, medium brown brew with strong, slightly rough flavor. Oolongs from this particular location are reputed to aid in losing weight.  I prefer smoother oolongs with a lighter, clearer brew, but this is a matter of taste.  This is a good, solid but not inspiring tea.

review/text: This tea is an alright oolong, but it is nothing special. It is definitely not worth the price listed here. Maybe it is worth half that amount. There are much better oolongs out there for a cheaper price. This tea basically lacks character, being neither dark and rich, nor sweet and refreshing. As I have said before, better oolongs are available, even in teabag form, that are far better than this. I barely even touch this tin anymore, because I prefer other oolongs.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009UC09U">Foojoy China Classic Min-nan Oolong Tea - 100 Tea Bags</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JI4SD8">FooJoy Tie Guan Yin Tea - 100 Individually Wrapped Tea Bags (7.0 Oz)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W2VVZY">High Grade Famous Fujian Anxi Golden Oolong (Wu Long) Loose Leaf Tea - Huangjingui Oolong - 3.5 Oz</a>

It looks like dark brown, not glazed tera cotta with a good-sized basket inside for the loose leaves. I went to a local Chinese market, where I asked the owner if he would recommend the tea he personally likes. He pulled a 125 gram, round red tin from the shelf, marked "China Fujian Oolong Tea, Ta-Hung-Pao, Xiamen Tea imp. & exp. Co." He said it makes strong tea, and can be brewed several times.<br /><br />So I tried it today, and I am satisfied.

review/summary: Great Dark Wuyi Rock Oolong at a low price.
review/text: Da Hong Pao is one of the 4 great oolongs of Wuyi. One of the darkest Oolongs and my personal favorites. If you've had Ti Guan Yin or one of the lighter varieties this tea is a significant departure in character.<br /><br />Da Hong Pao is considered by many to be the "King of Teas" and commonly sells for over triple the price of this product. Some very select DHPs sell for over $1000 USD for a tin this size. Understand that this DHP is a lower-end affordable offering. That being said, while not the quality of top shelf DHPs, for many casual US oolong drinkers this would probable be the best price per gram oolong easily available. The flavor is correct in character and invigorating.<br /><br />Be sure to research how to prepare oolong correctly, its a bit more involved then green/black tea preparation. Doing it incorrectly can ruin the flavor of the tea entirely. If you are new to oolong this is great starter tea to practice your oolong making skills. Once you hit the "sweet spot" of temperature, tea amount, and steep time DHP is an amazing tea.

I could not keep paying a lot of money for these quality teas, so I started my search for a cheaper wu-long tea, and that is why I purchased this tea. However, I am not satisifed with it. Even after steeping for a long period of time, the tea was dark but the taste was stale & not rich at all. I bought this because the price was good, and gave it 2 stars because it arrived nicely packaged & quickly. However, I would rather pay more money in the future for a better tasting tea.

review/text: I love Panko bread crumbs.  These are not bad but they do not brown up too well.  They will brown up but by the time they do, your food is way over cooked.  They do give a nice pleasing crunch as is expected with these kind of bread crumbs.  I use this brand in a combo of Panko and regular.  The Panko for a crispness and regular for a light brown color.  All in all they are OK.

review/summary: It's certainly worth a try!
review/text: I've had only Zango mangosteen juice and Thai mangosteen juice previously, so I didn't actually know what pure mangosteen juice was like.<br />It is very much like cocoanut milk. Almost the same color and consistency and an even milder flavor. There is no pulp or plant ground up in it so it is very smooth. Sometimes I drink my dose by itself, other times I mix it in any juice because this mangosteen juice doesn't change the flavor.<br /><br />I've heard alot of health claims about mangosteen, pomegranate and acai but I really can't say it's done anything for me, I've only been taking mangosteen for a couple months. I just enjoy knowing I'm putting the good stuff in my system.<br />I like the Amazon automatic delivery system, too, since I can't find this locally, it saves me time and money.

review/text: I personally know several people who recently tried this new 100 percent mangosteen juice. The juice is "Mangosteen Queen" sold at the mangosteenjuice.ws that is similar to the Dynamic Health Gold mangosteen.<br /><br />These individuals report higher energy levels probably due to sleeping better and disappearance of pains they have had prior to drinking these type of mangosteen juices.<br /><br />One even received comments of looking ten years younger without soliciting for it.<br /><br />I for one lost my suceptibility to allergy due to pollen in the fall; something I have had for many decades. I must admit that I only drank this pure mangosteen for maybe at most 3 days at a time for perhaps 4 times since August due to cost. Drinking it even inconsistently at 1/2 to 2/3 cup a day has its rewards apparently.

Great cup of coffee. In fact, I think the coffee is better than what is in the Senseo pods. These pods are a little thicker, IMO, compared to the others but this means I can sneak another half cup of coffee out of the 2 pods. Would definitely reorder these again.

Really delicious.  I'll be trying the World Blend from the same company as soon as I get my hands on it.<br /><br />Although I didn't really like the idea of the pods being individually wrapped, which adds to the amount of waste, I think I may be a convert, since the coffee stayed lovely and fresh.<br /><br />Finally, I got an unprompted individual response from the company about my shipping preferences after I left feedback for them on Amazon, which certainly goes above and beyond what I expect.

I'd give 4 stars for my personal taste, however, I knew I was not buying the same coffee, so it'd be unfair to downgrade it. It is still good coffee. I will continue buying it.

review/text: I am a "retired" barista and an admitted coffee-snob and until recently would have absolutely refused to even try instant coffee. I've always purchased my coffee fresh roasted from local roasters and insisted on grinding it myself in my burr grinder and preparing it in my bodum french-press; BUT, times are tough, and now more than ever time is money and money is money so I needed to BUCK UP. Between my full time job and full time education, I hardly have time to perform my morning coffee routine and I seldom have the money to buy a $3 cup of burnt coffee from the coffee shop so I needed an alternative. This is it. After reading lots of good reviews I purchased a jar of Nescafe Clasico and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Note: Freeze dried coffee is not, and will never be, as good as fresh coffee from the local coffee roaster. Listening to a CD will never be as good as hearing an orchestra play. But who cares? Fast, cheap coffee is a good thing. I've served this coffee to guests with a little cream and sugar and several have been quite smitten by it actually. So I'll continue to drink it, and I'll listen to CDs and be content.

review/summary: Excellent Alternative...Very Flavorful
review/text: I just recently purchased a jar of this instant at a local discount store.  A couple of days before I had run out of regular ground coffee and had a panic attack.  I decided that I would keep a jar of instant around to keep me off a respirator next time.  I decided after returning home to try a cup of this brew.  I have to confess that its not only been a very long time since I have had instant coffee in the house, but its also been a while since I tasted instant anywhere.  Even though I am sure the quality of instant has changed quite a bit since the days of old, I still know a fresh rich aroma when I smell it, and this coffee has as much a delightful bouquet as most  ground coffee I have smelled.  Its richness of flavor is evident by just cracking the jar open.  I used a little more than a level teaspoon for my first cup and found the brew a little weak.  My second cup was with a heaping teaspoon and the improvement was distinct. (On really heavy mornings, try two, it won't kill ya..: ) I found it nothing less than downright delicious.  Although a lot of folks feel compelled to always say that no instant can compare to fresh brewed, I am going to go out on a limb and say that this Nescafe tastes as good to me as most cups of regular blend, moderately priced coffee available.  (Hills Brothers, Maxwell House, Folders, etc).  It can't compete with a gourmet blend for sure, but against the well known familiar competition, it will give it a darn good run. And of course it is a whole lot faster and convenient. This Nescafe is rather easy to find in most grocery stores.  But if you have trouble locating it, by all means get it here on Amazon by the case.  Its very reasonably priced just about anywhere, and just about the best and most delicious you will locate in an instant around this price range.  Highly recommended....

review/summary: The second best instant coffee around.  But the best value overall.
review/text: I have to admit it.  I love Starbucks Via, but what I don't like is the price.  Dollar for dollar Nescaf&eacute; Cl&aacute;sico is one of the better instant coffees out there.  If you read the reviews, the one done by "The Old Grottomaster" does an excellent job explaining how to best enjoy this coffee.  BTW, it is much cheaper at Wal-Mart, where you can actually pick up huge "family size" jars of this stuff for way less than the Amazon price.<br /><br />As a high school teacher I don't really have time during the day to watch my coffee brewing so I typically take a microwave safe thermal mug full of water, pop it in the microwave for three minutes, add one heaping teaspoon and I'm all set for the morning.  I have tried other brands of instant coffee and in my opinion, this one has the best overall taste.  The taste itself is a bit hard to describe, you know you are drinking coffee but it is just a bit bitter on the back end.  What I think is neat is the hotter the water is you use when you make it = more froth on the top of the mug once you have mixed the coffee in.  I have also tried the instant versions of Caf&eacute; Bustelo and Caf&eacute; Oro.  I believe that those two brands and Cl&aacute;sico are all sourced from Mexico, not that this really matters, though.<br /><br />Caffeine-wise, I wouldn't say this is the strongest coffee out there and if you do some research you will probably find that instant coffees tend to have less caffeine than their brewed counterpart.  But if you want something to warm you up, and you don't have time to brew a pot, give yourself some time to get used to this and I think you will be happy.

review/summary: Poll results: this one beats all others
review/text: I actually conducted an informal POLL of people's opinions of the best instant coffee over on Recipezaar's "Community" chat forum and 8 out of 10 cooks there opted for this one! There were many respondents, 30 or 40, to my poll. I, too, was of that same opinion, having tasted every major instant coffee available. "Taster's Choice" brand was a way-back second place winner. It IS good coffee but it's usually the most expensive brand at the average grocery store.<br /><br />This is one of the few products which is not only the best in quality, it's also nearly the cheapest. I buy mine at The Family Dollar Store chain -- they always have it. The seven-ounce size fits nicely in one's cabinet and last a pretty good while, (I'm the only coffee drinker in my home, 1-2 cups per day). This is usually the size that I buy.<br /><br />If you haven't tried instant coffee in awhile, you should give it a go because it has improved 100% over the years. The key is to make sure that your water is actually BOILING as it is poured into a pre-warmed cup, (just run hot tap water over it for a few seconds). Also, experiment with the amount of coffee that you use. I use one "slightly heaping" teaspoon, (which is a very inexact measure), but you will soon determine how strong or weak you like it.<br /><br />Another tip, treat WATER as an INGREDIENT in any form of cooking! Don't boil plain tap water for your instant coffee -- use pure "spring (bottled) water". Read bottled water labels closely to assure that you're not just buying "purified" water, which usually originates from some polluted river source, (municipal water treatment), and which is a huge bottled water ripoff and a very widespread problem!<br /><br />If you want to go to the ultimate extreme for excellence and you drink your coffee with cream, then use REAL CREAM. It will keep much longer in your refrigerator these days because the producers are now using a process called "ultra-pasteurization" for most brands. Reach into the very back of the cooler at the grocery store and get a good "sell by" date on your dairy products when you buy them. The best dates are always in the back of the inventory because grocers rotate their stock that way.<br /><br />For sweetener, I often use "Pure Organic Tupelo Honey" which is twice as good as common clover honey. It can be obtained online from apiaries in the Florida panhandle.<br /><br />Nescafe is a superior product and a superb bargain and I give it my highest recommendation.

review/summary: GOOD PRICE
review/text: If you like instant this is a good deal.  I priced it at Cub, a local grocery store, and the unit price was about two bucks less.  This tastes fine.  It tastes like instant coffee.

review/summary: Real Nescafe
review/text: This classis Nescafe is better than each and every made-for-US-market freeze dried coffee brand, including Nestle's own. In Europe there is a better version: Nescafe Gold which is superior in taste, pure Arabica. I hope Amazon brings it here for us.

review/summary: Most robust instant coffee
review/text: I chanced upon this product while vacationing in Canada just north of Glacier National Park in Montana.  It is by far the most robust instant coffee I have ever tasted.  No instant coffee can match fresh brewed coffee, but this comes close.  It is full flavored without being bitter (though I do drink all my coffee with generous amounts of milk and sugar.)  I have not been able to find it in any stores where I live in New England so was pleased to find it on Amazon.

review/summary: One of the best
review/text: Other instant coffees tend to give me heartburn, this one does not. It also is one of the best tasting instant coffees I have ever tried. I have served this several times to guests and they were all suprised to find out it was an instant.

review/summary: Just as other reviewers said
review/text: The best instant coffee in US is here- look no further and waste no time with Taster's Choice/other junk brands. I drink instant coffee at home and doing so for last 10 years. This Nescafe Classico is better than anything you can buy at grocery stores.

review/summary: If you want 'instant', try Nescafe's Taster's Choice instead
review/text: I tried this product recently because I was DESPERATE! The grocer was out of Taster's Choice and I really needed my COFFEE! I saw this Clasico stuff and thought that since Nescafe also makes Taster's Choice, maybe Clasico would taste good, too. It doesn't. It tastes like instant 'coffee'. Their Taster's Choice does not like taste like instant (see the reviews). On the space-time continuum of coffee taste, there's instant on the low end, brewed on the high end, and in between, there's Taster's Choice. Clasico is on the crowded low end of instant 'coffee' (oxymoron: instant coffee). Taster's Choice is almost in the brewed category and shouldn't even be called instant.<br /><br />I made a cup of Clasico. It tasted so bad, I immediately threw the whole jar in the trash. I bought it out of desperation, but that didn't mean I had to drink it. Some people genuinely like instant 'coffee' and that's ok. If you are an instant 'coffee' fan, listen to the other reviews and try this. But if you truly prefer brewed coffee, but want the convenience and savings of instant, try Nescafe's Taster's Choice.
