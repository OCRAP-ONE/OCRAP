review/text: There is no finer chocolate in all the world, in my opinion. After I went vegan, I found myself pining for chocolate. Like an idiot, I tried the only thing I could find in the stores, Baker's. Then I discovered Lindt... The thing is, even though this is technically "dark" or "non-milk" chocolate, it tastes like the most divine of milk chocolates. Truly, truly worth the price!

review/summary: Sigh...
review/text: First of all, the positives...<br />The packaging is gorgeous; totally a reusable box for any gift in the future that you want to give someone, if not gifting the Macarons in the first place (wouldn't recommend THESE though).<br />The yellow colored one was by FAR the best tasting in the box- Absolutely delicious.<br />And the texture was PERFECTION- At least on three of the four.<br />And then the negatives...<br />I know that this listing didn't list the flavors in the box, however color is usually a good indication of what's to come...  At least that's what I thought.<br />WRONG!!!  :(<br />As I said above, I really enjoyed the yellow one (which was the last one I ate, thankfully)- The other three though?  Not so much.<br />I literally have NO IDEA what the flavors of ANY of them were...  Once the package arrived, there was no guide, no clue, no nothing.<br />Gotta admit, that was kinda surprising, considering these are hardly a "cheap" dessert, if you catch my drift, especially since so much effort had been placed upon packaging as well.<br />And then, the fact that one of them arrived crushed was quite disappointing...<br />Especially since it was pretty obvious that it was due to mishandling before shipment, considering the box was lined with peanuts for added protection, with no dents or damage visible to the cardboard packaging, or the inside box.<br /><br />Ultimately, disappointing.<br />I really wish your next customer has a good experience.

review/text: Scharffen Berger Mocha (Dark Chocola with Freshly Roasted Coffee) Chocolate Bar (62% Cacao)<br /><br />I am not a big fan of chocolate, nor am I a chocolate connoisseur, but I really like these Mocha chocolate bars. First, they come in the old school chocolate wrappers that use a paper outer labeling with foil for the chocolate itself. There are 400 calories, 30 grams of fat, and 32 grams of sugar carbs in each bar. The bar is labeled as being 62 % cacao. It is mainly dark bittersweet chocolate mixed with Sumatran coffee beans. When chomping on the chocolate, it tastes a lot like dark coffee mixed with dark hot cocoa, and a hint of sweetness. The texture is slightly gritty, not nearly the same as a Nestle Crunch, but you can definitely taste some of the crushed beans.<br /><br />I really liked the packaging, and the fact the chocolate isn't too sweet (although 32 g of sugar per bar is fairly significant).<br /><br />Overall: 5 out of 5 stars, doesn't taste overly sweet like the milk chocolates you buy at the local store.

review/summary: Compares with the best of Switzerland.  MmmmmMMMmmm
review/text: I am fortunate enough to have a daughter who fell in love with a brilliant, dashing Swiss national, and ran away to Live Happily Ever After with her One True Love in a rustic love-nest tucked away amongst the pines of the Snow-Covered Alps. (Well, actually, in an apartment on Av. de Riant-Mont in Lausanne, but whatever...).<br /><br />To ensure my continued forbearance with this situation, I am routinely bribed with the best of Swiss chocolates.  And I am here to tell you that Scharffen Berger holds its own against the best of the best.<br /><br />This chocolate bar is heaven for the lover of bitter-sweet chocolate.  Glossy, dark, aromatic, the texture of this bar is smooth and silky.  The flavor is exquisite, the coffee adding a decidedly interesting punch and a slight crunch to the experience.<br /><br />And I can get this from Amazon???  OH! Thank you, Gods of Chocolate....  No more pining away on the steps of the local Post Office, shivering in the cold, waiting for the next shipment of fine chocolate to arrive from Switzerland...  I can now die a happy woman.  Amen.

review/summary: Artisian Chocolate: Deep Flavored Dark Chocolate with Strong Coffee Bean Bits --- Delicious!  -- No Chemicals - All Natural
review/text: This is a delicious gourmet chocolate bar of dark chocolate with small bits of Sumatran coffee beans in it. The dark chocolate has great flavor and the coffee is a strong taste but it does not overpower or cover up the chocolate's taste. Very nicely balanced!<br /><br />This bar is all natural having few ingredients: cacao beans, sugar, cocoa butter, cofee, non-GMO soy lecithin and whole vanilla beans. This product is gluten free.<br /><br />Scharffen Berger is an American company founded by two California men. Using artisian chocolate making methods they craft chocolate in small batches using the best ingredients from around the world and with vintage European chocolate making equipment.<br /><br />I have seen this company and their methods profiled on television food shows in the past, and what I recall is the committment to high qualiy ingredients and how the founders travel around the world shopping for the best ingredients offered in specific regions.<br /><br />For years this company's chocolate has been used by chefs to make high quality desserts. Scharffen Berger sells many different products now, some for baking and some for savoring as gourmet chocolate candy. Be sure to read the label's product information to learn what that bar is.<br /><br />Knowing the work that went into producing the bars explains and justifies the price.<br /><br />I rate this 5 stars = I Love It.

review/summary: I am liking this chocolate!
review/text: I had not heard of Scharffen Berger chocolate before, so I was looking forward to sample of their Mocha Dark Chocolate with Freshly Roasted Coffee to review.  After trying this product I must say that I really enjoyed it and look forward to eating the rest of the batch.  :)<br /><br />Scharffen Berger Mocha Chocolate is 62% cocoa, which is higher than most mass produced chocolates American eat but not as high as the 70% and 80% cocoa bars I have tried in the past.  As such, this is a dark chocolate but not quite a "bittersweet" chocolate to me.  Those used to consuming milk chocolate may find the taste strong, but I think it is wonderful.  The key differentiation of this product, however, is the introduction of ground fresh roasted coffee to the mix.  The ground coffee adds a bit of graininess to the chocolate and a strong hint of "mocha" flavor, though I don't think it overwhelms the basic chocolate flavor at all.  To me it is a great combination, and I highly recommend Scharffen Berger Mocha Chocolate to dark chocolate lovers.<br /><br />Note: According to Wiki, Scharffen Berger was an independent chocolate producer in the San Fransisco Bay area that was acquired by the Hershey Company in 2005. Scharffen Berger continues to produce chocolate under this name, now at a plant in Illinois.

review/summary: Assertive coffee flavor makes for wonderful baked goods
review/text: I first tried Scharffen Berger's Mocha chocolate when a relative sent it to me in an overseas care package. Normally, I walk right by it in the store due to the high price tag, but it was a much-needed taste of home. I've always loved chocolate-covered espresso beans, and that's pretty much what this bar is: bittersweet chocolate with rough grains of coffee. Because of its texture, I use this in recipes calling for melted chocolate; it makes fantastic mocha pots de creme and is divine as a brownie base (I used this while reviewing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316074284">The Fearless Baker: Scrumptious Cakes, Pies, Cobblers, Cookies, and Quick Breads that You Can Make to Impress Your Friends and Yourself</a>'s mocha cream cheese brownies, and it really added a coffee-packed punch). It's also good as an out-of-hand snack, although as previously mentioned, the ground coffee adds a slight gritty texture that may not appeal to all. The chocolate is visually beautiful; the smooth sheen and clean snap speak to perfect tempering and storage (I was a little afraid that my chocolate had melted during mailing, but it arrived in perfect condition). This one is a winner in your special occasion baked goods (due to the high cost, I use this for holidays and birthdays rather than everyday baking).

review/text: Silky smooth dark chocolate with coffee bits mixed within.  These are fantastic as they are, though I could never eat a whole one in one sitting - breaking off small bits at a time makes an exquisite little snack or reward.  I also took one of the bars, broke it up and added it to some nestle toll house cookies before baking... it wasn't awful, but it also wasn't something I would do again... the coffee made the cookies gritty and gave them a rather burnt flavor.  That has nothing to do with the chocolate bar itself though - I highly recommend them to be eaten as the chocolate bars they were designed to be.

review/summary: For real chocolate lovers!
review/text: I didn't move fast enough to secure the flavor of chocolate I really wanted (you have to be fast in the reviewing world), but this one - Scharffenberger Dark Chocolate With Freshly Brewed Coffee - was a worthy second choice.<br /><br />These varieties of chocolate cater greatly to those who prefer dark chocolate, which, after all, is better for you if you are to believe the experts. Luckily for me, my mother instilled a love of bittersweet/dark chocolate when I was quite small, and while it is a scramble in some circles for the best bits of dark chocolate out of gift boxes or at parties, I generally manage to find my surfeit of the stuff. I'm always looking for new chocolate experiences, however, and some brands are much better than others. Scharffenberger makes an exceptional chocolate, in all the other varieties I've chosen at the store (the ones I'm most familiar with come in small 1 oz bars),so I was happy to try this one.<br /><br />For lovers of chocolate with a shot of coffee, this is the real deal. Little crystals of coffee crunch in your teeth, and the dark (62%) chocolate melts lusciously in your mouth. This is a flavor I will buy again. Very recommended.

review/summary: Melds two of the world's greatest flavors
review/text: Scharffen Berger Mocha (Dark Chocolate w/Freshly Roasted Coffee) Chocolate Bar = !!!! Keeping the superlatives constrained proves a futile task here. Scharffen Berger has melded two of the world's greatest flavors into one amazing confection.<br /><br />The first impression comes from the dark silky chocolate which tantalizes one's taste buds with its rich, silky flavor. Next comes the sensation of Sumatran coffee beans, a taste that lingers a bit longer than the chocolate, rasping gently across the tongue, as both flavors then intertwine in a jolt of goodness.<br /><br />If you have every enjoyed dark chocolate-covered espresso beans, the Scharffen Berger Mocha takes that experience to a much higher level. At about $4 each, these chocolate bars are a splurge. Sometimes a bit of a splurge is good for the soul.

The roasted coffee flavor is strong, but not overwhelming and the chocolate flavor still shines. Although it's dark chocolate, the 62% cacao means it's not incredibly bitter, and is sweet enough to nibble on throughout the day. Delicious!

review/summary: Gritty texture, not satisfying
review/text: While eating this bar, I compared this with two other dark chocolate bars with coffee beans that I regularly eat: Endangered Species Dark Chocolate with Espresso Beans (72%) and Chocolove Coffee Crunch in Dark Chocolate (55%).<br /><br />My first impression of the Scharffen Berger is that the coffee more finely ground, so it's not crunchy like the Endangered Species or Chocolove, but it's not smooth either. It's more similar to the Green & Black (which I didn't have with me to compare while eating the Scharffen Berger so I don't entirely recall). It ends up just making the chocolate feel gritty in my mouth.<br /><br />My next impression is that the bar itself is significantly thinner than other bars, which gives it a softer, smoother texture, but ultimately just ends up emphasizing the gritty texture of the coffee.<br /><br />I also felt like the chocolate itself was a little bit sweet which I attributed to it being a 62% versus the 72% of the Endangered Species. However, the Chocolove is a 55%, which should be too sweet for me, but that chocoloate holds up much better and seems smoother than the Scharffen Berger.<br /><br />My final issue with the Scharffen Berger is that it has a lingering, bitter after-taste that I don't get with the other bars, providing a less-than-satisfying experience that makes me want to go eat or drink something else.<br /><br />Overall, I think the Chocolove and Endangered Species coffee and/or espresso chocolate bars are far superior.

I had a hard time not scoffing an entire bar down at once! However, my kids and husband did not share my enthusiasm. The kids felt it was too bitter and not sweet enough.  The husband made a comment about chocolate mixed with old Starbucks grounds, and left me to consume the rest of the stash alone. To me, these bars are far better tasting than the typical waxy American fare, which contains little actual cocoa and too much sugar.  If your tastes run similarly, you will love these mocha bars.

review/summary: Nice blend of semi-sweet dark chocolate and Sumatran coffee
review/text: This is tasty semi-sweet dark chocolate with grounded Sumatran coffee beans blended in. You definitely crunch the taste and taste the crunch but it is a very mild crunch. The taste is great if you like dark chocolate, coffee and sugar. It has 62% cacao. I liked it!<br /><br />The six-pack of individual bars is wrapped in see-through material as an extra layer of protection but it is easy to open. The color of the paper wrapper looks nice and earthy, it makes it look more fancy in a good way.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, well this is a dessert. The whole bar is 400 calories. The label has a serving size of half a bar. However, if you have self-control you can easily turn it into eight servings or so.<br /><br />The chocolate bar itself has a design of its own, with the Scharffen logo in the middle. It is not the usual row of squares. This can be a little bit of a challenge if you are planning to share with other people, since you can't just break a square or a row. The design pattern is made of triangles with a trapezoid (parallelogram?) in the middle. It might be easier to try to break it along the grooves of the patterns, resulting in triangle-shaped pieces.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is good for you, but make no mistake, this is a dessert, with 400 calories total, and nearly equal parts fat and sugar :) The whole bar has 32g of sugars, 8g of dietary fiber, 6g of protein, 30g of fat (20g of which are saturated), and 16% iron. A very bright spot: 0% sodium and 0mg cholesterol! (this is by multiplying the serving size by two; actual numbers may vary slightly since they label numbers are rounded)<br /><br />The list of ingredients is so short: cacao beans, sugar, cocoa butter, coffee, non-gmo soy lecithin, and whole vanilla beans.<br /><br />So if you have the discipline to eat only a triangle every time, this is very reasonable nutrition-wise. I do not :)

review/text: You can never get enough chocolate and this rich, luscious bar more than satisfies both the chocolate lover and the coffee lover.  It's made in Illinois with quality, all-natural ingredients and has a subtle, sophisticated taste that is both interesting and more importantly, delicious.  The chocolate and the coffee flavors come through vividly but without the cloyingly sweet taste and waxy feel which is so common to commercial candy bars.  The finely ground Sumatran coffee gives the bar a nice, slightly crunchy texture which contributes to its appeal.  This is candy for grown-ups.<br /><br />Scharffen Berger has created a bar which is equal to the finest European chocolates and of which they can rightly be proud.

review/text: Let's face it, once you reach a certain age mike chocolate can taste just a little too sweet.  I think sometimes that's why dark chocolate was invented.  There's been a boom recently in the availability of dark chocolates with high cacao content.  I have never really tried one until this Scharffen Berger bar (I stuck with the ones that came in sampler boxes or brand names.)  I loved the bitter and slightly sweet of this bar.  The addition of the roasted coffee was a pleasant twist from your average "coffee flavoring."  If you like your coffee strong and your chocolate strong, you can't go wrong with this little gem.  Children beware:  mine frowned at the taste.  Of course mom and dad loved every bite.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Scharffen Berger is American Chocolate at its finest. These are about as removed from your typical Hershey's bar as possible (even though the company is now owned by Hershey's). The taste is less sweet and more refined than your typical chocolate. Although I don't have the vocabulary to describe it's taste as well as I'd like, I will make an attempt. The chocolate, at first bite, is subtle and not very sweet at all, but then once the you crunch the coffee beans, the chocolate, along with the beans, give a nicely sweet but not cloying taste that is both delicious and unique. My guess is that most premium chocolate fans will fall in love with this tasty treat like I did.

review/summary: Well balanced Dark Chocolate and Coffee
review/text: I love dark chocolate and especially the trend to use high levels of Cacao. I also love coffee, perhaps even more than chocolate. Scharffen Berger Mocha is a balanced dark chocolate. It is strong, but not painfully strong to any dark chocolate lover. A fair amount of ground coffee is in the chocolate contributes to the bitterness, but is also not over the top. It might not be for anyone that doesn't like the texture of coffee grounds, but I enjoyed it. Finally, it is worth knowing the process and that it is made with a minimal number of ingredients. Now I just have to try not to eat all six bars in a week.

review/summary: It's a good chocolate bar, but a bit pricy for what it is
review/text: This is a quality mocha dark chocolate bar.  The bar is a good size, the ingredients are decant quality and the coffee beans aren't too much, except for the fact I don't like the little grounds still left in my mouth after chewing it up.  I also like their logo and the way the chocolate bar is sectioned.  Yet these bars are a bit pricy for what they are, but maybe they are only pricy because of their tie in with The Bigger Loser, hoping to cash in on that name.  I haven't tried it in cooking, but I would assume if you need a mocha bar for a dessert recipe this one would work well.  I like the wake up feeling it gives me too, like having a cup of Joe, but not.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I get a before taste that I don't like it this bar, like I am eating old coffee that's been sitting around, like that weird oily cold coffee taste...it's enough for me to drop it down a star.  The chocolate part is great, since I love dark chocolate and I like that it is a small company...but I think the coffee in this bar could be smoother overall.

review/summary: Coffee lover and chocolate cravings satisfaction in a bar
review/text: I am an admitted coffee junkie and I also love the taste of dark chocolate so this candy bar intrigued me but I feared it would disappoint as so many other coffee infused bars have. This one was a GREAT surprise for my taste buds and I loved the rich coffee taste with the creamy dark chocolate melting on my tongue. The light crispy crunch from the crushed coffee beans was a NICE surprise and made it enjoyable.  I have savored a bar over several days as it is very rich and I can only eat so much at a time and my craving is satisfied. I HIGHLY recommend these for the coffee/chocolate lovers in your life.

review/summary: I would not pay for it
review/text: I was very excited to receive this chocolate. I love dark chocolate and I love the smell and flavor of coffee. However I found taste and especially texture of this chocolate to be average and not superb. Chocolate is very plastic-y and coffee grinds are too large - they get stuck in your teeth and you just keep spitting them out 30 minuted after you had a piece of this bar. I understand they were going to rustic artisan feel, but this is a miss. There is better dark chocolate out there, including the ones that are made out of high quality ingredients, including coffee.

review/summary: Dark, dark chocolate.  Coffee.  Absolutely perfect for me.
review/text: I love dark chocolate.  I love coffee.  So a product that mixes the two?  Oh, yeah.  Sign me up.<br /><br />My verdict?  This is fabulous.  I thought the combination of flavors was about perfect, and loved the somewhat gritty texture of the coffee beans.<br /><br />My biggest concern was that this is outrageously expensive... $4 for one candy bar, based on the current Amazon price.  However, this is easily broken into eight triangular pieces, and *I* found that one of those pieces was exactly perfect as a serving, leaving me feeling far more satisfied than a drug-store candy bar ever does.<br /><br />I shared ONE bar with my husband, who also really liked this.  He said it was like eating dark chocolate while breathing in the aroma of an excellent cup of coffee.  He didn't feel it tasted like coffee exactly.  He felt it tasted as wonderful as coffee smells...<br /><br />I refused to share with my kids.  They probably would like this as well, but this is MY treat.<br /><br />If you don't like dark chocolate, you probably want to look at a different variety.  But this is a quality product.

review/summary: Chocolate for grownups
review/text: Gourmet chocolate is everywhere, and I try as much of it as I possibly can.  I have a bias toward dark chocolate, and I am a big Mocha fan.  However, if you think you are going to get a Mocha Frappuccino in a candy bar, think again.<br /><br />This is serious dark chocolate with little bits of coffee beans in every bite.  Do not eat it before bed (I learned the hard way).  I would say taking a bite of this chocolate is every bit as stimulating as a cup of coffee.<br /><br />The taste is great, not too sweet, with the smoothness of the chocolate providing a perfect counterpoint to the slight crunchiness of the coffee.  To me it is much more satisfying (and less dramatic) than munching on chocolate covered coffee beans.  It is, in fact, the best combination of chocolate and coffee that I have found, in any format.

review/summary: A Win for Dark Chocolate Lovers
review/text: 4.5 stars out of 5<br />The flavor of this dark chocolate bar with coffee is fabulous.  It isn't very sweet and it doesn't need to be because the chocolate and coffee flavors stand on their own. The chocolate is smooth, rich, melt-in-the-mouth delicious.  The coffee flavor is strong, but the chocolate is so good that the coffee doesn't overpower it as it does in some other coffee/chocolate bars I've tried.  Some of the ground coffee beans felt just a bit too gritty (or perhaps crunchy is a better choice of words) for my tastes, but I've had other bars that are much grittier/crunchier than this one.  A small piece of this high quality chocolate is much more satisfying than a large piece of a sugar- and additive-laden alternative.  I'm a fan!

review/summary: Very overpowering, overpriced
review/text: I LOVE me some good chocolate, and you simply can't go wrong with good, dark chocolate. I was surprised however, to note that this is not in that category. Some people may be fooled by the name, Scharffen Berger which at first sounds very European. However, flip the package over and note: made in Illinois. I have never found American chocolate to equal anything found in Europe or Russia. But anyway, regarding the taste: It is very strong. The coffee beans easily overpower the nice, dark chocolate flavor, leaving your taste buds somewhat confused. It is only 62% Cocao but it feels more bitter. I am not a coffee fan at all, but I've always loved mocha-infused anything in my chocolate, but this is just way too strong. It could also have to do with the vanilla beans. The flavors just don't add up as nicely as I imagined. Oh, and another thing to note: If you eat one entire bar, you have reached your entire saturated fat limit-for the whole day! Two servings in a pack= 400 calories. And it's not even that good of a chocolate bar to indulge! And lastly, at $25 for 6 bars- So not worth it.

review/text: Pieces can be large so I break them up but there are also smaller pieces and some powder.You should keep it in the original package and take out a week's worth or so at a time and store in a jar or plastic container as it can get stale once out of the original package. The 4 oz size is pretty large, like a large yogurt container.<br />Be careful about forgetting them in your pocket they can stink things up if left there for months. (Some other brands come from china, I like that these are made in the USA)

review/summary: Bad Odor
review/text: In February of 2010 I ordered a 14 oz canister of Pro-Treat Freeze dried chicken liver dog treats.I had been giving another brand of freeze dried chicken liver treats to both my dog and cat. They both loved these treats. When I opened my new Pro-Treats freeze dried liver treats I smelled an odd odor. My cat would not eat these new treats. My dog did eat these treats  but every morning he started throwing up. I stopped giving these treats to my dog and he stopped getting sick. The liver treats may or may not have been responsible for my dog getting sick but I didn't want to take a chance of my dog getting sink again.

review/summary: Better shipped in smaller size container:
review/text: Our dogs and cat love these liver treats. They are solid enough to keep their shape in training pouches, yet soft enough to break into smaller pieces. Unfortunately, because of their softness, when shipped in the larger-size container, the pieces breakdown into dust before arrival, so you really don't get too many more actual pieces than you get with the smaller container.<br /><br />They are "real" rather than processed, and appeal more to the animals that way. They last a long time (at least 2 months). I heartily recommend them.

review/summary: My dogs love it!
review/text: I bought these as a healthier training treat for my dogs.  They absolutely love it!  In fact, they love it so much that I have to post a warning: Dogs love this stuff so much they'll do almost anything to get to it!<br /><br />When this product was delivered we did not hear the delivery van arrive.  As usual he put the box next to our side door.  When we came home later that day, I let the dogs out into the back yard to romp and do their business.  I heard a little growling going on so I went out to check on them to find that the dogs had found the delivered box of treats and proceeded to rip the box open and then they opened the bucket (It's a pretty weak lid but I believe they would have eaten the bucket if the lid didn't come off so easily) and they devoured about 1/3 of the bucket! Three days later, I had this bucket o'treats on top of my buffet where I dispensed it for dog training sessions in the house. (I leave dog treat bags in this spot regularly and they've never tried to take them before.) We were gone for the afternoon and the dogs decided to go counter surfing for it this time and ate a bunch more right out of the bucket.  Because this treat is so rich, they were not feeling well after it happened!  So do not leave this treat out where it can be reached!  It's too tempting for the dogs. And man, oh man, if you need a high value treat to work with your dog this one really does the trick for mine.

review/summary: GREAT INCENTIVE TO GET DOGS EATING DRY FOOD!
review/text: As you have probably read, these treats are not like most others.  You cannot overindulge your pup with them because of their richness.  They are very light, but need to be given SPARINGLY.  I use tiny pieces of these as special treats for my "Charly," who adores them. Want to know a trick?  For those of you trying to get your dogs to eat more dry than wet food, take a few of the liver treats and literally crush the suckers into a powder.  It takes a while to do it in your hands, but you can always use anything in the kitchen to help.  Anyhoo....sprinkle just the bit over the dry dog food and VOILA!  I bet your dog will eat up the bowl.  Again, most dogs ADORE these Stewart's liver treats, so the smallest amount sprinkled will do the trick.<br /><br />My friend is a dog/cat rescuer and turned me onto Stewart's - not only because they are really good, but also because they are made in the U.S.A.  That means a lot when it comes to our pet products.<br /><br />My treats came very fast, too!!!  It's much more economical to get the larger tub and it will last a long, long time.  Or consider sharing wwith another dog lover!

review/text: I received this in a trade from one of our members who put together a variety pack. I agree with our first reviewer that this is a delicious coffee. I brewed mine on the 7.25 cup setting and added liquid creamer and sugar substitute. It was strong but not to strong at that cup size. you first sense the vanilla then the caramel become more noticeable in the "after taste". What really impressed was no acidic bitter lingering after taste. Though I'm not a big fan of Caramel, I would recommend this great coffee

Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for me and my wife this coffee is delicious.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: Carefully check the price before you order this coffee from any seller. A box of 24 cups should cost less than fourteen dollars exclusive of shipping, and further discounts are available if you order multiple boxes, including free shipping.

Gotta love the price here on Amazon as well! It's technically $2 cheaper as a member on the Keurig site, but they charge almost $7 for shipping!

review/summary: Our favorite of all time, but much too expensive here. Look elsewhere for better prices
review/text: Two years of trying just about every coffee offered in k-cups, and this flavor is, by far, our favorite. We keep it stocked in the pantry at all times. Our second favorite is a seasonal flavor, Island Coconut, and we look forward to that being available usually in the Spring.<br /><br />K-cup prices vary, not only from different sellers, but at different times. However, it seems that Amazon's prices are always sky high compared to other places. Prime membership or not, the prices here aren't doing you any favors. If you like this coffee, hunt around. I get free shipping, next day delivery, and pay $12.50/box of 24 or less no matter what brand or flavor I'm ordering. Sorry, Amazon, while I do most of my shopping with you in all categories, this isn't one of them even though I keep checking back and hoping your prices on k-cups become more competitive.

review/text: Well, it's my fault. I am so used to K-cups (from Amazon) coming in 2 24 cup orders, I assumed that the Green Mountain was the same. NOT! That makes this about twice the cost of every other brand. The coffee tastes pretty good, not great. There are too many other options like Van Houtte Spicy Mayan Chocolate or Cr&egrave;me Caramel, and when you subscribe they are less that 50 cents a cup. Anyway, I learned to be more careful. Buying this once was worth the lesson, but not the coffee. Just my two cents, of which I have fewer now :)

Smells great while brewing but then again they pretty much all do!  Green mountain is one of my favorite brands and this flavor is good but not great.  I might order it again.

The kind who likes a caramel latte type afternoon fix once in a while?<br /><br />Well, when you stick this pod in your Keurig and hit the button, you will be rewarded with exactly what the product title claims. Notes of caramel, vanilla, and cream burst forth from the machine and make for a delicious drink.<br /><br />But I realized quickly that I probably couldn't drink this every single day. I like the sweet stuff, but beyond a point, all that goodness can be a little cloying. I recommend getting this, but you'll probably also want straight up regular coffee pods to mix it up.
