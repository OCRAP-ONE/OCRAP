review/summary: Best mint I can't find
review/text: When these mints were first available, they were everywhere; and a bit on the expensive side. The peppermint flavor was especially strong and is my favorite. Now,I can't find them anywhere. Most don't even carry the brand but have plenty of Eclipse gum. Amazon had these mints in larger size boxes at an affordable price. I'm happy to have especially fresh breath again thanks to Eclipse Mints and Amazon.

review/text: Like the other reviews, stores in my area stopped selling them and I was beginning to panic until I found them on Amazon!  Thank you so much Amazon!!  I bought 2 cases right away and will continue to purchase them.  Hopefully Eclipse will never discontinue the peppermint flavor.  Wintergreen just doesn't do it for me and I can't chew gum because of TMJ.  The peppermint is the strongest mint around and the only one that works for me.  Believe me, I've tried them all!  You won't regret purchasing these!

review/text: I can never find these mints in stores anymore.  Target was the last to carry them, and now they are only on the shelf sporadically.  Other flavors are never a problem to find, but Peppermint...that is a different story.  Amazon has the best price, almost the same as what Target was selling them for, and it is just easier to have them shipped home rather than going on a hunting trip for them.

review/summary: Worked very well read for more info
review/text: A few years ago we moved into a house that had not had a well maintained lawn for many years, it was over run with every kind of weed imaginable, and I tried every thing I could think of, wanting to stay organic I avoided herbicides but nothing was working all that well some would get rid of a few but others would just take there place, it was so bad there was literally no room for grass to take off from<br /><br />I did a lot of research and talked to a few people and several recommended weed b gone at the store I couldn't find just weed b gone but I could find weed b gone max I bought a bottle with a sprayer and several refill bottles the first year it took me 5 refills to  completely rid the place of weeds, but I was so surprised, I sprayed the yard and within a week all the weeds had already started to show signs of weakness I was so happy I wanted to dance !<br /><br />The second year 3 bottles and I finally had the weeds mostly under control so I could replant grass seed, finally !<br /><br />this year 1 1/2 bottle and the weeds are mostly gone besides some clover which dies but for some reason quickly comes back but in much smaller quantities, either way I am so happy with this product, we finally have a yard again<br /><br />I counter several days after spraying with fish emulation fertilizer in a hose end sprayer dropped at 51/2 oz's which brings the soil back to its best, at this point I'm expecting next year I should only have to spot spray weed b gone<br /><br />I highly recommend this product for serious weed issues, but do advise that if you can use a organic method with small weed issues do so, as the chemicals placed in the ground will eliminate beneficial microbes and worms which is very bad over a long period of time, and can cause many issues so if you choose to use some thing like this counter it with a good organic fertilizer that will help feed and repopulate those microbes

review/summary: Good, but has a different behavior than traditional 3-way mixes..
review/text: I've used this product (a mcpa, dicamba, triclopyr mix) for several years now, and I find it has some pros, and some cons compared with a traditional 2,4-d/mcpp/dicamba mixes (and possibly newer mixes). Loving it or hating it will depend on your weeds.<br /><br />On the plus side, it has triclopyr, and because of this it does much better against wild violet, creeping charlie, and Oxalis/sorrel than the old-school mixes (which have no affect at all on the first 2).<br /><br />On the down side, it seems control most of the common weeds that 2,4-d does well against, but it takes a lot longer to kill them, and may require two passes to do it. (ie: dandelion, plantain, clover)<br /><br />My old house had wild violet problems, and my new house has creeping woodsorrel problems. I love this product because it is effective against those troublesome weeds that so few other products kill.<br /><br />Of course, we now in 2012 have a whole new set of "plus crabgrass" mixes coming out, based on 2,4-d, dicamba and quinclorac (and one brand adding sulfentrazone to the mix). The quinclorac gives them control of grassy weeds previously untouched by post-emergent sprays, and the sulfentrazone takes that further (nutsedge!). The quinclorac should also be at least somewhat effective against wild violet, but I suspect that the lack of mcpa/mcpp may cause them to have a different set of common weeds they won't work on. Time will tell as these are somewhat newer herbicides and a lot of detailed herbicide guides don't cover them yet..<br /><br />Moral of the story: No weed killer is perfect and will kill every weed without killing your lawn too. If you have a weed in your yard you can't kill, find out what it is (plenty of picture guides on the web), find out what kills it, and buy a product with the right ingredients.

review/text: This product was sold to me as a replacement for Killex. Well let me tell you it does not perform  the same. I followed the instructions to the letter and now a week later the weeds are just starting to bearly die off. With Killex over the same time frame the weeds would be dead and gone. The only reason I purchased this product is we can no longer buy Killex.

review/summary: What is the point?
review/text: I bought a bottle of concentrate from Lowe's and diluted it according to instructions to spot-kill dandelions.  I can see that it kills them, but it is a slow death; before dying, they have time to produce more flowers, which go to seed unless I pick them right away.  So what is the point?  If I miss one seedhead, that is enough to "replenish" my lawn with dandelions!  There has to be a better way, or a better product!

review/text: I've sprayed twice now over several weeks and still the dandelions bloom.  I pluck the flowers diligently, hoping the spray will eventually kill them, but that doesn't ever seem to happen.  The plant itself looks a little worse off, but if it is dying, it is taking the slow, painful route.  I'm now in the process of plucking the flowers again while I search for a better quality product.

The same weeds were thriving. The products says it kills over 200 weeds. I'll be returning this product.

review/text: I love coffee. I love iced coffee a lot too and usually get mine at Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks. I've really been shedding out some dough for my iced coffee fix this summer and a friend of mine told me about Inventi. This stuff is good! All I do is two short squirts, add milk, ice and stir and I think it tastes better than what they make me at the coffee shop. It has a robust coffee taste and so easy to make at home on my way out the door to work in the morning. I did the math and it's only about 35 cents a cup which is like less than K-cups (I have one of those machines too). I'm gonna tell my friends about this... never seen anything like it. I hope they come out with more flavors soon!

review/summary: Really good stuff!
review/text: I was a little skeptical at first. I wasn't sure what 2 "squirts" really meant.  So before I ordered, I emailed the company and asked about the product. The can contains 35 servings at 1 teaspoon per serving. So I measured it out and it works perfect using my coffee scoop to squirt it into and then pour that into a glass.<br />Then I wanted to know about the caffeine content. Because if you are like me you don't just drink coffee for taste. So I found out that each serving contains 38 mg of caffeine. About the same as a cup of coffee but definitely not as much as a 12 oz. cup at a coffee shop. So if you like strong coffee you will have to use more. If you can get the 2 for 1 deal it makes it much less expensive.<br />The taste is great, I think. I love it as an iced coffee mix. And it seems to give me what I need for the morning lift. I am now squirting some right into my brewed coffee, because it gives it a great taste, and also a little extra caffeine. After that my day is going great!

review/summary: If only it came unsweetened
review/text: I wanted to love this product, I really did. The company is awesome to deal with. It's a great price. I love the easy to use can. I just don't like how it tastes.<br /><br />The problem for me is that this coffee is presweetened. I knew that going in, but when I tried it, I found it was too much for me. Another factor is that saccharin is not my coffee sweetener of choice.<br /><br />I plan to keep an eye on this company in the future. As soon as there's an unsweetened option, I'm so there.

review/text: Don't let the lower price fool you.  This stuff is easily as good as other brands of greek coffee.  In fact, it's my favourite!  It has an almost chocolatey taste to it.  Smooth and wonderful.<br /><br />To make the best coffee, pick up a stainless steel maker like this one: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RZWIY8">Stainless Steel Turkish Coffee Pot (14 fluid Oz)</a>  Not as pretty as the copper ones, but it makes a great coffee and it will last forever.<br /><br />Per coffee, medium-sweet: one demitasse cold water, two teaspoons coffee, two teaspoons sugar.  Apply medium heat on gas, high heat on electric.  Stir once after it's started to warm up a bit.  When coffee starts to rise, let it get close to the top, then remove from heat.  Let sit for 30 seconds, then pour into demitasse cup(s), with a slight rocking motion to get the froth off the inside of the pot.  Cheers!

review/summary: Coffee from the Cradle of Civilization
review/text: BRAVO Greek coffee is NOT FOR THE WEAK! It's quite potent, so read and follow the directions carefully. I've put one teaspoon each of coffee powder&sugar into a cup after adding hot water... and it's incredibly kicky. I've put Turkish-style coffee (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UGLYWC">Cafe Najjar Classic Turkish-style Ground Coffee 450g (1 Lbs) (Lebanon) (Pack of 10)</a> through the regular auto drip, treating it like other ground coffee... and let's just say it was a major wake up call! It makes Starbucks taste like weak sauce in comparison.<br /><br />Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, from Plato  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0872203492">Plato Complete Works</a>) to Aristotle (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375757996">The Basic Works of Aristotle (Modern Library Classics)</a>), the works of Euripides, the first modern psychological playwright (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140446680">Electra and Other Plays: Euripides (Penguin Classics)</a>), Sophocles who gave us the Oedipus complex (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140444254">The Three Theban Plays: Antigone; Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus</a>) The ancient Greeks gave us their mythology, their philosophical insights, their politics. Opera diva Maria Callas, pundit George Stephanopoulos, shock singer Diamanda Galas, all have Greek heritage.<br /><br />This coffee is best served with some tranquil Greek music (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00022LS8O">Putumayo Presents Greece: A Musical Odyssey</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEVZ5I">Gentle World: Santorini Splendor</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFL36A">MUSIC FROM THE WINE LANDS</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IAIC">A Mediterranean Odyssey: Athens To Andalucia</a>) In "Music from the Wine Lands",the late Greek diva Vicky Moscholiou compares herself to strong coffee in the song "O Cafes." Her song certainly fits BRAVO's tough blend!<br /><br />Drink deep!

review/text: ...I bought these because Amazon was running a "buy $59, get $25 off sale" -- which made these Jack Link products cheaper than the geletan-bound pre-fab dog treats available at the pet store.  About 1/2 the price per ounce, actually.<br /><br />And of course the pups think they've been run over by the "Good Dog Truck."  Before you write angry rebuttals telling me how these are not good for dogs, let me assure you they really are "treats" for especially good (and sometimes rare) behavior-- and I snip each stick into button-sized rounds with my kitchen shears so they go a long way.<br /><br />It's the smell that gets them.  Actual meat that was once on an animal.  Mmmmmm-mmm-mmmm.<br /><br />And for me -- like walking by a bakery.  The smell is more than enough, thanks.

review/summary: True Black Walnut Taste
review/text: Upon first opening the box the bottles came in I thought they had sent the wrong product and not the black walnut flavoring I had ordered. Then upon opening one of the bottles I was convinced they had sent the wrong item even though the labels stated it was black walnut flavoring. I decided to give it a try before sending a complaint into Amazon and so I did. When hubby and I were growing up on the upper eastside of Manhattan during the 1950-1970 era there was a neighborhood bakery called Cushmans that made the most fabulous Maple Walnut Layer Cake you would ever want to taste. Unfortunately they went out of business as the neighborhood changed and high rise buildings began to shoot up all over. Over the ensuing years we had bought cakes from all different places that proposed to be Maple Walnut but none ever compared to Cushmans. Well, I mixed up a plain flavored cake recipe and added some of both the Black Walnut and some Maple flavoring to the batter and baked it up, the kitchen smelled heavenly. I took out the layers and left them to cool and mixed up a frosting adding both the flavors to that too and when cooled I frosted the layers and then whole cake with it, then I covered the sides with finely chopped walnuts to make my lousy frosting job look a bit nicer. I chilled the cake for a bit to set the frosting and when we finally cut into it we were overjoyed, it tasted almost exactly as the old Maple Walnut Cake from our youth. So if you order this flavoring don't go by the smell when you open it, when used it tastes exactly as black walnuts do and we are very happy to have this on hand to bring back fond memories of a simpler life!

review/summary: Good for sensitive puppy
review/text: We recently adopted a shih tzu puppy and found very quickly that he didn't do well with chicken or turkey based foods.  We had tried several kinds with bad results so we moved on to this and are having wonderful results.  Even for a tiny puppy,  the kibble is a nice shape for meals and treats.  He loves it too which make it an even bigger winner.  I intend to keep him on it for at least several more months and then try the venison with sweet potatoes.  I love the way I can keep him on this from puppy to adult!  Great food.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-31-2011: Sheldon has been on this now for several months and doing OK, but I noticed that he seemed kind of hyper.  I was just excusing that to being a puppy but then we tried some turkey based food again and it agreed with him now.  Plus, he was calmer!  I checked out the dog food review website and the Natural Balance Limited Ingredient line only gets 3 stars because of the high carbs...58%, which is way too high to keep him on indefinitely.  I believe that the excess of rice added to pet foods is responsible for the epidemic of diabetes in our pets. I am in the process of changing him to the Castor and Pollux Ultramix which he loves and is doing great on AND is only 48% carbs with a 5 star rating.  They also have a grain free variety which we will work our way up to.

review/summary: Yummy Weight Loss?
review/text: OK - So I admit, I bought this for the possibility to lose weight with zero effort. I am not overweight at all but have ZERO muscle and a few curves I am not proud of. Anyway, my hopes were low but I figured I would have a healthy caffeinated tea in the long-run. So I have been drinking it for 2-3 weeks now and I don't think the scale is lying but I have lost about 5 lbs. Now, I understand that many factors could have caused this but I am pretty sure my eating habits have stayed the same. I still don't drink coffee or soda and I definitely don't exercise. I have not been drinking as much alcohol as I was during Football season so I know that might be a factor.<br /><br />Bottom line is that I know anything could have caused the weight loss but the only thing that I have done drastically different is drink 1-2 cups of this tea per day. It tastes great (hot not cold or warm), gives me a healthy pep and focus, and I have not seen the scale consistently this low in a couple of years. Not to mention is comes nicely packaged. You can't go wrong here and I highly recommend it.

I have had some oolong/wulong teas that tasted like steeped twigs.  This is not one of them.  If you steep this tea for less than 3 minutes, you can still get a good tasting cup of tea from a second brewing with the same tea bag.  If you don't microwave (or boil) your tea water with the tea bag in it, you can even get a pretty decent third cup of tea!  You'll find that when you are brewing a pot of tea for yourself & friends, you will only need 1 or 2 bags to make a whole pot!

This tea is characteristic of the biscuity quality found in many oolongs. It isn't astringent. Sweetener is not needed. It is a very good tea for every day.

review/summary: Fantastic Tea!
review/text: This is one of the best teas I have had.  I have tried a variety of Oolong teas, and this is by far the best flavored Oolong tea I have had.  It is rich without being strong, and smooth.  Add a bit of skim milk or soy milk to give it just a touch of sweetness.  The Prince of Peace Organic White Tea is also a superior tea.  These are sold at reasonable prices.

review/summary: Nice tea
review/text: I'm not a huge tea drinker (coffee every day) but I do enjoy black tea, Earl Grey, and Chai tea. This tea is nice addition. I bought it because I'd heard good things about it including Dr. Oz recommending it. At that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on Amazon do I buy. I bought three. They are all very similar in flavor, require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good. They are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being the lightest. I've never had oolong tea in a restaurant so I can't compare to that but I didn't find it to taste like dirt.

review/summary: Addictive Oolong that doesn't break the bank
review/text: Prince of Peace has hit it out of the ballpark with this economical organic Fujian Oolong tea in unbleached bags.  This is consumed throughout the day in my home and we are not in the least bit jittery as often happens with the semi-fermented type of tea that nears black in its caffeine content.  Amazon offers the best price so far and we highly recommend the Prince of Peace Organic Oolong in the 100 count box!

review/text: I purchased this tea a few months ago, and have been loving the flavor of it. However, of the 40 tea bags I've used, 4 have not been completely sealed along the side of the tea bag, causing tea to spill everywhere when I open the package or to leak pieces of tea leaves into my cup. With the price and taste, the tea's certainly still worth it, but you may need to be careful when you open the individual tea bags!

review/text: Uh, this tea takes some getting used to.<br />At first I was a little disappointed in the taste but it does grow on you.<br />It has an 'EARTHY' taste and that's just the nicest word I could come up with to replace the word DIRT.  It actually tastes like dirt.<br />(I guess what I mean is that it TASTES the way dirt SMELLS.)<br /><br />Except for the dirt that I've actually eaten and it does taste a lot like that.<br />Nah, it just needs something.<br />Like honey or some other sweetener and then it's pretty good.<br />Then it tastes like SWEET dirt.<br />I swear I'm not trying to be funny.  It's just an interesting flavor.<br />I have steeped it several different ways (sometimes with another flavor of tea) for variety.<br />Like I said, now that I'm 'used' to it, it's actually pretty good. But my senses always take me directly to DIRT when I take that first sip.<br /><br />Enjoy! :)

review/summary: Best oolong tea ever
review/text: I love this tea, it is awesome. I actually was sick and the only tea I had in my house was green and oolong tea. I decided to take the oolong tea and I was shocked that I was feeling better internally and externally, my clothes was fitting me differently. My appetite was curbed alot. I hardly was hungry. I honestly drink 4-6 cups of this tea a day and still drinking it till this day. I haven't hopped on the scale yet I am going to wait until next month to see how much weight I have lost. Since my cold is over with I will start back going to my Zumba classes this week and I am pretty sure the results will be more outstanding. And of course eating clean that is the most important factor when losing weight. So I decided to have 2 cups of oolong tea before each meal. I will have oolong tea in my diet forever. It is a must especially if you want to lose weight and don't forget the fabulous health factors also.

Quite delicious actually.<br /><br />One tea bag provided several cups of good rich tea.<br /><br />I am very happy with my order, and I would highly recommend if you are looking for an Oolong bagged tea.<br /><br />Thank You!

review/text: I was expecting this tea to have somewhat of a bitter taste to it just because of its name.  Boy was I WRONG!!!  This tea can easily be consumed with or without sugar.  I prefer it without sugar, but when I want a sweet taste to it, I'll just add one packet of Sweet & Low.  My energy picks up in about 30 minutes (after drinking the cup of tea) and lasts for approximately 2 hours!!!  You can't beat that at all!!!  Doesn't give me the caffiene jitters that my coffee does.  Now I just substitute one cup of coffee for one cup of Oolong Tea!!!

review/summary: Good oolong for the price
review/text: This review is for PoP Oolong tea bags. My tea background was first drinking Indian milk tea using black loose tea, milk, spices, and sugar. I added far-Eastern teas (non-milk varieties) in my search for a quicker tea to brew (milk tea needs more time to prepare). I am on my 3rd box of PoP Oolong tea. The tea is not like black or green teas. Be prepared for a bitter taste but with a sweeter aftertaste. Like black teas, this produces some kind of coating feeling on the tongue, almost similar to eating an unripened banana. It is somewhat woody in taste and smell (maybe a bit flowery. It may also be slightly sour, but less than some green teas. I have tried whole leaf oolong from a Chinese shop and that was more like green tea. If you can afford more expensive oolong teas, then you might get better quality. For the price, you're getting a good deal. I also think that the batches vary so sometimes you might get a stronger, bitter flavor but if you experiment with the brewing, you might get your desired flavor.<br /><br />To brew this PoP Oolong tea, realize that ground tea in bags will release their flavors much faster. My solution is to boil some filtered water. After bringing to a boil, I turn off the stove and add 1 cup (237 mL) hot water to the tea bag. Then wait ~30 seconds (or golden brown color appears)and remove the bag. The first cup usually extracts most of the caffeine and is the most bitter and strong taste. Now I can brew with another cup of the hot water. I can brew around 4 cups with the colors being golden brown, golden, light green, and very light green. It is best to brew by the color and not the time. If you leave the bag in too long, it will be terribly bitter.<br /><br />Tea brewing is an art and science, as many other things in life are. Please refer to the science of solvent extraction for a better idea. Basically, you are extracting the tea's aromatic compounds into the water. The flavor of the brew are mainly affected by water quality, extraction time (the time in water), and water temperature. You have to experiment with this for your preferred flavor. Sugar is absolutely not necessary, if prepared correctly.

review/text: For someone who generally finds green and white tea mostly uninspiring this provides and interesting change of pace.  I drink green and white tea for the antioxidants and not the taste.

It is a good, interesting product and I may have under rated it because of personal preference.

Oolong is supposed to have more anti-oxidants, however I prefer the stronger flavor of Black teas like Ahmad Engligh #1, Tazo Awake, and Twinnings Breakfast teas. These all blend nicely with the Oolong , and I get the best of each ...ch

review/text: If you are looking for a cup of tea with no real flavor, please buy this. I am an avid tea drinker; Oolong tea has a pleasant aroma of oriental spices and good flavor that dosent require added sweeteners. If you enjoy a good cup of tea, this is not the product. This tea seems like a combination of cheap teas, none with a hint of oolong. The tea even gave me a headache! The price of Oolong tea usually ranges between $5.00 to $7.00 for 20 tea bags depending on geographical area of the country. I should have known that $4.95 was too good to be true. They wont go to waste; tea bags are great for soaking tired aching feet after a run or treating foot fungus.  Certainly not organic!

review/summary: Experiment into the Lip Balm business.
review/text: Sometime back it was suggested that perhaps Hemp would make a good lip balm.  Sounded good to me, so I started the research.  Hemp is loaded with Omega 3's and lots of good stuff.  It is the only thing I have found for Eczema that actually works.  So lip balm was a definite idea.  I could add it to the 4 Ewe with Lanolin, and Shea/Avacado butter that I already make and sell on eBay.<br /><br />This stuff is wonderful!  This product is a little coarse for the lip balm, making it necessary to strain out the roughage.  But therein comes the best part. What to do with the roughage?  Light bulb.  The roughage goes into an almond oil/mando butter concoction that I also make and is used for a facial scrub.  This is not on the market yet, but it is coming soon. This facial scrub, though be it a little messy, coupled with my goat milk soap, leaves my face as soft as baby's bottom.  A friend suggested I name it "Arse Lookin' at You" which I am taking under advisement.<br /><br />The lip balm was made and named Lip Bong as a little tongue in cheek experiment into the land of sarcasm.  I sell this stuff as fast as I make it and am working on finding a way to get it here into Amazon.  Seems Colorado and Amazon are involved in a "no blink" contest and it is the sellers who suffer.<br /><br />I have since ordered two more jars of this stuff and I am cranking out the orders.  Keep it in mind if you have the rough skin going on cause it works and this stuff is natural and organic.  Just don't eat it.
