review/summary: Great Product but Terrible Packaging
review/text: Short and sweet.....The product itself is top notch and my two GSD's love it. However, the last shipment looked like it was packaged by a three year old and thus it arrived via UPS with a can lid popped open spilling its contents over the other dented cans. Another case arrived seperately which was properly packaged using air pillows and was fine. Don't get sloppy Amazon. It will cost you customers.

review/summary: Looks like vomit in a bowl, and my dogs HATE it!
review/text: I've got two dogs who will eat almost anything. I like to give them good, wholesome food and the increasing prices make it difficult. I purchased the Merrick Turducken as Merrick used to be a great company that made wonderful dog food that looked like human food. Not in this case! It looks, smells, and has the same appetizing effect on my dogs as if I'd thrown up in the bowl. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! Neither of my dogs likes it and I'm stuck with an expensive case of food. My dogs both sniffed their bowls, then walked away. I'm feeding it to them as its bought and paid for, but I feel cruel doing so. They usually won't jump right into eating it, no matter how hungry they are. They do eat a little, but usually leave at least half in their bowl and that's so unlike them! Horrible dog food. Would never recommend to anyone. Looks disgusting and must taste the same the way my dogs are avoiding it.

review/summary: Two Dew Claws Up
review/text: Both my dogs love all the Merrick canned food varieties, but this one seems to be their favorite. Even my hard-to-impress little JRT is very enthusiastic about this food. I like that although it's a stew-type food (as opposed to loaf style) the gravy isn't runny. It's a thick, meaty gravy that makes the food "stretch" a lot more when I add it to their kibble. 12 cans last a little over a month for us.

review/summary: heavenly stuff
review/text: I've tried all kinds of hemp powders and this is my favorite.  Hemp is a super source of EFA's and the protein is a highly available type due to the amount of different amino acids. It is good for those with animal milk allergies or who are concerned about cruelty to farm animals.  And it is also good for those of us who need to avoid the estrogenic properties of ingesting too many soy products.<br /><br />Great, so it's healthy, but how does it taste?  Well, this hempshake is amazing -- the taste is really great.  I particularly like the chocolate.  And I'm impressed that although it tastes a 1000 times better than plain hemp powder, it only contains 80 calories and 7 grams of sugar.<br /><br />As for digestibility, they do add inulin, which is good for the gut, and I don't have any problem with it.  However, the high amount of fiber might present a problem for those coming straight from a SAD (standard American diet), so you might want to begin slow with a small drink and work up to the full dose.<br /><br />In fact, I'm drinking a Nutiva Hempshake smoothie right now for my breakfast.  It contains hempmilk (natch), choco hempshake, cayenne, cinnamon, and frozen berries.  It is awesome.

review/summary: Tasty, organic, and convenient.
review/text: I have been using this product since fall 2008. I use it as a morning oatmeal mix-in and have been very pleased. It adds a vaguely sweet/nutty, chocolate taste (though not EXACTLY like "cocoa," which might irk some people with the wrong expectations) and a good amount of protein and fiber to boot. I also like to use it in baking that could use a chocolate-y hint (and discreet nutritional benefits) without adding too much bulk. Natural ingredients, fair-trade certified, low-calorie, lots of protein and fiber, tastes good -- what more could you want? (Warning, though: do not, "for the heck of it," try to eat a spoon of this stuff out of the canister! Ha! A friend of mine made that mistake and remarked its texture/dryness (not flavor) as similar to eating straight baby powder. Does not dissolve easily on tongue.)

It can serve as a meal replacement, or even as a snack.  Very low in calories compared to other protein shakes.

review/summary: Good to know it's organic; not so great tasting
review/text: I don't want to comment on how this protein shake affected my body.  I will only say that I worked out like usual and drank this powder mixed with milk and neither gained nor lost weight.  I like that there was no funny aftertaste (unlike some protein powders containing artificial sweeteners).<br /><br />I am giving this product three stars because I like that it is of organic and fair trade origin.<br /><br />I would have rated it higher, but I find that if I mix this with milk, the resulting shake feels gritty and has a weird and almost unpalatable taste.  If you mix too much powder with not enough milk the shake needs to be consumed quickly!  If not, you will have a jello-like substance that is best eaten with a spoon or mixed with more milk.<br /><br />The two containers I received were probably not well mixed.  I found that as I got closer to finishing the product the shakes I was making started to taste sweeter, so I wonder if the sugar was just not evenly distributed.  Given that this product is a powder, I don't think settling during shipment was a problem.<br /><br />At this point, I will probably not order this product again simply because I find it too hard to drink given the flavor and texture.

review/summary: Great protein source and very tasty
review/text: I read some reviews that claimed that this shake cause GI issues.<br /><br />Everyone has different sensitivities. My son has autism and according to his IgE and IgG panel test he has about 20 food sources that he has to avoid, such as: gluten (wheat, barley, rye), oats, milk, garlic, walnuts, sesame, grapefruit, coconut, and so on. I myself am sensitive to gluten and dairy and would get bloated and heartburn if I consume gluten or dairy. So this may not be the fault of this product because I found it to be a great product. I suggest if you have any GI issues you check with a good GI doctor, not just ANY GI doctor. The best GI doctor in the world is Dr. Arthur Krigsman. He practices either at Throughtful House in TX or in NYC. He has helped so many children with autism and addressed their GI issues that eventually the autistic behaviors improve. My son has been treated using simiar protocols by our DAN! doctor, Dr. Neubrander in NJ, and has recovered from autism just by cleaning his GI problems.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it would not use sugar. It uses sugar cane, but natural sugar or not it's still sugar. Sugar feeds yeast, and yeast causes GI and neurological issues (definitely behavior issues with my son). Signs of yeast overgrowth: dark circles under the eyes, red cheeks/ears, rashes/ezcema, hyperactivity, fatigue, craving for carbs and sugar, and so on (check out SCD diet on the Internet). I would rather use Stevia or Xylitol, so I wish this product didn't come sweetened. Xylitol actually has an added benefit, to prevent and fight cavities, since we don't use fluoride at home (fluoride is toxic, and it binds to calcium but it can't tell the difference between calcium and lead, so it increases metal retention in your body). I know this is digressing from the topic, but since I mentioned it I thought I'd explain a bit for those who are not familiar.

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious!
review/text: This shake is really tasty and is fairly filling too! It took me a while to figure out how to mix it - the first few times the protein would just clump up in my almond milk instead of completely dissolving. BUT this is easily fixed - just dissolve however much hempshake you will use in a little bit of water first, then add that to your milk! My favorite way to mix it is to add 3 tablespoons to just enough water to make it dissolve, then shake (it'll make a nice and thick mixture as the protein absorbs the water). Then I add enough unsweetened Almond Breeze to make it 1 cup. Makes a great breakfast that's yummy and healthy!

review/summary: Great protein mix!
review/text: I'm a vegetarian and had been supplementing my protein intake with whey protein for a long time. It really frustrated me that there wasn't a good, competitively priced organic protein mix available. I was skeptical about using hemp protein because I had never tried it before. I was extremely surprised when I bought this chocolate hemp-protein mix and found that not only did it taste great, it also has exponentially more fiber than whey protein. While the taste of this protein isn't necessarily what I would call "chocolate", it definitely is chocolate-like. If I had to give a comparison, I would say maybe hot cocoa? While hot cocoa does taste similar to chocolate, it is nothing like biting into a chocolate bar. Overall, I would highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Nutritious and... Ropey
review/text: As a warning - I am not a vegan, I do not hug trees (though I do love them), and I really am not into the whole organic movement (though I have no problem with it).... If my stance on those three "issues" was different, I might love this product... as it is, I found it to be somewhat disgusting.<br /><br />I typically drink Meijer branded chocolate shake mix (Meijer is a western US mega-store & the shake mix is a knock-off of what slimfast puts in a can).  I hoped that this mix would taste at least somewhat (even a little bit) like the meijer brand.... The ways that I described this taste to my wife each morning... well, they aren't good... I'm listing a few:<br /><br />- It tasted like rope<br />- It tasted like licking a wet horses bridle<br />- It tasted like sucking the water out of a wet hemp bracelet<br />- It tasted like someone had mixed dirt in with my unsweetened baker's cocoa<br />- It tasted like chewing on tree bark<br /><br />In all seriousness, the "rope" & "wet hemp bracelet" analogies are the closest... I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the "organic" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets.  This product tastes just like that.<br /><br />Another note - I was not impressed by the blending of this stuff.  Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid.<br /><br />On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff).  The fiber content is really high (always a plus).. and it was fairly reasonable.<br /><br />So, if you are into the earth loving hipster movement or are just a standard faire hippy - this stuff might be for you.  For Joe Six-pack (even the liberal type), this product should probably be avoided.

review/summary: A great hemp protein powder!!!  Perfect for kale shakes!
review/text: This is a great tasting hemp protein powder.  I decided to stop using muscle milk because of the artificial sweetener and the issues surrounding absorption of whey protein.  I found that muscle milk, which tasted great, was giving me indigestion and well.......let's just say gut issues.  This Nutiva hemp shake is very smooth and has a great flavor, not chalky or gritty at all in my opinion.  I have no issues digesting the shake and I'm thrilled to be getting protein that is easily digestible.  A simple shake recipe is included on the tub which tastes great, but I've been using this powder as the base for my morning kale shake.  I find that the Nutiva really masks the grassy kale taste; My morning shake has been transformed from something I had to force down to something I look forward to and enjoy every morning!<br /><br />Here is my kale protein shake recipe-<br /><br />1 serving of Nutiva Hemp Shake powder (3 tablespoons)<br />1 cup coconut water<br />2-3 large organic kale leaves (red kale or normal kale) torn into small pieces, I break off and discard the last 1" of stem<br />Approximately 8 spinach leaves with stems<br />1 whole banana, peeled<br />1 heaping tablespoon of peanut butter<br />1 piece of raw ginger, the size of 3-4 stacked quarters<br />1/2 apple<br />small handful of ice<br />-add more coconut water or ice if it's too thick<br /><br />Hint- start by blending the kale and spinach with the coconut water to create a smooth veggie consistency before adding the other ingredients

review/summary: I love it but it is not for everyone...
review/text: Nutiva's chocolate hemp shake is not your average tasting protein shake. It is definitely different and could for many have to be an acquired taste. It is not as sweet as some would guess but is versatile so adding fruit, honey, or another sweetener to it may make it a little more palatable for those who can't tolerate it's straight out of the container flavor. It is not completely water soluble so it does have a slightly grainy texture but that is part of the appeal to me. It has 11 grams of protein, 9 grams of fiber, and having only 90 calories would not make it a good meal replacer but a good compliment to a healthy one or a nice mid meal snack. It is organic which in my opinion doesn't mean a whole lot but the fact that it is GMO free and contains a simple and natural ingredient list appeals to me. I am not a vegetarian and love me some animal flesh but this would be a great addition to any vegan or vegetarian diet as it is an easily digestible protein source. I purchased the chocolate which I had tried a couple years ago (before they switched to the new formula- not sure of the exact changes that were made) it is great and I also purchased the vanilla that I have yet to try. I would definitely say to the newcomers go out and find the single serving packets before you commit to entire container- I love it but it just may not be to your liking.

review/summary: Hemp Protein Powder
review/text: After Consumner Reports came out with their results after testing protein powders, i.e. containing heavy metals, I started my search on the internet for something that did not contain these metals.  I started researching organic products and decided on the chocolate hemp protein. I also like the fact that it is made with Certified Fair Trade Chocolate.I have started on my second container.  I feel different than before I started, i.e. more energy...just feel better overall. I have a shake in the morning. I use 8 oz lowfat milk, protein powder (2 tablespoons), 1 tablespoon ground flax seed, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder, fruit of choice and some crushed ice. I have this every morning and on the weekend when I cook a regular breakfast, I do not feel as good. The chocolate taste a little different that regular chocolate, but that can be changed with a little Splenda. I am definitely buying this again.

review/summary: Easily digestable & delicious!
review/text: I was very pleased with the shake. I sometimes mixed it with water and rice milk. Based on the other reviews I went slowly so not to get too much fiber at once. I go easy with anything to change digestion. But it is really good. I eventually used less and mixed it with the hemp protein, since that has less flavor. Because of my LBS and low protein absorption I was having a difficult time finding the product for me. BUT THIS IS IT!!!!!!

review/summary: tastes great
review/text: This tastes great. At first it tastes a bit strange but i enjoyed the slight coffee taste. I mixed the Amazing Green Superfood (the chocolate version) with it which made the Amazing Green taste much better. I need to buy more of this Hemp Shake since i'm out. It really makes the Amazing Green taste much better. I mix it with milk using a little wisk, which works well. I recommend this to anyone trying to be healtheir, boost their immune system, and it is a great snack.  Try both the products together, it's a great combination. I have been using it regularly for a few months now and i have noticed that i have stayed healthy. I even managed to go to disney world during the new year holiday without getting sick! As a teacher getting sick is common for me, but i have noticed that i've been healthier since using these products. Give it a try!

review/summary: The taste is alright
review/text: I hate chocolate. I used to have this on subscribe and save because the two pack was cheaper than buying the other flavors individually. Unfortunately, the only two pack on subscribe and save was chocolate flavor. I was able to get past the taste despite really wanting to try the other flavors, but there were a few side effects to this particular brand of hemp mix.<br /><br />I would get really irritating tooth aches -- in my gums or teeth -- after I made a shake with this. I've narrowed it down to the inulin or the guar gum. I tried the Manitoba (vanilla) and never experienced an ache. I then tried the super berry version of Nutiva Hemp Shake and my tooth/gum pain returned. Also, I would never ever recommend the super berry flavor; it tastes like flintstones children's vitamins.<br /><br />Three stars go to a not-so-bad flavor. I think someone who actually likes chocolate will enjoy this flavor. However, some of the ingredients clearly gave me a reaction, so I couldn't give this product a full five stars. I think the inulin and guar gum are unnecessary ingredients, but I believe it's what they use to make this mix more 'mixable,' as compared to Manitoba's (which has only three ingredients total) 'sandier' texture. I don't mind the texture of Manitoba's. I don't need a smooth hemp shake, but the texture seems to really bother some other reviewers. If you prefer smoother over grittier, then try this one (but I hope you try them both to make your own comparison.)<br /><br />**Update 25/10/12<br /><br />I wanted to say that it would have to be the inulin. I was looking at the ingredients in a raw meal powder that I used to take and it has guar gum, and I never experienced gum or tooth pain with it.<br /><br />ALSO, in regards to how horrible the super berry flavor tastes: I tried it with apple juice today and it redeemed itself. I was trying to finish off the container that I still have and normally I mix my Manitoba hemp with water or apple juice and tried it with the super berry Nutiva. It actually tastes very good with apple juice -- they compliment eachother perfectly. I used soy and 7 grain milks before, so I would just recommend trying super berry with juice if you also think it tastes bad.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I agree with the others that say this is one of the best hemp shakes out there. I started off with the original Nutiva hemp powder and once I finished that I decided to try the chocolate. It is amazing! It is much easier for me to gulp this down in the morning. I mix it up in a Blender Bottle (also sold on Amazon) with a little water and some type of milk. I really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine, too!<br /><br />Nutiva is the LEAST grainy hemp shake I have come across yet. I have tried several kinds and even though I can drink them I much prefer Nutiva over any other.

review/summary: Tastes awful!
review/text: Maybe I'm asking too much---but I am trying to find a nondairy organic protein powder that would replace the whey protein I'm using in my morning shakes. Thought I'd give it a try-- my normal shake has the protein powder/shake mix, as well as kale and blueberries, and I usually love it--- with the nutiva hemp shake mix, it was in edible-- adding banana didn't help much-- bad with a really wicked aftertaste. I may be expecting too much, but I'm going to keep looking!!!!!!

review/summary: Taste is not good, texture is thin
review/text: I have tried a lot of different powders, and while I like that this one has fewer calories, the taste is just not that good. It's hard to describe - it actually is very hempy, if you are familiar with the taste. That's fine if you like it, but I didn't think it went well with chocolate. It's also very strong and sweet.<br /><br />There is also very little texture added by the powder, so smoothies made with this are thinner than those made with other protein powders.

review/summary: Bitter taste
review/text: I have been trying the sample sizes of a bunch of different protein shake mixes. I am glad I got the sample size of this one as it is the worst of the lot so far. It tastes super bitter, although, I did not mix fruit with it like the directions say, so perhaps it would be better with fruit. It also irritates my throat for some reason, in fact at first I thought I was having some kind of reaction, but it has subsided since I've started writing this review.<br /><br />Like everyone else is saying, this 'protein' shake doesn't have much protein. Compared to the other shakes I've been trying, it has the least amount by % weight.<br /><br />I think that it's unfair for the marketers to put delicious in the label as it is far from delicious.

review/summary: Great Protein shake
review/text: I do not like soy products, at least my body doesn't like soy products.  So I've been looking for a healthy shake for awhile now.  I found these hemp shakes and am very pleased with the amount of protein and the easy digestibility of this product.  I'm not one for a sickly sweet product and this one is sweet enough for me.  Most people don't like the color of my shakes, but I don't mind.  I appreciate the value and the cost.  I'd recommend it for anyone looking for an alternative to isolated soy protein shakes.

review/summary: Excellent, but not for everybody
review/text: I've been drinking Nutiva's Hempshakes nearly every weekday for more than two years now, and it's an excellent product, but not everyone is going to like the stuff.  If you're used to traditional whey-based protein powders and want something similar, you may not like this.  It's a bit of an acquired taste and has a different mouth feel.  I don't like whey or soy powders, and wanted something with a lot of fiber that wouldn't aggravate my acid reflux.  The hempshakes fit the bill for me.  I can drink them mixed in soy or rice milk, but usually I make a quick smoothie in the morning to drink in the car while I'm taking my son to school.  This fills up for a few hours but doesn't make me feel stuffed.  I blend together 1/2 cup juice (usually Odwalla Blueberry B Monster), 1 cup soy or rice milk, a banana, and 4 tablespoons of hempshake powder.  If I need it to last me until lunchtime I'll add in a cup of frozen berries.  It's a healthy way for me to start the day, and I don't end up skipping breakfast anymore.<br /><br />I haven't noticed a big difference between the old formulation and the new, except that the new seems a little smoother so I'd guess it's probably not as gritty if you're drinking it straight rather than in a smoothie.<br /><br />Long story short:  good product, but if the word "hemp" makes you cringe or laugh, this probably isn't something you're going to like.

review/summary: Mixes poorly and tastes bad-but a good source of fiber and protein
review/text: I ordered the chocolate hemp shake hoping that it would be easier to drink (or for that matter, to keep down) than the bulk protein powder, but I was not impressed. The only liquid I seem to be able to get this to mix into without having large lumpy chunks was coffee-hot coffee. I'm not sure what the high temperature does to the protein, so this left me a little frustrated. If you want hemp protein I would actually suggest just buying the bulk protein and dealing with the bad taste.

review/summary: Simple enough for kids to even do on their own
review/text: I keep these on hand for car trips with the grandkids. You can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful Kool-Aid drink by just adding a single packet to it. Just open the bottle, pour in the contents of one packet, then close and shake. Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid.<br /><br />They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size. These single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one, and end up pouring half of it out. These were such a great idea!

review/summary: Crunchy Cookie with a Hint of Chocolate and Orange
review/text: Pepperidge Farm is one of the few national companies that mass markets distinctive cookies.  One of those cookies is the marvelous Orange Milano cookie.  When you bite into this crunchy cookie you get a hint of chocolate as you reach the center, and as you chew the orange flavor spreads throughout your mouth.  Yet, none of the flavors is overwhelming.  The problem with Orange Milano cookies is that it is hard to stop after eating only one.<br /><br />These cookies are relatively expensive compared to other brands.  However, one of the hallmarks of Pepperidge Farm from the beginning of the company in the 1930s is quality.  For an alternative to the sweeter cookies typically available in the cookie isle, try Pepperidge Farm's cookies.  If you are looking for a good cookie to try first, this one is a winner.

review/summary: My favorite hotsauce
review/text: I'm not the biggest fan of hotsauces but I was interested in trying this one because the singer of The Offspring is the man that created the sauce and sells it.  I was pleasantly surprised with how good the sauce tastes, it's got some kick but not too much kick, I really really love this stuff.<br /><br />I would especially recommend it on Papa Murphy's Herb Chicken Mediterranean pizza, amazing.<br /><br />I'm glad to have found it on Amazon because I've ordered it on their site directly from them for a long time and this is a few dollars cheaper and it's still directly from the same company.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and grab a bottle.

review/summary: The BEST mexican style hot sauce you'll find!!!
review/text: When I first saw the website for this i thought it was a joke, especially growing up listening to the Offspring, Pennywise, the Vandals et al... anyways, decided to see who carried it and they have it at my podunk, hillbilly a$$ food 4 less here... $3 bucks a bottle, kinda pricey, I thought, till i saw how much it is here on amazon... I suggest checking your local Albertson's or Food 4 less and seeing if they have it, you'll never want tapatillo or chalula again... this is the real deal and tastes amazing!! I guess if it's one thing us Southern Californian's have in common it's our love of mexican food, and as any good So Cal resident knows, the salsa makes the burrito (or at least can make it go down easier in some cases)... Seriously good hot sauce!!!

review/summary: Amazing hot sauce, you won't regret
review/text: Like many people who have bought this sauce, I decided to pay the extra nickel to try the hot sauce created by none other than one of my favorite singers from one of my favorite bands growing up, The Offspring.And like many of those who have purchased online, this sauce isn't available in stores near us.<br /><br />First off, I am a native of New Orleans. I'd like to think I know a thing or two about hot sauces. Tabasco, Crystal, and many other hot sauces that have had heart and soul put into them have made their way onto my plate. But man........Dexter hit the money on this one. This sauce is truly amazing, for lack of better words. You get a burst of flavor when you first bite into your dish covered in Bandito, then a nice after rush of spice hits the tongue for a great ending. I really haven't found a dish that it doesn't go good on.<br /><br />I was skeptic at first, as I knew going in that I was only buying it because I was a fan of The Offspring. But I can tell you now, that this sauce is officially a household staple in my home. This is literally the best hot sauce i have EVER had. Try it!

review/text: this is unlike any other hot sauce out there. All hot sauce seems to taste the same, or rather not taste like anything at all, they are just trying to be as physically hot as possible. Not the Gringo Bandito hot sauce, it has a taste kinda like a cross of a hot sauce and enchilada mole sauce. great on just about anything. maybe not ice cream but you may have a flavor of ice cream that needs improving. I got 2 big bottles and am sure I will be ordering more soon.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I saw this at my local Food 4 Less for less than $3 (5 oz.) and had to give it a try. I've seen this hot sauce online before but could never justify paying the high cost plus shipping so I thought $3 was actually pretty cheap. I was a little wary at first because when I looked at the ingredients to see what kind of peppers were used the first one listed was habanero. I'm not a fan of straight up habanero sauce. I've tried popular habanero hot sauces like El Yucateco and didn't like it. El Yucateco has a weird pungent smell to it that I can't get over and I find the taste somewhat off-putting. It's also too hot for me. But I saw on the label of Gringo Bandito that it uses a mix of various peppers so I figured it might be different.<br /><br />After tasting Gringo Bandito I was pleasantly surprised to find it doesn't taste the same as a regular habanero sauce. The smell is not sour or overpowering but rather has a nice spicy aroma. The combination of different peppers (habanero, jalapeno, red japanese chili, and more) seems to work well. It tastes good. It's got much more complexity than something like Tapatio. Tapatio's decent but has more of a vinegary taste to it. This is more balanced. It also has the perfect amount of medium heat to it; not weak and not too hot but still enough to give it a nice kick.<br /><br />So I like this stuff and recommend it wholeheartedly . I don't give it 5 stars because I don't love it like I do another hot sauce. My favorite hot sauce is the chile de arbol variety. The kind they give you at the taco shops that's orangish in color and comes in those round plastic containers. That's my absolute favorite but I haven't been able to find a good bottled version of it at the store. I would certainly keep buying this stuff though. Kudos to Dexter for creating a good hot sauce!

review/summary: Hooked. Take this seriously.
review/text: I don't usually like hot sauce because all they do is burn my mouth but I am now literally hooked on GB. I don't know what they put in it but there is so much flavor and it's so perfectly balanced that it makes pretty much everything taste better, from eggs to steak to pizza. I can't eat anything without it. The smell alone will get your juices going and you can actually taste it before it kicks, and when it does, it's pleasant and just hard enough.<br /><br />Another thing I love is that it isn't just a spicy red watery liquid as most other sauces. You can see the peppers and the spices there, all ground into a paste and it looks, feels and tastes natural and fresh.<br /><br />I urge everyone to try it. I almost wish that it was not associated with Dexter Holland so that people wouldn't think of it as some famous musician's side project (although, then it wouldn't have the most awesome packaging of any hot sauce). He quite obviously takes this seriously though and so should you. Don't dismiss it, get it and you won't regret it.

XD<br />  PS- on their website, it has a recipe for beer mixed with some Gringo Bandito. For all the minors, just use coke. Not only is it good, but the reaction on people's face when you tell them it's mixed with hot sauce is priceless.<br />  And finally, my personal favorite is a Wahoos' fish taco with a lot of GB on it. THAT is amazing.

review/summary: This stuff is delicious!
review/text: I am a huge hot sauce fan, on top of being a huge health fanatic. I decided to try this out because I heard about it on my favorite bands website, the Offspring. As this is made by their lead singer, I was intrigued. The thing that made me want to try this the most is the great reviews and the fact that it has a low amount of sodium compared to many other hot sauces.<br /><br />I was not dissapointed at all! This stuff is absolutely delicious, I seriously put it on everything. I keep a bottle in my office with me for my lunch everyday. I seriously can't get over how good this stuff is. It reminds me of a more tasty taco bell hot sauce initially, then the tangyness kicks in, next thing you know the burn of the spicy habanero is there. Seriously is delicious and not just spicy enough to not be too spicy for someone who isn't big on spicy food. I highly recommend this hot sauce for its delicious taste and its low sodium.<br /><br />Things I put it on...<br /><br />-Egg Whites<br />-Talapia<br />-chicken<br />-rice<br /><br />Makes all the plain tasting healthy food I eat bearable and delicious!

review/text: Once you try these, you will not go back to conventional anchovies. If you never liked anchovies, it is probably because you never had the good stuff. If you worry about the large size of the can, don't. Stored in a glass container under salt in the refrigerator, these anchovies keep forever (not that they need to, you'll start using them more and more). Put one or two in beef stews, on lamb roasts, etc. It adds a depth of flavor, nothing fishy at all.<br /><br />However, shipping charges on this are ridiculous. I ordered once online. Realizing I would need more, I searched for an Italian deli that carried them. It took a while, but I now have a source for fantastic other Italian products that are difficult to get anywhere else.

review/summary: Must use correctly.
review/text: These anchovies are first rinsed, then filleted and then melted in olive oil in most cases and used for flavoring dishes such as Pasta Putanesca sauce. If your plan is to just rinse them and fillet them and then down them with a piece of pugliese bread dripping in extra virgin olive oil and a glass of chianti then these will work for you also. Putting them on pizza is not what they are intended for. The variety of their uses is vast if you have any knowledge of Meditteranean cuisine, if not get yourself a good cookbook and learn, the flavors they impart are without comparison, not to mention the aromas they send out floating around the neighborhood.

review/text: These anchovies are excellent; nothing like the salty, fishy cousins packed in oil available on a grocers shelf. Instead the taste has depth and character, somewhat like a sardine but with a little more bite. The drawback here is that you must scrape the skin off and "filet" the little fishes, worth the effort in my opinion.

While he liked them well enough, they were just too salty to be able to even consider getting through the entire can, even over months.

I opted to try Eukanuba because of the price - granted it is still pricey but cheaper than Royal Canin.  Both dogs eat it without a fuss and have had no apparent digestive issues with this food.  I would recommend it.  The only drawback is the price of the product.

He's now 4.5 years old and doing great.<br /><br />If I thought there was a better brand of food for him I would be open to trying it, but I feel good about giving him this Eukanuba Dachshund Formula.  I also can't find this locally so I am happy to buy it on amazon.

This "Chili Chipotle Powder" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.<br /><br />The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like I'm burning my nose.  YUCK!<br /><br />Stick with a plain old generic "chili powder" instead of this.

review/summary: My dog loves these! Closest I've found to the "old" greenies
review/text: My Maltese absolutely loved the old Greenies.  Then they changed their "recipe" and she wouldn't even try the new version.  Turned up her nose and that was that.  I can't recall the exact names of the other types of "Greenies" out there and there are only a few, but regardless, she didn't like any of them.  We moved on to another type of treat because I didn't think there was ever going to be another "Greenie" type treat that would measure up to the original.  On the outside chance she might like these, I gave them a try.  Turns out she really, really likes them.  So my search to replace the original "greenie" is finally over!

review/summary: Doggy Dent a winner
review/text: My dog is a very fussy eater.  Getting her to eat everyday is a challenge.  But she loves these mini sized "greenies".  As soon as she hears me open the bag, she is patiently waiting for her treat.

review/summary: Best tasting tea ever
review/text: Great tasty way to start your day yet shrinking your fat cells. I don't think I would need any other tea after this one. I have tried other Pu Erh teas, but this is the best tasting one. Again I am not a coffee drinker, but always started my day with black tea, may be being raised in Europe had its effect on my taste. After knowing about Pu Erh tea in Dr. Oz show for fat shrinking quality, I tried different brands and found out this one is the best.

review/summary: Take it or leave it
review/text: Used it for two months now.  Not sure it's helped at all.  My dog still thinks she's starving.  I had already cut her back, then cut her back more on recommendation from the product directions.  She loves the taste, but if she's lost even 2 pounds I'd be surprised.  Worse, though, is that it doesn't seem to stave off her hunger at all (that IS a tall order though, as she is one of those dogs who would eat until she explodes....).

review/summary: Very Pleased
review/text: I have been using this product for several months on an over weight, spayed, eight year old female Dalmatian. This dog has been ravenously hungry her whole life and constantly begged for food and stole food when given the oppotunity. Because of that, keeping her weight in check has been a battle. We even went so far as to have health screens done to make sure this wasn't a thyroid or other issue. I decided to try Lean Dog to see if maybe it would help with her appetite. I am pleased to say that it has been like a miracle for her. It has definitly taken the egde off of her appetite. She has dropped weight, her coat looks great and she just appears younger and happier. I like that the product has all natural ingredients and is not filled with drugs. I highly recommend this product for others to try.

review/text: This bouquet was delivered to rural western Michigan about 50 hours after ordered. The heavy, clear, tall vase tapers toward the bottom. Yellow and white carnations were beautiful, but the roses died before opening.<br />The price couldn't be beat anywhere on line.

review/summary: I will not buy from any company supporting Rush!
review/text: Since flowers are mostly bought either for or by women, it seems self destructive to support someone who denigrates your entire customer base.  Not all of us have bought into the conservative war on women's health led by Rush and his Republican cronies., nor will we continue to support companies that do.<br /><br />The personal attack made on a college student is unacceptable and I do not accept any apology from this misogynist bully.<br />I imagine my daughter in this position and go ballistic! All women are someone's daughter, wife or mother. How would you feel if these comments were made about your wife, mother or daughter?<br /><br />Rush Limbaugh has been getting away with these kind of personal attacks for years... well no more.  The climate in this country is changing and we will not stand for this any more.

review/summary: Great Product.....Too  Costly
review/text: This product is too expensive. Cheez-it products are very popular and they sell very well. I can't vend these 1.5 oz packages for $.93 , which is my cost price....48 pak @ $44.99. Can you please find another supplier besides Acehardwareoutlet for this item ? They are way off,and I hope you find another supplier soon.

review/text: I love the hot and spicy cheez-it<br />But was disappointed to find the packages were only 1.5oz instead of the 1.92oz that Amazon advertised them as. Dont know how they managed to flub it up, it states right on the box 1.5oz.

review/summary: If you like the flavors of Cran/Pom you will enjoy it!
review/text: Stash Tea Company Cranberry Pomegranate<br />Price: >$4 ordered in a 3 pack less than $10 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046KO7JA">Stash Tea Company Autumn Teas Trio Gift Set, 3-Ounce</a> + Free Shipping)<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: 0mg<br /><br />Ingredients: Hibiscus; Rooibos; Cranberry Flavor; Pomegranate Flavor<br /><br />Received this as part of a 3 pack of teas for the holidays (Cinnamon Vanilla, Pumpkin Spice and Cranberry Pomegranate).<br /><br />-Smell (2) - The smell is not strong, but it is present. I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring.<br />++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor.<br />++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.<br /><br />-2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.<br /><br />Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea).

review/text: exactly what i wanted. looks great and have had many nice compliments on it. It made a great mothers day gift, as no place around here sells anything remotely close to it. Yes the flower is not real as bamboo plants do not flower, but it does look nice. The plant is real and has grown since purchased and it still looks great
