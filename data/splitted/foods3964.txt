review/summary: Delicious and full of flavor! Also, best deal on Amazon
review/text: I became addicted to spanish ham while I was pregnant... spending $10 per plate for a 1oz portion on top of some salad greens at a local restaurant... I ordered this ham because it was the best price per ounce that I could find, and was not disappointed!<br /><br />This ham has a very rich flavor, causing me to eat it very slowly and enjoy it for longer. A half of a slice would satisfy my craving, and it seemed to never run out!<br /><br />Tastes great paired with fruit such as pears or sweet apples.. It cleanses your pallet to allow your next bite of ham to be as delicious as the first!<br /><br />I've since had my baby, but am ordering another pack of this ham because it's so good! My husband loves it as well.

review/summary: Wow is this some GOOD stuff!
review/text: This was such a good deal that I figured I'd take a chance on this much product. It shipped without a problem (which I was a little nervous about since it's a LOT of food in a plastic container) and you get over 12 pounds of Korean style fermented soybean paste (this has little chunks of fermented soybeans and is not smooth all the way through like miso).<br /><br />The expiration dates on mine were well over a year (and will last much longer if kept in cold storage both before and after opening).<br /><br />The ingredients as stated on the package are:<br />Soybeans, water, salt<br /><br />I'm going to enjoy making soups, stir-fries and salads with this delicious soybean paste!<br /><br />A+++

review/text: There are huge boxes so if you're just cooking for yourself or a small family, beware.  They are about 6x bigger than the ones you'd see in an Asian grocery store (the small boxes with the same brand and packaging).  Flavor is alright but quite salty.  I bought this to make Ja Jiang Mian (the Chinese kind, not the Korean) because I couldn't find the black bean paste in my local stores.  These are yellow beans.  Fail on my part...

review/summary: The search is over
review/text: I searched all the local health food stores for this product but they had no idea what it was. I was happy ( lucky!) to find it with the mill. The mill makes it easier to season with this product and spreads the maple flavor more evenly than the flakes alone. The cap allows you to measure the quantity once ground so it is easier to use in recipes.  It is refillable so I also ordered the 4 oz flakes separately.

review/summary: Maple Flakes
review/text: The maple flakes were just what I thought they would be, they had great maple flavor for just a little bit and calories are not bad. I recomend using after cooking for best flavor. I added it to oatmeal while cooking and it wasn't enough so I added some extract. The next time I made it I added a sprinkle atop when in my bowl. Much better. I have also added it to vanilla yogurt, cinnamon toast, and cut apple slices for the kids. I love it. Shipped very fast too.

review/summary: Marzipan
review/text: I have purchased marzipan from this company several times before and was always extremely satisfied.  The main complaint that I had up to my last purchase was that they did not always have it in stock, and the wait was sometimes quite long. The price is very high also, but for excellent marzipan, it would be worth the price.  Unfortunately, this was not excellent marzipan.  Although, the previous marzipan I received from them was very good, the last box that I purchased was not at all tasty.  In fact, it had almost no almond taste, which is, of course, the reason you buy marzipan.  Let's hope they go back to their old recipe!

review/summary: More beans than I know what to do with.
review/text: I bought this on impulse, the moment I came across it on Amazon-- I had been shopping for Jelly Bellies after not being satisfied with the pricing of bulk beans from brick and mortar/warehouse stores. 10 pounds of beans for $65?  One click and several months later and here I am.  I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them.  I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have "surprise jelly beans" when I'm not expecting it.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box.  No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard.  There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated.

review/summary: Best since Coco's
review/text: I fell in love with Coco's curry while my husband was stationed over in Japan. House Foods is actually the company that owns Coco's, so when I found this I had to buy it. I've found that if you add a little s&b curry powder to this, it tastes almost like fresh Coco's curry. Add a little cayenne pepper and you get the heat of it too. Long story short, if you love Coco's or are looking for a good Japanese curry, this is definitely worth the buy.

review/summary: Quick, Easy, Convenient & Delicious
review/text: I've been looking for a prepared Japanese curry product that had the same taste as the beef curry they used to serve at my favorite Ramen shop, before they stopped selling it (I guess I was the only one who would order it).  This is about as close as I've found to it, and it's incredibly easy to make.  Makes a great quick lunch out of the microwave with some rice, or you can add in some cooked meat (great use of leftovers!) and make a full meal of it.  They also say that you can put it over spaghetti or some other cooked pasta, but that's just a little too strange for me to try.<br /><br />This also works extremely well for camping since it's boil-in-bag and hermetically sealed, or could just be something to keep in the pantry for the long term.  It says "HOT" but if you've ever tried other types of Japanese-style curry, the scale of mild to hot is incredibly weak, with mild flavors coming closer to a sort of gravy and hot flavors not even reaching the level of the blandest Indian curry.  House Hot curry is very heavy on the apple and is rather sweet, but there's certainly enough spice to make it tastier than the milder flavors and there are a surprisingly large number of veggies for such a small pouch.  I'll definitely be ordering another batch once I've gone through the current one.

Now as a mother, my 3-year-old son loves it, and he's usually picky (note that my son only eats the "mild" version of this sauce).  I mix it with steamed white rice or steamed quinoa.  Both ways are fab, but of course it's healthier with quinoa.  It's cheaper at the local Asian market--but if you don't have those nearby, I guess this is the next best place to stock up.

It's quite easy to use, particularly if you have a microwave -- simply put the contents over rice and microwave the whole bowl for about a minute, and it's all heated and ready to go (it's precooked). The taste is pretty good, without being too spicy (it's actually quite mild). That said, the taste does have a little MSG in it, which isn't ideal for us. We would recommend getting this for quick meals, but wouldn't make it a regular household food.

I figured (especially being caffeine free) that it would just be a gimic and that I'd just move onto a latte afterward.  Well...I never needed the latte.  This woke me up and made me focus better than anything I have ever tried before.  Now instead of taking my ADHD meds, which work but give me migraines, I usually just grab a cup of this instead.  I'm about to finish up my first can and will definitely be purchasing another one.  Whether looking for energy, focus, or both, this tea absolutely delivers!  I cannot recommend it enough.<br />***Word of caution***  One cup is plenty to get you going; a little goes a LONG way.  Two cups in a row made me a little jittery, dizzy, and gave me stomach pain.

It's flavorful and refreshing, without "the coffee effect." (Rooibos tea is caffeine free.) Definitely my favorite of Republic's red wellness line. Even better with a little honey added, to enhance the tea's natural sweetness.

review/summary: Smells like an old man's tobacco
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Republic of Tea teas, but this one was way too much.  The smell of the tea brings me back to how the house used to smell when my grandpa smoked pipes. Its not a bad smell like cigarettes, but it also isn't the type of smell you want to drink either. I asked some coworkers to smell it too, and they all mentioned old men or smoking. They also would not drink a cup when I offered!<br /><br />Luckily, when the tea is brewed, it doesn't taste as strong as it smells, but there is a lot of Roobios in there and I guess I'm not a huge fan of that either.  I've only been able to get through two cups of this tea and I did feel a little 'charged' afterward - the stuff is strong - but I think you've got to be a fan of really bold, tobacco-like flavors to get into this tea.

review/summary: Chronic ear infections or skin problems?  No more with Halo!
review/text: We adopted a sweet dog from a local animal rescue. His underbelly was red, inflamed looking, and he was constantly scratching. His vet history included chronic/repeated ear infections.  Considering the high cost of vet bills, and our desire to give this sweet dog a good life, I spent a few hours reading online about chronic canine ear infections & skin disorders.<br /><br />I did not realize that so many brands of pet food had corn and other grain type products included (and often the primary ingredient).  Most people don't have corn or wheat as their primary food source, so I find it odd that pet food would have.......<br /><br />From what I read on several sites, allergies to those ingredients can cause skin issues and chronic ear problems.<br /><br />After a couple of expensive vet visits, 2 months on expensive Advantix flea treatment, 6 weeks of ear antibiotics (twice daily administration) and a month of oral antibiotics, I decided to switch to a different food.<br /><br />Within 3 days, our dog's underbelly skin became a normal, skin color. The ear infection cleared in about two weeks (confirmed by vet visit & ear swab labwork). The constant scratching went away.  He is like a different dog now, and I attribute a large part of that to his feeling better and having more energy since he's not scratching or having hurting ears.<br /><br />The cost of this dog food is WELL worth it to me, and my rescue pet.  Having less vet care alone will easily cover the cost of this food.  We have tried the other flavors, and he enjoys them as well.

Salmon was a very unique flavor, unlike everyone's ubiquitous lamb and rice. This food is very similar to giving your dog Greenies. I swear, it's like feeding them crack.<br /><br />My dog now looks forward to breakfast and dinner (her two feeding times). No more do we just leave our food out there because Spot will eat it up immediately!<br /><br />All in all:<br /><br />* My dog LOVES this dog food.<br />* Not tested on animals, like Iams does.

review/summary: Just right for picky doggies
review/text: I have a very picky 90lb German Shepard. He snubs his nose at food that he gets tired of, which is often. We have to resort to hand feeding him or buying another brand of food when he goes days without eating. Yes, he has trained us! However, Halo has changed our dogs eating habits. He no longer misses meals and never gets bord of his food. This is the 4th or 5th bag we have given him, (between the chicken and salmon) and he's never needed to switch brands. This is the longest run we have gone with his food. He loves it!

review/summary: My dog loves it... even though it smells a little... salmon-y.
review/text: We switched to the Halo dog food when my dog started having an allergic reaction to her previous, grocery store bought food.  After we switched, her reaction stopped, so I feel good about paying a little extra for this brand.  I love the product, and the fact that I can have a 30 lb bag shipped to my door in New York City (with FREE shipping if you're on Amazon Prime!) is worth buying it online.<br /><br />In the past, we'd given her the chicken flavored, but since she loves salmon table scraps when we have it for dinner, I thought I'd try this flavor.  She, of course, loves it.  After she finishes, she'll usually stare at her dish and bark for more (that's how it works, right?)  I would say this is a little smellier than the chicken flavor - and leaves her muzzle kind of salmon stinky.  Also, I usually have to wash my hands after feeding her to get the smell off.<br /><br />Overall, I'll probably buy again (and this same flavor) just because she likes it so much.  That said, be prepared for it to be a little smellier than your normal food.

review/summary: Pretty Good for the price
review/text: I switched my 3 year old large breed mixed dog from Timberwolf Organics Southwest Chicken and homemade dog food to the Halo Wild Salmon about a month ago.  He appears to like it.  His energy level hasn't declined and he isn't starving at the end of the day because of fillers.  It smells good and has a great recipe line up.  Its neither over priced nor a "great deal" but it's prime eligible so you save on the shiping.  It is worth the price it is sold for and performs as promised.

review/summary: Maddie the Vizsla likes it, but no longer shipped by Amazon
review/text: Amended amendment: Now it's back and shipped by amazon ... I cannot keep up with the changes!!<br /><br />Amended review: BEWARE!!! The product has gone up in price from $59.99 to 72.99 because Amazon no longer sells it directly and you get shuffled off to other sellers. Can not use Prime for free shipping either. Guess I'm going to have to find a local store now ... if one can be found. I find this quite unfair of Amazon to drop a product without notification to its customers. I dropped its rating to reflect the poor policy decision not the quality of the product.<br /><br />The most important consideration is answered in the title. It is a premium food with all healthy ingredients and comes packaged in a heavy (thick) plastic bag rather than in paper. Maddie likes it; what more can I want in a dog food that is good for her health and well-being.

As for the jalapenos, we don't find them to be hot, but they do add a little zest.  We usually enjoy this with a nice hot soup on a cold day.

review/text: It's a big hit at my house. We even tried it with about 1/2 to 1 cup of whole kernel corn poured into the mix just before putting in oven. Very good. Has a bit of a kick, but not hot at all. Slight jalapeno flavor-doesn't overwhelm the great taste of yellow cornmeal. We've added a seeded and chopped jalapeno pepper to the mix-very tasty. Great with a bean soup or your favorite chili recipe. My son could just eat it by itself for a meal. This has become one of our favorites from Amazon. Very pretty color that looks very nice on the table and after cutting, btw. If you like cornbread, this mix is hard to beat.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I love Hodgson's bread mixes for the bread machine and keep almost every flavor on Subscribe and Save so I'm never without. When I saw this cornbread I just had to try it. The jalapeno flavor was almost non-existent, the bread a greyish color that baked very dense and heavy. Not like your run-of-the-mill cornbread, even those made gluten free or wheat based. This was a big disappointment but I gave it a 2nd try because the first time I used oil. The second try I used butter, but achieved the same results. Because I figured it was Hodgson's and it would be great, I ordered a case of 6 boxes. Four of them are now in a carton in the cellar awaiting a trip to the local Survival Center/Soup Kitchen. I just did not like the flavor, texture, appearance or indescribable after-taste. I am hoping that whomever tries the ones I am donating likes it.

There is so much baking powder and/or soda in this mix that it tastes like soap.  No Jalapeno flavor.  I'm going to add a can of corn, some mild cheddar and some jalapenos to the next box I open and hope that it improves; no one ate more than one bite of the first box I baked.  I just can't justify giving more than one star to a mix you have to remake.

I think I'll make muffins with it next time and I'll definitely use a light veg oil too.<br />Really, for a $1.80 per batch, hard to complain about this. And easy to like.

review/text: I ordered this item, a 10 pound BAG of sour cherry Jelly Belly jelly beans but what I received was a previously opened BOX of jelly beans which were crystallized and melted together and looked nothing like the image above. In addition, the jelly beans were simply dumped into the cardboard box with no wrapper whatsoever. This box had a seal on it which had been cut through and then retaped. The external shipping packaging was undisturbed. When I have ordered Jelly Belly jelly beans from other vendors, they have come in plastic bags, shipped in a cardboard box.<br /><br />Since I really wanted what I had ordered, I was disappointed to see that upon return of the defective merchandise, I was only eligible for a refund, not a replacement as Amazon was out of stock on my item. I sent the item back and was surprised to see that today, when my return processed, there is now 1 ten pound bag of sour cherry Jelly belly jelly beans in stock. I wonder if the in stock item is the very same defective item which I just returned.

review/summary: Definitely not the best Peanut Sauce out there
review/text: Ordinarily, I love Thai food.  I love peanut sauce.  Recently, I moved to the country and was disappointed that I cannot find peanut sauce in my local stores.  So, I came to Amazon.  I really didn't want 6 jars of peanut sauce even though it was the type I usually use.  Instead, I bought this jar.<br /><br />The price is right.  You only have to buy one jar BUT since the taste isn't good, it isn't such a good bargain.<br /><br />The first sensation to hit your mouth is of a strange sweetness - somehow a little unpleasant.  There is a vague peanut-butter edge but not enough to drown out the sweetness.  After you manage to swallow, there is a surge of spiciness.  All-in-all, all I can see is ick.

My boyfriend, (who happens to be thai) was hesitant to try it at first because he says he can never find a sauce that met his standards, UNTIL THIS!! One day I came home from work excited to have it over some fried tofu and vegetables, to find that HE HAD EATEN THE ENTIRE THING!! We are both truly loyal customers now - we absolutely love this sauce, it is great on salads, with meats, vegetables or tofu - it really adds an addictive flavor to any dish. Also, the shipping is fast and reliable, and I have found that the price is well worth-it compared to what else is out there (especially with the free shipping that is offered). If you want the real deal, you cannot beat Wan's sauce. I would recommend it to anyone.

review/text: I finally have found a great peanut sauce that is healthy. I love peanut sauces from Thai cuisine, but I could not indulge in them daily. The ingredients are so much healthier than anything I could find in the markets or groceries. It seems most large companies add so many preservatives, salts and fat. This happens to also be free of any peanut allergens so its great to serve to guests without worrying who's allergic to peanuts. I am able to enjoy it more often now and even took some jars to a chain of bistros down town that like to dabble in exotic foods. They loved it too. I wish this was available in a health food store or some of the specialty groceries near by. This is absolutely the best tasting peanut sauce I have ever tasted. True to the Thai cuisine which I love.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Product!!
review/text: These are so good! I bought them for my husband, thinking they would be chunks of fish, but no, *Happily* they are filets, great!!! My husband loves them, he frys them in a little butter and has them for breakfast along with a good peice of french bread and butter. We will be buying these again and again. Best part is that they do not have to be refrigerated and you can have them anytime you want.

review/summary: Delicious & Convenient
review/text: I bought the 18 pack for office snacks / small meals.  They are just right for this.  The nutrition information says "two servings," but the total package, consisting of two filets, is 3.53 ounces, and if you are like me it will be "one" serving for you.  That will net you 200 calories (120 of this is from fat, including 2 grams of saturated fat but no trans fat), and 520 mg of sodium.  Not bad.  These are very tasty kippers, deliciously smoked.  They are packed in water, not oil, but the fish texture is good -- not soggy as I thought might be the case.  These fish are packed in Germany.  I think these are a great value and will help keep me away from the potato chip machine in the office.

review/summary: These are my pick!
review/text: These kippers have a wonderful flavor and texture.  They are smokey with just enough salt.  I wish the cans were bigger.  You open the can and the fillets are solid and firm, which is surprising for not being in oil.  I think they taste a touch better than the John West brand without the oil.  If I had both in front of me I would have a problem picking between the two.  If you like smoked kippers this is the brand I would suggest.  I was a lifelong King Oscar fan until I tried these.

review/text: Delicious lightly smoked herring at reasonable price, and best of all Herring are a sustainable resource, far enough down on the food chain that they don't concentrate toxins to the same degree as larger predator fish.  The firm fresh texture is as good as I've ever found in a canned fish.

I can't seem to ever buy enough to get me through the next trip to the big city. I order them 3 cases at a time now, and make sure I re-order before I'm dowm to my last case. ( They come 18 cans per case ) I sure would hate to go through life without thiis little treat. Almost every night I think about having a treat. I don't, because they woud be gone too soon. If you like canned fish snacks, you will love these.

So by purchasing the Polar Kippers instead, ended up being a better choice for me. In fact my Dad enjoys them as well! They have a great texture and natural smoked flavor that I enjoy eating with Saltine Crackers, or just right out of the can!. I will definitely continue buying these!~ :-)

review/text: Enough mystery about smoked herring has made the rounds, and it's time someone penetrated the veil and let in some light.<br /><br />This product is the definitive vanguard of Kippered Herring. It's the perfect expression of the art. Finely prepared, perfectly smoked, packed in a light oil and loaded with Omega-3, produced in Germany and clearly done with affection and a commitment to quality.<br /><br />I recommend MW Polar Kipper Snacks without reservation.

review/summary: Great
review/text: Never bought kippers online, so that's the first attempt. I'm not disappointed: the box was delivered very fast, and the kippers are great, mildly smokey with a good texture. Btw, I was on the fence initially whether to buy this kind -- because of the negative reviews here. I usually value critical reviews highly (and leave them myself whenever due), but I gotta say that these negative reviewers here must be smoking something good. One says, fish is loosely packed, soft and slimey in a lot of water. This is a lie: sizeable chunks of fish are packed very tightly; the texture is very nice; and there is maybe a tablespoon of salt water in a tin. Another says there's gluten in it. Wha? How did this come about? Gluten? In fish? I searched the tin for any mention of gluten, and, as expected, found nothing. Yet another einstein found soy in it. Again, where did you get this garbage about soy? I couldn't see anything about soy. It's fish and salt water. These guys must have been high, OK, good for them, but why post reviews in this blessed condition?<br /><br />Bottom line: perfect. If you like kippers, you'll like this version (and also, it's cheaper than buying in stores: round here, a comparable tin of kipper will be about two bucks.) I will certainly buy more.<br /><br />Update: I figured the reason the negative reviewers complained about gluten and soy: they confused this product with the same brand kippers in mustard sauce: I just ordered a box and, according to the ingredients list on the tins, _that_ product does have everything they complain about (because of the sauce).

review/summary: A tasty treat
review/text: These Kipper Snacks are delicious.  First and foremost, the can is very easy to open.  Its shape and size makes Kipper an easy travel item, as with most other brands' cans, I suppose.  The scent of fish is strong, but typical of herring stored in this manner.  However, the smokey scent is not over powering and adds to the flavor: perfect.  As for the salt water, the amount of salt is light enough to complement the flavor of the fish, and not overwhelming, like other Kipper snack brands I will decline to mention.  The texture of the fish is good in that it is not too soggy, nor does it break up too easily, once removed from its solution.  To sum it up, these Kipper Snacks are a perfect blend of flavor.  No need to feel guilty here: Kippers also provide a healthy dose of omega 3 fatty acid, responsible for lowering triglycerides.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Great snack
review/text: I first started buying these at the local grocery store, where they retail for about $[...]  a tin.  For me, buying them in bulk on here is a good deal, because I go through a few tins per week.<br /><br />These are a great high-protein snack, relatively low in salt and high in Omega-3 acids.  Combine them with some good whole wheat crackers and a little spicy mustard and enjoy.  They are nice and smoky flavored, de-boned, and packed in their own juices.<br /><br />Chances are if you're shopping for these things in bulk online, you've already had them before so writing too detailed a review is sort of pointless.  They're a bit of an acquired taste, very strong in flavor, and not for everyone.  Shipping was fast and efficient and best of all, free.  Can't beat that.<br /><br />But for those who appreciate a good smoked kipper, you can't go wrong with these.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Truly a superior Kipper Snack
review/text: I've been trying several brands recently and these are easily the best.  Using "Subscribe and Save" their true delivered cost was $5.31 per pound and they will last a very long time on the shelf.  The calories are listed on the can at 81 and sodium content is only 110 mg (both great).  I suspect since I drain the liquid, the sodium is even less per serving.  With 4 or 5 crackers and a double handful of small tomatoes they make a  simple, healthy, yummy lunch.  I also like them for breakfast with eggs and capers.  Next I am going to try a sandwich like others have mentioned.  I'm certain you will appreciate these better quality Kippers having just the right flavor.

review/text: I've been eating Brunswick kipper snacks for 15 years, but decided to try these when I saw 'em at Walmart. I really enjoyed them! I found them to have a firmer texture and more smoke flavor, and the ribs in the fillets were either not there or were cooked down more thoroughly. The fillets were more intact and seemed to be of slightly better quality too. Also, for what it's worth, the can is easier to open and drain without getting fish juice on your hands. ;-) Good stuff! My new favorite!

From heart health to brain health there is ample evidence that fish such as salmon, herring and sardines are very, very good for our health. The Polar Kippered snacks are consistently delicious, not too fishy with a light smokey flavor. I have these baby's on automatic delivery so I don't run out. I eat a can a day. Just drain the water and consume. You might try them on crackers or in a salad... but I gobble them up au natural! (I'm off all wheat products..). I get them for about a $1 a can... cheaper then my local super market.  Every once in awhile I'll splurge on some relatively expensive sardines...but these are my daily staples! Highly recommended!

review/text: These Kippers are very tasty the flavor compares to Appel Kippers only the consistency is compared to the big meaty Appel Kippers slightly mushy this varies from can to can on the ones I have eaten so far. That being said the price is so good I intend to continue to purchase these as they are great in a salad or anything along those lines.<br /><br />Really great smoked flavor not a hint of fishiness. If you have a taste for kippers give these a try the price is downright cheap for the quality. If you have never tried kippers you may be in for a treat.<br /><br />I have turned several folks onto Kippers who have never had any smoked fish or some lousy stuff and most of them complained of the aroma when I was eating Kippers (especially at breakfast) but once they actually ate some suddenly they converted on the spot.<br /><br />These are second on my list of Kippers behind Appel but for the price difference it is a no-brainier to grab some of these Polar Kipper Snacks at about a buck and a quarter a can, wow what a bargain.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  High Quality for a Low Price.

The one bad thing is the smell - fishy smell.  In fact, my son loves these so much he use to take to school until he was teased about the fishy smell.  If you like tuna, you will probably like this product.  I like to eat these on crackers.  This is a great price at Amazon.  In the store where I live, a can of kipper snacks cost at least $3.25 each.

review/text: These kipper snacks are very tasty and worth the money...but, the nutrition label shows a serving size as a half a can.  So if you ate the whole can at one sitting (and who doesn't?!) you get 20% of your "daily requirements" of sodium!  That's a little harsh!  And the North Seas have some bad pollution issues...are these fish taken from those waters?  I wonder... (I only gave it 4 stars because of the nutrition label, as other kipper snacks I've bought list a serving size as a whole can and they were all of the same weight.)

review/summary: Switching kipper snacks after many years
review/text: Received my order today and within minutes had a can open.  For years we have only eaten Brunswick Kippers but am having trouble finding them in area stores.  The last two cans we bought were different from what we always ate.  Watery, less flavor and odd pieces of fish.  I am especially impressed that Polar Kipper only has three ingredients, all of which we can pronounce and are familiar with.  We will be going on a subscription.  The can we opened did not even make it to a cracker!  Less smoky but the fish was cut into filets rather than mashed pieces and though salt was the only seasoning, it was not overwhelming.  Jewish Holidays are coming in September. MW Polar Kipper Snacks are going to make a grateful gift to my neighbor.

review/summary: Great Weight watching alternative
review/text: I have been ordering polar kippers on autoship from amazon for some time. Makes a quick and easy breakfast for me, and has served as a good substitute for breakfast bacon for me. While they still have fat, they are good fats. the smoky and salty flavor satisfy my taste at the same time. I eat a whole can which is supposed to be two servings, but even then it comes to a total of 162 calories.<br /><br />I have had on occasional problem with a lid not coming off cleanly but it wasn't a big deal to work around. Also some cans will vary slightly in the contents but it all averages out, especially when you eat them on a regular basis as I do.<br /><br />Buying on autoship is the cheapest way by far to get kippers with free shipping I am usually around $1.10 or so a can vs. $1.50+ in my local grocery. Plus I get a regular supply which fits nicely into my every other day or so diet plan.
