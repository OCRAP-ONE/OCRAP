review/summary: Most Excellent Coffee
review/text: I am a coffee connoi-sewer.  :)<br /><br />I say sewer because I drink a freaking large amount of coffee!!<br />Oh, and I am particular.<br /><br />Since I drink so much coffee, I was looking for a coffee roaster with<br />good prices who sold in bulk.  Enter 'Coffee Bean Direct'.  I first went<br />to their website, but didn't like the costly shipping.  Then I noticed I<br />could purchase from them, through the great and powerful Amazon, with free<br />shipping!!<br /><br />I bought the 5-lb Italian Roast Espresso, whole bean and French Roast.<br /><br />Expecting the worst, I was pleased when I opened the bags.  The coffee was<br />fresh and still had the coffee bean oil on the beans.<br /><br />I ground some up and brewed it.  The aroma is incredible and full.  I can smell<br />it coming from the kitchen, in my bedroom upstairs when I wake up.<br /><br />The flavor is rich and full, but smooth, without much acidic bitterness.  The<br />Italian Roast has just a touch of sweet aftertaste, as it should.  Very similar<br />to Star Bucks, but much less expensive.<br /><br />The French roast could be a little bit richer flavor, but as it is, for the price,<br />you will be pleased.<br /><br />I've ordered more than twice now.  And have just ordered the Peruvian Italian Roast.<br />My phalanges are crossed.  Now if they would just make a German or Turkish roast.<br />But then, I'm just dreaming now...<br /><br />Enjoy

review/summary: delivery problem
review/text: This order was returned and refunded after I waited nearly thirty days.  I reordered again and we are waiting patiently.  I have received your products and items to military POs before using an FPO (USMC.)  Now, the APO AE address I have provided was not accepted.  The refund went through right away to my credit card.  So, not only are we disappointed, we are without coffee.  I ordered three five pound bags.  We love the French Roast and Italian Roast both and we are now trying Brazilian Santos.  I have also enjoyed the chocolate before.  All are great products, well packaged and at a reasonable price.  I would hope the orders can be filled by adapting your order form for military postal deliveries.

review/text: This coffee has a reddish hue when ground.  It has a certain taste that I don't like as well as the decaf espresso I purchased previously, but it is good.  Everyone has their own tastes and I don't mean to discourage anyone from buying this coffee based on my personal tastes.  This is good coffee, at a price you can't beat.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: We recently purchased ourselves a home cappuccino maker and our use of expresso beans increased dramatically.  We were seeking a more cost effective and efficient source for our coffee so we gave this product a try.  Wonderful aroma.  Great taste.  Reasonable price.  We have now subscribed to the product on amazon so it will just automatically appear at our doorstep just before we run out.  Highly reccomended product.

review/text: I like this product. The price is right and it tastes good. I've got a self grinding coffee pot and this works well in it. I only have to clean out the grinding area after 1/2lbs. of beans have gone through. I do put half of the 5lb. bag into a gallon freezer bag and freeze it until needed. This seems to work well and the beans don't go stale.

review/text: I bought this coffee to use in my espresso maker and I don't like it at all.  I find the taste to be quite bitter with not a lot of other flavors in it, just bitter.  Now I have a five pound bag of the stuff that I'm going to end up throwing out because I just can't force myself to drink it.  Starbucks, which I don't even think is that good of a coffee, is better than this.

This is very smooth with no hint of bitterness. Packing and delivery was excellent, too. I'll definitely buy this brand again, but maybe try another dark roast next time.

review/summary: Subscribe and Save:  Doesn't Save
review/text: I have purchased Coffee Bean Direct 5 lb coffee in the past and I think it is a good value for the price (slightly above average).  Thinking I'd economize, I recently ordered using "subscribe and save".  Unfortunately, the USPS in my area (Maine) has changed it's delivery approach.  The mail carrier does not stop or attempt to deliver a package, but instead leaves a slip requiring me to drive to the post office to claim my package.  With gas at $4 per gallon, any savings is wasted.  It's actually cheaper to use the Amazon Prime delivery as Fed Ex and UPS have no problem actually delivering.

review/summary: Good, but not as good as loose tea
review/text: One of the cool points of the Keurig brewer is the capability to brew both coffee and tea.  Although I use it mainly to brew coffee, I got a box of this Earl Grey, and use it in a rush.<br /><br />I drink most of my tea using loose tea (Adiago Tea's Earl Grey Bravo is wonderful), and nothing beats loose tea for having a tea with some body and full flavor.  Tea brewed with a K-Cup is brewed too fast, and is slightly more bitter than other good teas, and doesn't have the same mouthfeel.<br /><br />Still, I've been drinking this regularly, especially when I'm running out the door and would rather have tea than coffee some mornings.  It's quick, and it's a reasonable cup.

It does have the basic Earl Grey flavor though.<br /><br />I do give it kudos for its convenience.  It's great to get a nice, hot cup of tea so quickly.  Although the flavor isn't fantastic, it's more than adequate.

review/text: Landed cost, at my door, was the best price I could find on the net. I had thought EBAy auction site would be a good shopping site but what with unreal shipping costs and having to wait until the auction was over, I found this was undesireable. Amazon buying is straight forward and you know what you are getting and when you are getting it. All my future buying of this type will be done on Amazon. The quality of Kuerig cups speaks for itself. No additional kudos are needed.

review/summary: Makes My Mornings Meaningful
review/text: Over the past several years, we've been buying our coffee through Amazon's Subscription Program, and although we still think that's a super way to get coffee, we've been forced to change our chosen coffee many times because the prices have simply gone nuts - each time we found a nice coffee, eventually its price would climb 25 or 35% causing us to reconsider our choice.  So we'd look for another one that had not yet reached such lofty heights.  Our most recent shift brought us to this French Roast Peruvian coffee.  We've never before had Peruvian coffee, but hey, why not?<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you that this is the best stuff I've ever had in my mouth - but I will say that it pleases most of my 'coffee taste buds' and makes my mornings happy.  It may come up a little short on richness and depth, and frankly, I don't think its roasted dark enough for a French roast - but for my taste, it makes up for those weaknesses with its price - it's a quality coffee at a low end price - so what's not to like?

review/summary: For me, just OK
review/text: I'm having a difficult time deciding how to review this coffee. Here's why...<br /><br />I have no complaints about the condition or quality of the product in the bag. As is typical of previous orders of other varieties of coffee by Coffee Bean Direct the beans in the bag were of good quality, uniform size and roast and reasonably fresh. Properly ground, these beans provide a nice crema when pulling shots of espresso and the beans, while certainly a dark roast, are not overroasted and therefore not so oily that they clog the burr grinder every few cycles like some beans. Also good for drip and press pot if you prefer those methods. Now here's the difficult part...<br /><br />I don't really much like the flavor, acidity or mouthfeel of this coffee. There is nothing wrong with it per se. It just doesn't fit a profile I like. First, I prefer my coffees to be low to medium acid. This roast of these beans is quite acidic, or at least the bag of beans I received was quite acidic, and not something I want to sip much of or for long. Second, the flavor isn't bad, it just isn't appealing to my tastes. And finally when it comes to mouthfeel, for me there isn't really that much. The brew is thin tasting and watery even when brewed quite strong.<br /><br />Now there is a saving grace for me with a dark yet acidic and thin-feeling coffee like this, and that is that it makes a great dessert coffee with everything from cheesecake to pastries and chocolates. The acidity and dark roast flavor helps cut through the sweetness of desserts and provides some balance. I just don't eat that much dessert or have dessert often enough to justify five pounds at a time of this particular coffee.<br /><br />Bottom line: Good quality beans, well roasted. If a dark roasted, acidic coffee suitable for serving with after dinner dessert courses is what you're after, I think this may be it. It's just not for me. Consider my three star rating of this coffee to be neutral. That's as fair as I can be.

review/summary: Worth it!
review/text: I've been buying coffee in 25lb batches from CoffeeBeanDirect since only a few months after they started Internet orders in 2004.  In the intervening 8 years, I have never had a bad bean.  I buy direct and get free shipping, which makes the savings even better.<br /><br />I buy mostly purchase their darker roasts-- French, Italian, yet sometimes I'll thrown in a City-Roast.  This particular Arabica from Peru is nicely roasted.  They get it right every time, for real.<br /><br />Only when I can't make a large order do I buy locally and when I do the results are rarely as good as when I buy from this outfit.  They roast the coffee within 24-hours of shipping and as I said, I have always received freshly roasted coffee.  Only when I roast green beans, which I get from these folks do I get a fresher roast and then it's really hard to know the difference unless I am taking the coffee directly from my roaster.<br /><br />I realize there are some great coffee sellers/ roasters out here, Sweet Maria's is one, but CBD has proven reliable over the short and long-term.<br /><br />I write this review because CBD earned it.  I do not work for the company nor ever received anything from them except great coffee-- I wouldn't mind it if they did send me something additional, but it's not necessary.  I get what I need.

review/text: the product purchased was david sunflower kernels. although the product date was not expired it tasted very stale, rancid. it is my guess this product was subjected to extreme heat or some type of poor storage. i ordered two cases, twenty large bags. we are "slogging" our way through it even though it doesn't taste fresh. it even smells stale. i doubt i order from you again as a result of this experience. my last order was fine. what happened here? new supplier? it is not acceptable product. i don't understand the difference in quality between these two orders. you won't have repeat business if you ship this kind of stale product. i have told friends of my experience. don't you realize you not only lose my business but the fact that i share my experience with friends and family means they too will not order product that is shipped in this unacceptable condition. it is a hassle to return items. i was willing to make purchases when there were no problems but once this happens I no longer am willing to go through the hassle. It costs money to ship returns. Shame on you.<br /><br />esther jones

review/summary: Sunflower Seed Particulates
review/text: I have a case of 8.5 ounce packages sent to me every-other month.<br />Normally, I am quite satisfied with what I receive.<br />So far every package in this last order - I just opened package #7 out of 12- is consistantly sunflower seeed dust.  I must have received the packages that were filled with the last of the stuff in the bottom of the bin at the factory.<br />The problem is that because I received one case from one specific packaging period at the factory - they are ALL like that.  If I had bought them at a retail store one or two at a time, I probably would have only gotten one or two out of 12 bags of this quality.<br /><br />YUK!

review/summary: Terrible shipping
review/text: This product arrived with the box broken open which had been put back together with packing tape.  The perforated display box was punched open and I received only 11 of the 12 packages that where originally in the box.  The shipper should have put the display box inside a regular brown shipping box in order to avoid this problem.  I'm giving 3 stars because the sunflower kennels were fresh and very good, however, because of this problem I am reluctant to order this product again fearing that I  might receive fewer than 11 packages next time.  I've decided to place my next order with another company through Amazon.

review/summary: Salmon heaven
review/text: I used this product this past summer while fishing across Alaska for anything I could catch that was legal at the time. I learned to use smokehouse maple seasoning sparingly since it is awfully powerful if too liberally used. By default, since it was the easiest way to cook inside my camper I braised my fish fillets.  I'm just earning how to live by truck-camper.<br /><br />Braising is a method of frying and poaching, or steaming, at the same time. One simply places a bit of olive oil in a skillet, places the seasoned fish into the skillet then puts the lid on using low to moderate heat. It fries on the bottom and the steam created cooks from the top down. One can take the lid off and turn the fillets if desired while turning the heat up for a few minutes. It takes experimentation to get a result you will be happy with. No additional salt is needed. Garlic powder works in conjunction with this method as does placing diced onions a green peppers in the skillet with the fish.<br /><br />At first I used an entire fillet with the skin on. Then I migrated to cutting the fillet vertically (belly to back) and away from the skin before braising it. It gave a more consistent product and it was easier to control the cooking uniformity this way. Also one did not have to wrestle with fish skin on the plate later.<br /><br />Now, nothing else seems to come close to the appeal of this seasoning. I'm now hooked and spoiled on it - not necessarily a good thing since it denies one a host of other tastes from other seasonings. I gave some to another fishing couple and now they want to buy it.

review/summary: Great for Chicken & Pork
review/text: My family uses the grill most of the summer months so I purchase the bigger containers of seasonings for our meats. This seasoning is a mix between sweet and salty with just the right amount of smoke flavor. My marinade for unthawed chicken breasts and pork loin: In a gallon ziplock bag use 1 tbsp sugar, 1 cup italian dressing and 4 tbsp of the smokehouse seasoning. Mix well and let marinade over night in the fridge. I also use the McCormicks Montreal for steak/burgers and buy it at a Warehouse store where it is cheaper but they do not carry this flavor. Of course, I buy this flavor from amazon because it is only two dollars more and I get free shipping without having to drive to different stores searching for it...

review/summary: This is the best rub ever!
review/text: I just wanted to chime in on this product. Everyone here has raved on how it tastes on chicken and pork. This stuff makes everything taste better! We use it primarily on steak. Rub it in, let it sit for about ten minutes then grill as you like yours done. I like my steak medium to medium rare and others in my family like theirs well done. The rub holds up and doesn't get bitter on the well done steaks. No need for sauce or anything else on these. Makes the best steak ever. My Ribeye's are coming out so good we haven't been out to a steak house in over a year. I can make them better at home.

review/text: I found this at Costco (for quite a bit less than here on Amazon) and purchased it. It is absolutely delicious (subjective, I know--I'm not sure how else to present a review on a food item) and has been great on chicken and fish. It is definitely sweet (not candy sweet by any means) and not comprised of the healthiest ingredients, but if that doesn't turn someone off, it's definitely worth a try. I ordered from Amazon after Costco stopped selling them in my area and my supply started to run low.

review/summary: Simply the best tasting tea I have ever drank...
review/text: I am addicted to this tea. Maybe because as an ex Starbucks employee I use to make, serve and drink it so much. I have tried many other teas which are suppose to be better then Tazo Zen.( Numi, Trader Joe's etc. ) and I still go back to Tazo Zen. If you go to Starbucks on a regular basis to purchase their iced green tea and want to save some money...Starbucks uses this exact tea. A box of 20 bags cost around $4.00. The instructions state to use two bags for every 8 oz. of iced tea. At Starbucks they do not follow this. To cut costs they use one tea bag for every 8 oz. of water then they double the steeping time indicated on the box. I make well over a gallon of tea out of each box that I buy. And yes...it tastes exactly like the Starbucks ones. If you like it sweet DONT add honey or powdered sugar because it will have a totally different taste then Starbucks...instead just buy a bottle of the Starbucks classic syrup available at all Starbucks. They go for about $7.00. They are usually out of pumps but Ebay has plenty of Starbucks pumps. Enjoy!

review/text: After first experiencing this tea from across a table in NYC, I had to taste it myself.  The aroma starts the relaxation process before the first sip.  I am NOT a green tea drinker in general, as I find them to be somewhat tasteless.  But this tea relaxes and refreshes with it's subtle mint and lemon flavor.  If you don't experience the flavor, you aren't steeping the bag long enough.  I find it to be the perfect every night tea just before bed.  I only wish I could purchase it in larger quantity.

review/summary: Mild, Relaxed Green Tea
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Zen Green Tea has a subtle, mild, light green tea taste, not bitter at all. I don't taste any of the additional flavors Tazo puts into this tea; maybe my palate isn't developed to this point. However, it still is one of their better teas, and has less of an artificial taste than the others I've tried. Maybe the flavorings are just too mild in this tea, but when it comes to flavorings, I prefer them this way; I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. It is not a strong green tea, so it would definitely appeal to people who enjoy herbal infusions and milder teas.<br /><br />The ingredients in Zen  are: green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint, lemongrass, and natural flavors. Zen contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "an enlightening blend of the finest green teas and rare herbs available in this world." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Zen as "smooth, lemony, earthy, refreshing". Tazo describes the aroma as "lemon, mint".  The web site also says, "Select pan-fired green tea from Zhejiang province in China, artfully combined with lemongrass, spearmint and a hint of lemon essence. Zen's distinct green tea flavor accented with lemon and mint is impossible to express in words. Best simply to experience its sweet, lingering aftertaste." I don't taste the lemon or the mint or the sweetness; still, it is a nice green tea. It is relaxing and enjoyable to drink.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Zen gets only four stars.<br />****

I never understood it...until now.<br /><br />  Trying to live a healthier lifestyle, I began looking into the different types of teas I could try out and was drawn into purchasing the Tazo Zen Tea.<br /><br />  Once it came, it sat unopened in my pantry for about two weeks, when I decided to make some while reading a book outside. I KNOW understand why this tea received so many good reviews!<br /><br />  The taste is somewhat minty, and although I can't explain it too well, it makes you feel really good. Call it the aroma, or the hot minty flavor going down your throat, it is a great tea. I look forward to purchasing more in the future.

review/text: I know people are going to rate my review not helpful but I can't help it... I think this tea is one of the worst I ever tasted. I grew up in a place where everyone enjoyed green tea, so this flavored green tea thing tastes just horrible to me. At Starbucks they serve this tea with boiling hot water, so naturally the green tea flavor is killed (like always as they never tell customers that hot water kills green tea flavor and make it bland). If you want herbal tea thats good, but if you are looking for "real green tea", I recommend you get once that don't have funny names like this one or Samurai, Sakura, because they usually arent real green tea but something people who haven't had real green tea thought would sound oriental and cool.

review/summary: Be Careful!
review/text: With an enormous range of essential ingredients, including krill oil, a super-antioxidant rarely found in other pet foods, this product is ostensibly ideal for both cats and dogs. THE PROBLEM is that it contains so many NON-ORGANIC ingredients, including corn protein. Newer studies just released point to a greatly increased risk of tumors in animals that are fed corn, simply because ALL of the corn grown in the USA has been genetically modified (courtesy of one very large multi-national corporation whose name is familiar around the world.) You can't escape it. So until Wysong decides to produce an all-organic version of their Epigen WITHOUT any GMO ingredients, we won't be buying it anymore.

review/summary: Hazelnut Milka is Tasty
review/text: Milka and its famous purple cow, recently purchased by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries. With hazelnut, the crunch and flavor has a pleasant exotic texture.<br /><br />Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate, although they also make varieties which include yogurt, nuts and a version with Oreo Cookies. Buy a case of the hazelnut Milka and enjoy!<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com

review/text: This Chocolate is made in Germany. Where they (by Law), have to tell the amount of Coco that is included. Please, try calling Hershey and ask them how much Coco is in their product & they will tell you that they DO NOT have to tell you. Milka chocolate bars are pure bliss and a little on the creamy side, which I like sometimes. This is how a Chocolate Bar should taste like, but in America it is only possible when you eat a foreign product.<br /><br />Please note, this is all about mass produced Chocolate. Yes, of course there is superb Chocolate in America but, NOT from the mass producers...

review/text: I was really excited when I found these. On paper they look great and I really hoped they would taste good too. Unfortunately that is not the case. They look like rice krispy cakes however when you chew them they turn to a powdery gloop in your mouth. I actually had to force myself to swallow it as it was so vile every instinct told me to spit it out. I am forcing myself to choke down the rest of the box because a) they were quite expensive and b) despite the taste they are good for me, however I will never buy these again and with the remaining bars I can only face eating half a bar a day as they make me feel sick if I try and eat a whole one. Sorry but I am sceptical of the positive reviews on here..... they are all written in a similar style and all bar one were posted on the same day.... May 9th seemed to be a very popular day for positive reviews.

review/text: I let my puppy eat these all though they are not intended for puppies. She is 25lb. giant breed so bigger than most dogs. She loves these because she can chew and chew since she is teething.<br /><br />The ingredients are very poor and these do not contain meat, even though they say meaty center on the front. Also they are not a good source of vitamins and minerals although they say that too. Dog food is a better source itself.<br /><br />My dog likes these probably because they are made mostly of sugar and meat flavoring. She also likes the fact they are chewy.<br /><br />Conclusions: These treats are alright for a treat. Something used once in awhile. I wouldn't recomend giving them more then once a week. Do not assume they are a healthy treat full of vitamins and minerals...mostly sugar.

I gave each of them one Jumbone about 6:00 pm, and this morning they both vomited it up.  They didn't woof them down whole, they were chewed, but came out this morning in solid chunks.  I trashed the rest of the treats.  Maybe it's just my dogs that couldn't digest the Jumbones--they never had sensitive stomachs before, but thought I'd pass this along.

review/summary: Great Alternative to Pricey Prescription Food (for my cat and his condition)
review/text: So my male cat developed a urinary/bladder problem.  Long story short(and 2 grand later)the vet said he should be on Hill's Prescription Diet C/D canned food.  We started him on that, but each can was substantially more expensive than other canned foods.  That's when, thanks to looking around on various sites, others have said they used Friskies Special Diet.  Cat enjoys the taste, and it always gets mixed with a few ounces of water to increase his water intake (cat does not drink water at all from his water dish).<br /><br />Using Subscribe and Save (discounted price and auto monthly shipments) along with Prime membership (free shipping), the price beats going to the store so it's a no brainer.<br /><br />This is working for my cats health, but I am not a vet nor should you blindly follow this review if your looking for an alternative to Hill's or other Prescription canned foods.

review/summary: CARELESS HANDLING DAMAGED CANS
review/text: WHEN I RECEIVED MY LAST ORDER BOTH CASES WERE FULL OF BENT CANS.  WHILE I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED A BENT CAN AT<br />PET FOOD OR GROCERY STORE, I DECIDED NOT TO RETURN THE ORDER AS IT IS SO MUCH TROUBLE. SINCE I HAD A GOOD STOCK OF FOOD FOR MY CATS, I PUT THE CASES IN CABINET UNOPENED. MY SIX CATS ALL EAT RX SCIENCE DIET AS THEIR BASIC DIET:I USE TWO CANS OF THIS DAILY SPLIT AMOUNG THEM FOR TREAT. TWO DAYS AFTER ARRIVAL OF PRODUCT I NOTE A DISGUSTING SMELL<br />COMING FROM KITCHEN AREA. TWO CANS WERE SO BADLY DAMAGED THEY WERE OPEN. I THREW THE REST AWAY. I HAVE A TOTAL OF EIGHT RESCUED ANIMALS. ALL CATS ARE ALLEY CATS AND THE DOGS ARE MUTTS. THEY ARE GOLD TO ME. THE CATS ARE WELL CARED FOR INDOOR PETS. OBVIOUSLY, I CLEAN CONSTANTLY AND SUPPORT THE CLORINE AND DISINFECTANT INDUSTRY. THIS WAS A DISGUSTING EXPERIENCE FOR ME. I AM CANCELING MY MONTHLY ORDER NOW.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOIU">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Special Diet Ocean Whitefish Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>
