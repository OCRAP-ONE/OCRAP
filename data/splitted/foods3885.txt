review/summary: Unaccurate Instructions
review/text: It brings a pastry bag and a star tip to mold churros as they are, but I must say that the instructions are very unreliable, I had to use almost twice the water, otherwise it would be too hard to pass through the small tip. At the end, we enjoyed sugar dusted churros with a warm cup of chocolate.

review/text: My review of the literature suggested xylitol gum to reduce or prevent ear infections. My son had several ear infections after bouts with allergies and one dose of penicillin for the infection nearly landed him in the hospital due to a severe allergic reaction.<br /><br />My choice is to be proactive and reduce the bacteria in the mouth that migrates and causes ear infections. The gum tastes great and he hasn't had an ear infection since. WE bought him the toothpaste too and he brushes all the time with it.

review/summary: Tastes good, but loses flavor fast
review/text: I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Fresh fruit falls in the middle of the pack. I really enjoy the flavor, but that flavor only lasts for about four minutes. (That's still twice the time of the two mint flavors.) According to the package, it has a mix of lemon, orange, banana, and pineapple flavors. I can't distinguish any of those - it tastes a lot like Juicyfruit flavor to me.<br /><br />I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. At least I can chew this without having intestinal problems, which makes it worth three stars despite the short-lived flavor.

review/summary: Tasty and good for you too!
review/text: My husband wanted to get this flavor, I was a little skeptical but it tastes good! Like Juicyfruit. Our dentist recommended that we get this gum, especially for my husband who has a lot of cavities because the xylitol kills the bacteria in his mouth that causes cavities. He chews it three times a day after each meal. And I like it too! Doesn't hold it's flavor for super long but it's not good for my jaw to chew that long anyway so it works out.

review/summary: Not Naturally Flavored
review/text: We've gotten other flavors of Spry gum from natural food stores and liked them.  So, I was excited to see fruit flavor available.  However, I was very disappointed when we received it and it was artificially flavored.  Not a big deal to most people, but it is to us.  The only reason I ordered it was because I thought it was all natural. My kids did try it before we realized it, and they liked the flavor, but I ended up throwing most of it away.  If I want artificially flavored gum, I can get that anywhere.  I don't need to order it. So, if your buying this just for the no sugar aspect this might be okay, but if you want "all natural" look for something else.

This listing states " SugarFree Gum Sweetened with 100% All Natural Xylitol Spry Dental Defense System" which is VERY misleading.

review/summary: Tasty Gum with no other added faux sugars
review/text: The reason I got this flavor of SPRY gum and the truth of the matter is that it tastes VERY similar to juicy fruit, as another reviewer mentioned.  There are no added fake sugars like sorbitol (found in my favorite gum, Trident) which is good in the sense of health (probably), yet the sweetness runs out way too quickly (like the real juicy fruit).  I'm averaging around 10 minutes of sweetness per two rectangles.  Weak.  Otherwise, it is a solid gum, it's good for your teeth (per my dentist) due to the high amount of xylitol.  Xlear just needs to figure out how to make the sweetness last longer.

review/summary: summary: think flavor-less gum + xylitol mouth wash coating
review/text: 2 stars because it actually delivers xylitol to my mouth<br /><br />however, as far as i can tell, all of the xylitol is found in the hard coating, not in the gum itself.  therefore, unless you avoid chewing the gum, virtually all of the xylitol goes into salival suspension within a couple minutes, and you either have to swish a mouthful of spit around in order to expose your mouth biota to the xylitol for an extended period, or continually add new pieces of gum.<br /><br />-3 stars because the xylitol is only present in a significant amount as long as i dont swallow.  the economics of buying pure bulk xylitol are probably better. the xylitol shouldve been infused into the gum.<br /><br />no word on if it helps slow or halt tooth decay, if anyone knows a strong strategy on remineralizing teeth (other than a better diet, im broke) please let me know in the comments, thanks.

review/summary: A Warning About Xylitol
review/text: I am a male in his mid 50's, in generally good health, slightly overweight and with no ongoing diseases.  I've used Tom's of Maine's toothpaste containing Xylitol for years without problems but haven't previously ingested Xylitol.<br /><br />I purchased Spry Fresh Fruit gum two days ago, consumed two pieces in rapid succession on an empty stomach that day about 2pm and felt OK.  Consumed another piece on an empty stomach at bedtime late that night.  Next day I felt increasingly ill: stomach (pancreatic?) pain, some nausea, and aches and pains throughout my body as when fighting a generalized infection or recovering from overexercise.  Consumed one more piece about noon of second day.  Peak of above symptoms was about 4pm that day.<br /><br />Of course I had no idea what was wrong with me.  At the time I suspected food poisoning or salmonella.  Rested due to pain much of the second day.  That night I researched Xylitol and found many had experienced nausea from using it (web search key words "xylitol nausea").  From what I've learned so far effects are most acute with first time users for whom there may be a tolerance or adjustment period.  I also encountered at least one recommendation that Xylitol not be taken on an empty stomach or that it be taken with other sweeteners to avoid nausea.<br /><br />Today is day three.  I'm feeling a little better but have abdominal pain and fatigue severe enough that I am taking a sick day off from work.  As I write this my experience is fresh in my mind.<br /><br />On the positive side, this gum was enjoyable to chew, the flavor quite good (though it does fade quickly).  It's probably fine to take after a meal as recommended on the package.  And, if you're trying to evade tooth decay or other sugar-related maladies I commend you for that!  However, please use moderation if you aren't an experienced Xylitol consumer.<br /><br />Bottom line: good product generally but given my experience and the number of similar cases I found in my research, I think a warning on the package to new Xylitol users about tolerance appropriate.

review/summary: Tastes good, xylitol for prevention of cavities
review/text: I have taken a quote off of Wikipedia pertaining to xylitol for dental health:<br /><br />"Early studies from Finland in the 1970s found that a group chewing sucrose gum had 2.92 decayed, missing, or filled (dmf) teeth compared to 1.04 in the group chewing xylitol gums.[17] Recent research[18] confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then "starves" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption. (However, this same effect also interferes with yeast micro-organisms and others, so xylitol is inappropriate for making yeast-based bread, for instance.) This is because cariogenic bacteria prefer fermentable six-carbon sugars, or disacharrides such as sucrose, as opposed to the nonfermentable xylitol, whose antimicrobial properties then "starve" the bacteria, reducing their growth and reproduction.[16] Most of these studies suggest that at least 6 grams of xylitol per day is needed for dental efficacy; for most chewing gum or breath mints this would require 12 pieces per day (op cit)."<br /><br />So according to this you need twelve pieces of xylitol gum per day to be effective.<br />That would mean a one hundred piece jar would last less than ten days, and you would be chewing two pieces three times per day.<br /><br />So you would need three jars or more of this per month.  I may try out buying xylitol in bulk packages here on Amazon and sipping it in water.  The health benefits not only of preventing cavities but also of preventing sinus and flu infections when taken by nose<br />in a spray are impressive.<br /><br />There was also a study done that showed that xylitol can help prevent osteoporosis by remineralizing bones.<br /><br />It seems there are two main companies in the world producing xylitol, in Denmark and in China, and this gum company supposedly gets theirs from China which sends up red flags in some of us.  We can't really trust China not to put harmful ingredients into things, as has been shown.<br /><br />The gum itself tastes good.  I can't complain about it so far, it is similar to Juicy Fruit in taste.  The taste fades out fast but still a hint of it remains for at least half an hour.<br /><br />I plan to do more research on ways to add enough xylitol to my diet.  Chewing twelve pieces of gum a day isn't something I want to do.  I recommend this gum as a way to get xylitol into contact with your teeth where it has a unique ability to kill bacteria.  One star comes off due to the probability the xylitol in this is made in China, and the fact that it or any gum of this nature requires too many pieces to be chewed per day to have the beneficial effect on teeth.  Still, when you can't brush after a meal this is a way to<br />kill mouth bacteria.

This tastes and smells just like Juicyfruit and my son is happy that he gets to chew gum.  It's this or nothing.  I buy the case of 10 piece packages on Amazon and it's always in ample supply in our house.  It's cheaper that way and convenient for me to not have to always look for it at the health food store.  As for the review about it not keeping it's flavor... Personally, I think it keeps it's flavor long enough.  Any longer and my jaw just gets tired.  Besides, I like my son to chew it to clean his teeth between brushing and don't particularly want him chomping on gum all day.  This is a great product and I will continue to purchase it here on Amazon.

review/summary: So far so good!
review/text: I expected that these would not taste okay, they would leave a funny aftertaste, or not be as chewy as, say like, double mint gum. Well, to my suprise they were very stimulating to my taste buds, and almost addicting. There was no aftertaste, and the chewing factor was alright with me. I wanted to just chew one piece after each meal, but it was very tempting to always go pop a piece just because I enjoyed them that much.<br /><br />My children enjoyed chewing them also, and one actually would ask for a piece each time he noticed the container sitting somewhere. I do not recommend them for children not mature enough to know not to swallow gum. My child would swallow often, so I know now that the mints or chewies would be better for those with swallowing issue. I was, however, able to get him not to swallow because he liked them so much. I would make a deal that I would give my child one only with an agreement not to swallow- it worked, but half the time swallowing was irresistable, though before he would always swallor. I had only used them for about 2 weeks so I cannot comment on any improvements in dental health, but I hope to continue with using them on a long term basis. No side effects noticed here as some have reported.

review/summary: WOW!! Great product!
review/text: I bought Spry gum for my 2 yr old grandson. It was xylitol or $2400 worth of dental surgery. He has been on xylitol products now for 2 and 1/2 months along with other remineralizing products, and has shown marked improvement in his speech development and eating. Plus several of the smaller cavities have disappeared and the larger ones are smaller.<br /><br />In the beginning we gave him too much xylitol, he got diarrhea, so we cut back and the diarrhea ceased. But he's back to eating, chewing, drinking xylitol, and no problems of any kind so far, not even a reoccurrence of the diarrhea.<br /><br />Spry is great and worth buying.

review/summary: Delicious, good for teeth!
review/text: If you haven't, read up on xylitol and how it helps knock back unhealthy mouth bacteria.  Spry gum is 100% xylitol, unlike most of the gum you buy in stores, and this gum tastes great.  My 8 year old, who likes Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum, loves it.  And the more he chews it, the better his teeth get.  We've actually noticed some remineralization going on.  Spry gum comes in different flavors, spearmint, peppermint, fruit, cinnamon and green tea.  Xylitol tastes exactly like real sugar, so the flavors taste like the ones you expect from regular sugared gum.  We take it in the car on trips when we can't brush after meals.

review/text: I really hoped I'd like this gum.  The texture is fine, but the taste leaves something to be desired.  I tried a second piece later just to see if it was really as bad as I thought.  Yep, it was.  I hate wasting anything and there are still 98 pieces to go : (  Maybe my husband will like it : )<br /><br />11/13/10 update:  I tried the gum again and it grew on me.  I actually like it now; go figure!

review/summary: Xylitol dangers
review/text: To make sure everyone has a clear view before buying, the other side of the coin is that studies show xylitol also causes some health problems, such as headaches and queasiness.<br /><br />Personally, every time I consume or chew something with xylitol, I can't eat the rest of the day because I get so queasy.

review/summary: Cheddar Cheese Flavored Chow Mein Noodles, yuck!
review/text: I honestly found these disgusting. I am a big fan of other Nissin Chow Mein products, but these are terrible. One reason is because they are very dry. Had to add lots of extra water, but it did not do much to help it. The cheese flavor is not very good and a bit over powering. Not worth the money. Also, the portioned size is very small. It might be good for a side dish, but you'd need more than that for a meal. Will not buy again!

review/summary: Very Disappointed
review/text: I gave it one star for the concept.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Dave's hot sauces. His combination of smoky barbecue flavors and invigorating heat always gets my saliva going. But this spray was disappointingly lacking in both respects. I'm not exaggerating when I say there was virtually none to speak of. It tasted like bad watery vinegar. Why buy the stuff if it doesn't taste good or get your endorphins pumping??<br /><br />The oleo-resin from the habaneros comes out of solution and collects at the top of the bottle. Instead of a homogeneous red color you see in the photo, you get a blood red color floating on top of a murky yellow color. You need a paint-shaker to get the spray looking normal again. I called Dave's about it and they told me that's typical of this product!<br /><br />I was excited about this sauce because I wanted a way to evenly coat  pizzas, but all I got were over-priced spray bottles filled with something I really can't describe as edible. I'd fill it with another sauce but it'd probably just clog the nozzle.<br /><br />It's also intended for use as a natural pest repellent. Dave's suggest spritzing some on your garden to keep the rodents & birds away. I never tried so I don't know if it works as claimed. I hope it does or else this product is completely without merit.

review/summary: Not sure this is the real thing
review/text: I have had mate de coca in recent travels and enjoyed the fact that it gave me energy without messing with any of my other systems as caffeine often does.  There are a few things you'll notice when drinking real mate de coca.  The initial most obvious effect is the slight numbing sensation you experience in your mouth when you take a sip.<br /><br />I recently ordered this product and it has failed to have the same effect that true mate de coca has.  This leads me to believe that this is not real mate de coca.  I'm not sure if this is because this particular re seller decides not to sell the real thing, or if it's because the actual product apparently has some ambiguous legal issues here in the US which forces the real thing to be stripped of the elements which stimulate alertness.  As far as my reading is concerned coca tea is in fact legal in the US, although it seems as if that may not always be the case.

review/summary: Safety Instructions for coca tea
review/text: High quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />Organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All coca tea Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods. An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store coca tea products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea.

review/text: I was so excited when I had read about this tea and wanted to try it and saw it was sold here on Amazon. I quickly placed my order.  It arrived quickly (about 5 days) so no problem there.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and the tea was mislabeled as something else...basic green tea from China.  I contacted the seller and was told that they do this so as not to have any issues with customs.  The seller also told me to mix the powder with a bit of baking soda and put it in my mouth and if it numbed it than it was good....well it didn't.  I tried to brew the tea also and guess what?  It was awful..I drink a lot of tea too, so I think I would know if this was ok or not.  It made me tired, and didn't give me any kick of energy or any clarity at all...as a matter of fact it was a total waste of money.  I would not buy from this seller again. Don't waste your money!

review/text: I received the shipment very quickly, and started getting down to how much powder per cup to use, and came up with about .5g (a little over half a tablespoon) per 6 fluid oz of water, steeped for ten to fifteen minutes worked out the best for me.  It's a touch on the strong side if you do it that way, so if you like a more delicate flavor, less time is probably the best.<br /><br />Numbed up an aching tooth nicely, and woke me straight up, though no jitters or anxiety.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with it!  The only "complaint" I would have is that the packaging is a little, mmm.  Well, clever, but I needed to store it in one of my own storage containers that I had kicking around.  That's it, really.  =)

review/summary: Delicious and mildly stimulating.
review/text: This tea arrived promptly in an obviously hand-filled plastic bag, with aluminum foil wrapped around it and a nice handwritten note from the seller. The tea is in the form of a super-fine, talcum-like green powder.<br /><br />It tastes great, very much like the green tea you'd receive at a good sushi restaurant, but better, in my opinon. It's great hot, and also fine ice cold. I didn't bother with bags -- just a pinch in the near-boiling water will do. A little goes a long way, so an ounce, for example, can last for weeks or longer.<br /><br />It is stimulating, but smoothly so -- even smoother than strong coffee or normal tea, I'd say. I've never felt jumpy or "wired" from drinking this tea, even after several cups, which I've done several times on cool winter days. You don't notice any feeling other than the soothing, aromatic tea experience. I do find that it's best not to drink within a few hours of when you want to go to bed, however.<br /><br />I plan to buy this fresh, delicious tea again, and would recommend it to anyone interested in trying it, particularly if you enjoy the taste of green tea.<br /><br />Five stars. Highly recommended.

It fails the 'gum test', where you can feel a slight numbing from the alkaloids.  However, you may fail a drug test if you use this because the minute chemicals in here will appear to show that you use Cocaine recently .. but, it will not be because you enjoyed the benefit of the alkaloids that were originally in the leaves.

review/text: Seeing as simply anyone can 'review' items with out really having to buy anything and also how two reviewers, who said they know their 'tea's', stated that they were very disappointed to find that they have received not 'coca ' but 'GREEN', TEA. Now, when it comes to getting a refund , what could those people really DO about it? Argue that they should have received genuine,ground up 'coca' leaf when it is Illegal in america? Now, there IS 'coca leaf tea' which has had the alkaloids removed, available but WHO would want that? Even if they did get 'alkaloid free coca' how would they prove if it was real or not without spending serious cash for some Botanist to check it out? Isn't the most part of the 'Experience' in the 'alkaloids' ? So what would be the point in trying this if it had been stripped of it's 'goodies' other than for a 'novel purpose' which in My mind would be like drinking the 'Tea' of some plain leaf material. Another thing, people reported feeling tired and fatigued or something like that,after trying the tea. I know that Kratom tea does this to people and I wonder if THAT is what this 'tea' really is, or some kind of 'admixture' of green tea and Kratom. I highly suspect that the 5 star reviews are not genuine since I have not bought anything and I can leave a review. This is what came into my mind when I read the reviews and then by checking it out and seeing I could leave a 'review' without ordering proves to me the likelihood of false promotion by the sellers who may be creating false reviews. Say what you will but until the option to 'review' is given only to those who have bought this product, and then I can be 100% confident that the 'reviews' are not false, I will not be buying this product. Something tells me that if the 'review' option WAS given only to those who have purchased something, that this product would receive very steady and poor ratings. Unless you like taking uncertain chances with your money or if your rich enough that you don't care about the risk, I wouldn't buy this. Be Careful, People !

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: For years now I've been curious about "this leaf" from South America. I've often seen it mentioned and tried on various travel programs, usually with glowing comments. Not knowing that the product was available in the USA, until recently I never tried it. A few weeks, ago while surfing Amazon, there in front of me were various products made with coca leaves. I was actually quite astonished as I was convinced it was unavailable here. With my adventurous nature I ordered a number of the products, some powdered, some whole leaves and some with roughly crushed leaves. I read up on various ways the leaves should be tried, from tea, chewing whole leaves with some added alkali as well as a sundry of other methods. I went into this exploration with a very positive attitude. Unfortunately I was soon disappointed. I don't believe that any of the products, no matter how they were used, had any effect on me whatsoever. While it's true that if you leave the product in touch with the tongue or gums it produces numbness, apart from that...... absolutely no effect whatsoever. Having spent almost $200 on these products needless to say I was quite annoyed.<br /><br />Surfing Google about the leaves available in the USA, apparently some, if not most or all of these products are modified to make them legal in this country. Just as you can buy decaffeinated coffee, these products can be modified or treated to remove many of the active chemicals native to this leaf. My guess is that the products I purchased were modified in this way, contrary to the assertions of the sellers.<br /><br />In view of this the best way to try these leaves is to book a trip to South America, something I don't plan on doing myself.<br /><br />As the saying goes, you win some and you loose some. With these leaves, I lost them all.<br /><br />I invite the supplier to comment on my review.<br /><br />Addendum  10/25/12<br /><br />Regarding the processing of the product prior to sale, I have been advised by Pijama Cafe and the Mysterious Bolivian that "we only sell what it is under regulations." I can only interpret that to mean that much of the alkaloid content has been reduced prior to selling the product..because as they state  "we only sell what it is under regulations."<br /><br />The home page on their website states<br /><br />"As coffee can be decaffeinated, the coca tea can also be decocainized. Just like "decaf" coffee does retain a minute quantity of caffeine, "Decocainized" coca tea will still contain a minute quantity of the drug. When the cocaine is removed, the amount of cocaine is small enough for the product to legally sell in the USA according to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs "Wikipedia" .........  "  "Some of our coca products are produced under processes that controls the amount of illegal alkaloids leaving behind only the beneficial alkaloids."<br /><br />The notes above appears to answer all questions as to whether the product is or isn't processed.

review/text: To those reviewers who did not get a significant lift (a bit stronger than strong green tea, but similar in that it gives mental alertness and clarity without coffee-like jitters), you have to add a base. Baking soda mixed in with approximately an 8:1 ration (8 parts coca tea, 1 part baking soda) does the trick. A small pinch between lip and gum and let it slowly dissolve over time, and you get a definite lift in energy, alertness, and appetite suppression. Very subtle but pleasant. If you are expecting something like the synthetic product, forget it. But it is essentially inactive without the baking soda. No problems with the sel<br />ler, though I'd like it to come a bit quicker.

review/summary: Contains alkyloid but is week....
review/text: Product does contain Alkyloids but is week..... I wonder if powdered organic material is 100% coca leaf or if it is combinatioan of ingredients. I am not previous familiar with this product in its natural precursor state. The ground up powder smells like alfalfa . Perhaps the mix leaf and green tea together at a ratio to reduce alkyloid content to legal levels? I would like to try whole leaf instead of powedered next time. I wouldnt hesitate to try this product as it does have actives . Best bet is chew with high ph substsance such as lime or soda to extract actives. Can this stuff be smoked?

review/summary: good
review/text: I bought this because I was lucky enough to have somebody send me some of the tea and candy he bought while in Peru.  While this tea powder is good, its not as strong as the other......but then again, this coca powder is labeled organic, and I'm sure what I took wasn't organic that was from Peru......its kinda like non organic coffee will give you that cracked out buzz, but organic coffee is more mellow, but also strong.....thats kinda how I would describe this.  I did feel an intense focus, and I that I felt the numbing feeling on my gums when I applied some to mine.....not as strong as what I had from Peru, but still effective.  I am curious to try a different brand.  Thanks Amazon for allowing me to enjoy my coca tea!  : )

review/summary: LIked it a lot
review/text: I wonder if the people who reported it didn't work consume a lot of caffine? I don't use any caffine products so this coca tea certainly had a positive effect without the caffine jitters. Did feel some improved energy and clarity. I look forward to each cup of coca tea. I would have liked more info on how much powder to use per cup. The instructions said use a few leaves (no leaves in the bag i got just powder)so I just experimented with the powder. I put the powder into empty tea bags and that works great. I use about a 1/4 teaspoon per cup and I have no idea if that is too much or too little but it tastes good and works.  I started with a small purchase but am confident I'll order more. Arrived very fast. Love it!

review/summary: Excellent Medicinal Tea
review/text: I got this tea to see if it would help my brother who suffers from acute sinusitis.  We found that Cardamom Green Tea has been the most helpful and have been looking for herbal teas that can synergize with this.  The Coca Leaf Tea does this.  It seems that it is a mild systemic tonic that boosts overall health and seems to give some mental lightness and clarity.  It helps lift the brain fog that sometimes happens when he needs to take a strong anti-histamine.  The brew that we make is to add 1/2 teaspoon of the Coca Leaf Powder into 4 cups of boiling water, turn off the heat, and let simmer for about 5 minutes, and then adding a small amount of stevia as a sweetener.<br /><br />This particular batch of Coca Leaf Tea feels very fresh.  You can taste the chlorophyll.  It feels similar in this respect to a high grade Sencha powdered Green Tea.  The taste is very mellow and flavorful.  I am very happy with this product.<br /><br />One small note:  The product came in a thick plastic bag rather than the metal tin that is shown in the picture.  It seems wiser to send the tea this way as the bag seems well designed to not accidentally open.  But I was looking forward to collecting a metal tin.

review/summary: WARNING***COCA LEAF WILL SHOW POSITIVE FOR COCAINE IN DRUG TEST***
review/text: My boyfriend just got fired from his job b/c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com, people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as "illegal" by the US Government.<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c technically you DID INJEST Cocaine, just in it's natural form.  The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.<br /><br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com

review/summary: It's the Voodoo That You Do
review/text: People in the old days had it easy -- go to work in the factories at age eight, slave for eighteen hours a day, live in filth and die at thirty. They didn't worry about free radicals or bad cholesterol or high-fructose gruel syrup. Lucky peasants.<br /><br />But modern medicine doesn't have all the answers, either. So I turned to 'alternative medicine'. Or I would've, if I could afford all that holistic health paraphernalia. So now I'm giving 'ALTERNATIVE alternative medicine' a whirl.<br /><br />If pop culture and old James Bond films have taught us anything, it's that voodoo dolls are scary good juju. Or bad juju. Or filled with jujubes. Something like that. But they're powerful stuff, any way you stick them.<br /><br />I suffered a nasty mosquito bite on my leg this week, and it simply wouldn't stop itching. Rather than turn to a 'doctor' or 'calamine lotion' to cure it -- because what do THEY know? -- I pulled out the voodoo doll that comes with this hot sauce. I found the approximate spot on the doll corresponding to my itch, and gave it a solid jab with a needle for relief.<br /><br />When I came to, I was lying on my kitchen floor writhing in pain. I managed to pull the pin out, which stopped the searing stabs shooting down my leg -- but the itch was still there. So I compromised, and rubbed some of the hot sauce onto the bite instead. That burned sort of quite a lot, too, but at least I can still walk. And the itch is gone, and now I know what a hot wing drumstick feels like. I'm calling that 'progress'.

review/summary: Quality product, but hot!
review/text: I started out as a Tobasco lover, but I have found that hot sauce is a staple of Africa as well as Mexico, etc.  In my experience, the African recipes are decidedly a cut above the rest.  Voodoo Juice is a quality product.  Although I am a hot sauce lover, I find Voodoo Juice is hot for real, and is at the top of my chart for my hotness toleration (but not above it).  I would have preferred a little less hotness so that I could use more of it. But it definitely does the trick. It is one of "Captain Thom's" hot sauces.  All Captain Thom's products are first rate. I became acquainted with Captain Thom's when I tried their "White Zombe" (Hey, this is really good!)  I also recommend "Brother Bru-Bru's", another great African recipe.

review/text: Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but.... that is not a bad thing in this case. They are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious. Our kids just love them. We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:<br /><br />Calories: 120<br /><br />Fat: 4.5<br /><br />Trans Fat: 0<br /><br />Sodium: 270<br /><br />Carbohydrate: 17<br /><br />Protein: 3<br /><br />For our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat & 25 carb. This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time.

review/summary: Over Rated (way over priced)Frozen meats
review/text: For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!

review/text: I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.

review/summary: These are the best hash browns!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I got these in the mail today, i know right, sounds so weird to say i got hash browns in the mail, haha.  Come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags.  Just stick them on a baking sheet for 35 min. at 400 degrees.  when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside, if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat, hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage, your choice, this get a 5/5 for taste, 5/5 for presentation, buy these now, great price too, thanks for your time, and thank you omaha steaks, the best at great prices.

review/summary: Au Gratin Potatoes
review/text: January 3, 2011<br /><br />I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect ... The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasn't it ... I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... I give these 4 stars.

review/text: Potatoes were good. Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x-mas dinner today or I wouldn't have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol. (not Omaha's fault)

review/summary: Iam's canned dog food
review/text: I finally found a product that my dogs absolutely love. I have tried numerous brands and in several varieties but my dogs never seemed to wait so eagerly to be fed. I have tried all three flavors of this brand but they seem to like the chicken and rice flavor the best. It makes their coats shinier and it gives them a general all around healthier look about them. Now that I've found something they truly enjoy I hope they don't raise the price. A good value, in my opinion.

review/text: Red Tea Leaf's Espresso Matcha is amazing!<br /><br />This product has helped with the joint inflammation in my hands.  I was told I had arthritis and that it would probably get worse.  After my own research, I found that an anti-inflammatory diet could help.  Matcha Green Tea was mentioned by several sources. Red Tea Leaf teas are excellent and their customer service is fast and friendly.  I had tried several different brands, but Red Tea Leaf's variety of favors that they mix with the Matcha was what drew me to this company.<br /><br />I chose Espresso Matcha because I am a coffee drinker, but wanted to drink several glasses of Matcha Green Tea a day and knew I would have to forgo my coffee to drink this much (and I love coffee).  There is a subtle flavor of espresso mixed with the Matcha green tea.<br /><br />During a workout when a bar bell completely slipped out of my hand because I lost my grip, I decided I had to try something.  I stopped drinking coffee `cold turkey' as soon as my Espresso Matcha from Red Tea Leaf order arrived and never once got a headache.<br /><br />My favorite summer time way to drink this tea is to mix 1 heaping scoop of Matcha green tea into my 20 oz. water bottle the night before, then refrigerate so I `m ready to go in the morning (I make 3 of these each night when I `m packing my lunch).  Just make sure to shake it before you drink it, the Matcha tea settles to the bottom.  Within two weeks, the ache-y feeling in my hands every morning almost completely disappeared!  I am able to grip jars to open them without pain.  During my workouts, I focus completely on form and only later realize, I never thought once about my hands!  They do not hurt... at all!<br /><br />As for my diet, I ate very `clean' before I started drinking Matcha tea from Red Tea Leaf and I love scientific research (I know, nerdy), so drinking 3 heaping scoops of Matcha tea a day was the only change that I made.  I consistently drink 60-80 oz of water now, but even before when I tried drinking this much water to flush out my system my hands still hurt.  It was not until I added the Match green tea from Red Tea leaf that I noticed an improvement in my hand.<br /><br />I am so happy with this product!  Thank you Red Tea Leaf!

review/summary: The cats like it
review/text: My 7 cats like this food but it is a little yucky for the human. Pieces of mackerel swimming in a dark broth. It is billed as a "complete" food and contains carrots, peas and pasta. Why, I don't know, since these are not foods that a cat would eat in the wild. An OK alternative to go along with their dry food.
