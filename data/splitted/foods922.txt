review/summary: I was pleasantly surprised at how good these cookies are
review/text: I have Celiac Disease and have tried several brands of gluten free "bought" cookies as I call them.  I have always been disappointed and resorted to baking my own.  Although baking my own is fine, sometimes I would like the convenience of being able to have cookies on hand when the urge strikes, or to grab when I'm on the go.  I ordered a "case" each of the oatmeal and the sugar cookies and was very pleased with both of them, although I slightly favored the oatmeal.  I purposely tried to detect the usual "off taste" that I've found in other cookies - there is no "off taste" to either of these flavors.  Both cookies are crisp, just the way I like them....I have just one word for them "yummy"!

review/text: These are pretty darn good cookies!  I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00213IAUQ">Lucy's Cinnamon Thins, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> but these are a close second.<br /><br />The cookies are crunchy, not chewy.  They do have a lot of sugar on the top but it is only noticeable if you have several at a time.  Seemed sweeter  to me than the cinnamon thins.<br /><br />Not crumbly or cakey.  No funky taste.<br /><br />Only 8 in the package, not very many at all.  Putting that in a positive light, you can consider it built-in portion control.  Handy if you're like me and sometimes happen to snack without actually paying attention to how much you are eating.

review/text: As someone who has been at this for a very long time...wheat free that is... I have tried dozens and dozens of gluten free cookies.<br />A cookie-a-holic I have to have my morning coffee with a cookie.<br />Up until this point most of the gluten free cookies have been huge disappointments..<br />I have thrown more practically full boxes of cookies in the trash than I care to remember...they were just not worth the calories, they were that bad.<br />I do like Pamela's brand Biscotti cookies...but they are the only other cookie I've found good enough to spend the money on.<br />And lets face it prejudice abounds in the gluten free aisle...everything is outrageously expensive.<br />But these..they are lovely, crunchy, no grainy texture, no strange after taste, vegan, low calorie and low fat...actually a miracle of a cookie.<br />Most gluten free cookies are loaded with fat...and as I limit fat content that was another big draw back.<br />No problem here though, only 1.5-2 grams of fat per 4 cookie serving.<br />I have tried all 4 flavors and each is excellent, I don't think any would disappoint.

There are so many additives in today's food, that it is nice to know that there is a product that is completely natural.  You also have the feeling that you can trust this product, since you know that she created this for her own child. The calorie count is less than other cookies, and it also does nto affect diabetics as significantly as regular cookies do. I highly recommend this product, as well as her other cookies. While I do love chocolate chip, my absolute favorite would be the cinnamon.  Enjoy!!

review/summary: What a Treat!
review/text: I have a son who is allergic to milk, eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts; however, he can eat wheat.  We have tried lots of allergy-friendly products and are sometimes disappointed with the wheat-free ones as the texture and taste is often very different from products made with traditional ingredients.  That is not the case with these cookies.  They are by far the best allergy-friendly cookies that we have tried yet!  They have a nice, crisp (but not hard) cookie texture.  I was also impressed with the shelf-life on the cookies that we tried.  Many allergy-friendly cookies have a very short shelf-life, but the Lucy's cookies that we tried today didn't expire until October.  Way to go Dr. Lucy on creating an excellent allergy-friendly product!

review/text: As a relative of a child with severe food allergies, i have always struggled with what to serve when the child comes to visit.  Until i heard of (then tasted) these gems! Not only are they super safe for children (or anyone) with food allergies, they are delicious.  I find myself purchasing some just when i get a cookie craving.  they are hands down the best line of cookies I have ever had....Great flavor (you would NEVER know that these were produced with safe products rather than traditional cookie ingredients).  I think one of the hardest thing for parents and relatives and friends of people with allergies is finding GOOD, tasty foods...especially sweets.  If you have a loved one with a food allergy, i think you should stock these in your pantry (but beware, you will find yourself craving them as well!!!)

Since a lot of the gluten-free foods I've tried have left (IMHO) something to be desired, these were a very pleasant surprise. The grandkids love them too - a true test of cookie goodness.<br /><br />I can buy these locally for about $3 per 5.5 ounce box. I offer this info so that buyers can decide if Amazon's current price, whatever it may be, is a bargain.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: As a mom with Celiac disease with one son that has a tree nut allergy and another that has a soy allergy, I really wanted to like these cookies.  We are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food.  Wouldn't it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and I could grab on the go?  I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to pick up a 1.25 oz. pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package.  The smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off.  The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie. Although I would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards, I put that aside when reviewing this cookie.  I do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie.

They are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale, and then they leave an awful aftertaste.  They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.

The instructions say 8-10 drops in a glass of water, but we have reverse osmosis water so I find I need twice that to make my water alkaline. RO water is acidic to begin with. If you think this product alone will alkalazize you, youre wrong! Its not meant to do that! It will alkalanize you water (coffee is harder to alkalanaize) but unless youre eating a healthy diet with lots of greens, youre going to struggle to become alkaline. This product is an excellent boost to a healthy diet. Ill keep using it!

And let me tell you, Victoria's is just about as close to the real thing as you get out of a jar. Tastes fresh and not loaded with preservatives and unnecessary additives; quick, easy and fast just serve it with your pasta of choice. This is a plus for us working stiffs. Penne, cheese tortellini and ravioli go best. Frutti Di Bosco ravioli (mushroom-shaped with ricotta, porcini, marrons glace, parmigiano & romano) is my favorite vodka sauce companion.

review/text: I have been an avid Celestial tea drinker for a number of years and this<br />by far was a favorite of mine, until they changed it.<br />  Not only did the company decide to package it differently , they have also<br />added a blend of white tea in it. In my opinion they ruined a perfectly good<br />product.<br />  The tea itself seems weaker to me, not smoother.<br />For the past year, this tea, prior to the change, was difficult to find in my local<br />grocery store.  I purchased it online and was fully satisfied until the last shipment arrived<br />and the new tea was sent. Needless to say, I won't be buying this again unless the company returns<br />back to the original , which was superior to this by far.<br />  Why oh why can't companies leave things alone? New does not necessarily mean better and in this case<br />it rings true.

review/text: Big green tea fan and love Celestial Seasonings.  The decaf mint is very tasty but I get tired of it before the gallon is gone  (I know, just make less...).  Not so with the regular decaf green tea or the decaf china white teas.

review/summary: My favorite (non-caffeinated) chai
review/text: I wrote the following review for the Black Tea version, but it also applies to the Redbush which I started drinking since getting pregnant and trying to avoid caffeine:<br /><br />I've been a chai afficionado for a while, and even more so since my trip to Nepal 2 years ago. There I was able to taste chai both in restaurants and in homes, and I have to say that Yogi's chai is the best and most authentic one I've ever tried.<br /><br />I steep it directly in milk every morning, it's a very comforting way to start the day.<br /><br />If you need the caffeine jolt, check out the Black tea chai.

review/text: Yogi Redbush Chai is an exceptional brew that has found itself a subject of particular fondness. Mixed with a little bit of sweetener and just enough soy milk to create a faintly cloudy caramel hue, this chai makes a spectacular any-time tea. It's spicy, though not overwhelmingly so, and when mixed with milk it becomes a delicate but warm tea. Give this one a go if you're on the lookout for a good chai tea.

review/summary: Beats out Starbucks and Twinings Chai Tea
review/text: My wife is Indian and loves Chai tea, but we're busy people and it takes a long time to make it properly. She has tried the following:<br /><br />1. Starbucks Chai Latte (from Starbucks)<br />2. Starbucks Chai (concentrate, the cardboard box with the syrup in it)<br />3. Trader Joe's Spiced Chai (powder)<br />4. Oregon Chai (powder and liquid)<br />5. Some other Chai powder that Costco had a few years ago but I don't remember the name now.<br />6. Twinings Chai Tea (formerly Indian Spiced Chai, and formerly good)<br /><br />For a while, Starbucks was #1 while #6 was the backup.  After Twinings changed their recipe, and she found Yogi Chai Rooibos (thanks, Garett!), even Coffee Bucks can't compare!  This is exactly what she was looking for.<br /><br />Mix 3/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup water, 1 tsp sugar, tea bag, steep for 6 minutes and you'll make a perfect cup every time, at like 1/20th the price of Starbucks.<br /><br />One word of warning, however, if you're looking for this tea to wake you up - it is not caffeinated!

review/text: I've never had Chai tea before, because I don't drink green or black teas, but upon hearing that Chai tea was really good, I was pleased to find an herbal Chai.<br /><br />I've been very pleased with this tea. It has a nice blend of flavors, but no one is overpowering. It smells great when you are steeping it. I pop a couple of these in my fuzzy logic rice cooker, set it on for 10-15 minutes, pour some sugar and milk in, and enjoy it. My wife loves it too.<br /><br />If you want a great smelling, great tasting herbal Chai Tea, give this a shot. I can't compare it to other teas, but I like it. You also get a good amount of tea for a rather decent price.<br /><br />Hope this review was helpful. If you have any questions or if I can clarify anything, leave me a comment!

review/summary: Yogi Chai Rooibos
review/text: I ordered Yogi Chai Rooibos because my very favorite Kalahari's Zambezi Red Chai is not presently available.  Perhaps if I'd never had the Kalahari product I would rate this chai higher.  But for me, it just not as good.<br /><br />The Yogi red chai is pleasant, but rather wimpy compared to the Kalahari.  I like a fuller, spicier flavor.  Also, be warned, that if you don't like a sweet tea, or you add sweetener to your tea, there is already Stevia in the Yogi red chai.  I always add Splenda to my tea and found that this Yogi tea was sickeningly sweet.  When I checked the ingredients, I noticed there was Stevia leaves in it.  I've since adjusted the amount of sweetener I add.<br /><br />There aren't a lot of rooibos chais around, so Yogi Rooibos Chai will have to do for now.  I hope Kalahari will be back soon though.

review/summary: Spicy and delicious
review/text: This is my go to tea for chai, since anyone can drink it at any time without needing to worry about getting the jitters. Make it with milk or condensed milk and a spoonful of maple syrup for a delicious treat whenever you feel like a quick pickmeup. The aromatic spices will wake up all your senses. The Detox is similar, by the way, with a slightly more bitter taste, and the Thai one with coconut is a less spicy version. The Indian spice one is way too spicy for me, so this is just right if you are looking for authentic chai you can enjoy with or without food.

review/text: I love black tea chai but since I'm avoiding caffeine I drink the Rooibos Chai. This is a very good blend given that a red tea blend will never have the richness that the black tea chai has. I love it with a teaspoon or so of "Honey Ginger Crystals." Amazon sells them. It gives it the extra spicy ginger kick that I love and a little bit of sweet. Very yummy.

review/text: The Yogi Chai Rooibos tea is one of the best chai teas I've ever tasted! It has a naturally sweet flavor that is not overpowering, and I love it because I do not have to add sweetener to it. There is also a hint of ginger and spice which makes this a great pick-me-up, wonderful given the fact that it is also caffeine-free! This is an excellent herbal tea which is healthy and made with organic ingredients. It can also be steeped in milk for those desiring a milky taste or taken as is. I would also recommend the Green Tea Antioxidant by the same brand.

review/text: I absolutely could not find a korma sauce at my local grocery store, even though it has a good ethnic selection. Bought this and couldn't be happier! Bought the 6-pack two months ago and I have to buy another pack today. I'm the type of cook who has to fiddle with anything that comes out of a box, so I add salt, pepper, cumin and garam masala as the sauce is simmering. Most Indian sauces are yogurt or cream based, so I also add cream cheese to give it a creamier feel. I think the extra spices and the cream cheese make the sauce perfect, but it is yummy right out of the package with no modifications. I usually just eat the sauce over rice [try [ASIN:B00269WUTC Tilda Basmati Rice, 10-Pound Bag]] but have also added chicken while the sauce is simmering and that is good too. It's not the quality you would get at a restaurant, but that's not what I expected so I'm happy.

I regretted it instantly, because you could tell the sauce would be very thin. I added another package of the Good Korma to try to thicken it a bit. Still I could tell it was going to be blah, so I added some cashews and a little coconut milk. Served over rice and everyone thought it was totally bland and boring. It was edible, just not interesting at all. Sad it didn't taste any better because it was a nice quick meal.

review/text: This is a perfect fit.  I love almosr every bar that is presented in this package, I save the peanurt butter cups ofr my sone they are not my favorite..<br /><br />I just love chocolate, these are always very fresh and packaged well.  I did not buy this particular one here, but I got the same item in a local warehouse store near me. I find that these are a very good assortment of bars for the adults in the house, but be careful the little ones will like these also.  Yummy......

review/summary: Be aware....
review/text: This company-Fast-Pak Trading Inc. locates in New Jersey. We used to buy honey they are distributing here in Brooklyn for couple years now. Manuka is our favorite,but in past year its price just skyrocketed,so we switched to Kamahi and Thyme.<br />We love Kamahi-it has distinctive taste,not as many American honeys we were trying for years. BUT!!! Last time we bought Kamahi from the same Fast-Pak Trading Inc. in the local store-it was different honey! Although label says it's the same,but I know the taste and can say for sure-they put something different in the jar. It's more like clover honey,something cheaper and less tasty. So,be aware of it,when you're buying honey from this company.<br />Other than that-Kamahi is great honey.

review/text: I picked up a box of this because I'd started drinking herbal teas at night and wanted to expand my horizons.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but all the bags had a strange smell that found its way into the brewed tea and just made this the most unappetizing tea I've ever tried.<br /><br />Tazo's a good brand.  I'm drinking a big mug of iced tea made with their Passion blend right now.  But their Calm blend just rubbed my nose the wrong way.

review/text: When I leaned down to breathe in the (expected) delicate aroma of my first (and last) cup steeping, I was taken aback by the smell. I've gotten a whiff of something similar once or twice before...couldn't put my finger on it but it reminded me of cat urine, or spoiled milk in a closed car on a hot summer day. I can't even give this stuff away - my coworkers, who usually scarf up anything free in the kitchen, turned their noses up at this too. Like another reviewer, I wonder if I received a bad batch. I was very disappointed.

review/summary: Fine Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Calm Herbal Infusion is a nice chamomile tea. I taste the chamomile and some flavorings, and they are not unpleasant, just hard to pin down as to what they are besides the chamomile. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />The ingredients in Calm are: chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice and natural flavors. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the package, Tazo writes, "a soothing blend of chamomile blossoms and other relaxing herbs." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Calm as "creamy, floral, minty, toasty, sweet, honey-like. As the name gently implies, Tazo Calm has a lovely floral bouquet with an apple-like flavor and distinct toasty notes.  Naturally sweet in a nice light way, with a smooth finish". Tazo describes the aroma as "minty, hay like, rose". I don't taste all of these various flavors, but I do taste the chamomile, and it is fine, not overwhelming or as artificial tasting as several of the other Tazo teas I've sampled.<br /><br />The bulk packaging is a definitely plus, making Tazo Calm much more affordable.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Calm gets only four stars.<br />****

review/summary: the worst tea ever
review/text: i'm not a stranger to herbal teas, so i do know what i'm talking about. this tea claims to have a variety of herbs NONE of which can be tasted. it's also chamomile based but i've never had chamomile of such low quality, i didn't know chamomile could taste so horribly badly.<br />first off, in order to get any taste of tea in your cup you need to use at least 3 bags. second, when you do achieve some sort of taste - which is still very faint, even with 3 bags - you will be disgusted at the quality of it. my guess is that it's made from the lowest oldest most defective refuses of herbs they could get their hands on. i've never tried it at starbucks but teas sold there are different and much better quality. i bought this tea at a grocery store and unlike other tazo teas it's undrinkable.

review/text: These were exactly what I have come to expect from Starburst. The only thing I'd critique is that it seems that they come with a lot more strawberry flavor than anything else (I am sure this intentional by the makers.) and it's my least favorite. Each one is individually wrapped and the bag itself is a zip-close bag for double freshness. If you eat a handful a day, one bag will last you for quite a while! And, you get two bags with this deal so you could even share some with your nieces and nephews. :)

review/summary: Great Price, Somewhat too hard...
review/text: I bought these to share with a friend who loved Starburst. One bag would have been enough! I'm not sure if it's something to do with humidity or not but after awhile they seemed to get harder and harder. I kept the bag closed and in a dark place, not sure what happened. It wasn't a Warehouse Deals purchase. If you're looking to buy these in bulk to save throughout the year I'd advise against it just because the harder they get the more difficult (for candy) they get to eat and you enjoy them less.

I'll be using spray butter to improve the taste, but from here out, I'm buying Orville's Light Butter popcorn - better size, better flavor and better price when purchased at Costco.
