review/summary: excellent gluten-free spaghetti: great taste, great structure
review/text: I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite "grains"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.

review/summary: Great alternative pasta
review/text: This was excellent tasting pasta.  I wanted an alternative to whole-wheat pasta, which I do not care for, and this was far better than I hoped.  I like this as much as regular white pasta.  It has a great taste and nice texture. I will be buying it again.<br /><br />It is not hard to cook.  I boil the water.  I use less water than the box recommends because my favorite pasta pan is smaller.  I put enough to cover it at least an inch and a half.  I add a bit of salt, about a teaspoon (less for pesto and more for some tomato recipes).  When the water boils, I add a splash of olive oil and the pasta.  I boil it 8 minutes. Add sauce of choice.

review/summary: Great Gluten Free Spaghetti
review/text: This gluten free spaghetti is the best of the gluten free pastas I've tried.  It tastes better than regular spaghetti and has a good texture.  It is not so high in fiber (like some of the rice pastas) that it would set off someone's sensitive digestive systems, which is a relief to me!  I like it so much that I would buy it on subscribe and save.  It is hard to buy in the store in the area where I live and so convenient to have delivered at such a reasonable price right to my home.

review/summary: A Grateful Celiac
review/text: I am a recently diagnosed celiac, and not having wheat is a challenge.  My first experience of spaghetti sauce on rice noodles was awful.  Rice noodles are extremely bland.  However, this pasta is AWESOME!!!!!  My family tried it too, and can hardly tell the difference from regular wheat pasta. They will gladly eat this pasta with me.  I am a pasta lover, so the celiac diet has been a tough one.  Now I will be able to once again enjoy the pasta dishes I love without making my family suffer through eating rice noodles.

review/summary: This used to be my favorite
review/text: After being diagnosed with Celiacs disease, I had a heck of a time finding a gluten free pasta that I liked.  When I found this quinoa pasta at Whole Foods, it became my favorite.  Once you figure out the right cooking time, it won't disappoint. We are in Albuquerque (high altitude)so it takes exactly nine minutes to perfect aldente. It has a nice flavor, but lets face it - once you get the texture right -  pasta is really about the sauce anyway. The noodles are a little on the thin side, which is why I say it used to be my favorite:  I have since found Tinkyada Brown Rice Spaghetti with Rice Bran - My new favorite. The noodles are thicker like wheat spaghetti. And they have the perfect texture and flavor when cooked properly. But that's a different review... I love the Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta, Spaghetti Style and their macaroni product makes great macaroni and cheese and pasta salad. But that too is a different review...

review/summary: Great flavor--now I can include pasta in my eating plan again.
review/text: I've been eating low carb for almost two years and had been serving my family a LC pasta (Dreamfields).  Then recently I was diagnosed gluten & casein sensitive so that pasta was out.  After trying a box of this from my local natural foods market my husband declared he absolutely LOVED the taste.  So I ordered it from Amazon for a better price and stocked up my pantry.  I still alternate for myself between this and spiral-sliced zucchini (made with the World Cuisine Spiral Slicer I bought on Amazon--see my review on that).<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, you definitely have to time it just right; don't overcook it or you will be disappointed.  Otherwise, great pasta!

review/text: Since I am gluten intolerant, I have really missed good pasta. This Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta, Spaghetti Style is the closest you can come to the real thing. You do have to be careful not to over or under cook it. Overcook and it will be mushy, under cook and it will be too tough and clumpy. But you will learn to test it and get it right every time and oh, it is SO worth it! My family doesn't even know they aren't eating "regular" pasta.<br />Every variety of the Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta is exceptionally good. I asked them why they don't manufacture a lasagna noodle. They did try, but the breakage of the noodle made the packaging costs too high.<br />I highly recommend this pasta!

review/text: I recently discovered I have an issue with gluten (migraines, etc).  I have tried brown rice pasta and been very disappointing.  Even the one that says "not mushy" on the package.  I think that it is either undercooked or mushy.  The first time I tried quinoa pasta, I was a little turned off by the yellow color of the pasta until I tried it.  It tastes just like regular pasta.  I am so happy to finally find an alternative to pasta!!!

review/summary: Should say Corn & Quinoa
review/text: I should have looked at the ingredients! I thought I was ordering quinoa (only) pasta, but when I got it the largest ingredient is corn. The front of the package does not say anything about corn, so I was quite disappointed when I got a whole case of it. Plus, I ordered other quinoa pasta the same day from them too and it has the same break down on ingredients.<br /><br />It is probably not fair to give them such a low grade since it was my error for not looking at the ingredients, but I think their packaging is misleading.<br /><br />I read a bunch of reviews and people sure seemed to love it, but I have to stay away from corn and wheat or I feel awful so I never tried it.

review/text: Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but.... that is not a bad thing in this case. They are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious. Our kids just love them. We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:<br /><br />Calories: 120<br /><br />Fat: 4.5<br /><br />Trans Fat: 0<br /><br />Sodium: 270<br /><br />Carbohydrate: 17<br /><br />Protein: 3<br /><br />For our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat & 25 carb. This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time.

review/summary: Over Rated (way over priced)Frozen meats
review/text: For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!

review/text: I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.

review/summary: Au Gratin Potatoes
review/text: January 3, 2011<br /><br />I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect ... The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasn't it ... I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... I give these 4 stars.

review/text: Potatoes were good. Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x-mas dinner today or I wouldn't have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol. (not Omaha's fault)

review/summary: Is Crystal Light for adults or children
review/text: I drink Crystal Light as an alternative to soft drinks and a low calorie treat.  The taste is always great but I wish they offered a formula that did not contain chemicals just for presentation.  I mean I know this is products flavors are artificial.  There is no need for the artificial coloring.  I think that as an adult I could use a few less artificial compounds in my system.  The company could pass the savings back to the consumer. ...."Just a thought"

review/summary: Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kitten
review/text: My 6 month old male Tuxedo cat likes Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kitten, Chicken, Salmon and Vegetables, which is "Y" shaped kibble, similar to Californian Natural <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F782JY">Chicken and Rice Dry Cat and Kitten Food - 5 lb - Bag</a>. Premium Edge has a higher fat content than California Natural, and is therefore recommended only for kittens. Based on the stated ingredients and nutritional information, I award Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kitten, Chicken, Salmon and Vegetables, "5 Stars," even though the bag does not feature a resealable strip, which is a nice feature that some other kibble cat food bags have.

review/text: I was very pleased with the ingredient quality, taste (according to the kitties), price, and reasonable kibble size of this food. I fed this food to approximately 20 different cats and it was well received by the majority, even the extremely picky one. My cats eat a variety of food. They eat homemade raw, freeze dried raw, grain free dry/canned, and non grain-free dry/canned food. My personal, senior picky cat easily vomits with most food...this food was very easy on her sensitive stomach. I would not hesitate to purchase this food again

review/summary: Happy Camper
review/text: I bought this to try on two registered Maine Coon kittens, as one is picky and refused all previous dry foods.  I feed wet food several times a day and keep dry food available at all times.  To my surprise, they both love this dry food.  For a lower priced dry food, it has exceptional ingredients.  Fat content is high, but that's good for active, growing kittens.  I love hearing them crunching between wet food feedings.  At 12 months, I'll try to find a different dry food they like, but for now I'm a very happy camper.

review/summary: Two Siberians like it!
review/text: When we brought home two 3-month-old purebred Siberian kittens, this was the dry food I picked for them.  Wolfram, the boy, prefers this to his wet canned food!  Catmium, the girl, likes wet food better, but she'll eat this when she's hungry and there's no wet food.  (They also eat the kitten versions of Fancy Feast wet canned food; it used to be 1 can per cat daily, but we've cut down to half a can per cat daily.  Catmium was gobbling her wet food and then eating Wolfram's, and Wolfram was letting her, preferring to eat dry food; he likes the crunchiness.  Catmium didn't need two cans a day, so now we just put out one can a day and they eat dry food if they don't get enough of the wet.)  They are growing quickly, and they are adorable little furballs full of energy.  Their coats are soft and luxurious, too.

When you are dieting and just want 'something', a cup of this is infinitely better than that handful of chips, and stirs up in seconds.<br /><br />Recommended highly!

review/summary: Best of the bunch
review/text: My wife and I go through jalapeno slices like they're water (we eat a lot of nachos and also include these in most everything else we cook: huevos rancheros, meat loaf, etc., etc.) and these are the best we've tried. Also, the unit price at Amazon is the best we've found for any brand of japapeno slices. That's why we're sad: the last time I went to order more, Amazon was out of stock, with no projected availability date. What are we to do??

review/summary: delicious biscuits
review/text: These are the exact same biscuits that I ordered from another source for more than THREE TIMES the price. They are, without a doubt, the most delicious, rich, yummy biscuits that you have ever eaten.  In addition, they are shipped with dry ice so they arrive frozen, you put them directly into the freezer and then bake them frozen at the time you want them.  They are divine.  I'm never baking biscuits or rolls for holiday occasions again....the time, energy and effort required just isn't worth it when such heavenly biscuits are already available.  My family is addicted to them.

review/summary: Best Biscuits I Ever Ate!!!!
review/text: OMG!!! I am so glad that I ordered two dozen of these biscuits because they are so GOOD! They arrived frozen and they bake up nice and high, very tender and you can taste the cream cheese layer by layer. They are perfect as an addition to a savory meal or as a dessert or breakfast. For example, the day they arrived I made a dozen for a steak dinner that night, the next morning I had a taste for something sweet for breakfast so I decided to use two of the leftover biscuits with some brandy butter from Dean & Deluca with some fresh strawberries, blueberries and Reddi-Whip and I had a delicious breakfast. I highly recommend these biscuits!!!!!

review/summary: The Cream of Chicken with Herb you love
review/text: I've always liked the Cream of Chicken with Herb just because it has that extra flavor that the herbs bring to the soup.  I like eating this as a soup and use it in many casseroles and other dishes.  It's becoming harder and harder to find in the grocery store so I decided to buy this on Amazon.  A lot of the grocery items on Amazon are much more expensive than what they are priced in the store.  Since I can't find this at my local stores I can't compare exactly but comparing how much it costs for regular Cream of Chicken soup the cost-per-can is roughly the same with the subscribe and save discount, although it is more expensive on Amazon.  I'd recommend this and have this set up on a 6-month renewal.

review/text: I have used this for several months now and there is just nothing to compare it to.  I use a lot of it for a salmon recipe that calls for 1 tbsp of cajun seasoning.  It's also great on shrimp ... just cover with the seasoning and saute in a skillet with a little olive oil.  Buying the 2 oz. bottle I go thru a lot and I'm thrilled to find it out here on Amazon in a 24 oz. canister ... maybe this will last more than a month!

review/summary: Great taste but some unfortunate ingredients
review/text: This is a good tasting cereal, probably on the sweet side (the second ingredient is sugar). For taste alone, I'd give it 5 stars but I am deducting a star from my overall rating for "unfortunate" ingredients like disodium phosphate, caramel color, yellow 6, BHT, yellow 5, red 40, and blue 1. I don't understand the need for all the "junk" ingredients and all the coloring.<br /><br />As for delivery, my cereal arrived fine. There were no problems with shipping, delivery, or packaging. I received it on May 8, 2012 and the "Best Before" date was March 21, 2013.<br /><br />For a healthier cereal, I like "Kashi Organic Cereal, Cinnamon Harvest" which is made from a small number of ingredients without all the questionable stuff. It's also not as sweet. I give that one 5 stars because it also tastes great (even though it's not as sweet) but the ingredients are healthier than Life.

Whether it's for breakfast or just munching on a couple of handfuls for a snack, Cinnamon Life satisfies the hunger crave in all of us!  The sweet cinnamon taste seems to really appeal to breakfast cereal eaters alike.  The only slight complaint I have is it gets soggy really fast, so I try not to put a lot of milk on my cereal.

review/summary: Italian Sausage Success
review/text: This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5") and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy. I will be purchasing other blends in the future to also try.

review/summary: Mild/Hot Italian Sausage seasoning
review/text: We followed the directions closely for a 10 lb. mix of 1/2 venison and 1/2 pork. (We did mix the seasoning directly into the meat, then added a bit of water.) We then let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  We fried some patties up the next morning to taste test.<br /><br />The pepper seasoning came through, not excessively so, but it did linger a bit.  I have been known to like things hot (although my tastes have mellowed with age) and I would rate this between mild and medium.  I have tasted commercially prepared breakfast sausage that tasted hotter.  It definitely makes this a great sausage for using in spaghetti and other italian dishes.  By itself, the sausage is very flavorable.  We plan to pack 1/2 into casings and bulk store the rest for cooking Italian dishes.<br /><br />I do agree with one reviewer, it is a bit salty tasting and could be toned down a bit.  But, it is within the limits for a spicy sausage and will be fine used in other Italian recipes, IMHO.<br /><br />I would buy this again, but back off of the amount to mix into the meat (due to the salt) and add other Italian seasonings.
