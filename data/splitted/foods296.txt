review/summary: Pop Up Bowl is Terrible
review/text: The bowl bag does not pop in the same amount of time as a normal bag so it makes your microwave's popcorn button useless. Additionally, about half of the bags are faulty and open when popping resulting in very little popped popcorn. Last, I have found it almost impossible to get the bag to pop completely even when watching it pop (since I can't use the popcorn button!). Overall, this new bowl design is terrible and I would recommend switching to another brand until they go bag to the old bags that work.

review/text: I do not understand all of the negative reviews. I think this popcorn and the design of the bowl are wonderful. I like to have popcorn on my lunch break at work and there are no big popcorn bowls. Now I no longer have to reach inside a greasy bag to get to the popcorn. I did not notice any unpleasant taste at all.

review/summary: Not Worth the Price
review/text: I love this product, let me say that right off the bat. These pop up bowls are really easy to deal with and the popcorn is great tasting. However, for the price here on Amazon, it's a rip off.<br /><br />What you get is four boxes of three bags. I can get a box of 8 at the local Target for $4.18. If the price on Amazon is anything less that that get it in a heartbeat as it's a deal. However if it's at or anywhere near about $4, get up and go to the local store and pick up a much larger pack for the same value.<br /><br />Again, the product itself is a five star product, but the price for this has to be right. Don't overpay!!

review/text: My, my these are good! We have made them with organic coconut oil, canoloa oil and organic butter. They are pricey but worth every penny. NO TRANS FATS. Betty Crocker,  GSA and many others still have this toxic ingredient, and I have emailed and called both companies about this. They just get defensive and say the trans fats increase shelf life of their goods. The general public does not care enough about the health of themselves and loved ones to be informed consumers. Cancer and Heart disease are killing Americans off. Kudos to Kings Cupboard. A little sweet treat now and then will do not harm. Over doing it certainly will. Type 2 Dibates is a global epidemic......oy, what a world.

review/summary: PEPPERIDGE FARM GOLDFISH CHOCOLATE GRAHAM CRACKERS(PACK OF 8)
review/text: A delicious great tasting product by Pepperidge Farm that normally cost you $2.49 per bag, sometimes on sale at the supermarket 2 for $4.00, but I picked my Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Graham Goldfish Crackers (Pack Of 8) through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com and shipped free to my home for an awesome price of ONLY $10.63!!! If you can get a deal like this I highly suggest purchasing it right away! If not, no worries and try getting it a little more than my bargain for no more $13.00 in my opinion, seeing as if you were to pay the retail suggested price on bag for $2.49 X 8 = $19.92 would still be a bargain if you look at it this way like I do! Good Luck and happy bargain shopping, ENJOY!!!

review/summary: UNCANNY! Must Buy! Must Have! With Kids or Without Kids!
review/text: Amazing! When you can't have a campfire and you've got the craving for S'mores, Pepperidge Farms had created an awesome FUN FISH!<br />Zany as Zany can be - Vanilla Gold Fish, Chocolate Goldfish, and of course - Marshmallow Goldfish - Stack'em up; but make sure<br />you hide your evidence if you want these to be ALL YOURS or otherwise they'll be gone before you get a chance to be a "kid at<br />heart"! Having bought two bags... thinking I would like these very much (how right I was!)...<br /><br />I was downright impressed, while not the traditional S'mores - but gee whiz; I actually ate the whole danged bag in one sitting<br />without even realizing it! *blush*  It was so much fun hunting or is it fishing (?) for one after another and then stacking them<br />together and eating "fishbait" - hahahahahaha!<br /><br />Next day, began to open the other bag (already!) and started to munch away ....<br /><br />Until, my grandchildren saw the "evidence" and wahhh :( - Poor Grandma here - ended up having to "share" and goodness gracious,<br />the laughter and giggles from the little ones were far worth it all!<br /><br />I 10,000 times recommend this ... this is the best ever from Pepperidge Farms! Way to go! Now if they can come up with the big box,<br />I'd buy it on Amazon in a heartbeat! Who would ever dream that Pepperidge Farms would come up with this? Just awesome!<br /><br />Interestingly, the very next day; while I had to babysit the youngest grandchild for a short time; she went off looking for something<br />that I had to inquire what she was looking for and she kept saying Whitey, Blackie and Creamy.  Looking everywhere in my room even<br />under the bed, leaving me totally bewildered until she sulked and said<br /><br />"Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />"Hide what?"<br /><br />"The 3 goldfishies"<br /><br />(puzzled)<br /><br />"The 3 Goldfishes? We don't have Goldfish in the house."<br /><br />(now she is mad with her arms folded)<br /><br />"Yes we do, we ate them yessteday! Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />(trying not to laugh)<br /><br />"Sweetie, we ate them all up yesterday."<br /><br />"Grandma, buy more. I like them lots! Tummy hungry, says want more goldfish."<br /><br />(points to her stomach)<br /><br />Kids are adorable! &lt;3  If you buy them, make sure you stash some for yourself, they are completely<br />and you just cannot resist them!

review/summary: Beware...
review/text: My wife and I have purchased J. LeBlanc Champagne vinegar from other suppliers on the net and become great fans of it. So, when my usual supplier had no stock, I ordered the product from Touch of Europe, who were a dollar or so more expensive, but who had stock. When the vinegar arrived, it was not the white wine colour of previous bottles I had bought, but brown - rather like cider vinegar. The taste was awful - not at all what we had gotten to expect. So I returned it to Touch of Europe, saying that, based on my experience with this vinegar, their product tasted bad and was probably "off". To cut a long complaining consumer saga short, the company has continued to insist that there is nothing wrong with the product they supplied.  (Whatever happened to "the customer is always right"?). And the bottom line, after multiple e-mails and phone calls, is that they have now agreed to refund me - but I have to bear the shipping costs of the return, which was around $8.95.  I have previously found the J. LeBlanc Champagne vinegar to be an excellent product. The product supplied by Touch of Europe was unacceptable, and when I returned it, I was not dealt with the way customers ought to be treated.

Not sure whether the manufacturer, amazon.com or the shipper is the cause of the dents.  I just ordered another case and I'm hoping all the cans will be totally dent-free like the first shipment I received.

review/text: The description is misleading. These are mini Chupa Chups, not the full size ones. There is nothing in the description stating this. It's such a waste of packaging, because the suckers are tiny. I am very disappointed in Penguin Mints. I love their mints, but I won't be buying anything from them again. The suckers may not be so fresh either. The flavor isn't as vibrant as I remember. Also, the flavors are kind of limited. This is stated in the description. However, it's still disappointing to get so few flavors when they are made in 50+ flavors. Even though the description lists 8 different flavors, may bag has only 5: choco-vanilla, cherry, strawberry, strawberries & cream, and orange. I hate orange flavored candy:( I can't seem to find anyone who sells online in the US who has cola, or any of the more interesting flavors available.

review/text: Chupa Chups - what bad can one say about them?! These sweet, "creamy" pops are a fun treat for kids and adults alike. Bear in mind that this particular assortment is for the "mini" pops, so don't be shocked when they are smaller than regular Chups. I'd say these have a diameter somewhere between the size of a dime and a nickel and are maybe a hair smaller than Dum Dum pops.

review/summary: Satisfies the Chupa Chups craving
review/text: I have been craving Chupa Chups for a long time. When I was young there were stands of Chupa Chups in many convenience stores. They also carried a Chupa Chups item called Wistle Pops. Now it's apparently impossible to buy Chupa Chups in stores in the United States.<br /><br />My Chupa Chups arrived today and overall I'm pleased. They came in a square box and they taste fresh enough although I think they could be fresher. The chocolate one in particular seems a little too soft. My only complaint is that I expected more flavors in the box. So far I've only found Orange, Cherry, Strawberries and Cream and Choco Vanilla. No Apple, Strawberry or yogurt flavors like the description suggests. At least it comes with the creamosa flavors since those are the best in my opinion. The Strawberries and Cream is the best by far and the Choco Vanilla tastes a little like Boston Cream Pie. Next time I might order only Cremosa flavors. I was really looking forward to trying the Peach Yogurt one.<br /><br />Also, as others have mentioned, these are the MINI pops. I like them better because they satisfy the sweet craving with fever calories.

review/summary: Great Mini-Lollipops - Highly Recommended
review/text: We love Chupa Chups lollipops and were thrilled when a friend of ours sent us two of these 5-lb bags of assorted pops. To be clear these are the mini-pops (about the size of Dum-Dum pops), not full sized, but that is just fine for us. The smaller size means more pops per bag and less calories per pop.<br /><br />The flavors are all good and include Orange, Apple, Cherry, Strawberry, Strawberries and cream (my wife's favorite), Choco Vanilla (my favorite), Strawberry Yogurt, and Peach Yogurt.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I love these pops but I wish I could be able to find the sugar free strawberry pop. No one in the state has them. I love this brand of pops they are creamy.There is not one flavour that I dislike. The downfall is that I have seen them at a lover price for the same quantity in other sites.I have given them as a gift before and people love them. I  am still waiting for the other kind of cremosa to be available.

review/summary: My favorite tea!
review/text: This broken leaf Assam tea is my favorite tea in the world. It makes a strong, flavorful dark tea that can start the day well and pick up the post-lunch afternoon slump like magic. The flavor is strong without being bitter or too tannic (leather tongue). In the morning I like to use a little too much and steep a little too long because I like a tea that can crawl out of the cup by itself. In the afternoon, I use just the right amount and steep for 3-4 minutes in boiling water for a lighter cup. Forget the tea blends like English Breakfast or overpriced flavored teas... buy this basic black tea and add your own spices, bergamot or other citrus rinds for a good strong tea with any flavor you enjoy.

review/summary: Javapodz Don't Fit in Senseo
review/text: Just received my order of 2 boxes of 10 podz each. I bought Columbian Supremo. I have a Senseo pod coffee maker.<br /><br />When I put my first podz in the Senseo, I thought "Gee the podz looks a little small". I was right. The podz was too small to be pressed tight so some of the hot water bypassed the podz. I could see right away that it was coming out weak.<br /><br />I don't give up easily. I put the second podz in a make-your-own plastic pod container. I had to stuff it in a little but it fit and sealed well so all the hot water went through the coffee podz instead of bypassing it. The coffee came out much stronger by sight.<br /><br />Now for a review of the taste which is obviously very subjective. First I should say that I like strong coffee (ever since a trip to Europe several years ago). Strangely, I do not particularly like Starbucks coffee because it seems bitter to my taste. Judging by the millions of Starbucks devotees my taste preference is not in the majority. Well if you like Starbucks you will probably like the podz flavor. It seems a little bitter. Now of course this is only one flavor so I don't know about other flavors.<br /><br />If the vendor is monitoring this review, he/she should change the podz description to qualify which coffee makers can use these podz.

review/summary: Kitty chow my fusspot kitten actually eats
review/text: I adopted a three month-old kitten from a rescue group on Christmas Eve. I think -- no, I am certain -- they fed her either home made kitten food (ie: table food) or just gave her table scraps because she certainly was not acclimated to kitten food from the can.<br /> To get her to learn to eat kitten food canned, I must have tried at least 18 brands, ranging from every high end (expensive) to the low-brow Friskie in the store. She picked at all. But when I made my dinner she was very expectant, as though saying, "now it's time for dinner!" I believe the worst thing people can do is give domesticated animals people food, no matter how they rationalize that it is "healthier." Dogs and cats have been domesticated for centuries and like people, they evolve in what they can eat now versus a millenium ago.<br /> Natural Choice is one of two that my kitten, now a year-old this month September, will eat. Cats and dogs are domestic animals and need a healthy diet of food specifically for them.<br /> This specific flavor ws not her favorite but in kitten canned food Natural Choice has a few good options my fusspot Eva actually liked and ate. It also is richer, and more filling. This brand in the Kitten chow is much more expensive than what you'll pay in the store for the usual suspects, but it's made with good nutients and has more staying power.<br /> Last month August I adopted two more kittens (they were due to be Euthanized if no one came along) and Natural Choice is the food I feed them. The one who has had canned kitten food loves it. The other, who survived on table scraps, is coming around but it's the only one she'll eat.<br /> The Lamb and Chicken kitten flavor is good as is the Tuna and Chicken.<br /> I can't speak for the adult Cat Food.

review/text: The jury is still out about the efficacy of curcumin (found in turmeric) as a treatment for cancer or Alzheimer's. Not enough testing has been done yet. But it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for about 4000 years, and there seems to be less cases of cancer and Alzheimer's in South Asia where it is consumed. So, who knows? I like the color it gives the food, and I don't even notice any change in taste to the foods I put it on. I try to sneak it into just about everything from roasted vegetables to fish/shrimp and to rice.

I've tried the rajma masala, dal bukara, pindi chana, and palak paneer. My second favorite would have to be the pindi chana. The rajma is OK but I don't prefer the flavor as much. The palak paneer is a little bland but oddly spicy. And the dal bukara is quite salty.

review/text: This curry is mild to medium-hot, and not real thick (not really watery, just not thick).  The vegetables are mashed to almost smooth.  It's very good to pour over rice or as a topping for meat.  I bought it to take to work for a quick lunch, and it suits.  The only drawback is the packaging.  The inner pouch isn't microwaveable, so the product must be squeezed out into a bowl before heating (it tends to cling to the pouch a little, too).

review/summary: Very tasty and great for adding your own stuff
review/text: I've tried a few different Kitchens of Indian packets, but this was my first time trying the Pav Bhaji.  The curry itself is just a thick, chunky paste with mashed veggies in it, so I added some frozen carrot medallions and peas to bulk it up a bit.  I also added about 1/3 can of vegetable broth to help cook the carrots and peas.  Finally, I sprinkled in a pinch of red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  After about 20 minutes of simmering, the curry had cooked back down to its original consistency and the carrots were softened.<br /><br />I ate it over Basmati rice and it was delicious.  The curry is very buttery, and the added ingredients gave it a good kick and some extra flavor.  Overall, I would recommend it if you're willing to add some of your own ingredients.

review/text: This Indian dish is delicious! I am a big fan of this brand of indian food. This one is one of my favorites. It is delicious and can easily be stretched to feed more people. The texture out of the package is almost mashed potato-like, so adding a little chicken broth or milk doesn't make it too soupy--as long as you like to eat it as a sauce. The other day I made this adding milk and garbanzo beans from a can. The garbanzo beans made it very filling, and it was so easy! Love it!<br /><br />Other favorites from this brand are the Palak paneer or "spinach with cottage cheese" (Just so you know, it is not cottage cheese; I think they just didn't know what to call their paneer cheese), their chick pea curry, and the Chicken makhani paste.<br /><br />Lastly, both times I have ordered these on Amazon, it has been during a deal of some sort, so, if you can watch for a deal before making your bulk purchases, it could save you a bunch.

Awesome food for college students, fast and easy.

My favorite ways to eat this is by adding it in to scrambled eggs, dipping pita into it, eating it over rice, and braising chicken in it with a bit of milk.  Much cheaper to buy it off Amazon, then buy it from the few stores who carry it.  While this is an amazing product, the other varieties from Kitchens of India tend to be less flavorful or dry in texture, so try them first from a grocery store if you can before committing to a larger order.

review/summary: Tasty But Don't Eat the Entire Pouch Yourself
review/text: This is a tasty item.  However - and this is subjective - I found the food to be a little on the spicy side (it is Indian cuisine so that is to be expected).<br /><br />I purchased it based on a simple, non-scientific comparison of ready-to-eat Indian and Asian foods in the WSJ.  I noticed when preparing the food to heat in the microwave that the box indicates the pouch is 2.5 servings.  I also noticed that fat content was a little high, but then again the box indicates that the vegetables are "simmered in butter" so I didn't think too much of it.<br /><br />I ate the entire pouch (2.5 servings) for lunch, around 1:30 pm.  I woke up at 2:30 am with the worst heartburn I have ever had, and I take Prilosec OTC daily.  Granted, I ate 2.5 times the amount I should have.<br /><br />I plan on eating more in the future, but as a side dish and not the entire pouch as a meal - it's simply too spicy and/or fattening to do so.

review/summary: Yummy & a nice change from curry with rice
review/text: Pav bhaji is chaat, northern Indian street food intended more as a snack than as a meal. It is not served with rice but with white bread buns and chopped onions, perhaps a pat of buttter and a squeeze of lime.<br /><br />This is not nearly as good as freshly-prepared pav bhaji, of course, but it is nice and spicy and the butter taste comes through but it's not at all oily. The texture is like lumpy mashed vegetables, appropriately enough. The meal doesn't taste overly salty to me but it is high in sodium with the entire package containing over 2g.<br /><br />I usually eat the whole pouch with two or three slices of lightly toasted bread or even hamburger buns, a good way to use up the bits and pieces that collect in the freezer. Lime and garlic pickle and chopped onion do make it nicer. I enjoy the spice level but occasionally add a little more heat in the form of dried pepper flakes. (Capsicum is peppers.)<br /><br />The ingredient list provided by Amazon is the same as what is on the package so I won't repeat it, but I did check it.<br /><br />For nutrition the serving size is 125 grams and the entire package is 285 grams or 10 ounces, so you would have to multiply by 2.28. Yes, fairly nonsensical.<br /><br />So PER SERVING as on the package, if you trust the analysis:<br />Calories 210, calories from fat 130, total fat 15g, saturated fat 2.5g, trans fat 0g, cholesterol 30mg, sodium 920mg (!!!), total carbs 16g, dietary fiber 2g, sugars 3g, protein 2g.<br /><br />Note that this meal is NOT vegan like most of these because it contains butter but it is without preservatives and is kosher.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish Amazon would find a way to reduce the packaging on this product. Each meal is in a laminated foil retort pouch, a box, then a case carton, then the shipping box, which is excessive in my opinion. At least the individual boxes could be eliminated since they are sold by the case. The ingredients and nutrition information could be printed on the pouch with the other information.

review/summary: A Culinary Passage to India
review/text: Kitchens of India's Bav Bhaji/Mashed Vegetables is deliciously spicy and savory,but it shouldn't stand alone. It's best paired with naan (bread) or rice. To add some zip, one can use freshly chopped vegetables. It's good for people aiming at a healthy,plant-based diet. By itself,it's like instant oatmeal,with a baby food consistency.<br /><br />An extra benefit is the hourlong CD of Indian classical music by sarod master Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. The music is savory... and needs no accompaniment!

review/summary: Salty, and tasteless
review/text: I bought this product thinking that it would be good for a rainy (or snowy) day. But actually I would rather have cereal than this. It is salty and has no taste at all. Perhaps since I am of Indian origin, I expected something more suited to my palate as I see that most of the others have given this a good rating (and that is what made me buy it in the first place). I have purchased similar stuff from grocery stores and they taste much better so it has to be this product. Definitely, will not buy in the future and not recommend either. Bon Appetit, folks!

review/summary: lacking in taste and texture
review/text: This Kitchens of India discount purchase was disappointing. It is lacking in taste and texture.  While the product has a lot of salt, I stilll found it rather tasteless.  The curry's texture was not pleasant.  Many curries that I enjoy most are thick and have a tomato paste type texture.  This one was watery with semi-mashed up chunks of vegetables.  It was not pleasant on the tongue and even combining it with rice and naan did not make it something I would want to eat again.<br /><br />This product is packaged in the ever-popular pouch inside of a box. I don't really like pouches because the contents are usually difficult to remove. True to my previous experience with pouches, I had to use a spatula to remove the contents that had stuck to the pouch's walls. Another reason for my disdain of pouches is they are not typically recyclable.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this product is lacking.  Each container has 2 1/2 servings and a serving is about � cup.  So, let's look at the numbers for a container, which would realistically serve two people when paired with rice, naan, or vegetables; the total fat per container is 37.5 grams, total sodium is 2300 mg, total saturated fat is 6.25 grams, total carbs of 40 grams.<br /><br />I've found Kitchens of India products to be hit or miss in terms of taste.  I like Jyoti products (come in a can for the most part) MTR products (come in a pouch) better.  Disclaimer: While some Jyoti products (their saag, for example) are healthy, MTR products are typically full fat but at least they taste better.<br /><br />This product is vegetarian but not vegan.<br /><br />This product is made in India.<br /><br />If you really want to try this product and only want one pouch, consider iherb.com.  You can use code LEK375 for a discount.

review/summary: Not good at all
review/text: I was born and raised in India and I cook a lot.  I had this at my friends house, they all liked it but I must say that this is pure junk.  If anyone who has ever cooked or had real pav bhaji, they know what this should taste like and what the texture should feel like in your mouth.  Basically this thing taste like it was cooked several months ago by someone who is not the best at cooking such a dish.  I have also tried various other brands besides this one, and they all are more or less in the same boat.  For the sake of taste and health, this is not what you want.  Look-up a video recipe on the internet and make it at home (preferably in small batches to make it taste more like the street food that it was supposed to be).  I have yet to find Indian food stored at room temp that is heat and eat and it taste good.  Some of the frozen Indian foods are a lot better, but do not exepect it to be impressed by ready cooked stuff.  For something good, just go to a good restaurant; and for good and healthy, make it at home.

review/summary: One of the worst
review/text: I ordered this just because of a special deal going on at Amazon. It turns out they were being sold cheap for a reason. Just one packet contains 38% sodium which is too much. And the problem is that you can taste the nasty oil and too much salt due to so much sodium which I think is added as preservative. Would not recommend for regular eating. If you have ever eaten Indian meals, this is totally not what you expect from them.<br /><br />Tried it on my friends too and they all hated it.

review/text: I bought two of these for Christmas to give to my husband.  The chocolates on the inside were Ghirardelli's typical high quality individually wrapped chocolates.  The problem was with the ornament.  It was extremely hard to open.  I wouldn't suggest this as a gift idea for anyone who has trouble opening containers, like grandmas and grandpas with arthritis.  It's about the size of a softball so it does make nice decoration for people who can utilize all the muscles in their hands and are up to the task of trying to open the thing.

review/text: Was so excited to receive these kisses with macadamia nuts.  I know they only have them in Hawaii and I was shipping them to my son's girlfriend who had them there and was telling us about how good they were.  Unfortunately, when they shipped they came in all melted.  i would have thought the company would have sent them with dry ice or overnighted them.  We could not even try them because the tin foil wrapper melted into the chocolate.  We had to return the product.  My suggestion since the bag was $40.00 they should invest in dry ice.

review/summary: okay, but...
review/text: Unfortunately, a good number of the candies melted and reformed during transit...so that they looked very strange and lost some of their flavor - it was okay to eat them myself, but I could not have put them out on the coffee table for any guests because they did not look or taste fresh.  It's not the seller's fault, but is something to take into consideration when ordering chocolate by mail (especially in the summertime).

review/summary: Welcome Holiday Gifts
review/text: This past holiday season these unusual to many people candies made an original and unusual holiday or hostess/host gift. For those who knew Italy, they were like old friends. For those being introduced for the first time, they were welcome new friends. Each piece of chewy nougat with almonds was individually wrapped and sealed and placed inside it's own decorated box, similar to the main box decoration. On each was a portrait of a beloved historical character from about the 1800's, three different pictures, each one signifying a different flavor. Each piece of white nougat in addition has a very thin top and bottom of egg white. No, it is not additinal wrapping ( it could easily be mistaken as a thin layer of paper ) but is meant to be eaten and keep fingers from becoming sticky. Each of the three flavors are subtle and delicious. It was like being back in Italy as they brought on many good memories.

review/text: I'm a huge fan of torrone - it just is not Christmas without it. This is the first time I tried this brand and found it to be quite tasty (especially the lemon version). Each one comes individually wrapped so it's easy to parcel them out as stocking stuffers.<br /><br />This is the white torrone that is semi-hard. There's also a version that is chocolate-based and very soft (basically, the white nougat is replaced with a dark chocolate nougat, with a lot of hazelnuts and wrapped in the edible paper). That is my all-time favorite, especially the one made in L'Aquila, Italy (sorry, can't remember the brand name) which is not sold in the US. If you're ever there, you have to try it.

Even the Italian specialty stores only carried it during the Holidays.<br />But, now we have the Internet! And you can get stuff like this whenever you want.<br />It's not exactly the same as when I was a kid. But that's good. Each piece is wrapped and sealed in foil now - they used to just have a folded foil covering. Each piece is fresh.<br />Four boxes was a bit much for me but my brothers enjoyed the gift.

review/text: All I can say is that if the readers have never tried torrone candy, they don't know what they're missing. It is an almond nougat candy made in Italy and served for special occasions. It's low fat, low sodium and no cholesterol. It has special memories for me. When I was a child, I would sneek out the back door on Sunday mornings and go over to my Italian neighbor's house next door. She would serve me tea and toast while we visited, then she would aways send me home with 2 or 3 boxes of torrone. It is not available to buy where I live without traveling distance, so I am grateful to Amazon.com for the opportunity to relive those memories at holiday time!

It also makes a great gift, because of the pretty, individually wrapped packages.  It is a wonderful candy worth 5*, but I often wished they had the candy in a bar instead of the more expensive & wasteful packaging. I tried the LaFlorentine pistachio bar, it was good, but only had half the wafer as the Bellino bar. I would give it 4*.  If you want more candy & less packaging, the Bellino Torrone soft nougat bar is soft, chewy, & melts in your mouth. WARNING: Don't get the hard nougat-ONLY the soft! Once you try these delightful nougat candies, you will be hooked!!!

review/summary: A healthy alternative to cooking oil and butter
review/text: Ghee (clarified butter) has been used in India for ages, it can be used as a substitue for oil or butter, in most applications. It's a healthier option to butter and the other questionable frying mediums in use today.<br /><br />A more detailed description from http://www.pcta.org/general/ghee.asp :<br />"ghee is unsalted butter that has been baked to remove not only its butter fat solids, as in drawn butter, but also all water -- so as to produce a food that contains no molecular oxygen, and is thus extremely storable and not subject to rancidity as in normal cooking oils. The health advantages accrue from the fact that ghee contains no oxidized cholesterol, the kind which leads to free radical damage in the cells of the body. Ghee is pretty well known among nurtrition nuts, plus it's a staple within Asian Indian communities and can be purchased in specialty food stores. It looks just like butter in a jar"<br /><br />For those new to Ghee, do bear in mind it has a unique odor and flavor that may take some getting used to. The odor is not really strong and is somewhat buttery.<br /><br />If this is your first time trying it and you don't like it, you can always use it instead of butter for baking, provided the dish you are baking has a reasonably pleasant odor of it's own. Overall, the quality of the product itself is really good and it tastes great.<br /><br />I like the small 8oz jars instead of one large one, it's easier to handle them and you don't need to scoop some out into a smaller container for daily use. Once a can is over, just pop open a new one. Also, ghee has a long shelf life and you don't need to refrigerate the unopened jars. However, if you don't plan on using up an open bottle in about a month, it helps to store the container in the refrigerator, especially in summer!

review/summary: Great authentic Indian Product
review/text: I have always loved ghee with everything I prepare and eat - be it my daily dose of rice and sambar/curry, dosas and idlys or any sweet.<br /><br />I had a tough time getting used to life without ghee when I first came to the US and tried my hand at making ghee using butter. The result was not very commendable....<br /><br />It is then I came across Tazaa ghee.... the first time I tasted it, it reminded me of my home made ghee back in India and since then I have been hooked.....I am a regular customer of Tazaa ghee on amazon.com for the last 2 years....<br /><br />Great product, affordable prize and the best online seller... the combination is irresistible!!!

review/summary: Great for Frying Fish!
review/text: I had always wanted to try Ghee, but never found it locally.  I ordered it, tried it to fry some fresh haddock, and was amazed at the difference between it and the ordinary frying mediums I had used in the past.<br />It also keeps so well right on the shelf.  Glad I tried it.

review/summary: Good ghee and good price
review/text: I like this ghee even though it is a bit different than what I'm used to. It is a bit lighter and more solid than ghee you get at the Indian grocer. I don't particularly like the ghee at the Indian grocer though. The ghee at the Indian store is often rancid and the containers it is in alters the taste. I like this ghee though because it is natural and is in glass jars opposed to plastic/tin. It has a good smell and taste to it. I also like that it is in small jars and I don't have to scoop some out of a big container everytime I use it. I use it on my chapati (flat bread) and it tastes much healthier than other ghee. I highly recommend it!
