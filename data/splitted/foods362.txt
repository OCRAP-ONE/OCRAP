review/summary: A great deal
review/text: I recently started drinking loose tea instead of bags. I was buying the jars from my health food store, but they are pretty expensive. I am always looking for a better deal, so when I found these on Amazon, I decided to get them. I gave one to my mom, and one to my brother. I kept one for myself and I think it is going to last me awhile. Since I don't know all that much about teas, I can't comment much on the quality but as far as I know it is good! It seems comparable to the same stuff I got in the smaller jars. Recommend :)

review/text: This tea is absolutely delicious, my husband and I love it. It's very smooth and subtly sweet, and especially good mixed with a little green rooibos and a bit of white tea for a touch of caffeine. I haven't noticed any sediment in my cup at all from it yet. I have no complaints, I'm turning into a regular drinker and am signed up for Subscribe & Save. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Excellent English Breakfast Tea
review/text: I have been searching for the 'right' balanced English Breakfast Tea for a few years now. Other than actual English Teas from London, England, it was very difficult to find a rich and aromatic English Breakfast.<br /><br />After trying out at least 20 different varieties, including some very expensive brands, I've found this to be the perfect cuppa in the morning. Personally, loose leaf seems to taste a lot better to me, and I've not tried the tea-bag variety on this one.<br /><br />Hope others enjoy this tea as much as I have.

review/summary: I always come back to this tea
review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.

In my opinion, when I did the job my old way the result was powerful (too strong).  After two more failed attempts I finally decided to read and follow the brief directions on the package. What have been enjoying for a few years is a strong tea with milk.  Now I have discovered a tea that can be enjoyed straight.

Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them. I had a "taste test" with my cat and dog, who *love* caviar) and they both turned their noses up at it. NOT a good sign.  :-(

review/summary: Excellent flavor, beautiful Beluga lentils
review/text: I'm sorry to see these lentils have disappeared from Amazon only a few days after I purchased a 10lb bag. The seller, Taste Specialty, is a wholesale only distributor based out of Las Vegas (according to their website) and appears to cater to restaurants, particularly those that are higher-end. At 3 dollrs a lb., the price was right for Beluga lentils, and when I purchased them via Amazon, the shipping was free for Amazon Prime members. The day the lentils arrived, I made my signature red wine lentils (using 1 cup Beluga lentils from this purchase and 1 cup of the French Green lentils I also purchased the same day on Amazon, but sold by Bob's Red Mill).  The dish was excellent, and the lentils were tasty and fresh. There is a small amount of chaff that sticks to the inside of the plastic bag, but there were surprising few culls/bad lentils. Because it is a bulk purchase, the plastic bag was not marked, but the box the bag ships in does have the Taste Specialty Foods logo and nutrition information: serving size 32 grams (1/4 cup); calories 170 (5 from fat); carbs 30 grams; fiber 9 grams; protein 13 grams - and best of all, one serving has 20% of the RDA for Iron. Lentils are a great dish for a pregnant woman looking for extra iron in her diet.  My only complaint is the box/package does not contain an expiration date; regardless, the Black Beluga Lentils are dried, so they should last nearly forever in an airtight jar away from sunlight.  Recommended, and I hope they come back into stock (with continued free shipping) soon!

review/summary: Really good lentils
review/text: Lentils are one of the oldest cultivated products.  There are about 35 varieties of lentils available commercially.  I really like this variety.<br /><br />I thought that they would cook-up to be blacker rather than brown but I was mistaken.  I used a really simple recipe to compare them to other lentils:<br /><br />6 cups low sodium chicken broth<br />1 cup lentils<br />1 bay leaf<br />1 finely diced onion<br /><br />Cook it until the lentils start to break and you're good to go.  Compared to other lentils, I found these to taste (but not look) better.

review/text: I have to say that my family totally enjoys these lentils to the point of other family members bring their empty tins over to "share" in my bounty of lentils.  They cook up fast and have a wonderful taste cooking in just chicken stock.  I will go to the ends of the earth to find these as the flavor is so tasty and does not need a lot of additives for a wonderful flavor.

review/text: These lentils are the best I've eaten. I first became interested when I saw them at a fancy grocery store in Cincinnati. I paid at least $8-9 for the 1lb bag and was hooked after the first try. This item on Amazon has the right and I was very satisfied with the packaging and quality. I pressure cook smoked turkey  for about 15 minutes with green onions, bell pepper and garlic.  Then add the lentils--after about 9 more minutes in the pressure cooker, I have something wonderful! Buy them--you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I'm an ER doctor and work long hours - sometimes day shifts and sometimes night shifts. I've always struggled with finding something healthy I could take to stay awake. Coffee tends to give me heartburn and the 5 hour energy drinks don't do anything for me. One of my friends gave me one of these pills to try and I was AMAZED. Literally right after taking it I felt more alert. It lasted for about ten hours and then I was able to sleep without feeling a crash. I was more social/friendly and just felt like my eyes were more open/aware. I could do my job better. I've never had anything like this before. Needless to say I bought a bottle and shared it with all the people I work with and they're all hooked. I haven't heard a single person say it doesn't work for them. I don't know where this stuff came from but it's the real deal.

review/summary: Holiday M&Ms are the freshest
review/text: I am the unofficial M&M supplier in my office. I keep a bowl stocked for drive-by snackers. Over the years, Peanut M&Ms have proven to be the biggest draw of all. Other candy goes through a rotation but the Peanut M&Ms are a constant.<br /><br />The holiday editions of M&Ms are the best of the best, since you know that when they appear on the shelves they will be fresh and crunchy. (The ordinary bags can sit in the store for months before they're purchased.) If you've ever sampled an aging M&M next to a fresh one, you will know what I mean.<br /><br />So whenever a holiday version of M&Ms hits the market, I grab em up.<br /><br />And of course this includes heading to the local stores on the day *after* the holiday in question, since there are immediate markdowns and you can stockpile for the weeks ahead.<br /><br />Happy snacking!

review/text: Not sure how much to review here.  They're M&M's with peanuts in them.  They taste like every other M&M with peanuts in them, except they've changed the colors to be 'Halloween colored'.  The fact is, they aren't appropriately named.<br /><br />Halloween colored?  Not a chance.<br />Fall colored?  Maybe.<br />Rotting vegetable colored?  Certainly.<br /><br />Whatever it is, they don't look right no matter what they try to call them.  They actually look like sick versions of the other candies, and are ewww-enough looking that NOT A SINGLE M&M WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE CANDY DISH AT THE COMPANY PARTY.  Even after every other candy dish was cleared out and people are scooping at the bits and pieces at the bottom, nobody was taking the 'Halloween-colored' Peanut M&M's at a Halloween party!<br /><br />I know they're M&M's, so I ate them, but when a crowd of people won't touch a candy product at a Halloween party...you know something's not right there.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Get the regular peanut M&M's...they're more Halloween colored.

review/summary: Weak and watery, not recommended
review/text: I purchased the Gevalia Signature Crema because it seemed like my preferred T-discs were all unavailable at the time, and the reviews that I read seemed OK. Those reviews are completely wrong, unless you enjoy watery, weak coffee with a little foam crema flourish on top. I've had better coffee in a foam cup out of a vending machine at a hockey rink. About halfway through the dispense cycle of the Gevalia Signature Crema the output starts looking very clear and watery. I'm not the kind of coffee drinker that must have super strong, rocket fueled coffee, but watery coffee is definitely not what I want. I had settled on the Starbucks T-discs being the best coffee available for Tassimo, and after those went away I almost gave up on my Tassimo machine until I found the Gevalia "Extra Bold" T-discs. My recommendation to you is to try the Extra Bold product instead of this one. The discs are double height thus containing far more ground coffee, and they give you a full mug of good coffee. My recommendation to Kraft is to stop pretending that you can get a full mug of product out of a thin T-disc. You can, but it's no good. The thin T-discs should be reserved for European style coffees, expresso, etc. that dispense 5 ounces or less. To get a full mug, I'm convinced you need the double height T-discs. For those like me who bought the Gevalia Signature Crema and are wondering what to do with it because it's undrinkable the way it is, use a small coffee cup rather than a mug and halt the dispense cycle early by pressing the button. You'll still get the foam on top, but it won't be nearly as weak.

review/summary: Quality problem
review/text: I have owned a Tassimo T-disk coffee maker for 8 years and the Gevalia Signature Crema has been the disk that I use most often.  In the last year the prices have increased dramatically through actual price increases and reduction of disks in each package. I can understand that as prices have increased on most food items during that time however, the most recent order is the first time that I have noticed a change in QUALITY. It is undrinkable - reminds me of the cheapest generic coffee from the grocery store.<br />As of today I have cancelled my Subscribe & Save order and will retire the Tassimo in favor of a recently purchased Keurig - the coffees aren't as good as Gevalia used to be but the quality is consistant (so far).<br />Perhaps enough negative reviews will convince Gevalia to return to thier previous high standards.

If you want American style drip coffee with foam on top, than this product is for you. If you want a european style crema coffee than this is not it. Don't waste your money on this product. I am done with Tassimo. They have supply problems that they have not been able to solve for a year, and the coffee quality has gone down ever since Starbucks dropped them. Getting a nespresso machine instead.

To me, it tastes just about the same as the cappuccino,or perhaps even better, because of it's bold, rich and creamy flavor and "texture," for lack of a better word! Plus, it is a much better value, as you do not have the milk pods included in the package.  I would much rather add my own milk or creamer, and with this coffee, you still have the foam on top.  It's delicious, it's a full cup of coffee, and again, I must say, I love it!

review/text: Gevalia Signature Crema is hands-down one of two most requested coffees in my home. It is THE most popular coffee for my Tassimo coffee maker, and it is now the only one I buy on a regular basis. Other specialty coffees are fun once in a while, but never seem to quite satisfy like this one. It's strong without being overwhelming--with an aroma and  flavor that linger. There's a certain richness to this coffee--it looks great in a glass cup, and the little layer of "crema" on top makes me forget about having dessert! My other favorite house coffee is for the Keurig machine, and is in a diferent review.

review/text: Since there's no pic of these dog bones, I wasn't sure what I'd be getting, but (in case you want to know) they look like all the other dog chew bones -- big white knotted pieces of rawhide. They come in a flimsy bag that popped open but since they're also in a shipping box, it didn't really matter to me. The thing that matters most to me is that I get the MOST rawhide for my dollar because my 3 dogs chew through this stuff pretty fast.<br /><br />At first my dogs weren't too excited -- I guess because these are not flavored like some of the smaller brown or yellow bones, so I just set them on the floor and walked away. It only took a few minutes before they picked them up and began chewing away on them. Now, when I hand them out, they don't hesitate to happily run off to their corners and chew.<br /><br />Now, price-wise, it works out to $0.24 an ounce for these long-lasting bones. When I compare that to even the "cheapy" bones from the 99 Cent Store, it's HALF the price. So I'm pretty satisfied and my dogs are BUSY.

My medium sized dog chews through about one a day or two days.<br /><br />-update:-<br />I noticed my dog getting loose stool with whitish color for a few days - and thought maybe it might be the rawhide. Stopped giving it to him, and problem solved. So - this product does not sit well with my dog.

review/summary: Rawhide Chews
review/text: Great product for the money! I don't see any difference between these bones and ones much more expensive. Since we go through one every day or two, I need a cost-effective supply. These bones seem be just fine.

review/text: I have two small dogs that love these bones, and I got sick of going out and buying two per package and paying what I was paying for them.  These are great!  As stated on the package, the size of the bones vary sllightly, but they are as good, or better, than the ones I was purchasing at a local store.

review/text: I have been auto shipping these rawhide's and the first two orders were of great quality. I just received my third order and these rawhides are paper thin. My dog chews the entire bone in about 20 minutes. The quality has totally deteriorated. I'm discontinuing my auto ship. Very disappointing!!

review/summary: Good for Rawhide
review/text: Rawhide isn't the best treat available, but it can be useful for massaging gums and cleaning some plaque off of teeth. Also, many dogs are able to get their frustration out by chewing on these.  I bought these particular ones because they seemed healthier than other's.  However, because they aren't flavored, my dogs thought they were kind of boring. My Jack Russell Terrier will carry it around, but not actually chew on it much. I think it's because it's too big for her. My larger (40 lb) dog, will occasionally chew at them, but he's more likely to do so if I'm stuck some peanut butter or cheese in the crevices.  I will try a smaller size for my Jack Russell and try soaking them in chicken broth and then re-drying them to see if they become more palatable.

review/text: My 8 month yellow lab mix was chewing through the same size dollar store bones in less than an hour, and they left little pieces all over the carpet.  These are only slightly more money and it takes him 3 hours to chew through one, with no mess!  And I don't need to keep running to the store to buy more.  Well worth the price, and with no tax and rising gas prices, I think I may be saving money!

review/text: My dogs normally don't have bad stomachs, but after I let them chew these for a while they both puked and had diarrhea.  I know if this was just a bad bag I got but when I gave them the bones again a week later the same thing happened.  They really like the bones though and they don't smell too bad, so if your dog has an iron stomach go for it.

review/summary: Bone sizes not as advertised.
review/text: The product is advertised as "6-7 Inch" bones.  Printed beneath the UPC code on the bags is "8 PK 6-7" Bone".  But I could immediately see without opening a bag that the bones were not the advertised size.  The real size range was 5 to 5-1/2 inches (to confirm my visual estimation, I grabbed my tape measure and measured their lengths).  Not ONE single bone was 7, or 6-1/2, or 6 inches.<br /><br />When you have a large dog, the size of their dog chews determines how long they will last.  I hate being lied to - no matter what a "deal" this product may be for others.<br /><br />If you want true-to-size 7" rawhide bones, get "Healthy Hide" brand beefhide treats.  They're made from free-range, grass-fed beef, and are HACCP & ISO certified.  And you also won't be ripped-off by deceptive marketing.

review/summary: better than Walmart rawhide
review/text: These Green Cow rawhide bones are $1.30 each including shipping. That's 30 cents more than the same size at Walmart that are not delivered to me and my dog. These, though, do not have gross dirty smudges like the ones I saw at Walmart. Those look like bones that are seconds and way too expensive for that. The regular, scheduled Green Cow deliveries are reliable and simple to adjust if I need an extra shipment (which arrives quick) or if I need to skip a shipment. The quality, cleanliness and convenience make these a good buy for me, one less thing to do and a real good chew for my dog. I don't know what those smudges are on the other bones, but I don't want them in my dog.

I sure am glad that she likes these bones because she's a chewer.  I have found through trial-and-error, that if I don't give her one about every other day, I end up losing another "throw" rug.  (Which is what I have to do with the rug when she's done with it, "throw" it out.) These are a good quality purchase.<br />Sunnybrook

review/text: Ordered these for my two Chessies. They love them and the price is a third of what local stores wanted. The section between the knots is hollow and contains bits of hide instead of layered rolls of rawhide; the dogs dont mind and consume every part. The bits out and tend to make a mess, thus 4 stars.  I subscribed for bimonthly for both the addition discount and the ease of not having to remember to order more.

review/text: I'm so impressed with these. This is way cheaper than going to Petsmart and having to buy rawhides, and they're the exact same thing you'll get anywhere else. Of course, they're not flavored and plain, but if your pup isn't spoiled.. it shouldn't be a problem! My aggressive chewer corgi has a bit harder of a time with these than regular rawhides from the store, so they last a bit longer for us.

review/text: We have tried many bones for our doggies.  The ones we have given them in the past have caused diarrhea and these one do not.  The bones take about 2-3 hours for them to finish which is a nice distraction especially for those cold-rainy days that they are unable to go outside for a walk.  The fact that the cows are grass fed was the selling point for us.

review/text: I discovered this brand in July 2007.  My two terriers were always prone to digestive problems - gas, vomiting, diahrhea.  They both had asthma, allergies and chronic ear infections.  My vet told me that is just how the breed is and I spent thousands of dollars on vet treatments.  I felt so sad for my dogs, I began exploring health options on my own.  After much research, I found that nutrition can cause and cure many health ailments, including all those my dogs had.<br /><br />I researched a variety of brands, and began buying Wellness Lite - within a few weeks, my dogs were both healthier than ever.  It has now been 10 months and we've had no more health problems whatsoever - my only regret is that I did not find this brand sooner!

review/summary: Seems better for the owner rather than the dog
review/text: We recently adopted an obese pet and were looking for healthy dog food that could help him lose weight. The ingredients seemed great, but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements 5-7 times per day! The food did little to help with weight reduction (even with all the vomiting), and we eventually had to switch to a veterinarian-prescribed food instead. (Note: Our dog does not have a hypothyroid problem.) After we stopped feeding our dog this brand of dog food, his stool has become firmer and less frequent, and he is no longer vomiting on a daily basis.<br /><br />As I stated above, the ingredients seemed very healthy and nutritious, but I would not feed this to my dog or recommend it to anyone else.
