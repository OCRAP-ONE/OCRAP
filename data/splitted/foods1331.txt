review/summary: Pod people
review/text: We got a Senseo machine at work.  I was skeptical.  Then I tried it.<br /><br />I'm not at all sure that it saves energy, but it sure does make terrific coffee.<br /><br />I favor the Dark Roast variety.<br /><br />And Douwe Egberts Dark Roast Coffe Pods have turned me into a Pod Person.<br /><br />So I bought a pod machine for the house.<br /><br />Greeeeaaaat stuff.

review/summary: Drink of the gods
review/text: I consider myself very lucky, I am a degenerate caffeine addict, and this is a very costly habit. I walked out of a $7/day cappuccino habit to brewing my own coffee, which was slightly cheaper. When I discovered pods, I tried every premium brand I could find, but none really pleased me.<br /><br />Then I ran into the Senseo Douwe Egberts Dark Roast Coffee Pods at Target. Not only they were exactly what I wanted, but they cost half as much as my next candidate.<br /><br />The problem: limited availability, you never find more than one or two bags at Target, and it is not sold anywhere else here. Since my wife works at Target she got used to buy most of their allocation right off the shelf, to avoid the risk of running out of my stash and having to deal with her degenerate caffeine addicted husband going through withdrawal.<br /><br />I was very happy to find these here in Amazon, even happier when I noticed that if I bought enough of them, the cost is identical to what I pay here, and the shipping is free. The day I received my first order I held in my hands more of these pods than what was available for sale at the whole COUNTY that day. Oh yeah.<br /><br />I have done bulk orders through Amazon twice, and I kept buying from Target. Amazon wins. Timed properly I will never have to worry about running out of my supply, and there is even an option to have it as a subscription, so I would not even have to bother with making the order every month or so.<br /><br />This is really good stuff, some people find it bitter, but to me it tastes just right. Also, it helps me keep it down to 3-4 cups a day. If I was drinking drip coffee I would be drinking 5-6 cups a day easily.

review/text: I am very impressed with the Senseo coffee system. I have tried several of the coffees available and all are good, especially the Vienna. Its not as rich as the Bold roasts of Starbucks but its still an awesome cup of Brew. The Dark roast is quite rich and aromatic. Try it, you'll like it.

review/text: I'm hooked on the Dark Roast Coffee.<br /><br />I've found the best tasting brew is to use two coffee pods but drain into a large coffee cup.  First I fill up the water container and let it heat up until the red light stops blinking.  Then, using a large cup, hit the button on the right that will drain a regular sized coffee cup amount of coffee. Now hit the heater again and when the light stops blinking hit the button on the left.<br /><br />Hey, works for me.

review/text: I use hundreds of these pods every month.  It is perhaps not the most economical way to drink the equivalent of several pots of coffee each day, but the convenience and ease of making a personal cup of latte, by whipping up a splash of milk in the bottom of the glass, is well worth the cost.  Also great to offer a spot of coffee to drop-in guests!

I am disappointed in the flavor of this coffee. I will stick with my locally sold coffee and my coffee press.

review/text: The senseo rocks, I love the coffee it makes, but this coffee is bad.  The DE pods make good crema but the coffee is a lot like instant.  The dark is especially bad when making two cups at a time.  Make two four ounce cups if you want a large cup.  Other pods do fit in the Senseo including Archer farms and others available online.  I wouldn't go making your own pods but definitely try some other brands.  If you do insist on sticking with DE, do your best to keep them fresh.  Put them in an airtight container or bag, and put any extra in a non-funky freezer.

review/summary: Dark is best
review/text: I found the mild was undrinkable and the medium barely tolerable.  But the dark roast is quite good.  Its on the Starbuck-type bitter side, but not as strong.  None of these single serving coffee machines will taste like fresh ground.  That is why you get some one star reviews for the Senseo.  <p>I keep the Senseo in my office for hassle-free single servings and it is great for that.  Even the dark roast is really not strong enough to qualify as espresso, so I suggest you just use the double packets and make a large cup.<p>Here is a further hint.  Use a 10 oz cup, not a standard 8.  Then put your milk in the cup and microwave for 30 seconds BEFORE you make the coffee.  After coffee is make make sure to stir with a stirrer.  Stirring is important and is actually recomended by Philips.<br />As long as your expectations are down to earth you should enjoy this product.  The machine itself has been flawless and doesnt seem flimsy at all.

review/summary: Great for convenient coffee--not home roast!
review/text: Sure, Sarah Lee and the pholks at Philips think this baby produces the best coffee you'll ever taste.  It doesn't.  The snotty coffee folks, like myself, roast our own coffee and it is utterly superior.  However it is a royal PITA to tote fresh beans into the office and I'm the only one willing to go to that much trouble for coffee in my office.<br /><br />To solve this little problem, I purchased a Senseo and these pleasant Douwe Egberts Dark pods!  It's a sturdy machine, completely employee-proof, and quite tidy.  The coffee it produces is far better than anything that comes in a can and certainly will give Starbucks a run for their $6 venti's.<br /><br />Think of the DE pods as an easy way to get fresh, hot, pleasant coffee in about 30 seconds.  Use two pods, one dark and one medium for a fuller flavor profile or, if you're a low-caf freak, do one decaf and one caf.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that you've gotta pre-warm the mug you're using if you like hot coffee-and the best way to do this is with some leche in the microwave.  One final tip which out to assuage some of the folks who think the DE's are weak:<br /><br />Run a few seconds of hot water through the machine without a pod inside.  This gets the metal plates wet and hot.  A good thing.  Put your pods on the wet plates and close the machine.  Let it sit for a few seconds.  This lets the coffee get wet and swell a bit.  This is called pre-infusion in the espresso trade and if you pull your 8 oz of pleasure now, it will taste pretty darned good.<br /><br />-J

I purchased my coffee maker from Target...what a disaster since they don't keep consistent stock of the recommended coffee pods for this coffee maker.  I now purchase my pods from Amazon...they are dependable, in-stock and tax free.

review/summary: Dark Roast = Bitter Taste
review/text: First off, I love my Senseo so let's get that out of the way.<br /><br />I like strong flavored coffee but I found the Douwe Dark Roast too bitter with an unpleasant aftertaste.  I much prefer the medium roast which is still has a strong flavor without being bitter.<br /><br />Stick with the medium and, here's a secret, you can use the Folgers Home Cafe Coffee pods in your Senseo.  I've tried the Home Cafe Folgers Columbian pods and they work fine.  Also go to cafepods.com for more cofeee pod varieteis for the Senseo.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Best coffee I have ever had from Douwe Egberts....
review/text: I have been drinking Douwe Egberts red label coffee for about 4 years now and the last time I was in Holland visiting friends I had a taste of Senseo Crema Dark Roast... I love this coffee... It is a fantastic blend and is so easy to make a cup of the coffee...<br />Last year I was given the Senseo Coffee maker and spent the money to have a special outlet installed in my kitchen and the plug changed on the coffee maker so I could enjoy it... I would not pass on this coffee ever.. It is adictive, it is that good...<br />Buy this coffee maker and this Dark Roast blend and you will see what I mean... It is well worth the money...<br />Also for those who didn't like the coffee, remember to read the instructions carefully because you first have to run clear water thru the Senseo before you use it.... It adds to the flavor of the coffee and prepares the maker for use... If I could I would rate this with 10 stars...

review/text: The Douwe Egberts dark roast is the best of all the senseo compatible pods currently available in the United States.  While it lacks the slightly fruity nuances that many of us who patron starbucks have come to love and expect.  It delivers a quick, convenient coffee that is full bodied, rich, and devoid of a burnt flavor.

review/summary: Happy Senseo Customer
review/text: A year ago we brought the Senseo machine back from Holland and have been using it with a $100 transformer here in the States, but it was worth it all. Now we're overjoyed that the machines have finally come to the USA, we already purchased three and have recommended it to friends who also have bought the machine. Our favorite is the Dark Roast as we have tried all flavors while in Holland.  Yesterday we brought back the newest flavors from Europe: Rio de Janeiro, Vienna, and Milano.....but most of all DARK ROAST (Mocca Gourmet is pretty good too). I just hope the collection expands quickly over here....

I suggest spending a little extra money and buying quality pods - the difference is markedly different.

review/summary: Why not in Canada ?
review/text: Going on a regular basis to Holland, I got to know the Philips Senseo coffee machine well. I even have one in my condo overthere. Since I knew that the machine was introduced in North America I tried to buy one in Canada. But no such luck, the machine is only available in the USA, too bad. I bought one in the US, including the whole stock of Douwe Egberts dark roast coffee pods in the local U.S. Wall Mart. I thought that I could order more supply over the internet only to find out that shipping is only available in the U.S. Shame on  Philips and Douwe Egberts for not introducing the machine and the coffee in Canada as well.<br /><br />I can really recommend the dark roast coffee pods, the machine works very well, but I would even be more happy if I could go to my own (Canadian) store and buy the stuff instead of asking my mom to bring the coffee from Holland, where they have by the way more coffee varieties such as mocca, French vanilla etc.<br /><br />Henny de Gruijter,<br /><br />Sooke B.C., Canada

review/summary: Cheaper in the stores...
review/text: Ok, you have or want a Pod machine.  Many choices, the Senseo is the best of them.  Why you want to buy one is likely because you want barista coffee that's easy, cheap, or fast.  The Senso does that, but it's not better than espresso.  Maybe as good, that's for you to determine.<br /><br />That's the usual tradeoff: fast (easy), cheap, and good: pick any two.  That is my Shiny scale (see below).<br /><br />Ok, I can pick up these 18-pack pods about $4-5 in the supermarkets.  Why pay more with Amazon?  You live in Alaska or something?<br /><br />If you like the other makers' pods, go ahead and buy them.  I've had the Cafe Express ones in my Senseo, and they work fine.  I've also brewed some bag green tea in it, though it can seep out the sides if you're not careful.  You can NOT use tamped coffee, however.  Tried it, and cleaned up the mess afterward.<br /><br />The purist complaint with the Senseo is that their coffees are not up to barista standard.  I don't know who is writing their stuff, but I have been drinking coffee since 9, and I like it so much that my drip brewer sits in the corner.  It's not espresso, but it doesn't' claim to be.  This system is worth more than what I paid for it at Costco, which was $40 at Xmas.  Actually, it was a Xmas gift, so technically I didn't buy it.<br /><br />I think the dark roast is better than the medium, but I do like the mild roast when I am in the mood for nothing shocking.  I have tried the flavored coffee, but think I'd rather add flavored syrup.<br /><br />The system brews at 3 bar, or thereabouts, and true espresso machines will be over 7 bar.  Also, it's pumping steaming water thru, not just steam, but will produce a very pleasant crema (that oil/coffee foam at the top of the glass).  Add milk before, there is no steamer/milk foamer.<br /><br />If you want a real espresso machine, buy a $500 one (Rancilio Silva is the my recommendation at that price range) and learn how to be a barista (10 hours of practice, working at Starbucks, or take a class).  Amortize the cost of the machine over 20 years and you'll be wildly happy.  The Senseo will likely last 4-5 years, I guess, but if it's for occasional good coffee, better than your drip system can produce, you'll be well pleased.  I recommend it, and I have one.<br /><br />Shiny scale:<br /><br />Fast/easy: 9<br /><br />Good: 7<br /><br />cheap (value): 8<br /><br />And for comparison, the Rancilio Silva is:<br /><br />Fast:easy: 7<br /><br />Good: 10

review/text: The dark roast is good coffee.  Never liked the other flavors.  Well, the decaf is OK.  Super Saver Subscription brings price down to about $0.22 per cup of coffee.  And Senseo means it's always fresh.  Occasionally one pod in a pack will have ripped open (in transit, or from manufacturer).  This makes a mess of the other pods and will result in the occasional extra gritty bits in your coffee.  Call Senseo if this happens, and they'll send you a coupon for another bag.

review/summary: Very good single cup of coffee
review/text: My wife and I each have one cup of coffee each morning before we leave for work.  We've had a Senseo maker now for about 4 years.  We have found that the Dark Roast coffee makes a very rich, flavorful cup of coffee.  Much better than any drip maker.  We both use two pods and make a double cup for both of us.  It's a great help to getting us going in the morning.  It isn't cheap but we feel it's worth it.  We buy the coffee from Amazon or Target (when they have any).

review/summary: Better to the last drop
review/text: What can I say... If Douwe Egberts was good enough for my dutch grandmother, it's perfect for me.  I like this flavor best with my Senseo... It has a nice dark full body flavor without the burt bean taste I tend sense with starbucks.  It's a shame most americans haven't bought into single serve coffe makers as our Dutch counter parts have.  Every cup is fresh brewed and doesn't sit long enough on my desk to get that old taste either.

It's not only convenient, but it saves me money and time... I get 4 bags sent to my door for what 3 bags would cost in the supermarket, and I don't have to go there and back for them either.

review/summary: Favorite Senseo Coffee
review/text: The Dark Roast is my favorite Senseo coffee. I love a super strong cup of coffee, and the other flavors/strengths just don't cut it for me. The only thing better is coffee from a French coffee press and I usually don't have the time for that method on a typical morning. Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" program is great for this product too. I get 2 cases of coffee in the mail every couple weeks, free shipping AND a discount to boot... and I never have to wonder or worry about whether the grocery store is out of stock, which they usually are!

review/summary: Senseo coffee pods
review/text: The dark is not that much stronger than medium, so be aware if you like it strong! I tried the ecopods and they just don't compare to the ease and taste of the originals.  They may be a bit pricey (I always use two and it averages out to about .55 a cup), but in my mind, well worth it for taste and convenience.

review/summary: Great tasting and very easy to make
review/text: It doesn't get much simpler than this.  All one has to do is put the pod in the Senseo coffee maker, fill it up with water, press the button for one or two cups and, less than two minutes later, you have yourself some great-tasting coffee.<br /><br />The machine itself is not expensive and the pods, while not cheap, aren't very expensive, either.<br /><br />While Senseo is the equivalent of espresso (it looks and tastes strong), the coffee itself will not have you bouncing off the walls.  It gives you just the right amount of zing to go about your day.<br /><br />Senseo is definitely worth a try (but, beware, there is the tendency to love this coffee).  - Donna Di Giacomo

review/text: For at least a full year now, we have been using Senseo Dowe Egberts Dark Roast Coffee Pods, and the Senseo brewing system in our home. As people who appreciate the difference between Good coffee, and the "average cup of Java", we feel that the original Senseo "Dark Roast" Coffee Pods, make the best cup of coffee possible. Amazon's excellent service and price helps an already perfect situation.

review/text: The Senseo Douwe Egbertts Dark Roast is as close as I've found for a strong cup of coffee out of a pod coffee maker. I use the 5 oz. and it's still not strong enough, but hey, the convenience is there.  If the pods were stronger (for me, a lot stronger) I'd give Senseo the full 5 stars.

review/text: I have yet to try the other coffee flavors, but I have to say (being a bit of a coffee snob at times) the dark roast was the best cup of coffee I've had at home, or most locations, ever!  I love dark coffee but can never get the taste quite right, with these I can drink it black and it's perfect.  I was going to try another flavor but I'm so in love with these I had better stock up!  They do seem a bit pricey, but for a good cup of coffee quickly, this stuff is the best!

review/summary: Incomparable
review/text: The process of pushing water with a certain amount of pressure through these pods, produces a flavorful, frothy cup of coffee. If however you use one pod for each four ounces, you are not having an inexpensive experience. If however you supplement your brew with instant coffee and brew eight ounces of coffee from each pod, you can get the same frothy effect and have more control over how strong your want your coffee.<br /><br />I even know somebody who uses each pod twice (sixteen ounces of coffee from each pod). There is not as much froth on the second round but the coffee is still serviceable.

review/summary: THE BEST - NOTHING COMPARES!!! - BUT WAIT - IT'S CHANGED :(
review/text: We love this coffee and machine. But you need dark roast (light is weak, medium ok).  We tried Maxwell House and Folgers pods too but there was no comparison. We also bought the adapter so you can use your own coffee, but again, no comparison - it came out much weaker no matter how much coffee you crammed in. We also make tea in the maker - just stick a couple of teabags in and you have a frothy cup of tea too.  We love this. Anybody want to buy a used Krups?<br />2012 UPDATE - I take it all back.  Senseo closed up shop apparently and the pods are definitely not the same quality. The taste isn't as good and the seams of the pods splits open - leaving a mess in the bag.  Very very unhappy with it - gonna try another brand pod.  It's a sad day in coffee land.

review/summary: So expensive now, replaced with Baronet Coffee Pods for my Senseo machine
review/text: I enjoyed the Senseo coffee pods for 2 years, and now they become so expensive since Senseo withdrawn from the US market.<br /><br />Google it and found others had the same problem too. Tried one of the suggestions from others, switched to Baronet coffee pods(larger size of pods) so you will need the coffee Duck to hold it in.<br /><br />Search Amazon for the following product to use...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00295RASY">Coffeeduck Classic: Permanent Refillable Coffee Filter for the Senseo models HD7810-HD7812</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQRCH6">Baronet Coffee French Dark Roast, 18-Count Coffee Pods (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />It worked for me for 1 month now, it's not as much chroma as this product, but similar price with more coffee per pod in it. Now I can make a full cup(3/4th actually) of coffee using the senseo machine(Used to be a pod for half cup of coffee using this product).<br /><br />The trick is to wet the top part of the pods with water after putting it in the coffee duck, press the 1 cup brewing, wait for it to finish and the blinking red light become steady again(Senseo machine heated up the water). press the 1 cup brewing again, when it's half way through stop the Senseo machine by pressing the power button.<br /><br />Now I have a 3/4 cup full of coffee, not too dark and not too light, you can control it to your liking.

review/summary: of all the brands of pods I have tried, Senseo's is the best
review/text: I really like the Senseo Coffee Pods. My old Senseo maker broke and I got a Bunn. The Senseo pods fit perfectly. I do prefer when Amazon has the variety packs, but they were out and so was I, so I got the Dark Roast. I would love it if Senseo would print the name or a code of some kind to tel one pod flavor from another I take them out of the bags and put them in canisters. So far of all the brands of pods I have tried, Senseo's is the best flavor.
