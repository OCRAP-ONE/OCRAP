review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: Scottish Breakfast Tea is a very robust tea.  Although probably not a purist way to drink it, I like it with lemon and sugar which both enhance the slightly smokey flavor. A great tea for making a pot in the evening, but it is good any time. If you like Liptons or Red Rose, Scottish Breakfast Tea is not for you.  If you want serious tea, this is the right stuff. One more comment - it is easier to buy it through Amazon than it is through the English Tea Store. Go figure.

review/text: As a child growing up in the cornfields of Minnesota, I LOVED my mother's Lime Jello Tuna Casserole. Besides Lime Jello, her recipe includes one can of tuna, a cup of mayo, sliced green pimiento-stuffed olives and chopped celery for crunchiness.<br /><br />There was some controversy in the neighborhood as to whether this was not actually a Jello salad rather than a jello casserole, but I was unconcerned with the semantics. My mother, a devout Lutheran, would not let me peek into the frig until it was done, and I never caught that magic moment when the mixture became a jiggly solid.

review/summary: Been there, done that
review/text: The truth of the matter that with this review It is getting to be around 4 reviews of different JELL-0's that I have reviewed to the present date. But since it is to please Amazon, and I am spoiled silly by them, sometimes you just want to comply.  Jell-O Sugar-Free Gelatin Dessert, Lime, 0.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24) is a good buy for those that enjoy or better still, have realized that this form of dessert does not present the threats that, let's say, a german bavarian chocolate cake, would bring to the table. Almost no calories, it does not add or take from a conscientious shut the day off on the munchies department. Unless the main entree was brutal in size, and I am just fooling myself that because I have a harmless serving of Lime Jello I am on the path to leaner days and that whatever else I stuff myself during the day gets absolved with such prudent option in the end, one really feels light on their feet and optimistic at the end of a great day in the day of a life. Yes, 4 Stars because, after all, JELL-0 is such an integral part of the market shelves, one can not dismiss or disrespect what it means. Think of hospitals, boring cafeterias, mild settings when after a mediocre meatless fare, some color of the dessert arrives. You know they are not real fruit, but hey, as long as it taste like it who cares how many varieties of coloring and unpronounceable ingredients we swallow with pride and satisfaction at the end of the day. Did I say too much? At this stage I am fully realizing I did. 3.5 Stars but 4 instead out of respect for its vast and familiar history!

review/text: I would give this zero stars if I could.  Aspartame is poisonous.  Its effects on the body are more dire when it is heated.  I gained a large amount of weight when I started ingesting "diet" products such as sugar free Jell-O, Diet Coke, sugar free gum, etc.  I was chronically fatigued 24/7.  My brain "fog" was so bad I couldn't think.  I was depressed.  All of these are symptoms of aspartame poisoning, and luckily, they all went away after I discontinued use of aspartame.

review/summary: Dog Loves
review/text: I bought this to let my dog try it out when we switched over to adult food.  It is extremely expensive, but when I fed my dog this food, I put it at the bottom of the bowl and put her old food over the top of it. She proceeded in digging through the old food to and only eating this food. She LOVES it. When we made the switch she had some really bad gas, but that only lasted 2 weeks and now everything is normal, and instead of waiting to eat her food, she pretty much eats it right when I put it in her bowl. I highly recommend this food. The only thing I wish is that the food pieces were bigger so she would have to chew it up. I was at the vet and he said that there prescription science diet is made with carrot fiber so as the dogs are chewing it up (big pieces that can't be swallowed hole) it is also cleaning their teeth... So We will see if her teeth get bad in the long run, I constantly give her small chunks of raw hide and teeth cleaning toys, so I am hoping that will also fend off bad teeth.  My dog loves this food. Highly Recommend!

Once that was gone, I gave the chicken a try.  He loves that also and it doesn't have the same smell, so I like it better.

review/summary: My precious child (yorkie) REFUSED to eat for 2 months!!!!!
review/text: I have literally been frantic over "Celli" (nickname for Andrea Bocelli) not eating anything except treats..no nutritive value..for 2 months!!! I cooked grilled chicken breasts, beef cooked every way, even lean pork chops...no deal...It is very grueling to watch your only baby starving!!! I tried 32 flavors of dog food. He has always preferred dry food over canned food. So I was perusing the dog food offered by my "hero sight" Amazon,and something about Halo Spots Stew caught my attention. For days I went back and forth between flavors that my pooch would find appealing. Finally, I settled on the adult lamb recipe. After ordering I thought "Oh no, the kibble is going to be too large for his small mouth"( Am I neurotic, doting mother or what?) Anyone who thinks I am totally disgusting doesn't know what this situation is like!! I was prepared to chop the dog food in my food processor...BUT, the food arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and what a surprise!!! Upon opening the bag of food, to my pleasant surprise, the smell of the food was so good..so fresh.. and the kibble is so small!! Now for the happy ending...Celli ate every bit in his bowl as if to say "This is what I've been waiting for"...Mommy will rest tonight...Thanks Halo and Amazon...My love and gratitude to you!!!

I've bought 3 different flavors of Halo Spot's Stew, and she likes all of them. And maybe it helps that the food is made in smaller pieces. I often mix the dry food with chopped meat or hard boiled egg, and sometimes wet dogfood. She eats everything instead of picking through it and leaving behind some of the dry food. Also, the size of the bag is easy to handle.

Her dog, Mr. Quiggs gives it "two paws up."  Full of real food and the end result is easy to scoop - hey, that rhymes with poop!  Cowboy will pick out the peas (yes, there are real peas in there) and eat the rest of the food first - either he saves the best for last or he really doesn't like peas.  I'm guessing the latter.  It's a big plus that the food can be delivered to my door - thanks Amazon.

review/text: My dog loved this food, and he lost a few pounds without seeming to be ravenous all the time.  I'm so impressed with the high quality ingredients, but I'm still searching.  My dog's skin issues are much improved on this food but not completely resolved, and peas are unusually high on the ingredient list here, so I'm thinking that he may be allergic to peas as well as corn.  Would definitely buy again if I can rule out peas as a problem.

review/summary: 15 years of Shedding Stops!
review/text: My JRT used to shed terribly before I found this brand.<br />I have tried at least 20 different premium dog foods, supplements, & coat treatments throughout her 16 years.  No expense was too great.  Her coat always looked shiny and healthy, but no amount of brushing (I tried all types of grooming tools, even those wire things to strip a dogs undercoat) would  even slow down her shedding.  And, she is also a very picky eater, demanding a new brand after about a month.  All that shopped with HALO.<br /><br />--It was AMAZING!  After a few weeks her shedding was noticeably decreased!  Thinking it was a dream and I had finally gone off the deep end I pushed it out of my mind.  I didn't want to jinx it but I washed and vacuumed the car especially well, crossing my fingers that it wouldn't fill up with hair. Sure enough, by the time she finished her first 4 pound bag of Halo Stew she STOPPED shedding altogether! AND, she has been eating this brand for months and still loves it!  Another prayer answered!

review/summary: No bergamot
review/text: This tea is OK.  I suppose the anti-oxidants in rooibos are there and that it is, therefore, good for you.  But it certainly does NOT taste anything like Earl Grey.  If there's bergamot in it, I certainly couldn't taste it.  I was hoping to find a replacement for the Earl Grey I used to drink (I gave up caffeine).  I guess I'll have to keep looking.

review/summary: Nice Rooibos - but hardly fit for an Earl!
review/text: I agree with most of the other Reviewers, this is an ok Rooibos, but no-one should mistake it for Earl Grey tea.  The bergamot flavor is very weak, in fact the tea itself is on the weak side.  The Bergamot is really just a subtle and fleeting scent, not a flavor at all.  I have used other loose Earl Grey Rooibos teas that have a n actual long-lasting flavor of Bergamot, as they should.  As for this one, I suggest you follow the Manufacturer and bag it!

review/text: I travel a lot and purchased this tea because I couldn't find the "rishi" brand where I was a month ago. Rishi brand comes as a loose tea so I also thought these tea bags would be easier than traveling with a tea strainer. The taste is ok but I definitely recommend Rishi better. If you don't like loose tea this is a good option. In any case I was really glad to find this and happy, SO HAPPY to have my morning decaf earl whatever brand it was (^_^)

The flavor is delicate but strong enough to feel like a good cuppa. I hope Amazon.com will always keep this one in stock!

review/summary: A soothing, exotic taste.
review/text: I've been drinking Yogi Tea's Licorice flavor for about two years. I thought it was about time I try something new... and Cocoa Spice is just it!<br /><br />Without sweetener or creamer, the immediate taste upon entering your mouth is a sweet soothing taste followed by a strong, spicy zest that tingles down your throat after swallowed. Almost like those "hot" cinnamon disc hard candies. This is one of the few teas I can drink without any sweetener. As with most teas, the minute you add sugar the taste is intensified! An extremely delightful tea.<br /><br />My favorite way to drink Cocoa Spice is-<br /><br />1 teabag<br />12oz of hot water<br />2 packets of Splenda (or a teaspoon of sugar on my "bad" days)<br />1 tablespoon of half-n-half<br /><br />Amazing!!! Try it out sometime!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: With the fact that the title of the tea says COCOA, I was truly hoping for a warm and yummy chocolate tasting tea with a hint of spice - however, the first time I brewed a cup with 1 tea bag - it tasted very very bland and then I tried it with 2 tea bags and sure it tasted slightly better. I enjoy putting a drop of milk into my non-herbal teas, and basically with or without the tinsy drop of milk this tea tasted like blandly flavored water; a very vague essence of chocolate. Very disappointing. I let the tea sit out for hours (I had forgotten about it) and since there was no milk in it and I was curious so I took a sip and I must say it did taste even better ... but still, I don't want to wait hours and hours for even a slightest bit of flavor from my tea ... although I am thinking of trying it as an iced tea - almost like an iced chai tea. We shall see. I love Yogi Tea and I drink many of their teas - however, this Cocoa Spice is by far not my favorite ...

review/summary: better than mmf!
review/text: I used this fondant for the first time to cover a two layer cake. It took blue food coloring gel very well, was pliable, easily handled, rolled thin, and worked wonderfully for my purposes. I had used marshmallow fondant in the past and it came out very lumpy on the cake- and was a pain to make. This was so much easier and looked much more smooth. I also bought at Michaels with a 40 percent off coupon. The best part was, my guests actually enjoyed it! The taste was definitely sweet, but not offensive as some premade fondants are rumored to be, and tasted better than the MMF!

It was for a wedding cake and I was running late, so I figured I would just use it anyway.  The fondant was so soft I could not get it on the cake.  Every time I tried to roll it out and get it on the cake it would stick to itself or stretch out or tear.  I ended up racing to the store and buying Wilton fondant -- which I hate.  The taste of Wilton is gross, but at least it was white and I could get it on the cake.

And this, friends -- this is a whole big bunch of salsa.<br /><br />I especially like that this salsa is kosher, because everyone should feel comfortable at a good party. In the middle of a huge bash -- with bacon-wrapped scallops and six kinds of barbecue and a roasting pig on a spit out back -- it's nice to be able to turn to one of my friends of another faith and say:<br /><br />"Fear not, champ.

review/text: This instant soup is insanely delicious.  It comes in a rigid cup containing four packets:  vacuum-sealed moist udon noodles, concentrated liquid soup base, dehydrated vegetable flakes, and dehydrated bonito flakes.  Add water and soup base to the noodles, microwave for three minutes, stir in the dehydrated flakes, and you will have a high-quality restaurant style soup.

review/summary: Quaity black tea - no garish perfumes or oils
review/text: This tea is a wonderfully smooth black tea, with just a hint of black cherry flavor. The reason I like it is that it is not "perfumed" with over powering essence, as has become the trend in flavored teas. It does not have the synthetic use of flavor ls used by almost every other maker of flavored teas. This is he real deal! All this, and being organic - what a treat!

review/text: This tea is lovely and you can't beat the price for organic, but if you are looking or cherry tea, keep looking!  I personally can't even smell cherry, I love the favor, but it is better described as a black tea without the "bite" that you sometimes get with a black tea, the cherry seems to mellow the flavor. The tea is 5 star, but I am giving it four due to missing the cherry!

Barely discernible licorice taste in a starchy semi-hard gel that doesn't really chew - After the first bite the candy tube collapses and it just fragments into smaller gel bits. It's like they made the candy for someone who doesn't like the taste of licorice- and I bought five lbs. of this waste.  Stupid me. Hope you licorice lovers don't get burnt. Good luck.

review/text: They've got the appearance of licorice, but close your eyes and you would be hard pressed to identify the taste if someone put one in your mouth. They're really, really bland.<br /><br />If you try hard, you can taste a bit of licorice flavor, but would it have really hurt to put some more licorice oil in there? After all, those of us trying to avoid sugar are not trying to avoid licorice oil.<br /><br />The consistency isn't great either. It's a bit starchy. But I'd take it if they had any taste. As it stands, I have five pounds of these, with no idea what to do with them, because I'm not going to waste the calories eating something this tasteless.

review/text: Sorbee Sugar Free Licorice Bites are very nice.  As some reviewers have said, they do not have a strong licorice flavor nor do they have that soft firmness to the bite.  They are a very nice, sugar free licorice treat that is not expensive and fills the need when you want a sweet treat.  As with almost all sugar free candies, if you have a sensitive stomach, you'll need to watch your portion size.  Since it is a 5 pund bag, make sure you place it in a sealed container to keep the bites fresh.  I will buy them again.

review/text: I just got my order of amaretto fudge and I seriously question their thought process of shipping preparations during the summer. There was no cooling package to make sure it didn't melt, and I was also overcharged for shipping in that I paid $7.95 but ON THE VERY BOX I RECIEVED IT IN cleary says it only cost the company $5.34. Furthermore, it tastes bizarre. I don't even know what else to call it, it's just a weird flavor as if something is wrong with their liquor. Of course, that's what I get for buying fudge not from a mountain area.

review/text: I have used the Gold Rush brand sourdough starter in the past with success. Since I couldn't locate any locally, I hoped to buy it on Amazon. But once you get it going, it keeps (and improves) as long as you keep "feeding" it. In other words, one packet will last for years. What would I do with the other 23 packets? Unless you're planning to go into the sourdough business, buying a case of 24 doesn't make sense.

review/text: I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.
