review/summary: Too strong and too reminiscent of green tea (not chamomile)
review/text: I love chamomile tea and I like green tea...but I have to be in the mood for one or the other, not both simultaneously.  Somehow, Timothy's has managed to put both of these tea flavors into one product and both my husband and I do not care for it all.  It's not horrible, it's just not what we care to taste in our chamomile tea.  We are truly disappointed and would not recommend this product as the green tea flavor is overpowering leaving very little true chamomile to taste :(

review/text: Sunridge Farms Organic Roasted Salted cashews are a great snack.  Our daughter has a large number of food sensitivities, including peanuts.  We had a hard time finding any cashews or various types of roasted nuts that were not roasted in peanut oil.  This product has been a great, delicious snack alternative for our daughter and is not roasted in peanut oil.

review/summary: Cornucopia Kiwi Melon
review/text: Another successful Cornucopia kit purchased from Amazon!<br /><br />These kits are amazingly simple. We've done so many now we hardly look at the easy to understand directions. Couple that with the very reasonable price (most other brand kits do not include corks, labels and foils!) and it's hard to go wrong with any Cornucopia wine kit.<br /><br />The Kiwi Melon has a strong melon presence. We made this in December and it would probably be better off enjoying in the summer. Still it adds to our variety of wines we have on hand and we really enjoy having friends over to sample what we are making.<br /><br />A nice sweet wine if you like sweet wine.

review/summary: Kiwi Melon Verdicchio
review/text: This is my first Amazon review because I really liked how this wine turned out.  As with mostly all kits, all needed items came with the kit (juice, F-pack, labels, & corks, etc).  Also, all directions were easy to follow.  I did take the liberty and add an extra 5lbs of disolved sugar into primary fermentor.  This wine would have given a ABV of abotu 5.5% without adding sugar.  With the sugar I was able to take it up to 12% and the "balance" (your relationship between flavor and alcohol content)still really exists.  Its been had by many people now, all with outstanding surprise on their faces!  So for the price, this kit is well worth the time and money.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Amazingly Good Cheese
review/text: I work from home, so I have as much of my food delivered as possible. I gave this cheese a try not expecting much. I figured that I would give it a whirl, but truly expected to be out the money. I was pleasantly surprised. This is darn good cheese. It is as good if not better than any regular cheddar cheese from the supermarket. It is a medium cheddar, not too sharp. It holds it flavor and shape well simply wrapped in foil. I will definitely keep it on my shopping list as one more thing I do not need to buy locally. My guests have liked it as well. I highly recommend this cheese. Pair the convenience with the cost and it deserves all five stars.

He probably would have eaten more if we allowed him to gorge himself on it.  There were no adverse reactions to the switch. You just have to slowly wean your dog off the cheap stuff, otherwise, you dog could experience loose stools.

review/summary: Not up to the hype, caused bloody stools in my puppy
review/text: I purchased this food upon recommendation from my vet. They told me that they had previously used the Holistic brand but it had merged with this company & they did not have experience with Eagle Pack but that they thought it was the same. I slowly added the food to my puppy's old food over the next week and she seemed to like it just fine. Well, she started having a lot of loose stools, many of which were completely liquid and even bloody for the next couple of weeks. I decided to try another food and everything completely resolved. I have since tried a couple of puppy foods equal in quality/price/reputation with no problems. Her stools are completely better, now soft but formed (like they should be!) with no sign of blood whatsoever. She has not had any gastrointestinal problems on numerous different kinds of treats either. She has been fine on 3 puppy foods, a dozen different kinds of treats...you do the math.<br /><br />I have been trying to figure out what the problem may have been from the ingredient list and my concern is the "triple animal proteins" combining chicken, pork and fish meals. This is just an invitation for food intolerance because there are more potential allergens. I think the pork is the problem. I know she tolerates chicken & chicken meal fine, not sure about fish but I've seen that frequently in other foods while I have yet to find another quality food that contains pork meal. Pig does not seem akin to a domestic dog's "natural" diet anyway. If they got rid of the pork, I might consider trying it again but until then I'd recommend you try another food for your puppy. I think (hope) they are generally a good company and I do see that some people's dogs have been fine on this brand, but I'm not sure this is the safest food for baby animals. I will NOT be purchasing this again & I will be contacting my vet recommending that they no longer carry it in their store. There are so many better, safer options out there. If you care about your puppy's health and happiness, save her weeks of misery and buy something else!

review/summary: decaf review
review/text: i've often used instant coffee in a jar since no one else in the house drinks it and making a pot regardless of the size is a bit of a hassle. jar coffee loses its robust-ness after a while, it sort of 'stales'. being this coffee comes in little single serve sleeves it is always fresh. and the flavor was surprising and when it hits the hot water it smells brewed, mmm good. i first tried it when i picked up a decaf pack of 6 at my local target for only $1. so then i thought i'd see if i can get a better deal on amazon for larger quantity. i don't care for super strong starbuck kind of coffee so i make mine using about 10-12oz of water verses the recommended 8oz. but if you like yours more full bodied i don't think this coffee will disappoint. ps. DO NOT buy Superior's brand of instant decaf, even tho i prefer weaker coffee i had to use 4 of their individual packets to get even a slightly mild flavor, it was much cheaper than tasters choice and as we learn over and over again 'you get what you paid for'.. so i'm back ordering the good stuff

review/summary: Nescafe Coffee sticks
review/text: Well, from the other review, it is amazing how taste varies between individuals. So in order to have any impact on your buying decision, I will elaborate as much as possible.<br /><br />My first experience with these Coffee Sticks were from a sample mailing promotion of 6 flavors.<br /><br />First Plus - The variety of flavors made finding one I might try more favorable.<br />Second plus- The convenient and well labeled aluminum packets made choosing fun<br />Third plus - The perfectly measured serving took away the brain work - just add water<br />Fourth plus -The texture and smell were pleasant, without addititives<br />Fifth plus - The coffee crystal mixed and dissolved thoroughly.<br />Sixth plus - Flavor was enhanced by coffee mate non dairy and sugar (stuff I put in my reg coffee.)<br />Seventh plus-I looked forward to every sip during the test, and regretted the last one as I knew<br />  fun was over.<br /><br />Conclusion is that these coffee sticks provide a real varied and fun experience from a regular coffee break, with some very refreshing flavors.

review/summary: a waste of money and customer service from hell
review/text: The product contains 7 individual teaspoon size sticks. A quick calculation shows that for $7.84 it is over one dollar a stick. In their website, Office Quarters sell it for a quarter of the price. I contacted customer service, as I did not know that I was getting a box of 7 sticks, and I encountered an attitude from hell: they claimed that "I don't understand how Amazon.com works" and that the product cost is $1.70 and all the rest is shipping and handling, which is a straight forward lie. This is not how it is described at Amazon.com: the cost is $7.84 and there is no shipping charge. And, the product came in a regular mail envelop, good 16 days after I ordered, with USPS. I would not recommend dealing with Office Quarters for any of their products. The one star rating I gave them, is a huge complement.

review/summary: at least it looks like coffee
review/text: The packaging is convenient.  Single paper/foil tube for one cup of coffee.<br />I followed the simple instructions carefully and produced a 6 oz cup of hot brown liquid with almost no aroma. It did not smell like real coffee or anything else.  The "beverage" was not cloudy and looked like a typical cup of good coffee--no murkiness, no powder floating on the top.  I drank it straight--no cream, no sugar.  The flavor was lousy.  About what Nescafe powder produced 40 years ago.  It is as if they have abandoned all they once new about instant coffee.  The taste was bitter, with a hint of solvent and very little real coffee complexity.  At least there was almost no 'caffeine' after taste.  I would recommend this as a last resort when nothing else with any kind of coffee label could be found.

review/summary: Fresh & worth buying in bulk even if you don't use very often
review/text: I usually just buy pine nuts bulk from Amazon based on price.  These fit the bill.  Actually easier to store than the other brand that sells in plastic tubs.  We use pine nuts infrequently, but when we do it is so much better to just pull them out of the freezer to find just as fresh and WAY less $ than in grocery store.  Be sure to roast these on stove or in oven (toaster oven works too) for few minutes, but don't look away or they'll burn - but definately worth it to bring out flaver especially when using in pestos, salads, etc.  Found that most friends do not realize to keep nuts in freezer - share the info because saves $ & is more convenient.  I've kept up to 6 months & works great, may last longer, just not in my house.

review/text: I'm very particular about what I feed my dogs. I often make my own "canned/wet" food and treats at home to ensure the quality and safety of the food I'm feeding my dogs. After looking at the ingredients in these biscuits and checking out the price when purchased in the 12 pound box, I realized I could not make biscuits of this quality at home for this price. My dogs really love these biscuits, and I feel good about the quality of this product. I also love that I can divide these biscuits into various sizes, as I have dogs that range from 6 lbs to 130 lbs. Even with 5 dogs this 12 lb box lasts a long time, and it is packaged in 3 heavy zipper bags, so you don't open all 12 lbs at once and they stay fresh. I would recommend these to anyone who cares about what they feed their dogs.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE These Biscuits
review/text: I have known for a long time that Canidae is a great product, and is not usually sold in stores, so when I saw these biscuits on the Amazon website, I immediately ordered them.  I have two Eskies (miniature American Eskimo Dogs) so I had to have enough for both of them.  This is a big package, so it was definitely enough.  Canidae is so highly rated for both dry and "wet" food that I didn't have to worry about these biscuits containing anything that might not be good for my Girls.<br /><br />It has "Balanced Omega 6 & 3 Fatty Acids" and they are advertised to help control tartar and plaque.  Can't speak to that yet (neither has had a dental for a year) but I do know they love them.  It's a single biscuit that can be snapped into 4 separate pieces.  My Girls, both under 26 pounds, receive 2 half-pieces in the mid-afternoon (that's 1 biscuit broken into 2 pieces) and although one of them trots off with her half-piece as soon as she gets it, the other stands right where she is and crunches down the first half-piece and looks for the next one (just about demands it!).<br /><br />As the package ran low I knew I had to have more for them, and so re-ordered from Amazon.  Another package duly arrived, before the first one ran out, for which I was thankful.  And so were The Girls!

I have never had a problem with Canidae Dog Treats, as they are healthy and safe to feed my dogs.

review/text: While I do think these treats are healthy and nutritious, they are on the large size. I generally break them in to 4 pieces (the biscuit itself is scored), and then break them again for the treat.

review/summary: Canidae Dog Treats
review/text: The Canidae dog treats has been well received by my 1 year old Presa Canarios.  The "snap" configuration of the treat works great since you can break off as much or as little as you want.  I liked the nutritional content of the treats.  So many times the dogs may love the treats but they are not the healthiest for them.  These treats are good for them and they love them.....  I have switched my dogs to the Canidae dog food as well.....

review/summary: My dogs love them
review/text: I have been buying these Canidae treats for a while now for my dogs.  I feed them the same formula Canidae kibble and canned food, so these treats fit in well with their diet - no worry about upset tummies.  They smell kind of nice too, almost like cinnamon.  There is usually a good amount of crumbs at the bottom of the bag which I just sprinkle in their food bowls at dinner time.  I'll continue to buy these for my dogs for as long as they make them.

review/summary: These are quickly gobbled. . .
review/text: I have fed Canidae All Life Stages food for several years to my mixed dog collection, with great results, but for some reason, had not offered the Snap Biscuits.  Finally, I purchased a bag and offered them up.  Well, they must taste treat-like because they gobble them up, and have evidenced no digestive upsets.  Safe and tasty is the verdict.  My test group is aged two years through 10 years, size eight to twenty-five pounds, in generally good health.

review/summary: Great Value, A Little Broken Up
review/text: I was looking for a bulk price bargain on my preferred premium dog biscuit for my two Vizslas & this definitely met that criteria. Canidae's Snap Biscuits always have some bits and pieces in the bottom of the bag, which is understandable since the biscuit is a snap variety. I was afraid the larger quantity might mean more waste & I was right. There were three (3) plastic 4# bags in a large single cardboard box to comprise the 12#, so they must shuffle a bit & in the end the amount of tiny bits & powdery crumbs in the bottom of each bag was a significant amount of waste. Though I'm sure I could use the wasted crumbs in their food bowl, I am very careful to watch their food intake at meal time.<br /><br />I love the nutrition & quality of Canidae's Lamb & Brown Rice Snap Biscuits, but I will likely stick with the single 4# units in the future, which are packed in individual bags.

review/summary: Dog did not like them
review/text: I decided to try these treats because the reviews were so good and the price was great. That and the fact it is such a well known brand I had high expectations.  I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that I thought would love them, however he rates it a 2 star. I was hoping he would be a little more excited about them. They are a larger treat so I break them up into smaller pieces. They also have good things in them.  Most of the time he will eat the treat. Others times he will take it and then drop it in the living room and come back to it later. I will not be getting them again.

review/summary: Delicious, but a tad sweet for me.
review/text: This is really a great tasting cereal.  The Apple and Acai combine for a strong fruity taste to go along with the crunchy, granular texture of the granola that you're probably familiar with. It's a big sweeter than I would prefer for daily consumption, so I don't eat it everyday.<br /><br />Being granola, this is a fairly dense food so while 11.5oz might seem like a decent amount of cereal, the box is actually pretty small.  I get about three bowls of cereal out of a box, though granted I like a larger breakfast.  Compared to other cereals, it's a tax expensive, but I don't mind (it's $3.30/box at my local Kroger).  I use it as an occasional "treat" in the morning for when I don't feel like eating oatmeal.

review/text: This tea is not bad, it has a subtle flavor of black tea.  Maybe I got a bag where they forgot to put in the Bergamot, but there is none of the unique citrous Bergamot flavor one expects with an Earl Grey tea - or if there is it is too subtle to taste. This is not a Bergamoty Earl Grey tea. I would recommend Davidson's over this one.

review/summary: Mmm Good - a review of Mi-Del's Ginger Snaps
review/text: I am the sort of mom who likes to bake my own cookies because 1) it's fun, and 2) I like to know what goes into them.  However, when that is not practical I buy these ginger snap cookies.<br /><br />I don't mind giving them to my family because they are mostly organic (70%) and they don't contain hydrogenated oils nor corn syrup.  In addition, they contain iron - from the molasses - which is  something you don't often find in a snack.<br /><br />Four Stars.  A superior product in my opinion.  The whole family loves them.  Even my extremely picky son.  The flavor is zingy with a definite bite and each cookie is only 26 calories.  One of the few store-bought treats that I have no problem handing out to the children.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/text: My wife and I prefer them just a bit stale - leave them open for a day or so to get just the right amount of chew.  If you don't, they're very, very crisp (but still very good).  Snappy, even.  :)<br /><br />I'll also agree with the comment that they can be inconsistent from one bag to the next, but even when they're off, they're pretty good.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, one person's spicy is another person's bland.  For my family, they're just the right amount of hot after a few cookies.

review/summary: All Natural Ginger Snaps
review/text: When Whole Foods stopped stocking my favorite ginger snaps, I decided to get a 12-pack from Amazon instead of settling for the "365" brand, which had sugar as an ingredient, giving it a sandy texture in my mouth.  Mi-Del is the real deal and are great with coffee.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic dehydrated cane juice, canola oil, unsulphured molasses, ginger, baking soda, sea salt, soy lecithin (used as an emulsifier).  Product of Canada.<br /><br />Update:  I placed my order about 6-months ago and finally worked my way through the 12-pack.  They are not as fresh tasting now, of course but they still go great with my coffee and I consider them a healthy snack.  My sister thought they were too spicy but I love that ginger spice and just placed another order.

review/summary: Good cookies!
review/text: These cookies have a clean, crispy chocolate taste -- without the chemical-laced aftertaste of other commercially produced cookies. They are all-natural and made with canola oil, as opposed to the oils that can add to cholesterol problems. The ingredients are mostly organic and they are sweetened with dehydrated can juice, as opposed to the less-healthy commercial alternatives.<br /><br />Now, for the problem: I have never found these cookies in a market near me, and we have only purchased them through Amazon. Because these wonderful cookies are not pumped-up with weird chemical preservatives, the necessity of purchasing them in such big lots means that you are going to be eating a lot of cookies in a short period of time, or going in with a friend on sharing the case! However, given the high quality of this product, you should have no problem splitting up the order.<br /><br />Yummy and highly recommended!

review/summary: Crunchy Little Cookie - Delicious
review/text: My order for Mi-Del Ginger Snaps arrived a few hours ago and I tried my first one ... okay, I'm on my 10th cookie now.  My first bite of one I noticed it had a hard crunch.  I like crunchy cookies, others may not.  I read here that you can leave the top opened on the bag overnight to soften them.  The cookie is about 3-4 bites worth.  On my first bite I could feel a little tongue tingle.  Each subsequent bite produced the same warm tingle and THAT is what puts this ginger snap in a class of its own, never losing that 'bite'.  It's not too overdone or underdone on the spice, it's a perfect little cookie.  Not to mention they are 26 calories each, and ingredient that are pronounceable, this makes for an excellent little treat with coffee, tea, or vanilla ice cream.  Excellent product that I will purchase again.<br /><br />Note: Expiration date on the bags are December 17th, 2010 but I don't think they will last that long.<br /><br />--Sailor Hill, CA

review/summary: Well worth the money
review/text: I originally bought the Mi-Del cookies at a local odd-lots store over a year ago. I felt a sense of loss after the store stopped carrying them, since no other local grocer stocked them. So I was glad to see that they were available, albeit in bulk quantities only, via Amazon. I love these cookies, and best of all, they're about as healthy as you can find anywhere. I have to watch my intake of saturated fats, and per 5-cookie serving, the Mi-Del snaps have zero grams of sat-fat. They're delicious, with a nice, somewhat subdued chocolate flavor and a crunchy snap. I keep them in the fridge and they maintain their freshness for MONTHS. Twelve packages may seem like a lot, but I look forward to devouring every one of them. I've also tried the vanilla and lemon snaps, and they're equally outstanding.

review/text: This cookie stands up very well to dunking in milk (about three dunked bites per cookie), and with mostly organic ingredients is about as guilt-free as possible in a cookie. We like a crisp ginger snap, and while the bag isn't self-sealing it seals well if you have a clip. We find the ginger level to be just right -- not overpowering, but definitely there.<br /><br />One correction to the ingredient list posted on this site -- there's no grape juice concentrate in the cookie, according to the bag I'm looking at right now and the Mi-Del website.<br /><br />Per serving size of 5 cookies: Calories 140; Total Fat 4g; Carbs 22g; Fiber 1g; Sugars 11g.

review/summary: So good people are taking them from me!
review/text: These cookies seemed to be a pretty good deal when I saw that there was a special offer on them. I LOVE cookies (who doesnt??) but am kinda picky about texture. I dislike soft mushy cookies although if desperate...but I know that "snap" cookies are usually not soft so I took a chance and ordered a case!  I live alone so a case of cookies was, at once, both frightening and decadent---but I think I am going to have to order another case!  Everyone who tasted these asked me "so where did you find these?"  Of course, since I am the online shopper from hell, everyone figured I found some obscure website and paid a fortune. "Natural" and "Organic" are buzz words for "gonna cost ya more" but the price was great per bag. After I told my friends and family who tasted them that I ordered a case---the bags started disappearing pretty fast! I got hit with guilt---What are YOU going to do with 12 bags of cookies? (duh--eat them!) and everyone was very happy to lighten up my stash by taking a bag so I dont overeat! Dont I have the BEST friends and family??? LOL  Seriously--I was happy to hand them over! I enjoy turning people on to new finds. I gave a bag to my Parcel Post guy and my UPS guy (after all--they lug all the boxes to my apartment!) and they were happy! And there is a method to my giving-away madness (especially to the carriers)! Less dropping and throwing around of MY boxes!<br /><br />Ok--they are nice and lemoney (?) but they could even be a bit more lemon-like for me! They are made with more healthful ingredients (no trans-fat) so even though I am pigging out on cookies--I dont feel nearly as guilty! And at less than $2 a bag--I think they are a greal deal! Plus it never hurts to have extra cookies in the house because a cookie emergency can happen at any given moment!  So--order them!  I think you will be pleased!

review/summary: Classic Great Cookies
review/text: These are healthful, smallish (about the size of vanilla wafers), tasty and flavorful snappy cookies.  They are sweet but not overly so and have a bit of that molasses taste that ginger snaps are known for.  They have a really nice ginger bite too.  They are great to have with some tea, milk or even coffee.

review/summary: Best ginger snaps
review/text: Look, I love ginger. Ginger ale/beer, pickled ginger at sushi restaurants, ginger salad dressings... and I love ginger cookies. I have tried who knows how many other brands of ginger snaps and _none_ are as good as these. Mi-Del ginger snaps are the MOST gingery. Spicy. I love how snappy they are.<br />If you are really a fan of ginger, real spicy ginger, then these cookies are for you.

review/text: Mi-Del Swedish style ginger snaps are delicious and nutritious!  They are made with organic flour and ginger, and are great with any meal- especially with coffee or tea.  It is not easy to find these treats in a market- and ordering from Amazon is quick, easy, and cost effective.  They arrived promptly, without one broken ginger snap. Thanks, Amazon!

review/text: I bought these cause I'm a chocolate snap lover, and I had been craving some. The lack of trans fats and description drew me in.<br /><br />Let's just say this: I took these over to a family party, and none of the kids liked it. NOT ONE. And most of the adults, the best they could say was, 'Eh.' I think two folks had more than one.<br /><br />I'd have to say skip these cookies. They don't make your mouth sing with chocolatey snappy joy.

review/text: I absolutely love the Mi-Del ginger snaps, so I thought I'd try these in vanilla, thinking they'd be just as tasty.  Unfortunately, they didn't have the vanilla flavor I'd hoped for, and I wasn't crazy about their consistency.  They almost seemed stale, although I'm sure that's not the case.  As I actually prefer the name brand vanilla snaps, I gave these away to my local food pantry.

review/summary: disappointing taste
review/text: I like the fact that the Mi-Del cookies are low-fat and use some organic ingredients.  I love the Mi-Del lemon and vanilla flavors, and their ginger snaps are ok -- BUT these chocolate snaps are no good.  I'm a chocolate lover, so this is rather disappointing.  The taste is similar to the ginger snap, but it's off quite a bit - slightly bitter.  It's as if they didn't put enough sugar in these snaps to counter the bitterness of cocoa powder. It also has a poor aftertaste that's slightly bitter (the lemon snap aftertaste is awesome keeps me wanting more).<br /><br />Gotta give it 1 star - yeah, I ate 10 of these to give them a chance, but I threw away the rest of the bag. The crunch and texture is the same as the other Mi-Del Snaps, but the flavor is off.  Not Recommended.

review/summary: Still looking for the right on the run food
review/text: I thought I would give these jelly beans a try after seeing numerous ads in my running/health magazines.  I thought, hey I love jelly beans why not give it a go.  I have used cliff shots, GU, power bars, almost every kind of endurance treats out there.  This was my latest trial.  They were not the best but they were not terrible.  I did notice a bit of a late run boost, but the taste is medicore at best.  I thought I was trying to swallow vitamins.  If taken without water beware of a gagging sensation.  However, I have a very sensitive stomach and low tolerance when I am distance running, so that might be the reason.  If you think they will taste like jelly beans beware, they do not.  I would just stick to the old reliable jelly belly jelly beans if you are looking for a tasty on the go treat.

review/text: I loved eating this soup growing up in CA.  I haven't lived in CA for many years and had not seen this soup in Colorado, until recently. Unfortunately, the store I found it at only carried it for a short time.  Thank Goodness for Amazon!  Found it on Amazon no problem and ordered 2 cases!  This soup may not be for everyone but my teenage daughters who had never eaten it before tried it recently, reluctantly and they both loved it! This soup is low calorie, no fat, high protein and filling. No wonder my health nut 70's mom loved this stuff! Pretty close to perfect I'd say!

review/summary: NO CONTEST; BEST PEA SOUP IN THE WORLD!!!!
review/text: When I lived in Los Angeles I used to travel up to Buellton with a friend of mine and we always stopped at Andersen's for their fabulous food and of course, the pea soup for which they are deservedly famous. It is just like going to a friend's house who prepares home cooked food superbly (or has a private chef); it has a flavor like no other pea soup and I could tell it from all others blindfolded, it is fresh, subtle, wonderfully lacking in processed taste and is positively addicting. You need add nothing to it, no seasoning, no water no milk, etc, it stands on its own and very well without any supporting cast. I went with my Mom once and she raved about it too and she was very picky. Now it is available to buy and I am in Heaven just waiting for it to arrive.<br />You are in for a real treat if you have never had it it is satisfying and rich and will keep you full and happy for a long time; the 15 oz size means you can get 2 meals out of it if you live alone like me; if you have more people of course it won't last as long, but when you buy it by the case, you can plan on buying it regularly as it will be in high demand.<br /> Bon appetit!

review/text: The gum is a nice ice mint (almost like the black Dentyne Ice flavor) flavor, however, after only about 5-10 minutes, it has lost the majority of the flavor, and the gum becomes somewhat gritty.  For those used to caffeine, this gum is not a great source of energy.  It is, however, a good starter for those who do not commonly ingest caffeine.  Being mildly sensitive to caffeine myself, I found the buzz from a single piece (40 mg of caffeine) to be the perfect amount.

This tea has a mile sweet taste, not to overbearing. It is made with white tea which has the least amount of fluoride in it of all the teas since white tea leaves are the youngest of the tea leaf plant, which is something that green or black tea leaves are not. (Just something extra to think about when you are drinking green tea, lots of fluoride, black tea is the worst for you!). Get it you won't be sorry.

review/text: In the search for a reasonably healthy way to get a *mild* caffeine kick in the morning, this is by far the best I've found. 85 calories and 30mg of caffeine. Coffee may give you fewer calories but for me it has way too much caffeine. Soda is too caloric and I'm not a fan of the carbonation. This stuff fits the nutrition parameters I've been looking for and tastes pretty good too. Another thing I like is that it doesn't taste so great that I want to down 10 bottles in a morning. I usually open one up at 8am and finish it around 10:30am.<br /><br />So far this (amazon) is the only place I've been able to find it in bulk.  At ~$1.50 a bottle (and 1 bottle per day), it's more expensive than I'd like it to be, but that is about the only knock I can give this drink.

This time, the box was torn open and the bottles were rolling around loose inside.<br /><br />Amazon: you need to do a better job here!

review/summary: I use it to make a face mask
review/text: I do not use this spice to cook. I use it to make a face mask due to the antioxidants, along with chick pea flour and almond oil and bit of milk. It does wonders for the skin. I have combination skin and this helps with breakouts and oil control. I use it weekly and since i've began using it gives my skin a youthful glow and elasticity. I recommend you try it.

review/text: I ordered the turmeric because I was tired of paying a big price for a tiny container.  This product is a great value for the size and the money spent!
