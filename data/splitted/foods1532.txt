review/summary: Cats love this product, although very watery
review/text: If you're used to purchasing cat food that comes out of the tin all in one hunk just like cranberry sauce, this product will take some getting used to. This cat food is very liquidy, and it even says on the package that you can simply pour it right out of the cup into your cat's dish. My first reaction was that this cat food must just be watered down, but after looking at the ingredients it didn't seem any more watery than other canned cat foods. And, more importantly, my cats just adored this food, much more so than any other canned cat food they've had (I like them to try different kinds).<br /><br />The cups or pouches of cat food have a non-metallic lid that peels back. I thought the cups were kind of small, so I would empty two cups at a time into the cat dish and the food would just disappear in no time.

review/summary: My cats totally love this!
review/text: I feed my three cats once or twice a day with Market Select. While the prices on here are about 4 dollars more expensive, they ACTUALLY carry it. Most of the stores around here can't keep it in stock, it is that popular. One of my acts, who was almost sickly and tiny when we got him, has now grown bigger than a small dog. And he DEMANDS his Meow Mix.

review/summary: Great Product Great price on Amazon
review/text: Meow Mix wet food is great.  My cats get this as a treat once a night and they know it, so they start begging for it by 7pm or so.  There are some nice flavors, and the packaging is easier than the metal can stuff.  Also, this is not clumpy.  It looks like what gourmet cat food would look like if there was a such thing.<br /><br />The price on Amazon cannot be beat.  Individually these sell for 75 cents per cup.  If you buy a 12 pack in a supermarket by me it's $7.99.  It would cost $32 for 4 packages of 12 by me, but it's only $23 here on Amazon.  It's a great deal, especially with the free super saver shipping.<br /><br />The reason it gets only 4 stars instead of 5 is because maybe once or twice per case of 12 I find a sliver of a bone in the food.  I thoroughly look for them, just so my cats won't even have a chance to swallow them....but even if I miss it, it ends up on the plate as they know not to eat it.  I guess because it's animal food, the packaging is not as thoroughly checked...but my cats adore it, so I'm ok with checking for bones because the food makes them happy.

review/summary: Makes my cat vomit
review/text: Most of the time when I give this product to my cat she ends up vomiting it back up.  I asked my vet and she said that several of her patients have experience the same result.  I tried asking on the Internet if others had the same experience and was shocked by the number who said their cats responded the same.  I put the cat on a different product and she stopped her vomiting....  I would suggest that anyone using this product with poor results try a different cat food.  I filed a complain with the Federal Government.

review/summary: A great-tasting product...
review/text: I was encouraged to try this for at least two reasons: we live in an earthquake-prone area and I wanted it for our disaster supply kit. The other reason was for my convenience because we drink our fair share of coffee and cocoa (hot chocolate) and want to have a great-tasting cream available all the time. This product fits the bill on both accounts. I am also going to try the Nido full cream powder and also the Willpowder dried cream (low-carb diet). But you can't go wrong with Peak powdered milk with cream, it is delicious! ADDITIONAL REMARKS/UPDATE: I haven't yet ordered the Nido, it seems expensive. Having compared both WILLPOWDER and PEAK products, PEAK wins! Willpowder is OK but it has a strong aftertaste and consistency that got to us. Keep in mind that if you're on a low-carb diet, Willpowder is cream with zero carbs and Peak is powdered whole milk so it has carbs.

review/summary: Yes to yogurt
review/text: Ordered this with some trepidation, as the only other powdered whole milk we've tried was pretty bad, sort of rancid smelling, and ruined two batches of yogurt to which it had been added. (The second time I used less, but it really didn't help,) The Peak, however, is wonderful. Smells a bit like ice cream in the can, and thickens the yogurt perfectly. No off-taste. I'm a happy camper. May even try making yogurt with this milk alone.

review/text: I'm sure this stuff tastes fine, based on other reviewers, but my mistake was in assuming this came in a #10 can like other powdered milk products I've purchased in the past. 400gms in the can and 17 servings per container works out to $1 US dollar for a 14oz glass of milk.<br /><br />Do the math!!...Crown Royal & Coke is cheaper than that for a tasty adult beverage.<br /><br />Couldn't believe it when the smallish package arrived for my 4 cans, and they are as big as the smallest coffee cans you see at the grocery stores. Oughta return it, but too much hassle. Live and learn<br /><br />I realize this is a European (Holland) company, but you'd think Amazon would show actual US measure - size of the container...and info on # of servings this item will provide.<br /><br />Fool me once....

I brewed my cup of coffee and sprinkled in the milk powder, stirred it with a spoon and it was good to go.  Just FYI-  the can is 14.1 oz.  Don't expect a huge can!  It's about the size of the 1 pound can of coffee in the grocery store (you receive 2 cans in your order).

review/text: A very good everyday tea for those who like strong tea, and Assam in particular, great with milk and sugar, morning and afternoon. Not overly malty or pungent, and not that distinct or subtle, though it can be brewed long and strong without going bitter. You can buy higher-grade Assams, but you'll have to spend twice or more. I've not found a better Assam this price range.

review/text: My cat eats a 2.1 ounce bag in a couple days, and this can really add up in price.  Buying off Amazon is the best value - It comes in a box that makes storage simple; I don't have to worry about bags getting smashed.  I save about 20% buying cat treats online, and I just purchase whichever flavor is the cheapest at the time - They tend to circulate prices amongst the flavors... One goes up; another goes down.<br /><br />The seafood flavored Party Mix is some of her favorite.  She's a seafood fiend.  I also like that these are crunchy and seem to keep her teeth clean.  They're also lower in sugar than Temptations, if you have a diabetic or chubby kitty.  I've been buying my pet treats like this for six months, and will continue to do so at this great value.

review/summary: The cats love them
review/text: I like to have a few treats on hand for my 2 cats. These were a good price, and I have twice bought the multipack of Beachside Crunch, since they tend to prefer fishy flavors. I would try the other flavors if they came in a mixed multipack, in case they didn't like the other flavors. They love these (they like most 'treats' actually) and come running, as they hear the packet opening, or if I shake the bag. They are also a good way to sneakily apply their flea medicine to the back of their necks without them realizing it. They have a sixth sense about this and make themselves scarce whenever I even think about doing this. However, they also have outsmarted me when I tried to fool them into scarfing up some of their regular dry (Friskies) cat food that I spilled on the floor when filling their bowls and thought I would try and get them to eat it straight off the floor. They ignored it, so I thought I would sprinkle a few treats among it to make them think they were getting a big treat. They came running, but managed to pick out and scarf up only the treats from among the other pieces. No problem eating treats off the floor, but regular food no way!

review/text: Like many of the other reviewers have said, my cat "Vie"(French for life),will come from anywhere in the house or wake up from a deep sleep for these treats. Beachside Crunch is the first flavor she has tried. I live in an old, loft, condo. One evening I shook the bag of Friskies treats and she was sailing through the air from the level above and landed on the sofa! She, apparently, had been sleeping on the ledge outside of the railing over the landing of the stairs. I am more careful now and so is she. She is only about 8 months old. I am a travel nurse and these will be perfect to take with me as she adjusts to my traveling schedule. I looked online and could not see anywhere that they are made in China. Some pets have died from treats made in China in the last few months.

review/summary: Cats love `em but price drop irks me
review/text: First, I must rant about the price I paid. I subscribed to these for the additional 15% off and the day they shipped the price dropped 5 bucks. That may not sound like much but it's a 25% price drop to where the original price is even less than the subscribe price. This isn't the only item this has happened to me in the past few weeks... so end of rant.<br /><br />My cats love these and I have several so giving some to one is impossible because they come running when they hear the bag open. Also, the first ingredient isn't corn but that just leads me to another rant about cat food in general.<br /><br />We were once using Purina One exclusively until the contents started dropping in weight, the price started going up and the formula changed. Our cats like the salmon but now the first ingredient is corn meal. We've switched to some others for variety but they are also problematic in price, volume and formula. We'll stay with these treats until the bag gets smaller, the price increases and/or the formula changes and it's probably pretty much a guarantee that all three will soon happen based on how the bag food has changed recently. anyway, even paying the higher price of about nineteen bucks for the 7 pack it's still about half what the food and pet stores are charging for the same total in ounces in the smaller bags. I can't buy these larger bags locally.

review/summary: The Great Dane Standard
review/text: We have fed Holistic Select for 5yrs now - from the time our Great Danes were puppies.  Most Great Danes I see are either a little thin or a little heavy.  Ours are just right - filled out in the right places with a terrific waistline.<br /><br />We feed our Danes from 5-7 cups of food each per day, combined with a 1/2 can each of Holistic Select canned food.  This combination adds moisture content to their meals which reduces the amount of water they need to consume with their meals and helps to keep away the dreaded bloat.<br /><br />Holistic Select helps promote joint health with Glucosamine and Chondrotin, as well as keep their coats shiny.  If you check the Whole Dog Journal (the discerning dog owners resource for dog food ratings, Holistic Select makes their list).  I would recommend this food to any dog owner - which version you use depends on your dog.  If you have a Great Dane or Large Breed dog, I would recommend no other food.  If you are going to switch your dog's food, do it gradually over a couple of weeks and try using Holistic Select Transition powder which will help your dog maintain a balanced intestinal tract during the food transition.

review/summary: EXCELLENT CHOICE
review/text: My year old Airedale has moved on from her Holistic Select Large Breed Puppy food to this adult food.  She loves the food, and it has provided her with the proper nutrition and seems to be easily digestable for her.  This brand was recommended by our vet, who explained the ingredient list, and what we did and did not want to see.  Our girl has a lot of energy, is happy, has a beautiful coat, and has blossomed from the 9 week old puppy we brought home into a beautiful one year old.  Purchasing from Amazon is so easy...  for the same price I have the food delivered right to my door.... how convenient!

review/summary: well worth the $
review/text: I started my English Lab puppy on the Holistic Select Puppy chow for large and giant breed dogs per the advice of the breeder, and now that she turned 1 we are on the Holistic Select Adult chow.  She loves it, I feed her 2.5 cups twice a day, and she eats it like a starving child.  Her coat is soft and shiny, and her teeth are white.  Not to mention her breath is free of odor.  Her stool is consistent, and her muscles are defined.  Very very happy with this product, and I will continue to use it for her and any future dogs that I might get.  I used to get this at Petco, but found it on Amazon.. Free delivery + no tax, noooooo duuuuuuh!!

review/summary: This dogfood is great!
review/text: I have an English Mastiff (actually adopted as a six week old puppy from a shelter, long story with a happy ending!). I started her on Holistic Select's Large Breed Puppy food when I first got her, because a number of breeders recommended it. She is the healthiest dog you have ever met!! She is now two and a half years old and we have had no health issues at all. The other wonderful thing about her is, although mastiff's have a reputation for being couch potatoes, she is a running fool!! I believe the Holistic Select food got her off to a good start and has continued to provide her with the excellent nutrition she needs to keep that very big body moving. We do add a dollop of no fat plain yogurt to her food to help with gas (mastiffs tend to have problems with that!) Other than that, the only other thing she gets to eat are Milk Bones for treats to reward good behavior. I really do believe that, although the food is a bit expensive, it has saved us in veterinarian bills. Buying it on Amazon makes it a little less expensive and much more convenient since we live in a rural county.

review/text: Fed this to our weimaraner and she did great with it, lived over 12 years.  Recently rescued a Great Dane, and she loves, loves, loves this food!  She was eating Royal Canin Giant Breed dry when we got her.... mixed in a little of the Holistic Select with the Royal Canin in order to ease her into the new food.... all I can say is that I wasted $50 on a bag of Royal Canin because she picks the Holistic Select pieces out of her bowl and leaves the Royal Canin behind!  She is a picky eater, so am very happy she is happy with Holistic Select.

review/summary: Spitz are the best seeds - it's a fact.  But....
review/text: I (we, I'm conveying sentiment for myself and a couple buds) have been eating sunflower seeds for many years.  Like everyone, we consumed "D*" brand (another D* slayed a giant some millenia ago..).  Anyway - we ate 'em, we loved 'em I guess.  Then, I think because we ran out and some mini-mart we found didn't have any in-stock, we tried another brand - Frito Lay as I recall. Hmmm..  These were - better.  Wow.  Fresher tasting, not so salty that your mouth and lips were pickled within the hour.  Wow.  Then we discovered "Jumbo" size, and - hey, this was kind'a cool.  More seed per shell-cracking.  Then, we discovered another brand "BIGS".  Wow, these were jumbo, and they were usually fresher, _and_ they came in different flavors, etc..  We discovered that quality/freshness varied, sometimes widely.  Probably depended on where we got them, but sometimes it was just a "bad batch".<br /><br />Lastly - we discovered "Spitz'".  Large, very uniform seeds (comparatively), come in variety of seasonings as well as plain/original "Salted", which are my favorite overall, though I enjoy some variety once in a while.  They use OLIVE OIL!  You can taste it.  It is heavenly (if you find a buttery-olive-oily, just slightly salty, almost popcorn but better, SF seed to be heavenly).  And yes, just satisfyingly salted, without the salt-curing of your mouth parts).  Several times I have been seed-less, and jones'ing bad, and gone to a store to find ONLY "D*" brand.  And I have learned to just walk out.  The let-down of "tiny, shriveled, often empty, often burned or actually (honest) bug-parts, and so salty it leaves your mouth numb for awhile" is enormous.  I can't even eat them anymore.  BIGS are still good usually, Frito-Lay taste great but they're still tiny-little seeds for the most part.  Spitz' -- they're consistent and tasty.<br /><br />BUT ----  I recently purchased two of these 5-bag packs.  Of these, two bags were actually STALE.  I am talking a just kind of unpleasant, warehouse-dust smell and taste mingled with the memory of how they're supposed to taste.  The DATES were all fine, sometime in 2012.  I don't have an explanation for it.  It's possible I guess that the bags had very small holes or something, and I might have them around to check that.  Bottom-line is that I got 8 bags of great Spitz seeds for the price (their price, which was reasonable) of 10 bags.  So, that's a bummer.  Also, when I discovered these two stale bags, I guess enough time had passed that there was no easy place to contact the seller (Amazon, usually very good at this) and convey a little disappointment.  Anyway -<br /><br />This is a great product.  Clearly we like them.  BUT - if you buy one of these 5-bag packages, you might find that they're not all as fresh tasting as you might like.  At least from this "provided by Amazon" seller.  I also got a 5-pack of "Seasoned" flavor, and all five were fine in our experience.  I might buy the 12-pack of 6oz bags, in hopes that they sell more of them, and hopefully they're not sitting around for any duration in someone's warehouse.

review/summary: Not too salty, nice big meaty seed!
review/text: I've said it before on another review: Spitz seeds = best on market.  Tried lots, Spitz wins.  The salted version isn't the best of their make, but what it has over the other makers (besides a nice big seed, not a tiny shriveled up kernel) is that the salt isn't over powering, so your mouth starts to hurt.  Its just enough salt to allow you to eat them all day.  :)

review/summary: The best sunflower seeds
review/text: I love sunflower seeds.  Unfortunately all the American ones come heavily salted which leaves your mouth pickled after an hour or two.  Thanks to our northern neighbors, I can chew these lightly salted seeds all day.  I've been loving these for the past decade.  Of the various flavors, salted is my favorite.  Be wary of the other flavors as sugar has been mixed in with some.  Liked the dill pickle, pepper, and seasoned flavors.<br /><br />If I recall correctly, Spitz was bought out by one of the larger snack distributors.  Thank goodness the salt content didn't change.  Would love to get them in kilo size, but five 16oz bags should last me a couple of months... maybe.  ;)

review/summary: A decently priced option for those on a gluten-free diet
review/text: I just read the above negative review of this product and was a bit shocked. This product isn't the absolute best gluten-free soy sauce available. I think San-J low sodium tamari (wheat-free) has that distinction, but it also has a very high price tag. For the price, this is a good gluten-free portable sauce to take to your favorite sushi restaurant or while traveling. It is better than the La Choy option that some frugal gluten-free folks use, and I have used it in cooking while on the road with kitchen facilities. I love the case option as it allows me to place an order and have some around forever. I keep some in my purse and some in the car so I never have to go without if I unexpectedly stop at a sushi restaurant.

review/text: I bought this popcorn a few months ago off of Amazon and decided to come back here and leave a review to warn people that like cheese popcorn not to buy this.  I was a big fan of the Orville Redenbacher Pour Over Cheddar popcorn but since that has been discontinued, I figured I would try this Jolly Time cheese popcorn.  Big mistake, it is nothing like the discontinued Redenbacher kind.  There is not even a good cheese flavor, it's just horrible.  The bad thing is when you buy this you get 36 bags of popcorn, so if you don't like it you're stuck with a ton of bags.<br /><br />If you really want to try this stuff, I would suggest buying a small box from a grocery store to try it first, and then if you like it, come back on here and buy this lot of 36 bags.<br /><br />I give this popcorn 2 stars out of 5 since it's at least edible.....barely.

We think adding your own cheese flavor, or getting the "pour-over" cheese popcorns like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007SNZL6">Orville Redenbacher's</a>, will give you more actual cheddar flavor than this popcorn will... because we wanted uber-cheese and we did not find it here.

I don't know if all Jolly Time micro popcorn has this great texture, but I've ordered Big Cheez a number of times and am never disappointed in its quality.

Unlike some other brands I tried with minimal cheddar cheeze taste, the cheddar cheeze taste of the Jolly Time popcorn is strong - so much so, as to be perhaps too strong! And also unlike another brand I tried, the taste is "baked in" with no need for a messy pourover insert.<br /><br />Overall, the product is very good and well worth the cost.

review/summary: The only cheese popcorn worth eatting
review/text: My husband and I are popcorn junkies. But we are elitist popcorn junkies. Not just any kind will do, and to be honest, we don't eat it every day or even every week. When we do eat it, it has to be Jolly Time.  They make the best flavored popcorns on the market, and if you like specialty flavors, it is virtually impossible to find any. My grocers all have a section devoted to popcorn.  You can find every buttered popcorn that exists and every low fat popcorn that exists, but if you have a yen and a yearning for something different, you have nothing. In desperation we searched for The Big Cheez everywhere in the metro area and our suburbs, and found nothing. Luckily, Amazon does carry it.  We are working on our first case, and just sent a case to a pregnant friend who craves cheese popcorn, and specifically The Big Cheez.  A word of caution: using the popcorn setting on your microwave will lead to frustration, cussing, and disaster, unless you are very lucky.  Nothing smells worse than burnt popcorn. It lingers like death, but isn't nearly as pleasant. I believe the magic number on our downstairs microwave is under two minutes. The one upstairs is just over two minutes.  The trick is to listen, because when the popping noises slow down, you want to stop the cooking process, or it will burn, and it burns quickly. It also helps to have a squeaky clean microwave.  This is the best cheese popcorn on the market, and one of the only ones, sadly.  If you like cheese, this is the popcorn for you. I can also highly recommend the Spicy Salsa, which my husband inhales, and which I avoid, since spice doesn't like me any more.

There is also almost no cheese taste and it has kind of a bad after taste too.  After eating about 1/8 of a bag I just couldn't eat anymore.  I dumped the rest into the dog's dish because she eats anything, even veggies.  She wolfed down several bites but then refused to eat anymore of it and I had to throw the rest out.  I think I'll leave the remaining bags by the microwave at work and donate the unopened boxes to a food shelf.  Avoid this stuff at all costs!

review/summary: Worst popcorn I have ever eaten!
review/text: I am a popcorn aficionado.  I normally only buy Redenbacher, but tried this stuff since I had a coupon.  It was terrible!  Does not taste like cheese at all.  Tastes like someone took dirt and garlic powder, burned it with a blowtorch, and sprinkled it on the popcorn.  Also, this product is a dark orange-brown color which looks awful.  It smells, tastes, and looks nasty.  Do not buy this stuff!

review/summary: Organic, non-GMO & delicious butter with a high smoke point!
review/text: This was the first Ghee or clarified butter I'd ever tried, to my knowledge, and I have to say it's the most amazing stuff to cook with. I saute a large batch fresh organic vegetables in it every week, using my large cast iron skillet, and the flavor it imparts is stupendous! Just a touch of celtic sea salt and a few tablespoons of this make the veggies something my whole family craves.<br /><br />Bonus: it's a healthy oil for us! You can also use some on a spoon as a chaser to fermented cod liver oil to get the maximum benefits. Look up the work of Weston A. Price for more information on that preventative, but even if you don't, you'll absolutely love this for cooking and in recipes.<br /><br />I also LOVE that it doesn't have to be refrigerated, so it sits in the cabinet, happily, with the salt and olive oil, not taking up precious refrigerator space.<br /><br />It's delicious, and it's NON-GMO!! In this day & age, where so much GMO corn, soy, canola & other foods are genetically modified, and I'm trying to outrun them, this is such a relief to find. No hormones, no antibiotics & no GMOS!<br /><br />Fantastic!

review/text: I have tried a number of Ghee brands, and hands-down this is my favorite.  It tastes just like you melted your own butter and removed the froth from the top.  Luscious.  I use it to make eggs, and to saute vegetables.  It has never burned or oxidized during even very high heat browning.  Another benefit is that the makers only use grass-fed cows to make this ghee.  I'm totally hooked.

review/summary: sweet, creamy, buttery flavor. Excellent product.
review/text: This is the second brand of ghee that I have tried and I like this one far and away above the other one (Nanak Pure Desi Ghee). This one doesn't separate and has a smooth creamy consistency, whileas the other one is more gritty and the flavor is not nice just straight out of the jar. Purity Farm has me eating it straight out of the jar and it smells just heavenly.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this product and would definitely buy it again. I especially like that it is casein-free as I have a dairy intolerance so even the small amounts of milk protein in regular butter might be an issue, but with this ghee I don't have to worry about it.<br /><br />*update* It is now a few months since I started ordering this and I have started ordering two jars at a time to make sure that I'm never without. I have confirmed that regular butter DOES cause me issues but ghee is perfectly fine due to being casein-free. I read that ghee is also an ayurvedic remedy for many things and is supposed to be healing for leaky-gut syndrome.<br /><br />I also have to say that it makes a FANTASTIC moisturizer for the face! I have ultra ultra sensitive skin that just cannot handle the slightest amount of chemicals on it. I thought to myself one day to try ghee as a facial moisturizer as I desperately needed it. I put it on, thinking that I might get red from it or break out as I have from every other moisturizer attempt and... no reaction! Best of all, my dry, scaly patch on my face is now soft and smooth after only two applications! I've had that scaly patch for months! I am so excited about this find since most of the time I cannot do any topicals at all, but my skin just loved the ghee and drank it up. A little goes a long way, so if you do this, a pea-sized amount is plenty for a large area. Rub in gently but if your skin is dry it will soak up quickly leaving you feeling soft but not oily if you put on just a little bit at a time. You can always put more as needed, so don't overdo at the beginning.

review/text: I ordered this last week and have been using it and just enjoying it tremendously. I got tired of the quick-browining/burn of butter (since I stopped using fake butters and switched back to real butter). I decided to try this and I like it a lot. It smells so nice. A fresh smell. It tastes excellent. It cooks beautifully. Very, very pleased. I had refrigerated ghee I'd tried in the past (not as good as this one) years ago, but I think I'll keep this in the cupboard, cause I like it all smooth and easy to get out of the jar.<br /><br />I recommend this brand. Lovely.

review/summary: Amazing Ghee!
review/text: This ghee is wonderful. I now use it as my primary cooking oil. Being grassfed means this ghee is extremely nutritious and flavorful. The fat stands up wonderfully to high cooking temperatures meaning you won't get smoked out as easily and the resulting fat is not burned and rancid with the related health effects. I was elated to see a high quality grass fed ghee at a great price here.<br /><br />I have also tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032RPLSY">Grassfed Organic Ghee 7.8 Oz</a> by Pure Indian Foods. This is the other grassfed ghee I know of on Amazon. That ghee is also very good and has a slightly nuttier buttier smell in contrast to Purity's sweeter almost caramel smell. At almost half the price, though, Purity blows that brand away. If you are deciding on a grassfed ghee there is no comparison, Purity is the way to go.<br /><br />Amazon, please please please make this a Prime eligible item with Subscribe & Save!!

review/summary: I love this stuff and my cavity has stopped hurting
review/text: I bought some of this at my local health food store for almost $9 for this size. I decided to try it because of Weston Price and reading about his research on cavities. I'm impressed. I've always loved butter and eat quite a bit already, but I have to be careful because I'll eat this stuff right out of the jar like it's candy. But it's also great for cooking - put it on fish, popcorn and cook eggs and saute in it. I know that between eating this, fish, vegetables and taking cod liver oil, my cavity has stopped hurting and I wonder that the effect he predicted - total healing of that cavity - is in effect. Regardless, I will be buying this in the future for its mere taste and versatility. I highly recommend! It's a little costly, but your health is worth it.<br /><br />I agree - make this a Subscription item please!!!

review/summary: Like it...Unfortunately so did the Dog
review/text: Great Ghee!  I love this stuff.  It has a great taste.  Not a lot else to say.  I like cooking with it too for some things.  However, I do have one warning about protecting the product after purchase.  We have a Labrador Dog that is 80 pounds and evidently if you leave the Ghee in the kitchen on the counter top where a dog can knock it to the floor the DOG might be able to chew off the plastic cap if it is not screwed down tightly enough.  What I found on my living room floor was an opened and empty jar of Ghee on the floor.  The plastic cap was right beside the jar and had plenty of deep dents caused by her canines.  Evidently, she must have struggled quite a bit before the cap came off.  So, my only warning about the product (lol) is to screw the plastic cap down pretty tightly after use so you don't end up sharing it with your dog.  I ordered 2 more of the 13 ounce Jars to make up for the loss.  Now as to what happened to the dog? ... was very interesting ... she seemed to have a lot more energy that day and didn't get sick.  The extra energy she had says a lot because she's usually pretty energetic anyway ... hummmmm ... So, what caused that?  Who knows - maybe the Ghee?  Crazy dog.

review/summary: One of the best things to cook with!
review/text: I absolutely love this stuff. I often eat rice and use a rice cooker/steamer and before I found ghee I was using coconut oil to make sure that my rice didn't stick to the bottom of the cooker. Coconut oil -- while extremely good for you -- didn't taste too great in my rice. I like it better in oatmeal -- it might just taste better combined with 'sweet.' Coconut oil does make an amazing butter substitute for grilled cheese, though. If you are vegan, coconut oil is also one of the few vegan choices.<br /><br />But if you're not a vegan, you should try cooking with ghee.<br /><br />Ghee by itself doesn't taste much like anything despite having a wonderful buttery scent. You need to cook with it to actually get out the flavor, and you'll definitely know that it's there once you bite into something that has been cooked with ghee. It makes everything taste better without the negative effects of butter or margarine which are commonly bought at stores.<br /><br />The container is made of glass with a BPA free lid. I emailed the company and they told me that it is BPA free.<br /><br />This lid is made of polypropylene. Polypropylene is one of the safer lids that can be offered. This is the only ghee I can find that is organic, grass-fed, and has a safe lid. Other ghee products seem to have BPA or "plastisol" food liners (plastisol contains PVC particles which is very carcinogenic and worse than BPA,) or are not 'organic grass fed.' If you're worried about lids, just try to avoid glass jars with metal lids. If it is a glass jar with a plastic lid then it is usually made of polypropylene which is much safer.<br /><br />There is no seal between the ghee and the lid. During hot weather the ghee will leak out of the jar. I had this happen to me because the seller shipped the ghee jar laying on its side rather than upright. I would definitely appreciate a seal. Seals also prevent any plastic leeching that might happen during hot weather shipments.

After reading lots of reviews and doing a little google search on ghee & it's benefits and uses, I decided I would go ahead and try it.  I dont use butter ever in my cooking, so the ghee was a new experience for me.  I really enjoy it, especially on toasted bread with a splash of acv & some parmesan cheese.  I know, sounds weird & I get strange looks from hubby but it taste really good.  I like that this ghee can be taken oraly as a part of an ayurvedic cleanse.  It's consistency is very creamy & smooth.  And on my counter it hasnt melted in our 90 degree temps so far.

review/text: This appears to be a pure, clean, & well packaged product. Mine has an 18 month expiration date for a cool room temperature storage. I'll put my unopened jars in the refrigerator in hopes of extending that quality use period. Haven't tasted it yet, that's why I've only given it four stars. If it is indeed a clean, clarified butter taste and heat-durable for cooking fillet mignon on black iron, then I'll boost my rating to five stars...which is what I expect for a product of this price/weight ratio.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: First I love it I was able  to find it on amazon and for a good price.  Where I live there is  not many Indian grocers if maybe one to find authentic items like this one.  I use it for everything from cooking to baking and it tastes great and give a nice flavor to all my baking dishes.

review/summary: Is Ghee really that Great for you?
review/text: I purchased this having read in the Body Ecology book that it was an excellent alternative to butter, because the milk had been removed and that ghee is does promote phlegm/thick mucus in the way that other dairy products (cream/cheese, etc) does.  I didn't think the taste was very strong, and was surprised to see over time, mold in my ghee.  I don't know if I contaminated the container with something wet or what? I did just scrap the small spot of mold away and continued to use it.<br /><br />I haven't bought it again, but thought it was a decent product when I used it. I generally don't buy butter either though.

review/summary: It has a lamb/goat cheese type taste
review/text: First time I have tried ghee - because I heard it was a delicious and high heat oil - and used it to stir fry napa cabbage.  Found the taste a little like lamb and or goats milk cheese - both of which I don't like.  I ended up throwing all of it out as I do not like the flavor of mutton or whatever the flavor was.  I don't know if all ghee tastes like this, or if I just got a brand that was off.  Others may love the flavor of lamb or goat - I found it very hard to take.  The actual frying heat was nice and high - although I did not fry it too high in my cast iron wok.<br /><br />I am now going to try other less flavorful oils, will try mac nut oil or something.
