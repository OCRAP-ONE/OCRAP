review/summary: bestest biscotti
review/text: These biscotti are truly delicious; as with any good biscotti they are quite crunchy. The thin chocolate coating on the bottom of the cookie is dark, sweet, and high quality; chopped hazelnuts throughout the cookie as well. These are large cookies - about 5 inches long, 3/4 inch wide so just one cookie is entirely satisfying. They are individually wrapped to stay fresh for a very long time. Very good paired with coffee or tea.

review/summary: A Nice "Treat" To Serve With Coffee or Tea
review/text: These are crunchy, so tasty, and great to have on hand to offer guests when serving coffee or (hot) tea. Of the different flavors offered, I have to say that the Cioccolati biscotti is my personal favorite, but these are all very good and very well-received by others upon getting a biscotti with their beverage.<br /><br />I'm a coffee drinker, so I love to have this once in a while with a cup of coffee. They hold up well with "dunking" and make a coffee break truly feel like a break. My friends who drink hot tea (as well as coffee) always light up when I offer a Nonni's Biscotti with their tea. I recommend Nonni's Biscotti (Traditional Assortment 25 Count). Yummy!

review/summary: The piture of the product was confusing
review/text: The price said it was for individual tubes but the picture showed a box of 6 tubes.  So I ordered 5 just in case it was a box of 6 but it was 5 tubes not 5 boxes of 6 tubes.  Also, this vendor used a shipping method that means they came by container ship not priority mail.  Suppose to arrive Feb 17th - Came March 6th.<br /><br />I really like this product because in the tropical heat I leach electrolytes and nuun doesn't have any calories and has what I need in it to keep from having to eat salt or chips.  Unfortunately it is hard to come by on Guam.

review/summary: amazing
review/text: I used these for the first time this summer hiking the Grand Canyon and other places out west, we took down bottled sport drink and these tablets to save weight. At home I tried them and thought they taste like watered down grape jello, but not bad. On the trip I was amazed, sports drinks got hot and tasted gross and sticky, made you feel bloated yet still thirsty. These little tabs cover the taste of water, didn't make your mouth feel gross and you could feel the pick up it gave you. Completely satisfied with the product and willing to try other flavors. It was easy to use, pop them in your bottle and they fizz away, a quick shake and your ready to go. Don't pop them in your mouth, as a buddy of mine did thinking thats how you used them, he gagged his way through for quite a while, I still laugh at the memory.

review/summary: Only fructose NOT cane sugar
review/text: I had to give this a one star because it not only was not as advertised (Carbonated Water, Cane Sugar, Caramel Color, Sodium Benzoate (A Preservative), Citric Acid, Natural and Artificial Flavors) but I received one case of vanilla soda and one case of dad's root beer long necks. Both cases contained fructose ( the first item on the bottles list). So customer service said they would send me another case of dads beer with the hopes that it is as advertised, with cane sugar NOT fructose. I spend a lot of money on this site buying food because it's impossible for me to go shopping due to a disability. Now I have a case of fructose laden root beer and a fructose laden case of vanilla soda, both of which I cannot drink because I'm allergic to fructose. If this is not resolved by Amazon.com customer service then I will stop buying everything on Amazon.com and believe me, I spent thousands of dollars a year here on this site. It was nice of customer service to offer me a free case to replace the vanilla soda with dad's root beer but what happens if it turns out to have fructose and it like the other cases I received. I would imagine it would be the end of our relationship because this is not the first time this has happened to me,, it's the third time in less than two months. Now I see a disclaimer claiming they are not responsible for what's inside of the product or the pictures they describe the product looks like. I guess it's time to pay somebody to go shopping for me. If you are allergic to or do not want fructose in your diet I suggest you don't buy this item that claims to be " fructose free". Disclaimer or no disclaimer I call that false advertising. Forewarned is forewarned. The motto on their advertising says" If it isn't dad's you've been had", then my motto is " it sure is dad's and I've been had"

review/summary: 400 Calories per individual pack!
review/text: Which is exactly what I was after.  I'm trying to gain weight and these are a fantastic quick source of calories for a busy guy trying hit his daily caloric intake.  They are somewhat high in fat, but they are mostly the "good" fats (poly/mono-unsaturated).  Great source of protein and SHOCKINGLY low in sodium.  Now if you're really active then more sodium isn't a bad thing, but if you snack on other stuff like beef jerky, crackers (or anything canned) you're already going to have a surplus of sodium (40mg a serving, which is 100mg a pack, that's "5%" total in the bag, based on 2,000 calories a day, obviously).  This is a great way to try and balance that out.  Just realize that this isn't the low calorie snack you want if you're trying to shed a few inches around the waist, but if you don't mind the calories, or you need them, these are worth it!  I suppose I should also mention that the taste is fantastic?  Fresh tasting.<br /><br />As a last little tip, I know we all love the M&M's, but if you remove those, it will lower the calories to about 115 a serving (instead of 160), remove just about all of the sugar, as well as most of the saturated fat.

review/summary: Full of salt and calories
review/text: One reviewer of the 4 lb. version said there are too many peanuts which overwhelms the combined flavor and that's correct, but the bigger problem is that the nuts are salted (of course - try finding an unsalted product at Costco). The salt uniformly covers everything in the bag, including the raisins which do NOT taste good with salt on them. The result is a bland mix of blended flavors. Also, a 2.5 ounce portion comes to almost 400 calories so there's no bang for your buck here, either for taste or health.

review/text: My local supermarket used to carry it -- I would practically empty their shelf each time I needed to buy it -- so what did they do? They STOPPED carrying it -- they still kept carrying the other Campbell's Low Sodium soups, but not this...<br /><br />But as a die-hard fan of this wonderful elixir for the stomach and soul, I now order it by the case.<br /><br />For those of you who eschew Chicken Fat (heresy!!!), once you carefully zip open the pop top, there is usually a clump of shicken fat floating on the top, so you can skim it off-- I have no problem with it, so I use one of those old fashioned beer can openers to make two holes in the top and then I just pour everything out.<br /><br />I know the label says not to add water, but I add a little water to the can,  swish it around and pour out the rest of the chicken-goodness into the pot in which I have already poured the broth.<br /><br />Try using this as stock to cook rice -- it is YUMMISH.<br /><br />And I have also given this in a small bowl to an ailing cat who would not eat -- she slurped it up and it helped in her recovery.

They also seemed to never have it when I wanted it and I had to wait for a delivery.  Finally, I wised up and went online and voila!  There it was at Amazon.  I love the automatic ordering (it shows up once every few months, and the timing seems to be perfect for us).  Goodbye expensive coffee bean boutique!

review/summary: Tastes like chamomile-cinnamon
review/text: I like this blend.<br /><br />Brewed:<br />The chamomile and hibiscus dominate the smell and flavor, and there is light cinnamon smell (and flavor) to it as well.<br />The sencha (green tea) takes a backseat to the other flavors here, which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />For my tastes, I don't add any sweetener because it seems semi-sweet by itself.<br /><br />At around $9-10 a pound, I think this was a great value.<br /><br />The packaging I received:<br />It comes in a large resealable bag - ziplock style. You tear off the top of the sealed bag to open it initially.<br /><br />The outside is brown paper as shown on Amazon's product images.<br />The inside is lined with a silver, reflective material that is itself lined with a clear plastic coating. The tea-blend is in contact with the plastic lining.<br />I assume the silver-colored lining is an attempt to reflect infrared/heat. Who knows...<br /><br />I ordered other Davidson's tea in the past, and the older packaging didn't have the silver-colored material.<br /><br />The description on the product page "Contains ... exotic berry flavors" is misleading. I don't detect any "berry" flavor in this nor do the ingredients suggest any berry-ness (other than mysterious "Natural Flavors" ingredient).<br />For teas in general: to get an idea of how it'll taste, you should always check the list of ingredients rather than the marketing description.

review/text: I decided to buy this tea because I wanted something to drink for breakfast & chose this tea so that I could experience the health benefits of the tea leaves, flowers, and spices. Most herbal teas can be used as a remedy for a wide variety of things, and this tea is not only good for you, but is also quite tasty in its own way, and is quite fragrant and colorful. Its color was something I noticed right away. The first time I brewed the tea, the tea was a brilliant dark red color (b/c of the red/ purple flower) and the second time I brewed the tea, the liquid was green. I found this to be quite amusing.

review/summary: Healthy, delicious, and at a decent price.
review/text: I love "Food for Life Ezekiel" products. Originally, I was introduced to the bread when on a special diet -- an offshoot program of "Over-eaters Anonymous", the H.O.W. program -- many years ago. The bread contains NO flour, no sugar, is high in protein and fiber, and, for my taste, is delicious. Actually, I learned that OVER-eating was not really my problem. My problem was NOT eating the healthiest, life-giving, minimally processed foods available. Over time, I learned, relapsed, and relearned, etc. I was thrilled when I learned "Food for Life" added cereals to their product line. In looking at labels at my local health food store, I discovered that this brand was the ONLY cold cereal on the shelves that had NO sugar content! Since then, this is the ONLY cold cereal I buy. It can be served warm, as well. Generally, though, I prefer "John McCann's Steel-Cut Irish Oatmeal" (also zero sugar and high fiber) for hot cereal.<br /><br />Needless to say, the cereal is expensive (but cheap if you consider that you're no longer polluting your body with all the sugar, air, preservatives, and other junk in most commercial cereals), so I was thrilled to find that Amazon.com offered it in a 6-box bundle for a far better price than my local market. I usually have a bowl a day with fresh berries (strawberries are very sweet this year in my area) and slivered almonds topped with light soy milk.  I find that when I'm eating really nutritious food, I eat slowly and savor. When I'm eating junk, I tend to "wolf" it down. It doesn't matter why. I just hate that sensation, so I avoid it and my body thanks me every day.

review/text: I believe that those who bash the flavor of this product are generally used to eating processed products and have yet to acquire the taste of natural grains.  Once you learn how to eat healthier, it's amazing how most people learn how naturally sweet dry toast can be if its made with a really great bread or how wonderful this cereal is.<br /><br />For my taste, I love this stuff andd I think it's worth every dime.  The boxes are always stuffed to capacity without the three or four inches of dead space chalked up as "settling due to shipping and handling".  I normally add it on top of a bowl of fresh fruit and yogurt and then listen to my co-workers tell me how great my breakfast or lunch looks.<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend Food For Life Ezekiel cereal - its very difficult to find more nutrition in a single meal anywhere else!

review/summary: The best I've found
review/text: If you're still eating refined flour, sugar, and artificial sweeteners, this cereal (and all the Ezekiel products) will probably taste like granulated styrofoam to you. We train our palettes, for better or for worse.<br /><br />I have been eating Ezekiel for at least 20 years.  I don't eat sugar, artificial sweeteners, refined grains, red meat, or artificial anything, and this cereal tastes sweet and crunchy and nutty to me. I usually eat it with a handful of chopped walnuts, cut up a banana or peach, and add almond milk. It's low on the glycemic index, which is also an enormous plus if you're trying to eat healthy. And it's filling; unlike when you eat those sugary cereals, you won't be hungry in an hour.<br /><br />When I walk into the grocery store, and 99% of the groceries are all about sugar and carbohydrate addictions and foods all pumped up with chemicals and addictive substances, I feel discriminated against. It's much harder to eat right in this country. I can't even find Ezekiel in most stores. I hope, I hope, I hope they never go out of business!

Without fruit, it's still satisfying with Vanilla Soy Milk. However, if eaten as pictured with Blue berries, the cereal really tastes good. You get a satisfying cereal with a good amount of fiber. I've been hearing a lot about sprouted grains and I'm not sure what it really means in the end, but this cereal is pure. Which is something I appreciate.

review/summary: Ezekiel 4:9 Cereal Golden Flax - The REAL Food for champions!
review/text: For anyone interested in eating food that is truly good for you in every aspect, Ezekiel 4:9 Golden Flax is the answer.  When you study the digestive system you begin to understand that our bodies do not like processed foods, the words "enriched flour" should send you running in the oppposite direction.  Our bodies cannot digest white flour, yet how many of our products today have that as a major ingredient.  This cereal is made for a unique natural processing method that uses live sprouted grains and bakes them in loaves in order to then produce the cereal.  Your body loves it!  My husband was raised on the classic southern diet of white - white breads, white gravies, white rice.  When we married I began converting him with my classic saying, "The whiter the bread the quicker you're dead."  Since beginning to make this cereal his daily breakfast, he has seen a tremendous difference in how he feels all day as well as his general levels of energy and well-being.  Try it for a week or two and see if you cannot tell the difference!

review/summary: Why all the salt?
review/text: I adhere to a low sodium diet (&lt;1,500 mg daily).  I ordered this cereal not realizing that it contained 190 mg of sodium per half cup serving. The product is advertised as having no artificial flavoring and no preservatives.  This claim is misleading because salt is the mother of all preservatives.  Perhaps sodium is used in this product only for purposes of artificially enhancing the flavor and not as a preservative?  If you have been off the processed food grid for a awhile, you will probably find, as I did, that this cereal has good flavor and texture.  However, because of the comparatively high sodium content, I will not purchase this cereal again.  There are other good tasting zero sugar cereals on the market with no or low sodium content.

You do need to be a little careful though....I wound up with some sort of seed (maybe Flax) that was as hard as wood and incapable of being chewed.  That could have been a problem if I bit into it the wrong way.<br /><br />Cereal in general is not good for you.  It is not the worst thing you can eat, but it is not really good. I think this cereal is a rare exception, and you can feel great about eating it with your favorite milk or yogurt.  I double the portion size, add a cup of milk and it is a great meal and not too high in calories.

review/summary: Super Great Stuff!
review/text: I've used Ezekiel 4:9 bread for a lot of years and enjoyed its no-flour, high-nutrient goodness. But it's not easy to find decent cereal...most of them are high-salt, high-sugar, do-it-yourself health problems in a box.<br /><br />Was great to find E4:9's cereals! I've tried the flax and the cinnamon-raisin...both are great! Most of the time, I eat it cold with almond milk. But sometimes, I like mixing E4:9 about half 'n half with oat bran (I use Bob's Red Mill), adding almond milk, and popping it in the microwave for about three minutes. This stuff is great hot!<br /><br />One great thing besides knowing the cereal is crammed with nutrition and high fiber is that it fills you up but good...and sticks to your ribs for hours. A real help for losing weight.<br /><br />Some people won't like this kind of cereal. Too much like chowing down on twigs and weeds and sawdust, they fear. But the flavor is truly enjoyable. Add the milk, some fruit, and you'll have energy to last!<br /><br />Finally, I've compared local store prices against Amazon, and the local is far higher.

review/summary: Some of the healthiest cereal you'll find!
review/text: First off, this product is awesome. As others have said, no added sugars, high fiber and protein. Also, flax seeds have crazy health benefits, including help managing weight loss. For that reason alone, I paid the higher price for the cereal. I will admit, when I first tried the cereal, it was hard to choke down. I was used to cereals with high sugar content and this tasted like cardboard. After two weeks of eating it nearly every morning, all that has changed. I usually cut up a banana and throw it in the bowl, and now this cereal is hard to beat in taste.<br /><br />This cereal is a perfect compliment to a weight loss regimen, and after some getting used to is awesome in taste!

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised!  I'm hooked!
review/text: I just started the "Cinch!" diet by Cynthia Sass and have switched to healthy, organic foods. I found this cereal while looking at organic products on Amazon.com and ordered it. While waiting for it to arrive I went shopping at The Fresh Market and saw this cereal there. I decided to buy a box to try in case I didn't like it then I could return the 6-pack. Boy was I surprised--it tastes great! I pour out 1/2 a cup into a bowl then add some ground cinnamon, a handful of blueberries then almond milk. It's real crunchy and so flavorful. I NEVER thought I would like a cereal like this. And to top it off it's good for you. At The Fresh Market I also bought a loaf of Ezekiel 4:9 Cinnamon/Raisin sprouted grain bread and it is delicious--I don't even need to add butter. Tonight I had it with Blue Diamond almond butter. I'm glad I bought the cereal last week at $26.96/6-pack. I thought it was a permanent price. Now that it is $41.54/6-pack I'll be buying it at The Fresh Market for $5+/box.

review/summary: Healthy and tasty
review/text: I started buying this cereal at the store after reading a recommendation about how much healthier sprouted grains are. Since it is rather expensive, I found that I could save a couple of dollars per box by buying it from Amazon. To my taste the cereal doesn't need any added sugar or anything to taste good and I like the consistency too. I also buy the almond flavor for variety.

review/summary: Taste has changed...
review/text: I have been a huge fan of this brand of cereal enjoying it for over 3 years.  However, just recently, the taste has changed dramatically.  It tastes like wood now and sometimes, I can taste some pesticide.  I called Amazon to return all 12 boxes, and they immediately replaced them without any hassle.  However, once I got the new boxes and opened them, it tasted the same, quite awful.  I called Food For Life and let them know about the taste change and a lady said that she would bring it to the manufacturers attention.  I also have a twin brother in California who also said the taste has changed.  Then, I went to Whole Food Market to see if the same problem was occuring with the cereal in the store.  And sure enough, it tastes awful.<br /><br />I hope they change the taste back to how it was.  Unfortunately, due to the change in the taste, I will not be buying this cereal anymore and warn all other buyers to stay away from the GoldenFlax due to its sour and bitter and woodlike taste.  I am on the search for a new cereal.  Also, I noticed the packaging insert is different.  Usually, it is a frosted plastic bag that has the cereal in it.  Now, it is a clear like plastic bag.  I wonder if the new packagaing has changed the taste.<br /><br />Thanks

review/text: I'm a vegan and love Ezekiel products, and I have no quarrel with the quality or the good intentions of Food For Life, Inc.  However, a 41% price increase since November 14, 2010, for their flax cereal is extreme.  The current price $41.54 for 6 boxes comes out to $7.00 each for a small 16 ounce box.  The other Ezekiel cereals are priced normally ($24-$29/box).

review/text: I'm going to start by saying that I do enjoy this cereal and may purchase it again. The fiber content and the fact that the ingredients combine to make a complete protein make this a vegetarians delight. That being said, it isn't remarkably tasty without some doctoring. I put dry blueberries and a touch of honey on mine and it's delicious. But I can't responsibly give the cereal a perfect star rating if I have to alter it in order to enjoy.

Who can eat 10 TINY LITTLE PIECES and be done?  I don't know about you but 100 calories may be great but I end up eating like 3 packages at a time.  I suppose the only good thing is that I'm underweight by about 15 lbs or so which means it won't kill me but still it seems a bit senseless.

I'm giving it 3 stars for concept and effort, but I will be giving these to my toddler (which would be the ideal target market for these LOL). He will love them.

My local grocery store has an olive bar and they usually have nice, plump blue cheese stuffed olives.  They were sold out so I bought a bottle of these and it certainly was a waste of $7.  They were very crunchy, too salty, and the cheese was hard and lumpy. I ate one and threw the rest out.

review/summary: So much better than instant oatmeal
review/text: I've always loved oatmeal and I've tried every imaginable variety. Instant, steel-cut, Quaker's Oats, the kind you buy in a barrel at health food stores, but this is the best one I've ever tried. It's a little more effort than instant oatmeal-I put about 1/2 a cup of oats with 1 cup of cold water in a saucepan, add a little salt and sugar, and cook it till it's bubbling. Takes about 10 minutes and I get a big low-calorie bowl that's very filling and lasts until lunch. The texture is a lot chewier than instant or even steel-cut oatmeal and the taste is difficult to describe, but better. Instant and steel-cut taste a little watery next to this oatmeal. You can cook it in the microwave, but you have to use a really huge bowl or it will boil over-it cooks up much better on the stovetop. Just keep stirring it as you cook it and enjoy the aroma.

I don't happen to think it's gritty and I have lots of options for mixing.  I prefer Chia seeds (they expand and create a more full feeling)to Flax, and I usually use Coconut milk (unsweetened) or Coconut water as a base.  I'm not opposed to using carrot juice either.  I don't like overly sweet so I freeze my own berries and such to give it a great chill.  I'll even throw in a handful of fresh spinach.  There are so many options so find out what you like a go to town!  At these prices, how can you beat trying more healthful choices to start your day!

review/summary: Love It !
review/text: Hemp protein is a excellent choice to use, I add it to smoothies for extra protein. Not a bad taste to it especially mixed with other things in a smoothie. Hemp is so under rated.

review/summary: A bit gritty...
review/text: I ordered this to use as a protein shake addition.  I use 1/3 of a serving added to my regular protein powder drink.  I love that this is high fiber- that is why I decided to try it. The taste is unremarkable (my regular flavored protein powder taste remains the main flavor of the shake), but I am so NOT lovng the gritty texture and the way the hemp powder sinks to the bottom almost immediately.  Also changes the color of my shake to a rather unappetizing greenish brown, but that isn't relevant to the taste or quality of the product, but thought I'd mention it as some folks get bothered by stuff like that. Anyway, the heaviness of the powder requires shaking the shaker bottle half to death while I try to drink the darn thing, but I still gave it 4 stars for the fiber and other assorted healthy attributes of the powder, as well as the fact that it has no strong taste, all of which I very much like. I am going to use up all I bought (which is gonna take a loooong time at 1 tbsp a day to get through three pounds of powder!) but I am very unlikely to order again, simply for the gritty texture and heaviness that requires almost constant agitation in the shaker  bottle. If you plan to add it to something non liquid like oatmeal, I imagine the gritty thing would not be noticeable.

review/summary: Good Addition to a smoothie
review/text: I use this in addition to my morning smoothie.  Aside from the green color, I really do no notice too much of a change.  With that being said, I use a lot fruits, veggies and some peanut butter in my smoothies so every flavor does get masked.  A great way to get your fiber and protein.  As with any high fiber foods you will notice some intestinal digestion changes.
