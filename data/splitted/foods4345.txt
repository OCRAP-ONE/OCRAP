review/text: our 3 retrievers are 9,8 and 3 years young and we're working hard to keep them healthy and not go bankrupt.  We were using another joint supplement that works great but costing $$$$.  We decided to use this food in the am and pinnacle's chicken and oatmeal for the pm meal.  High quality food that won't kill my budget.  The dogs love the taste, their coats are shiny, joints are moving well and yard clean up is minimal.

review/summary: Ideal diet for a Rhodesian Ridgeback
review/text: This is the only food our 12 year old Rhodesian Ridgeback has ever eaten (plus a single square of Kraft American cheese daily as a treat and a few chicken breast treats.)  Kramer is in great health and people are always amazed at how fit and strong he is.  That he still has all his teeth is surely attributable to the Active Care hard kibble diet and the near absolute lack of any signs of arthritis must be one of the benefits of the "healthy joint formula."  Both Kramer and I cannot recommend Active Care highly enough.

review/summary: Less Sodium but Same Great Flavor
review/text: We were concerned that when we bought this product that with low sodium the flavor would be the sacrifice. They are using real chicken broth because I cooked chicken breasts and poured the extra broth into the container with some I had left and it simply blended in. With this broth you can cut salt even further by pouring one eighth container into your soup and adding more water. It does not detract from the flavor or taste at all. What a find !!!!!! We love it !!!!!

review/summary: Great Treats - Liver is Liver...
review/text: Our Shitzu is very picky when it comes to treats, which is good I guess.  Only puppy sized Milkbones and Dried Liver Treats.  We used a different brand in the past, but tried PureBites and he loves them, just as much.  The other brand sells them in a hard plastic (reusable)container and the PureBites are in a bag/pouch.  Not sure if that contributes to more breakage of pieces or if it's just they way they are processed.  Since our pooch is a small dog, he doesn't need "big bites", so these are just fine for him.  Price per ounce seems better on the PureBites too.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: These liver treats are awesome!! My dog loves them and they definitely make a nice reward especially after getting his nails cut. My dog is also kind of a picky eater and he doesn't really like his dog food, but since he's allergic to potatoes he doesn't have very many options to what kind of dog food he eats. To coax him to eat his food, sometimes I'll get a piece of these treats, crush it up and sprinkle it over his food. He seriously is the best eater after the liver treats are all over his kibbles. I also gave these treats to my cousins chihuahua whos also a really picky eater. She a little worse than my dog, she doesn't like any kind of treats, but she'll eat these! Yes, these are kind of expensive especially since I'm still in college, but it's so worth seeing my doggie happy :)

review/summary: Great product -- reduced my dogs "emissions"
review/text: These treats truly are as pure as you can get -- 100% beef liver and nothing else.  This also means that they're grain free, which is fantastic for dogs with gas problems.  Switching from other (high-quality) treats to PureBites liver reduced the frequency and potency of my dog's rear-end emissions by about 90 percent.  Both my dogs love these treats.  The only, minor drawback is that the bottom of the bag tends to have a little pile of tiny bits and pieces of treats -- at that point, I'll pour out a little pile for each of my dogs and they lick them up like candy.

review/summary: All-time favorite snack for my babies!
review/text: My two finicky dogs just love, love this snack! They don't just eat any snack that comes their way, in fact, they usually turn their noses up when I try to give them other pretty darn good natural dog snacks, but this one is a winner! The bite-sized pieces are just the right size for them (they are slightly under medium-sized dogs, peke mixes) and although they have been eating this snack for years, they never grow tired of it. The 16 oz bag lasts us for about two months (two dogs), which is pretty darn good considering the price. I have tried the other flavors, but we stay away from chicken and cheese because of the allergy equation. The fish is also excellent, but the price is a bit steeper, so we pretty much stick to the liver. YUM YUM WOOF WOOF!

review/summary: Makes the best ever pumpkin pie crust
review/text: This Thanksgiving I used these cookies instead of our regular brand when making my grandmother's famous cookie crust for pumpkin chiffon pie, and it was so delicious that everyone at the table was left speechless.  For one crust, use one and a half cups of cookie crumbs, a combination of ginger cookies and vanilla wafers.  Add in some finely chopped pecans, a quarter cup of confectioner;s sugar, and a third cup of soft butter.  Spread in a buttered pie pan and bake for 10 minutes at 350�.  Cool before filling -- we use a pumpkin chiffon filling, which is basically a pumpkin custard made with evaporated milk, brown sugar, and egg yolks, then enriched with butter, firmed with gelatin, and lightened with whipped egg whites.  Top with whipped cream.

It was a very worthwhile purchase and I would do it again in a heartbeat just to see the look on my husband's face when he opened the boxes and then when he sits down to enjoy his "presents".

review/summary: Walkers Stem Ginger Biscuits robust flavor explodes in your mouth - absolutely delicious!!!
review/text: I love ginger cookies and ginger bread, but usually if homemade not store bought. I must say that when I was served Walkers Stem Ginger Biscuits at a friends home, I was amazed at how delicious they tasted. The chewy stem ginger and it's robust flavor explodes in your mouth...or at least it did in mine. And, supposedly, the stem ginger in this cookie is so much more soothing to the digestive tract than plain powdered ginger.<br /><br />These delicious Scottish cookies are baked using a traditional recipe with generous pieces of whole Buderim stem ginger. The candied ginger bits in the cookies are a real plus.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the ingredients did not include butter, but vegetable shortening. However, the biscuits do taste buttery. The ingredients are: wheat flour, vegetable shortening, sugar, candied stem ginger, golden syrup, oatflakes, leavening, skim milk solids, ground ginger, salt. There are no artificial colors, flavorings or preservatives and the biscuits are Kosher. My  rating...YUM!!<br />JANA

review/summary: Not Gingersnap Replacement; More Like Pecan Sandies
review/text: One of the reviewers claimed that the flavor of the ginger exploded in mouth -- Do not count on it! I am frustrated over not being able to find old fashioned gingersnap cookies that are hard, flavorful, made with molasses and are low in calories. The cookie makers left the market! They have robbed me of favorite memories of my father. He would take us (the family) for ride in the country, stop at country store (USA) and buy local cheddar cheese and gingersnaps and make a gingersnap/cheese sandwich for me. The stores no longer carry a comparable gingersnap since a Japanese company bought Stouffers, for example - and then Voila! Nothing to be found anymore. I do love the buttery Walker's shortbread style cookies and gift them to my family and friends during holidays - they all love them. This Walkers cookie/biscuit is nothing to brag about and definitely should not be recommended to people as a good example of a Walker's cookie. It is most similar to the stale taste familiar to Americans when tasting a pecan sandie cookie. Unlike a good gingersnap, this cookie has Saturated Fat and is made with Canola/Palm Oils. If I am going off diet - let me have butter, please.

review/summary: Really good for an instant soup
review/text: Like the other reviewers, I initially bought this as a joke but after about 6 months of it sitting around in the kitchen causing mirth, I realized that I could still keep the packet if I opened it carefully and actually try the product.<br /><br />I was amazed and appalled. The former because it's a delicious, highly spicy concoc(k)tion which is far more interesting and flavorful than any of the domestic packet soups I've tried (and I've tried most). The latter because I realized right then and there that I would have to continue to avail myself of a product that's very difficult to find and inspires derision and hilarity when friends spot it.<br /><br />On the downside, it *is* extremely salty, I use about 125% of the water it suggests and you have to be careful it doesn't simmer down too far. It is very, very tasty though.

We bought it as a joke in the supermarket in the foreign foods section (always a good place to find new favorites).  We ended up using it and it was wonderful!  Very flavorful and with a great combination of spices.  We like to use it as a marinade sometimes as well.  They stopped carrying it at the Kroger, to our dismay, and I'm glad to find it here. Good stuff. The name and packaging are good for a laugh, but the actual soup is good enough that I'd buy it even if were in a package that said "Spicy chicken soup mix".

review/summary: Highly recommended; tasty white cheddar with a little bite, super easy to make, more in a cup than you would expect
review/text: At first I was a little leery of getting this because 2 ounces did not seem like a lot. But there is actually a good size amount in each cup. Enough for our 2 year old daughter to have this twice as the centerpiece of her lunch. Enough for a big snack or a small lunch with something else.<br /><br />2 great things about this product: taste first. Very good cheese flavor, much better than say a Kraft. And even though it has a little bite our daughter still likes it as well. Definitely good for grownups as well. Second super easy to make. Fill to line 3 minutes or so in the microwave, add cheese, and done. Third the cheese sauce is organic so added bonus there since if you had to have one organic item you would want it to be the dairy item. Recommended.

review/summary: Smells Great; Makes Things Taste Great
review/text: Several years ago, I started making homemade marshmallows for family and friends.  You'd be amazed at the simple joy that radiates from the face of a person learning for the first time that marshmallows can be made at home.  Anyway, as a special treat for a friend who  is so enamored with France that she grows French lavender in her backyard because it reminds her of her travels there, I decided to try a lavender marshmallow.<br /><br />I was able to find some culinary lavender in my local grocery store (near a pretty urban area), but it seemed so expensive.  In the end, this is about a fifth of the price of my grocery store.  Win!  When I got the package in the mail, I could smell the floral, almost woodsy and astringent fragrance that I associate with lavender (and rosemary) before even opening it.  The color of the flower buds ranged from shades of blue to purple.<br /><br />To cook with it, I dump what I need into a large bowl and use the sprayer on my faucet to put enough water in the bowl so that the flowers float.  I give it a stir and then use a small-gauge strainer to scrape the floating flowers out of the water.  Any detritus that may be mixed in with the flowers will sink to the bottom (though any stems will not - but then again, rosemary and thyme typically have some stems mixed in), so don't just dump it in the strainer.  Glean the flowers from the top of the bowl.<br /><br />As for my marshmallows, which I topped with lavender-scented dark chocolate, my friend loved them and everything I've made since (lavender lemon cookies, blueberry lavender syrup, lavender cream, lavender, thyme, and rosemary roasted potatoes, lavender butter, strawberry lavender butter, etc.) has been quite delicious.  When I need more lavender, I know where to come.<br /><br />Update:  I also wanted to mention that 1 oz. of lavender is about 1.25 cups.

These people are so friendly, so nice, very understanding, and truly have a great attitude for business and their customers. I flavored powdered sugar with it to make Lavender Frosting (sifting the sugar of course, the buds are very potent).  It's so aromatic, a little bit of lavender truly goes a LONG way! I have about 2 cups of lavender from purchasing the 4oz package.  I highly recommend any product from the OliveNation company, they have great products and I'll be getting more!

Lavender is known for its calming effects.  Feel free to Google its benefits.

review/summary: Flawed design
review/text: This infuser is better than many but falls short of its promise.  It's deep depth means it can be used in almost any sized cup or teapot.  Many shallow infusers barely reach the surface of the water and so are unsuitable for long brewing.  Its mesh is also finer preventing the tea leaves from escaping into the cup.  It's diameter is also wider permitting use with wider openings although an even wider lip would be preferable.<br /><br />However, this infuser has one major problem: the mesh is folded to form the infuser's cylinder shape.  This allows tea leaves to get caught inside the folds of the mesh.  They are then impossible to remove.

review/summary: I've tried them all, this is the best so far!
review/text: I'm a pretty serious tea drinker, and I've had all sorts of tea balls, strainers, teapots, etc. and been frustrated with most of them.  So many are cute but not really functional.  I bought a few of these "Ultimates" in a gift shop in England because they looked ideal, and brought them home for gifts.  Soon I was down to my last one, and having used and loved it, I was loathe to part with it, even for a very good friend.  =)  I tried to get more through a friend in England but she couldn't find them.<br /><br />Then, while visiting another friend in Illinois, we went to a tea shop that had great selection, and there was my infuser, along with many others!  I had forgotten what it was called, which is what made it hard to find more, but now I've kept the box and made a special note of the name.<br /><br />The long rambling story is just to convince you I'm not a casual user; I really believe in this infuser!  The wide "handles" on top allow it to fit all cups except a really gigantic mug, the tea leaves are able to circulate freely within the roomy interior, the cover keeps your tea molecules contained as the tea steeps (just like a teapot) and instantly turns into a drip tray when you lift the infuser out of the cup (give it a quick swirl first), and it's a breeze to clean: just bang the leaves out into the wastebasket, turn it upside down under the faucet, and give it a quick rinse.<br /><br />I've never had the problem of tea leaves sticking to the mesh folds, so I respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer's 3-star rating.  I've wasted far more time trying to get tea leaves out of various other designs.  My one remaining Ultimate does gradually get stained, but a short soak in a light bleach solution takes care of that (as I do when my teapots get stained).<br /><br />This is the best infuser so far...after at least 20 years of tea drinking!

review/summary: Great infuser, but I'm not entirely pleased
review/text: The Good: arrived right on time, well made and durable, excellent design, works great, clean-up is easy (just dump and rinse).<br /><br />The Bad and the Ugly: #1 - shipping charges were more than half of the price of the infuser. The infuser is $12 and the shipping (to me - in the same state as the company) was $6.95!  Unacceptable. The thing weighs only a few ounces! #2 - MADE IN CHINA - also unacceptable.  Not to mention the made in China stickers on each of the two pieces that had to be peeled off and the residue cleaned thoroughly before subjecting the infuser to hot water.<br /><br />Come on Davidsons, you can do better on this product. Look for an American manufacturer will you?  If it's not your design or patent, design one yourself and have it made exclusively for you here in the USA.  Because as it currently stands, this is most certainly NOT the "ultimate infuser", to me anyway...

I successfully boiled some water, poured it into the dealie whats without spilling any.  Put the bottom over the top for 7 minutes, then put the top back to being the bottom and put the dealie whats in the bottom to catch any remaining tea.

review/summary: Better brand than others
review/text: These are a better brand than some other energy bars on the market, but are still leaning towards a candy bar when combared to some others.  It is OK if you want something reasonably low priced for a quick pick-me-up, that is fairly durable to take along in a day pack (they are not as heat sensitive as some bars), but if you don't mind a higher price, you can shop around and get some specialized bars.  Other brands available at a reasonable price that I have tried and recommend include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EXS6D6">NuGo Organic Nutrition Bar, Dark Double Chocolate, 1.76-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> which also come in other flavors, and list their contents as including 11 grams of protein.  You might also try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVQXY">SoLo Gi Chocolate Charger Bars, 1.76-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> which I have tried and liked.

review/summary: Tastes good, would consider as an energy bar, but for the soy
review/text: I already like Clif Bars other products, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0074B4HU2">granola type things</a> so I gave this a shot. It tastes good and chewy and I realized it could make a good energy bar for hiking or emergency supplies. My only problem is that it contains a substantial amount of soy ingredients. Its not GMO soy, which is good, but unfermented soy contains compounds that mimic estrogen and other hormones, which can harm men AND women. Google "The Truth About Unfermented Soy and Its Harmful Effects". So that rules it out for me other than occasionally, if at all, since Im trying to eliminate soy. I hope they find a way to take out the soy, because it really is a great bar. Perhaps for emergencies, the soy isnt something to worry about, but I still wish it came without.<br /><br />If you dont give a damn about that health aspect, go for it! It tastes really good, has a nice chew to it, etc.

review/text: After you receive your wheat bran, wheat germ, peanuts, or other mycotoxin-vulnerable grains or nuts, don't just leave the opened bag sitting around.  For storage at room temperature, use an airtight plastic jar with a dessicant placed inside.  For storage without a dessicant, I recommend the freezer.  The refrigerator is very humid and therefore may not be the ideal place to store whole grains and nuts.  Mycotoxins can cause liver cancer and kidney failure (please click "Comment" below to see 1 scientific study).

review/summary: Smells Great; Makes Things Taste Great
review/text: Several years ago, I started making homemade marshmallows for family and friends.  You'd be amazed at the simple joy that radiates from the face of a person learning for the first time that marshmallows can be made at home.  Anyway, as a special treat for a friend who  is so enamored with France that she grows French lavender in her backyard because it reminds her of her travels there, I decided to try a lavender marshmallow.<br /><br />I was able to find some culinary lavender in my local grocery store (near a pretty urban area), but it seemed so expensive.  In the end, this is about a fifth of the price of my grocery store.  Win!  When I got the package in the mail, I could smell the floral, almost woodsy and astringent fragrance that I associate with lavender (and rosemary) before even opening it.  The color of the flower buds ranged from shades of blue to purple.<br /><br />To cook with it, I dump what I need into a large bowl and use the sprayer on my faucet to put enough water in the bowl so that the flowers float.  I give it a stir and then use a small-gauge strainer to scrape the floating flowers out of the water.  Any detritus that may be mixed in with the flowers will sink to the bottom (though any stems will not - but then again, rosemary and thyme typically have some stems mixed in), so don't just dump it in the strainer.  Glean the flowers from the top of the bowl.<br /><br />As for my marshmallows, which I topped with lavender-scented dark chocolate, my friend loved them and everything I've made since (lavender lemon cookies, blueberry lavender syrup, lavender cream, lavender, thyme, and rosemary roasted potatoes, lavender butter, strawberry lavender butter, etc.) has been quite delicious.  When I need more lavender, I know where to come.<br /><br />Update:  I also wanted to mention that 1 oz. of lavender is about 1.25 cups.
