review/summary: A CHRISTMAS Basket for MOTHER'S Day = Unhappy Customer
review/text: The description should indicate that this is mostly given as a CHRISTMAS basket. When my grandmother received it she was under the impression that it was the wrong basket or that I was gypped because I mailed this as a Mother's Day gift. She said it looked like a Christmas gift because of the Christmas mugs that were included. I had no idea that Christmas looking mugs were included. If I had known, I would have opted for a more appropriate gift for the occasion. I wanted to return it to resend a different basket but later realized that the item was ineligible to be returned.<br /><br />In addition, although I indicated that this was a gift and wrote a note to be included with the package, Amazon did not include the note and my grandmother had no idea who it was from. I am very unsatisfied with this product and am very unhappy that Mother's Day was somewhat ruined thanks to Amazon's inability to describe this as a Christmas gift or to include the note that I requested.

review/summary: A wonderful gift!
review/text: This is especially a great gift for someone who loves coffees and teas and it definitely looks spectacular upon unwrapping!  My coffee crazy friend certainly beamed with pleasure.<br /><br />Neat arrangement of different flavors of Starbucks coffees (similar to the ones shown in the picture), Tazo teas and other goodies in a sturdy and beautiful basket. It is a big basket (7-pound seems like an apt description label for the product) filled with goodies that is bound to cheer the recipient. Well worth the money. Shipped well and in good time. On a side note, wine country also sends a small but pampering gift note along with the basket for the recipient to delight some more in. Wine Country seems to offer special discounted prices seasonally for such baskets and this can be one of the best purchase choices at that time.

review/text: I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  Although we no longer live in Seattle, she grew up there, and she loves anything related to Seattle.  So the gift basket featuring Starbuck's was a big hit.  The basket itself is beautiful, and quite sturdy.  I snagged the Tazo tea (is Tazo a Starbuck's offshoot) because she doesn't drink tea, but I let her keep the cookies.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning, the basket shipped quickly and was well-packaged.

review/summary: Sweet Strawberry
review/text: Matcha where have you been all my life! I mentioned in another review of Red Leaf Tea's Matcha tea that my discovery of tea is a very new adventure for me and that after reading rave reviews on Steepster about Red Leaf's eclectic selection of flavors, I gave it a try. I wonder now how I got along without it. I got my daughter hooked and recently had my son try it. He immediately ordered some for himself. After tasting it, it is not a question of "do I want to order some", it is more like "how much and what flavors should I order"! Trust when you look at all the flavors they have to offer, it is extremely hard to decide!<br />My second order came last week and I could smell the wonderful matcha before I opened the box! First up for testing was the Strawberry flavored match.<br />Sweet and naturally tasting Strawberry flavor. In an effort to lead a healthier lifestyle, I find Matcha tea to be so versatile. I added a teaspoon of Matcha, a half a cup of plain greek yogurt & a few fresh strawberries, a little almond milk & ice in a blender and I had a delicious healthy smoothie!

review/summary: Deliciously strawberry!
review/text: Out of the gold foil package, the matcha smells like juicy strawberry, like smelling strawberry fruit leather or a strawberry flavored candy.<br /><br />Prepared as a traditional cup of hot matcha, 1/4tsp of sifted strawberry matcha whisked in some 175f filtered hot water,  the green tea comes out as deliciously earthy with no bitterness. The strawberry is bright and present, adding a hint of sweetness. The taste combined almost reminds me on when I eat strawberries too fast and I accidentally eat the stem or a leaf, which happens often haha!<br /><br />Now my favorite part, making this matcha into an iced strawberry soy latte! I did about ï¿½ or 2/3 cup of light soy milk (ran out of milk), bit of sweetener, 1/4tsp of matcha and whisked it. The result: very tasty strawberry balanced with the taste of matcha. Even better than strawberry soy milk as it tastes just like strawberry candy. An amazing treat for under 90 calories!<br /><br />Overall, very delicious if you are into the strawberry candy flavor. As a traditional cup it is pretty good, but even better as a latte. I suggest not to pass this one up.

review/summary: Pure summer bliss!
review/text: Let's get to the good stuff: as always, I fall in love with the first sniff. Cutting open the corner of the gold foil bag was like a flavour overload! The sweet strawberry scent was too good to be true - and happily for me, it tasted just like it smelled!!!<br /><br />That can be rare in a tea, but I've come to learn that Red Leaf Tea sets their bar just as high as I set mine! That leaves me very rarely disappointed, and almost always happily surprised with the quality, scent and flavour! Strawberry was no exception!<br /><br />(Excuse the amount of exclamation marks, I really can't help it)<br /><br />I ordered by my usual parameters: Basic Grade Matcha with Delicate flavouring. One day I will invest in tins, but right now I have a system that keeps my matcha fresh - a mix of the tiny tins from DavidsTea (from their "Wall" teas), and freezer bags kept in a special tin box. It's pretty and I like it! I kind of thrive in a world of controlled chaos - it's either the artist in me, or the lazy in me! Probably both - but I thought I should share my "technique" since the tins are a hot topic these days!<br /><br />On to the taste! I truly was taken by surprise. The flavour is simple but so effective that from this experience, I can't think of a better combination than matcha and strawberries. That's not to say that RLT has amazing flavour combos and super unique matchas - there is something just so simple, comforting and naturally delicious about this Strawberry Matcha. It's tangy and sweet - I prepared it first straight up with a bit of sugar, second as an iced matcha latte. The flavour was a mix between strawberry milk (I used to devour the stuff as a kid) and a melted strawberry milkshake!<br /><br />This inspires me to get some good quality vanilla ice cream and whip it up in my blender with this matcha! I looove matcha icecream and strawberry icecream, so I can't think of a better combo for a homemade matcha shake!

review/text: You know this matcha screams summer and while I have been longing for autumn to get here for the weather this mix makes me feel like going down the street to our local fruit farm and grabbing up a bunch of fresh strawberries! Yes I am lucky to have fruit farms close to my home. The grassy matcha base along with the fresh fruity aroma of strawberries just makes me sit back and appreciate summer a little while longer. This would be SO GOOD mixed with some orange juice in a smoothie. This makes me want to just play around with this flavor and see what all I can come up with! I bet an actual cheesecake made with this matcha would be sinfully divine!

review/text: I love this matcha. I could rave on and on about the multitude of ways it can be served and the multitude of health benefits it offers. First, I tried it in cold water. Delicious. There's a real freshness from the matcha and a strong strawberry aroma and flavor. It tastes like a strawberry juice. Next, strawberry matcha in cold almond milk. Mmmm. This was excellent. It really brought out the strawberry milk flavour I've adored for as long as I've been aware of its existence. Really tastes like a strawberry dessert. Love it! Then, I decided to try it in hot water. It's still great! It seems a bit strange to drink what tastes essentially like hot strawberry juice and like it, but I deceive you not, my palate found it quite appealing. And finally, in hot almond milk? Mmmm. Very comforting. Warm strawberry milk.

review/summary: Deliciously Strawberry!
review/text: I absolutely love this flavored Matcha.  Why?  Well, first, I love Matcha:  the bittersweet, creamy, vegetative taste with a hint of buttery goodness and all of its delightful nuances.  Second, I love strawberries!<br /><br />This flavored Matcha is a brilliant representation of both strawberries and of Matcha.  Creamy, smooth Matcha with sweet, juicy strawberry taste.  Together, it is a chawan full of berry goodness.  The strawberry is very true to the fruit:  sweet with just a hint of tartness toward the end, all that's missing is the seeds (and I don't really miss those!)<br /><br />A real treat, any time of day.  It's also great as a Matcha Milkshake.  Add some milk and ice cubes to the blender, along with a tablespoon or so of the Matcha (I really just eyeball everything), and blend until smooth.  It's really yummy, cool and refreshing.

review/summary: Strawberry Matcha Forever!
review/text: Mmmm strawberries. I cannot begin to tell you how much of my life has been spent picking strawberries. As a child, I hated it, but now I remember it fondly...isn't it weird how that happens? So good...strawberry shortcake is the most delicious thing in this world. Especially made with fresh, sun ripened strawberries. As long as I can remember, my mom has had a row or two of strawberries in her yard. When we lived in Michigan and we had room to garden (and soil that was more than just clay), we had tons of strawberries. Tons! But then we moved to Tennessee, and the soil there was not as habitable, but she still managed to squeeze some delicious berries out of that red clay. So strawberries and strawberry flavored things that actually taste like strawberries always remind me of her and of that gorgeous garden she kept in Michigan. Of course, they also remind me of the time I was about 7 and picking strawberries in the garden when I felt some grass brush over my foot. I looked down to see a snake slithering over my foot. **shudders** I have never screamed so loud in my life. And thus a lifelong fear of snakes was born.<br /><br />So the real question here is will this matcha be a snake or a shortcake?<br /><br />Shortcake. Oh my goodness, shortcake. This smelled amazing when I opened the package, like creamy, sweet strawberries. Like, well, strawberry shortcake, to be honest. Guh, I just want to dive into it. I took it to work with me and my mind was blown by it. I kept getting distracted by how good it was. I love a good tea. I'm trying to figure out which six I want to keep in stock and this is a definite front runner. I think mixing this with a little French Vanilla would be out of this world. I love berries so most of my smoothies are berry smoothies...this will be an amazing addition to that particular mix. Now, it doesn't have that hint of tartness that fresh strawberries do, but that's okay. I'm in love anyway. It tastes like strawberry candy, but I know Red Leaf Tea doesn't use artificial ingredients, so I'm very excited to have this. Next time I'm craving a bag of strawberry puffs, I'm going to reach for this instead. Mmmm...maybe I'll take some of this to work with me today too!

review/summary: European coffee at its best
review/text: This is by far one of the best coffee blends, I have tried. The beans chosen are a perfect meld, with what seems to be a lower acidity, a by product of the medium roast I presume. Douwe Egberts did their job right in selecting beans for their taste. A typical pattern in many coffee house brands is to throw together a low grade more plentiful bean with a few mid to high range beans and then pawn it off as a quality brew at a higher price. This often results in a coffee blend without taste. Douwe Egberts however, did their taste test on this blend and came out with a true winner.<br />The beans are roasted much lighter than your typical Euro roasts  think  french roast, again this also helps in creating a coffee that is less acidic. Yet while lightly roasted the beans have been roasted enough so that the oils will be released when put through a drip maker or coffee press, a problem usually encountered with  some of the lighter roasts. Their is a defint natural sweetness in the blend that I feel is  enhanced with the use of fat free milk, the lactose sugar of the milk becoming the only additional sweetener need. A full fat milk or cream would mask the complexity of the sutler flavors here and leave you with coffee that is creamer on the taste, but be on par with any store brand stale canned bean type where you taste the cream rather than the coffee.<br />This coffee's blend and flavor would make it great choice for finishing a hearty breakfast of bacon and eggs or with a lighter meal where the flavor of the foods are enhanced by a milder coffee that would leaves the food as a co-star with this blend rather than an attention grabbing bitter coffee. Happily five stars and recommended.

review/text: I first experienced this coffee in a hotel in MA. many years ago.  Loved it!  I had relatives in Europe send it to me when I had trouble finding it.  Now I get my regular shipment from Amazon. Problem solved.  Very mellow, smooth flavor.  I use it in my Bunn drip coffee maker, french press and my espresso maker. Great coffee every time.

review/summary: Very Good Coffee
review/text: This is a very good coffee, I saw they were using it in local casinos, at our bingo halls etc, and so I searched and found it here on Amazon.  I drink it at the bingo halls with a little creamer and sweetner and it is very good, at home I use a flavored creamer, my husband drinks it black and he like it too.  The additon of Creamer doesnt kill the flavor of the coffee

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I ordered this pack and have been so disappointed.  Following the directions, I found the coffee practically tasteless.  So I kept adding more coffee to the Bunn coffee maker and the coffee has been disgusting at best.  I am either giving away or throwing away the remaining packs from the order.  Too bad because we had just found the "coffee of our dreams" at a big box store and in two weeks they stopped carrying it.  So I must do coffee shopping on the web, which can be a costly alternative.

review/text: I also hunted far and wide for this coffee in stores after drinking it at the Chumash Resort in Santa Ynez. Could only find it online.<br /><br />But after reading some reviews, it seems that hotel-style coffee may be a liquid concentrate, and i can't recreate that taste by buying the ground coffee. It tastes fine, but not better than other brands readily sold in stores. I won't be buying any more online and paying a premium for it.

Everytime I went to eat the bar of chocolate it would be somewhat melted and a mess was made when I ate it. Now there is no hassle of using the foil wrapper to eat the chocolate. You simply open the package, which is ziploc, making it fresher longe, then you put the drops in your mouth. They are not too chunky or hard they are the perfect amount of chocolate. Afterwards there is no mess and your hands should remain cleaned. : ) Enjoy!

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about "bowel tolerance" or "happy bowels" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.  I realize that taste is a personal thing.

review/summary: These are the best!
review/text: I have had hypoglycemia at least since I was 5.  That means I have to eat high protein, high complex carb, low simple sugars in six small feedings a day.  That diet also has to be low fat, low cholesterol, low sodium, and as free of refined sugars as humanly possible.  You can imagine, I suppose, that such a restricted diet can be a monster pain to follow.  Blue Diamond Natural Almonds are a staple in that diet.  And when I get them in multi-package containers like this one, I save a lot of money. They crunch, they taste good, and they're good for me, as well as everyone else!

review/summary: A great tasting and crunchy snack that is healthier for you!
review/text: As I read a book in the evenings I sometimes want a snack.  Being a diabetic I look for things that are low in sugar, high in protein and low in sodium.  These almonds are whole natural almonds and don't have a lot of other additives in them to make them unhealthy.  They are rich in vitamin E, magnesium, calcium and potassium.  They also contain 3 grams of dietary fiber but only one gram of sugar.  One serving is 160 calories.<br /><br />Not only are they ideal for a quick snack they are good to have while you are in the car and driving.  Your family will enjoy them as a quick energy booster without all of the salt.  I like all of the other flavors but to be honest if I can enjoy a snack and avoid all of the salt and sugar that can be added to the other almond flavors I will.  I don't feel as guilty and it is better for me!

review/text: I bought these bars to fill in the void of healthy sweet snack.<br /><br />Also bought them for the "chocolate" factor.  Healthy + chocolate = no guilt.<br /><br />They are a bit gooey, as opposed to crunchy.  There is not nearly enough chocolate in one place for my taste, just little tiny bits here and there, but they do taste good, like good chocolate, when you taste it.<br /><br />The good news is that they are tastey, I would say they are good, and the best news is that once you eat one, it totally removes your hunger.  And it lasts for a good long while.<br /><br />If I had children, or working adults to feed, I would definitely buy these again.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QTZ2RS">Green Mountain Southern Sweet Perfect Iced Tea, 22-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a><br /><br />I'm a TRUE Georgia Girl!! I know how sweet southern ice tea should taste. Well this Chick is no longer in Dixie. I've been searching for the perfect sweet tea for the past 5 yrs. Anyone who has made southern sweet tea the old school way, knows that it takes a lot of time to get the consistency just right. Once that's done the tea goes fast, thus the cycle continues. This tea is awesome!! Keurig makes it easy! Just keep in mind the K-cup is not REALLY sweet. Southerners call the tea itself "SWEET" not because of the suger but because of a particular taste. (This is a hard point to get across if you are not accustomed to drinking many different sweet teas down south) I use a glass pitcher, fill a fourth of the pitcher with sugar, then fill the entire pitcher with hot boiling water. Stir with a long spoon...(careful it will be HOT) until the water is completely clear. It's what we call a SIMPLE SYRUP down south. Before you brew your K-Cup, drop a splash of simple syurp in your glass or over your ice. The Sweet Perfect Ice Tea will then truely be PERFECT! FYI: If you live up north like I do and crave ice tea all year round...You'd better stock up on your K-cups by end of summer. The company considers the GREEN MOUNTAIN SOUTHERN SWEET PERFECT ICE TEA a seasonal item, (the NERVE!!) making them almost impossible to get in the winter and tripple the cost!!!! Enjoy!!!

Put plenty of ice in your glass before brewing<br />2.  Be sure and stir the tea before drinking<br />3.  You may want to add a bit of ice after brewing<br /><br />As with any beverage you will have to experiment with different amounts of ice to find the amount that works best for you.<br /><br />A quick note about Amazon's wonderful customer service.  I recently ordered some of this tea and the box was all bent and some of the k-cups were slightly damaged.  I contacted Amazon customer service via email and with in less than one hour they emailed me back.  They told me to keep the tea and refunded my money.<br /><br />thanks Amazon

review/summary: Sweet and lightly spicy iced tea for k-cup summers
review/text: Is this an authentic Southern sweet tea. No. And, so what? Green Mountain/Celestial Seasonings K-cups are a delicious summer beverage for Keurig owners.<br /><br />My wife purchased a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B40 Elite Gourmet</a> last Christmas. I was reluctant at first to switch from our stainless steel French press but we have now tried more than a dozen coffee blends. The wide range of roasts and flavors available are impressive.<br /><br />This is our first iced tea k-cup. Following the directions produces a strong glass of black tea over crushed ice with just a hint of spice (although the only flavored ingredients listed are evaporated cane juice and black tea). I find I like the tea even better if I let the mixture sit for five minutes before I start to drink it.<br /><br />One serving is 70 calories and contains caffeine. The exact ingredients are: evaporated cane juice, black tea, rebiana (sweetner from stevia) and tricalcium phosphate (a natural free flow agent). Personally, I don't add more sugar (not necessary) but I garnished a glass with fresh lemon.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars<br /><br />Green Mountain/Celestial Seasonings also offers k-cup iced teas - specially designed to brew directly over ice - in the following flavors:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DWYXPU">Sweet Peach Black Perfect Iced Tea</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DWYXSC">Sweet Lemon Black Perfect Iced Tea</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036SNKZ0">Sweetened Raspberry Perfect Iced Tea</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M60630">Black Unsweetened Perfect Iced Tea</a><br /><br />BTW: During the summer, I drink mainly unsweetened ice tea, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ATZOAQ">House Mugicha</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017SZTR8">Ito En Golden Oolong</a> but when the mood hits me, I'll look for a sweet tea. Until I found Celestial Seasonings k-cup, I favored <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RBQ0ZA">Sweet Leaf Tea, Original Sweet Tea</a>. I recommend all of these iced teas.

review/text: My husband loves sweet tea and he is the pickiest person in the word when it comes to food. He actually loves this sweet tea. Having been born and raised in the south, he likes it really sweet and though I didn't think this was as sweet as some I have had, it has a great smooth flavor.

I make my own sweet tea at home using splenda, but this is perfect because I can make the tea early in the morning, put my cup in the freezer and by lunch time I've got perfectly cold sweet tea to enjoy for the rest of the day.

review/summary: Sweet Iced Tea at the Push of a Button
review/text: I got the chance to try a sample of Celestial Seasonings Southern Sweet Tea as a BzzAgent.  I love iced tea and Keurig, but I usually like a less sweet tea, so I have to admit to being skeptical when I popped that Celestial Seasonings Southern Sweet Tea K-Cup into my Keurig.  I needn't have worried!  I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the iced tea this brews.  I used the 6 oz setting to get a stronger tea flavor, and this K-Cup delivered exactly that.  It has a nice strong black tea flavor, and it is lightly sweet, not at all overpoweringly sweet like I was expecting.  Pop a slice of lemon in there and you've got the perfect glass of sweet iced tea in less than a minute!

review/text: i love this tea hot and cold. i actually use each cup twice sometimes three times if im making a pot of iced tea i can run the cup thru the third time and  still get a good color to add to the pot, no sense in watsting the leaves. I do that with a lot of these cups. but this sweet tea is yommy hot for breakfast or with ice in the afternoon you just cant go wrong. and each box is wrapped for freshness. i know the cups are sealed but i like the idea that the boxes are sealed in plastic. i buy a lot at one time. this makes me feel it stays fresher, longer.

review/summary: Tea taste is great!
review/text: However this is not authentic southern sweet. It can be, if you add 2 tablespoons or more of granulated sugar to each 6 ounce cup you brew. Then it comes close to sweet like southern sweet tea is sweet. The tea taste is great at the 6 ounce brew level, but there is no way to get enough sugar in a K cup.

review/summary: 4.5 Stars Interesting Blend of Sweet and Bold
review/text: *SAMPLE SUPPLIED BY MANUFACTURER*<br /><br />This is the better deal at 86 cents per glass(including shipping)  as opposed to the packages offering less quantities.<br /><br />This product is a robust tea with just enough sweetness to keep most people happy.  Oddly enough the taste is almost that of a honey being used to sweeten the tea instead of refined sugar.  Rich  tea flavor and bold enough to withstand the watering down that can sometimes seems to happen when you use the Keuring for making iced products.<br /><br />I love this product. I've been down south and have had true 'southern sweet tea' and this comes close.  As a matter of fact the tea I used to get down in Georgia and Tennessee was somewhat too sweet for my taste.  I used to have to cut it with some unsweetened to keep my taste buds happy.<br /><br />You may be able to find this elsewhere for less but I've been finding that those places are usually sold out during the height of the summer and don't carry the iced teas in the winter.  With Amazon it seems that you may be assured to be able to get it whenever you're craving it.

review/text: I didn't want to rate this product low just yet.  I would like some advice before I give it a lower rating because you all seem to enjoy it so much!<br /><br />I get the strangest aftertaste when I make this tea.  It's almost metallic.  Here's how I brew it:  Large cup setting with some extra sugar, then I add ice after the brewing.  Should I do something different for a better taste?  I checked my ice and my water to see if they were the problem, but they are not.  Also, nothing else that I make with my machine has this aftertaste.<br /><br />Advice would be appreciated, and I will update this review when I find the perfect way to make it, in case someone else is having the same problem as me.

review/summary: Good tasting tea.
review/text: This tea tastes pretty good. As a tea lover I think it could be a little stronger, as it doesn't have a very strong flavor (though I do use my cups twice to fill a small pitcher). It is sweetened with sugar (18g per k-cup, I think) and stevia. I'm not a big fan of artificial sweeteners but I'd much rather it be stevia than another toxic chemical sweetener. There is no foreign after taste, which makes it more agreeable. If you like sweet iced tea and you are willing to use stevia, I recommend this product.

review/text: I probably should've never found this k-cup because I can't drink anything else now.  This is that good.  I will admit its not a simple syrup type sweet tea.  I lived in the south for a period of time and I've certainly tasted sweeter.  Its more a half sweet tea, half unsweet tea but it makes just the perfect combination tea that is just right.  It does seem to brew all the sweetness first though, so it needs a good stirring before you drink. . my only recommendation.  Overall though, this makes a perfect refreshing glass of sweet iced tea!  Love it!

review/text: We go through a pitcher of sweet tea in our house a day, three meals a day; it's a staple to our diet. I say that to mean we're quite the connoisseur of sweet tea.<br /><br />With that, I wasn't overly impressed at first. The cane sugar gives it a unique taste but I still found it weak. BUT... I did accidently stumble upon - if I let it steep in the cup after it's made for maybe 10 minutes, it's profoundly different (and better)!<br /><br />I won't be rushing out to buy these but I was curious as to their quality... not bad for an "instant" sweet tea.

review/summary: It's good, but not great
review/text: I love Sweet Tea.  The Sweeter, the better for me.  This is good, it is sweet, it is drinkable...it does not have artificial sweeteners so it doesn't leave a bad aftertaste.  It doesn't have a strong lemon flavor like some teas have, which is a plus in my book.  If you want a sweetened tea, this is it.  But, if you want a super sweet tea, keep looking.

review/summary: Couldn't get much closer to traditional sweet tea!
review/text: I just bought this despite the reviews that insist it is not sweet enough. With the first sip, I thought they were right. Then, I stirred and it was just right! This wasn't as sweet as McDonalds but it reminded me more of Cracker Barrels tea.

review/summary: The best sweet tea!!!
review/text: I love this tea!!!  I add a little extra sugar because I like it super sweet but this tea is awesome.  The only thing I dont like is everyone is ALWAYS sold out of it because it is that good!

review/summary: Great Sweet Tea A KEY BUY
review/text: This is by far the best brewed tea I have made. I enjoy good quality tasting tea and this takes the cake. It is really nice to be able to have a glass of tea in minutes without all the messy bags. I will be keeping this in stock at my house for sure.

review/text: this is not southern sweet tea by any stretch of the imagination.  it's very bitter with barely any sweetness to it at all.
