review/summary: Two Paws Up!
review/text: My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them.<br /><br />But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise.

review/summary: They like it!
review/text: I learned recently that cats are not supposed to have GRAINS in their food. It causes them health problems, including weight problems. The first few days of trying this I couldn't decide if they were liking it or not. They had always eaten dry food. After a few days on this canned they really started to show that they were liking it. It is a little chunky, but the chunks are easily smoothed out - it's also better to add some warm water with this to make it a little soupy. If it has been refrigerated, let it get to room temperature. All 3 cats like this as well as the Tuna Too Cool and the one that has Shrimp and Chicken combined - but they didn't like salmon.

review/summary: Please understand what it means to go grain free.....
review/text: This product is a good product and really good health wise for your cats. If you are looking at this product you are probably interested in feeding your cats something better. I just wanted to address some of the negative reviews of this food - many of them by people who don't understand that all cat food is not the same. I took the time to switch my 8 year old street rescue Louie to grain-free food (tried many brands before I arrived at BFF), and here are some of my observations.<br /><br />Cost<br />All grain free foods costs more for the same reason that grass-fed antibiotic free, free range chicken costs more per lb than a chicken nugget. It's better for your cat! Anyone who has a cat that's on a farm - ever see it eating some of the corn or wheat that spills off of the truck? Never! That is because cats don't eat grains. In cheap cat foods these grains are used as fillers to round out the portions and are not of any nutritional value to the cat. When I went grain free my cat ate much, much less - thereby negating the price difference. I even tested it a couple of times - my 13 lb cat can eat 2 - 3 ounce cans of Fancy Feast in one sitting - but cannot eat a 3.3 ounce can of BFF in one sitting.<br /><br />Another point on cost. If you are the type to take your cat to the vet and take care of it when it is sick, then you save so much money and trouble with foods like this it is crazy. When you hear people talk about diabetic cats, food allergies and all the other assorted sicknesses our animals are getting - most of them come from food. Diabetic cats - did they continuously raid the cookie jar? All the money you think you will save (but are not actually saving) will go to the health care of your pet in later years. Its the same way McDonalds and Denny's don't have to absorb the cost of all the diabetics they helped create - the taxpayers pay for it through Medicare and higher insurance costs 30 or so years down the line (and sooner with all the young diabetics we are creating).<br /><br />Smell<br />Most grain free cat foods smell. EVO stank up the house horribly and I had to move the cat bowl from the kitchen. Minus all the fillers and grains - you are getting an all natural product that is better for your cat because nutrition of the cat is put first.<br /><br />Taste<br />Cat's are notoriously finicky. Most cat foods that have grains and other filler ingredients have to add heavy syrupy mixes to get the cats to eat them. They take corn, wheat, soy, barley and gods know what else, add some vitamins and then add a extremely strong tasty syrupy mix to get the cat to swallow it all. So cats fed this for a period of time get used to it the same way babies get used to sugars in their formula. Then, when you want to give the baby vegetables with no sugar added guess what? Baby rejects them - they want the sugar! Same happens with cats fed with cheap filler foods.<br /><br />Poop<br />When switching to grain free a cats habits and consistency may change. Their digestive system is learning how to digest what it was actually made for. Same thing happens to humans - look up the "Whole 30" and see what I mean.<br /><br />Switching to Grain Free<br />Its a process more involved than opening the can and plopping it down. Took me months. Google can help you do it but don't expect to just give this to your cat and have her dive right in thanking you for it. That may happen, but more likely than not you have to mix old and new foods until they are used to it.<br /><br />BFF, EVO, Taste of the Wild.... they are all good brands that will improve the health of your cat. I settled on BFF as my wet food because he loves it. I used to give him EVO wet food and he would eat it but he hated it. I still feed him EVO dry food because he likes it. I tried many brands and did not give up on grain-free food because I cared about my cat. I understood as a street cat for years he was used to eating whatever he could and it all was the cheapest, unhealthiest stuff available given to him by well meaning people. He has improved in every way (coat, activity level, temperament, litter habits, etc..) and now is a healthy and happy cat.

review/summary: Great grain free, high fiber, high moisture food!
review/text: My slightly aging cat has had horrible colitis in the last two years, and was defecating on the floor and my bed. The best solution I found was to switch to a grain free food, and offer more wet food than dry, so he will have more moisture in his bowels. I switched to Natural Care LDT, and it solved his problem...for about six months. After finding another steaming pile in my bed recently, and a few under my desk, I decided to try BFF, as my local pet store  just started carrying it. He is a picky feline, but he sucked the Tuna and pumpkin flavor down like a Hoover. One week later, happy cat, no more poop in my bed, which means happy girl. Great ingredients, and picky cat loves it!<br />Note: yes he saw the vet. The change in diet was the vets idea.

review/text: Thank You. I am very pleased. Quality cat food. Good for male cats, high water content.<br />Some other brands on Amazon are made abroad then distributed by US. company. The b.f.f product reads<br />made in Massachusetts. Glad there is Taurine in it. First ingredient tuna, then water for processing,also included: Potato Starch. The Potato Starch may not be for all cats. I am not vetrinarian. I have always fed my cat dry and wet from Premium companies. This was my first time finding a brand for him on amazon. For the price and convenience, I am ordering again... but mostly because my cat loves it. Thank You.

review/summary: BFF Top Grade Cat Food
review/text: Very good quality cat food.  Made at a human food factory with human grade ingredients.  The tuna used is the red meat from the skipjack tuna fish.  They get a variety so this is just part of their diet as I do not want to feed them tuna based foods as their primary source of protein.  Healthy and cats love this.  I try to use this brand, Tiki Cat, Weurva and then for dry food Orijen cat food.  My Himalayan cats are on a no grain, no gluten/filler diet.  This wet food in combination with the dry has led to great coats, no hair balls, good energy and solid not too stinky poo :)

However, it's a Weruva product and is exactly the quality of food I normally purchase (Tiki Cat, Merrick, Natural Balance, Wellness).  There's no grains or byproducts.

Our kitten, though, is now spoiled rotten and doesn't want anything else! They both like it better than canned tuna, which is saying a lot. They also really like the "tuna so cool" flavor. The one flavor they weren't crazy about was the tuna and vegetables, big surprise.

review/summary: Another Hit From BFF!
review/text: I just tried my two four footed food critics on BFF's Tuna & Veggies Valentine and it made a big hit with both of them. It's always a risk trying a new food on my two finicky cats, but I hoped they would like this one because they love parent company Weruva's Tuna & Vegetables <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70O2">Weruva Mediterranean Harvest Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)</a>. BFF's tuna & veggies is a bit different from Weruva's - it has red tuna instead of white and a slightly thicker consistency, though both are stew like and have visible chunks of veggies. And both have an ingredient list that meets my standards - no by products. My twosome snarfed up every last bit of tuna and veggies valentine that I gave them and they asked me for more - but they will have to wait until tonight for that!

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.) That being said, my ragdoll usually only eats dry food and my shorthair usually eats the wet food. Amazon delivered this to my doorstep today and I opened a can and fed it right away to see if they liked it. After taking a shower I came back out and it was ALL gone, and my ragdoll was finishing up what little was left. The cat food box says on the front that it was made in a human food facility, but I don't know much about cat food that isn't made in a human food facility. I still appreciate the fact that they are trying to say it is higher quality. I will probably be buying this brand from now on, I just wish Amazon Prime members got it in two days like usual, but it is shipped from pet food direct so :(.

review/summary: Energetic Cat!
review/text: I recently adopted a kitten just under a year old. At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat.

review/summary: Carrageenan ingredient NOT good !
review/text: If your cat has GI or stomach problems, be SURE to read the ingredients on the label as several of the BFF flavors contain Carrageenan which is not at all healthy for your cat (or people for that matter).  It causes GI problems and heartburn -- the very last thing a kitty needs.  It does NOT appear that Carrageenan is listed in the Amazon description, but if one checks the BFF website, you can find complete product ingredients.<br /><br />In particular, this BFF has the Carrageenan listed towards the top of the ingredient list, so more highly concentrated.<br /><br />My cat needs grain-free food for her IBD and I purchased a few cans of this BFF locally.  The "Carrageenan" on the label got me to sleuthing and discovered some food makers (pet and human) use this as a filler.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Just a heads up for folks ..!

review/text: My 14 year old kitty's mouth does not work so well anymore, and she has trouble eating most of the grain free wet foods, which tend to be too chunky or solid. This awesome wet food is full of jelly and broth as well as meat, and it's PERFECT for an old kitty's mouth. She has not eaten a full helping of cat food in YEARS, but the very first can of this stuff I set out for her was GONE almost instantly. She is usually constantly screaming for treats, but after having a full 3 ounce can of this, she is happy and scream free. I have never seen her take to a wet food so instantly and so completely. Yes, it smells like tuna...because it's made from tuna? It's pungent but she frickin' LOVES it. How nice to see my poor old girl eat every last bit of something. I am just so grateful I found this food! Will be ordering it on a regular basis. Thanks, BFF!

review/summary: This stuff is kitty crack
review/text: The BFF line is great; my cats adore it (to the point of occasionally going on food strike when I try to get them to eat other things), its fairly reasonably priced and aside from the mercury issues, it's a really healthy catfood lacking all the crud that's usually in commercially prepared foods (bad additives, grains, corn etc).<br /><br />This particular flavor (tuna and shrimp) is their favorite, but I also feed the tuna and pumpkin flavor which is a close second.  The only reason that I don't feed this 100% of the time, is because just like with humans, you have to be a little concerned about the amount of mercury in fish.  Nothing to do specifically with this brand - they do everything right.  It's just not the healthiest thing in the world to feed nothing but tuna - the mercury levels can build up and that isn't good.  So I alternate this with a chicken product.<br /><br />Otherwise - this is top notch catfood.

review/text: My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed "stuff". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!

review/summary: Pleased picky eater with this food
review/text: I have 2 picky eaters at home and have bought many of the other very expensive popular brands of cat food without luck. I was thrilled to find these, and thrilled to know that my cats love all the different flavors that they offer. Yes it is on the spendy side, but at least I'm no longer giving away the other expensive brands that they wouldn't eat (because I misplaced the receipt or didn't return them on time). I love bff! And very cool that there is a veggie option to throw into the mix.

review/text: My spoiled kitty loves this food.  I like that this is grain free and the price is better than other brands.  The food is chunky but not to chunky and it looks better than most cat foods.  I would definitely recommend this food to other cat owners.

review/summary: My cats best friend
review/text: I was looking for a cat food without grains, and read the reviews on this line of cat food. So I took a chance and ordered it hoping my cats would like it. YES they do. I have 2 male cats one 12 yrs and one 7 yrs. The 7 year old has IBS and vomits most cat food up. He has not vomited this up once. (YEAH!) My older cat eats this and leaves most of the Fancy Feast I put in their bowls. I am so glad I found this as I believe that the grains and fruits they put in cat food is not good for them.

review/summary: A winning combination
review/text: Two of my cats are very picky eaters most of the time and will only eat kibble or straight up canned tuna. They even turn their noses up at canned salmon and sardines. Even though this food is all fish, I was afraid they might snub it, too, and they normally don't like canned cat foods at all. But they love this. The food has a lot of tuna, but you can tell it has the chunks of tilapia in it. My cats didn't hesitate to eat all of it. I intend to try the other flavors to get some variety in their diet.<br /><br />And I liked that this canned food is very densely packed, not soupy. I just add a little water if the cats need it wetter.

review/summary: Extremely high quality cat food at affordable price
review/text: I love BFF by Weruva because it's incredibly healthy, with only quality meats and supplements and no grains or by-products, but is so much cheaper than any other "premium" brand of comparable quality out there.  I don't even know how they manage to keep the price so reasonable.  The difference in quality is obvious when you open the can, as the food hasn't been ground into unrecognizable oblivion but still has identifiably shredded meat and looks a healthy flesh color, not some unsatisfying 'blah' brown.  I'm a student, so I'm on a very tight budget, but it's worth it to me to purchase BFF for my cats because I believe in preventative care.  Feed my cats well from the beginning and they'll live long, healthy, happy lives with less health problems that will leave me with expensive vet bills.  As for now, my cats and kitten gobble it up in a second flat.  It's obvious they love every flavor I've tried with them (and one is even quite picky).  Their fur is like silk, too.  This is clearly a great food.

review/summary: BFF Tuna and Bonito Be Mine, 5.5 oz. 8-pack
review/text: I recently upgraded to higher quality canned food, first trying the standard Weruva offerings and now the BFF (a Weruva sub-brand?) I like that BFF offers flavors with gravies and others with aspic, as it increases feeding time variety. BFF is certainly a good value compared to the other high-end natural and grain-free products, and even my pickiest senior guy enjoyed the tuna and bonito variety. I will continue purchasing the standard Weruva in Paw Lickin' Chicken since my boys love it, but we are happy to mix it up with BFF. The inclusion of the skin on some fish pieces is certainly a confidence-booster that my cats are getting real food, not mystery meat. I also appreciate the 5.5 ounce can size, as we can share a can each feeding and both cats get their fill.

review/text: Out of all of the various types of cat food I've bought, the Tuna and Bonito is definitely the best for my cat.<br />He likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken</a> more, but given an equivalent amount of this BFF vs the Chicken, he tends to stay happier longer.  He tends to beg for food, and after eating this, he won't beg for almost the full 12 hours between feedings (vet's orders!), while with many other foods, he'll start begging way before that.

review/summary: BFF is better food than some and not as expensive as others
review/text: I did place an order with Amazon for this particular item, but it was canceled because the supplier at the time was not able to provide it (it was not PetFoodDirect - I have had excellent service from them through Amazon).  I managed to order the 4Eva through another source, and the kitties like it.  It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices.

Well, yes, I agree, although, I would have given this excellent cat food the highest rating. My cats, all 5 of them, love all the flavors of this brand. And they are very finicky too.<br />I hope they introduce even more flavors of this ultra healthy brand of feline food in the future.

So far my cats have tried the following recipes and they loved each and every one just as much as the other.<br /><br />Tuna and Chicken 4Eva<br />Tuna and Tilapia Twosome<br />Tuna and Bonito Be Mine<br />Tuna and Salmon Soulmates<br />Tuna and Chicken Chuckles<br />Tuna and Chicken 4Eva<br /><br />I highly recommend this to any person that loves their cats.

review/summary: My Cats Refuse To Eat It
review/text: My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment). My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it. One of them ate a bit of Tuna & Chicken Chuckles and threw it up and the other just refused to touch it. My cats are really picky, though. I'll donate the rest of the case of this to my local shelter where I'm sure the kitties will find it a glorious treat and get my feline food critics something else.

review/summary: Nothing but sub-standard tuna from Thailand
review/text: Read the labels before you buy. All the flavors of BFF list the following two ingredients at the top of their lists: Tuna & water. Every can is just low quality, dark gray, shredded tuna.  The company adds a trace of other ingredients so they can claim to have several flavors, but don't fall for their tricks! Rather, when you want to give your kitty some tuna for a treat, just feed him/her some regular tuna--the good kind humans eat.  Not only is it far superior quality, but it's cheaper, too!

Lately times have been good so I wanted to buy him something special hence my decision to buy Best Feline Friend, Talk about a emotionally based decision!! this stuff is horrible!! it truly smells worse than any cat food I have ever come across not to mention the fact that he will not even come near the stuff, one whiff and he is walking in the opposite direction. This stuff may be good for cats but if they don't even want to eat it, whats the point? Here's some advice save your money and buy your cat what is good for them but at the same time something they enjoy, that's what your best feline friend deserves, not this stuff.

review/text: Just as I was thinking about some iced coffee, the UPS guy shows up with my Cool Brew order. It was nicely packed with an insulated liner. I immediately opened it for a cup. Despite comments I read about the original flavor being bland or not very strong, I found it to be full of flavor and just what I was hoping it would taste like. I love coffee but don't drink hot things in the summer and don't have time to run to a coffee shop or McDonald's for a cup of iced coffee throughout the day. Judging from how big this 32 ounce bottle (1 liter) is, I'll be making myself many cups of iced coffee before I need to order again. And it's so fast! Pour a measured amount (measured area provided on the bottle) into a cup, add milk (my preference) and sweetener, ice and a straw and call it done. I'm much impressed.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MW6JXI">Cool Brew� Fresh Coffee Concentrate - Original 32 oz - Make Iced Coffee or Hot Coffee - Enough for 32 beverages</a>

review/summary: The Untimate Coffee Expereince
review/text: I love a cup of great coffee in the morning but my husband doesn't drink the stuff. I went through all the options. Making a pot for one person. Nope, too much coffee and time. French press--great coffee but the clean up is agony. I settled on a plastic cone with a filter. The coffee was good but not great, seems like it didn't spend enough time in the filter. Then came the Cold Brew concentrate. I read an article about 3 months ago about how pure the system was especially for iced coffee. Amazon had the product. Incredibly priced--32 cups for $10 bucks, about .32 a cup but even adding shipping which is a little expensive only brings it to $$.60 a cup. It is shipped in a cold pack because it needs refrigeration. The company ships in a flash too.<br /><br />But the most incredible part is the coffee itself. I use it for hot coffee and lattes. It's pure perfection! Smooth as velvet, with no acid or harshness and strong enough to make any coffee drink you like with one shot. The bottle it comes in, like a giant flask, is genius. It has a measuring device built in so all you do is squeeze the bottle and a shot appears in the top to pour. No clean up at all. Great coffee at a great price with great service. I'll never go to Starbucks again. This product is AMAZING.

review/text: I have been drinking Original style CoolBrew longer than I can remember.  It is absolutely perfect. I am fortunate to have grown up in New Orleans and now live 20 minutes away. Due to that, CoolBrew is sold at all grocery stores in my area.  Not trying to make anyone jealous :)  (Maybe a littlebit)<br />Just like others have said, it is better on the stomach than regular Coffee, a 5 year old could make it, and it seems most people enjoy it the same way as I.  A little bit of milk with some sweetener.  If you have not tried you must buy.

review/text: I like this product a lot.  It is the best coffee I've had, I think it's as good as the coffee I get from freshly ground beans.  It's so easy to use.  I tried both the original and mocha.  I liked the original a lot, but really like the hint of chocolate in the mocha.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: My love for iced coffee is close to addiction status.  I just can't drink steaming coffee during the hot summer, and brewing coffee then throwing it over ice just leads to a watery mess.  I've tried a couple of iced coffee product offerings which were decent, but since I don't add sugar to my coffee, all were too sweet for my taste.  I stumbled upon Cool Brew and thought I'd give it a try.  All I can say is great stuff.  It could not have been easier - add a measured amount of concentrate (which the bottle nicely provides) to 9 oz of water and you are done.  Great coffee flavor which I can enhance to my tastes.  With the concentrate good for 30+ cups, it's a great savings on other options.  Delivery was very fast.  Check it out.

review/summary: Well worth the price!
review/text: I was introduced to this by a family member, who was introduced to it by a family member that lives in New Orleans. I was soooo thrilled to find that I could buy it online. I bought one and went through it so fast I bought 2 the next time. It is well worth the price. I could pay almost $5 at other coffee shops that sounds like '4bucks'. This is 10 for 34 servings!! My husband doesn't like iced coffee, so he thought. Now I can't keep him out of it! I bought it for me, but I can share, I guess. I also like the self measuring bottle. After I finish off a bottle of 'Cool Brew', I then reuse the bottle to dispense concentrated cleaning product. Which also reduces waste. Super win!

review/summary: See my Mocha Flavor review...
review/text: In brief...we love this stuff...makes a smooth rich cup of coffee any time you want in no time flat.  It is not cheap, but with coffee prices on the rise these days it is still a good value.  We have a preference for the Mocha over the regular flavor.  Hot or cold, anyway you like it, this stuff is great.  We did notice that we had to use a bit more than recommended to get the taste where we wanted it, but the fact is we have gone through several gallons of this stuff this summer.  Java...got to have it and you will not be disappointed with this option.

I have found that reviews of Duc D'o are widely varied, from those who love it to those who find it too lowbrow. This is not $60 a pound chocolate, and it is no surprise that it does not compete with $60 a pound chocolate. For the price, i found it to be better than its similarly priced competitors. It's worth a try for you.

They arrived bruised from the shipping and looked like they were ten years ago (dried out and marked). Absolutely horrible.

review/summary: My favorite Asian chips!
review/text: First time I tried these was when a friend brought them back from shopping in the city's Chinatown. She had bought them mainly because I love octopus and the little character on the bag is so cute. Turned out I ended up loving the chip itself too!<br /><br />These tako chips are rather thick and crunchy (though not hard) and aren't much similar to a potato chip. They are very light and have a pleasant texture. The chips are a rather cute fish shape as well.<br /><br />Of course, the most important thing is the flavor. It's very light and not super "in-your-face." When you eat one, it's not like you're being slapped in the face with seafood. That's not to say someone who hates seafood would like them, but it's not too strong and overpowering. The flavor is very delicious, and they are absolutely my favorite seafood flavored snack food I've had.

review/summary: Great addition to variety of dishes
review/text: While this or course is an ingredient in many oriental dishes, I don't cook any of them. My specialty is "modified" Mexican and Italian, so even if you're not making Chinese food, this is still worth a try. It makes an interesting counter to the flowery/fruity flavor of habanero, and works well with cumin. It does give a rather unique flavor that will remind people of Asian cuisine, but it doesn't overpower or mask flavors. It does take a little experimenting to work into new dishes, and the preparation for it isn't quick and easy, but it's usually worth the effort.<br /><br />Before using it, I place the peppercorns in a dry frying pan and cook for about 60 seconds on high heat, then pour them into a mortar and use a pestle to crush them into powder or flakes. The result then can be added to the dish and cooked in.<br /><br />My only complaint is the spam I seem to have signed up for by purchasing this.

review/text: I have visited many cities in China enjoying hot pot and a variety of other dishes with Sichuan Peppercorns as an ingredient.

review/summary: Great for Chinese (or other) dishes
review/text: I have traveled extensively in China over the past 10 years.  I especially enjoy Sichuan (or Szechuan) cooking - I really love the hot, spicy, flavorful dishes.  I also enjoy cooking these dishes at home; however it is difficult to obtain the true flavor of these dishes without the use of Sichuan peppercorns, which add both a unique flavor as well as a unique feel for the tongue and mouth.<br /><br />Note that Sichuan peppercorns (which aren't really peppecorns at all) are not hot or spicy like chilis or peppers, but are pungent and flavorful.  Don't use them on their own and expect a hot/spicy dish - you need to add chilis or peppers if you want hot.<br /><br />Be sure you toast them gently a bit before cooking with them - this releases the oils and flavors.  Once heated/toasted you can grind them in a spice grinder - or, as another reviewer has noted you can use a mortar and pestle.  I prefer the mortar and pestle because it provides a more rustic or uneven grind, which I prefer and which I think adds to the quality of the dish.<br /><br />I have used with chicken, beef, pork, tofu, and just vegetables, and enjoy it in each of them.  I tend to use quite a bit more than most people might.  If you haven't used them before, experiment a bit to find the right amount for your palate.  I also enjoy the aroma from the peppercorns being cooked - makes the kitchen smell great.<br /><br />I have also used the peppercorns in other than Chinese cooking.  Suggestion: try some with your popcorn next time.  Toast up the peppercorns, grind them in a spice grinder, melt some butter and add in the ground peppercorns and cook gently for less than a minute, then add evenly to your popcorn and enjoy a new taste.<br /><br />These peppercorns seem to be fresh and clean and have good flavor.  They arrived quickly and were well packaged in a resealable bag.<br /><br />I'll be ordering some more soon.

In addition to black pepper, I pick up elements of pine, (like a very subtle clove), a hint of heat similar to mace, and something unique to Sichuan Peppercorns. Would be a great addition to home-made chai, if you like it spicy.

review/text: We had a box of Zatarain's Rice Pilaf sitting in our pantry that I had bought a few years ago.  In cleaning one day, I found it and set it aside to be thrown away.  That night, we were having fish and my wife picked up the box.  Without checking the "Use By" date, she prepared it and it was part of our supper.  Wow!  It was great - better than any rice pilaf we had had at our favorite restaurants.  I added it to our shopping list, only to find it was not carried at our main source of groceries.  So, as I have done in the past, I checked Amazon and was happy to see that it was available there.  Thank you, Amazon.  We love this product.

review/text: I discovered Heinz's version of ranch dressing at a Harvest Festival site, at a hamburger stand, from a pump jar. I dipped my fries into it, and discovered it was a great ranch taste. I am picky about my ranch dressing and was impressed with the flavor. So in looking for ways to purchase Heinz Ranch, I of course first turned to Amazon, the source of everything! Apparently the Heinz Ranch is only available as a concession stand item, or individual servings. No problem - I ordered a case of 60 packets, and shared some with relatives and friends. Thanks again, Amazon, for providing a product I wanted! It arrived promptly and in great shape. Now I can bring it to work and keep some in my purse in case a restaurant doesn't carry ranch dressing or I don't like their version.

review/summary: Fresh, Lightly-Spiced, Crunchy Kettle Chips. Good Value, Good Product.
review/text: After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

review/summary: glad to find them in 1 oz size
review/text: I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettle's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10.

review/summary: pretty good, could be better
review/text: Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10.

review/summary: a slight taste of jalapeno
review/text: one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties, and many others.  There's only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone.<br />If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous...

review/summary: Best chips ever
review/text: The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch. We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house, we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite, never enough bags to get us to our next shipment. I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself!!!

review/summary: Kettle potato chips:  Sweet onion
review/text: WOW!  I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day. Kettle chips are the BEST non-baked chips I have eaten. I decided to try the sweet onion chips, since I've never had them. I now have a FAVORITE!! If you like onions, this is a MUST buy! I will definitely reorder these, as I mentioned above, they are the BEST I have ever eaten! The flavor is GREAT.

review/summary: Ridiculously Good
review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Now, I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, but these chips still taste like the real deal. These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for. Portion control AND reduced fat? Yes, please!  With the Subscribe & Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store.

review/summary: PUCKER UP
review/text: I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).<br /><br />Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips.

review/text: These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.  The taste is perfect.  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good.

review/summary: Quite good
review/text: I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.
