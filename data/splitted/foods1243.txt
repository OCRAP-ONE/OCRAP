review/text: This cereal stays very crunchy in milk for a long time, which is a huge plus for me! Tons of yummy fibers and omega-3 comes with nutty flavor of flax seed and pumpkin seeds! At amazon's price - around $3 - it can't be beat! I was worried that it might come stale or old, but mine came perfectly fine. Expiration date was in 2011.<br /><br />Yay! Will definitely use again.<br /><br />ps it's organic!

I buy, I kid you not, multiple boxes at a time, the large ones they sell at Costco.<br /><br />Try using it, not only as a terrific breakfast component, but as a yoghurt topping, or a cookie ingredient, or even as part of some really rockin' Krispie treats.  And it's a first-class snack, all on its own.<br /><br />Kudos, Nature's Path!

review/text: Friend came over one day and wanted some cereal. I gave her some of this. She was like "uhh organic granola...?" She takes a bite and follows with "this is better than like... normal cereal!"<br />Tasty. Crunchy and doesn't get soggy. Healthy. Filling. What more can you ask for? This is definitely one of my favorite cereals.

review/text: Love, love, love this cereal.  It's the best-tasting granola I've ever eaten.  The pumpkin seeds are a brilliant<br />addition.  As others noted, it's a bit high in calories compared to other healthy and natural cereals but most granola is that way. For a treat for breakfast every now and then it's worth it. Or you can eat it for dinner. It's that good! I put soy milk in it sometimes for a different flavor. You don't need to eat a whole cup of it to satisfy you.  And you can sprinkle it on plain yogurt and fruit for added crunch.  I found I needed to keep it wrapped up tight or it gets "soggy" as do most cereals. Happy crunching!

review/text: My three-year-old and I both love this granola. We eat it almost every morning -- mine with yogurt, his with milk. It's sweet and dense but tastes less fatty than store-bought granola I've eaten in the past. The flax and pumpkin seeds are tasty. It's pretty high calorie (260 per 3/4 C serving, and 10g fat) but also very filling and satisfying.

review/text: This cereal is great! Finally, I can get it without driving around hoping that it will be in stock where I've seen it before. I have previously purchased it at Costco, Trader Joe's and even Big Lots. The only one that had it cheaper was Big Lots. Anyway, I no longer find it at any of these, so imagine how happy I was to find it on Amazon.... offered for less by subscription (I'm not going to stop eating it, so why not stock up?)<br />Better yet-- it ships Prime! SO I am not wasting gas money or time, either.<br />Thanks, Amazon!

I haven't found many cereals that taste great but this one is it! Of course I am also a pumpkin lover but it isn't overly pumkin-y (okay I made that word up). Just try it!

review/summary: really good, really healthy
review/text: We are on a special diet and this is the only commercial granola that does not have ingredients that are bad for us. It is wheat and corn free.<br /><br />I am sincerely hoping that they don't change their formula and start using canola oil and/or safflower oil and/or palm kernel oil like Cascadian farms did.<br /><br />This is GOOD stuff!  Occasionally I eat it "straight" with our homemade soy/almond milk, but usually we use it for "sprinkles" on top of organic yogurt mixed with fruit.  That makes a really good breakfast or lunch with very few grains.  Sometimes my husband uses it as a topping for the rice and millet cereal flakes we buy.<br /><br />No matter how you use it -- it's great!  I try to buy the 26 oz.eco friendly economy packs when I can find them at a sale price.

review/text: I second the problem mentioned by other reviewers regarding the indigestible whole flax seeds. Two more things I am not thrilled to find out after reading the label (should have done it before placing the order)<br /><br />* The "organic evaporated cane juice" is the 2nd most significant ingredient by weight. It is a fancy name but sugar is sugar. There are two more sweeteners down the list.<br /><br />* The 3rd ingredient by weight is "organic soy oil". Organic is good, but it is still fat.

review/summary: The best cereal ever, but loaded with sugar
review/text: The crunchiness, the texture, the nutty flavor and the pumpkin seeds; it's all put together in this beautiful combination, delivering nothing short of an avalanche of flavor.<br /><br />However, it has a fatal flaw, for all of its goodness it's shadowed by its heavy sugar payload. I've got a tip though, and although it sounds a bit OCD, it works. I just rinse it in water for 30 - 60 seconds with a strainer, it seems to take most of the sugar off.<br /><br />I really don't like sugar that much, I've grown accustomed throughout the years to have my food without sugar, and that's the only annoying bit. Other than that, I haven't found any other cereal as addictive as this one; I've been eating it for years (I hope they don't find anything wrong with it or I'm dead).

While the cereal tastes yummy and has decent nutritional content, if you are gluten-sensitive, stay away.  I tried it twice and both times spent hours doubled over in agony.  I suspect the gluten source has to do with how the oats are processed.  I wish food producers would realize that celiac disease is no joke and be very careful about product labeling.

Ten days after the cereal was shipped, it's still listed as 'in transit' with FedEx SmartPost, and there's no customer service number to call about the shipment. I submitted an online query 5 days ago with SmartPost, and there's been no response. I've cancelled the subscription (obviously) and suspect that I'll never see the package or a refund. Too bad - it seems like the subscription service would have been a great deal for this excellent cereal.

review/summary: Good, but beware the calories!!
review/text: I really enjoyed this drink having 1st been introduced to it in the UK. It is a yummy ginger drink, warms you up, quite strong in flavor, which is good and a good value.  The only downfall is that it is high in sugar and that is why i've given it 3 * instead of 4.  It is a little too sweet, i would prefer it to have less sugar/honey in it a) for the flavor and b) because of the calories.  However, I do enjoy a cup occasionally as a treat.

review/text: Loved it!!! I use half of the sachet in a cup of hot water (kinda strong for my taste). I put a few drops of honey and it's perfect drink after  full meal,it helps digesting food and very soothing to the stomach. I even use it when I have  sour stomach,and it works... it relieves discomfort. Perfect drinks for cold weather as well.

review/text: This is the best pasta that you can eat without guilt. It is high in fiber and very good. I will not purchase any other kind. The pasta that is high fiber you purchase in the store (the brown stuff) is so tough and very bland. I recommend this product very highly. Start slow though, because you will know by the affects how high it is in fiber.

I got it at Long's for $4.99 and it was not on sale.  It seems a little much for this seller to ask twice that price for the same thing (same size, same brand, and not including shipping)....even if we are on the mainland and can't just go to Long's to get it.  If you're desperate, get it, but try to shop around first; this price seems silly.

review/text: I wish the seller had provided more information about their product in the online description, as I only learned after I bought it how natural it was, no artificial ingredients, etc. As far as the product itself, it's very tasty with all the reasons why I love pumpkin products - clear notes of the spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. I've never had pumpkin butter before; this a bit thinner than I would like, as it really soaks into the toast  making the toast a tad soggy. Maybe all pumpkin butters have this consistency. It was packaged well, so no problems with breakage.

review/summary: Didn't like this too well
review/text: Good green tea has a subtle, fresh, "green" flavor that's hard to describe.  It's fresh and light, and some describe it as "grassy." This tea is OK, but it has an undertone that is a little off for me. Maybe because it's decaf.  I've tried several brands of green decaf, and none are good.  Maybe green tea just doesn't lend itself to decaffeinating.  I rated this one two stars because I didn't hate it, as one star denotes, but didn't like it much either.  I'm partial to regular (caffeinated) Japanese green teas, and the genuine ones are the best.

review/summary: FINALLY a constipation cure!
review/text: IMPORTANT:  This Review is for Royal Canin "Gastrointestinal Fiber Response" and I'm not sure that's what this one is...(see other reviews). I did not buy this here...<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />I've tried laxatone, lax'aire, catlax, and cisapride.  Though my cat loved the taste of them (except for the laxatone which he eventually got sick of), none of them fixed his constipation problem.  He was struggling to go and going anywhere and everywhere in the house.  I mixed this food 50-50 with our regular Science Diet Mature Formula and now he actually has diarrhea.  I've cut down to about 40% of the new cat food and we almost have it right.  The cat's poop stinks horribly, but at least he can go and it's in the litter box. It's only been a couple of weeks so I don't know about long-term results...<br /><br />UPDATE (Sept, 2012):<br />  Long-term results are great! We call this the pooping food. :) This still works fantastic and I have all of my cats eating it, even though only one of them actually needs it. They also all love the taste and seem to mine for this cat food when I have it mixed with another one. The cats have adjusted to it so they could probably eat it straight now (no more diarrhea), but it's so expensive that I think I'll still mix it (FYI, you can find this cheaper elsewhere online or possibly from your vet; it's not in regular pet stores). I'm at about a 50-50 mix again, partly just because the cats like this stuff so much. I quit mixing with Science Diet since the formula seems to have changed and it smells awful now (neither I nor the cats seem to want to tolerate that). We've sometimes had problems (e.g., throwing up) with the cats when the cat food has run low in the dish because the cats already ate all/most of the royal canin, but that might be from the gross Science Diet formula. I've gone to 1/2 meow mix now, with no ill effects, but the cats still try to pick out the royal canin. I'll probably try to mix with a more generic royal canin one next. I guess the point is that it doesn't matter what you mix this stuff with, as long as your cats like the mix.<br />  Although I'm completely sold on this cat food since I no longer have to worry about being on the lookout for poopy surprises (yuck!), there is a drawback. If your cats tend to throw up or get hairballs, this cat food seems to stain the carpet more than other foods. Sometimes I can't get the yellowish stain out even with my tried and true SpotShot spray and PetBot machine, which have never failed me before. Good luck. If you're reading this, you and your cat are probably very frustrated. Hope this stuff helps you too! I'm throwing away all of the prescription and OTC laxatives I bought because I haven't used them once since I started this food. They better keep making this stuff!!!

review/summary: Cats love it and helps with constipation problems
review/text: When first giving this food to my cat, he developed "runny" bowels so I stopped the cisapride and enulose.  We did well for 4 months and then the cat became impacted.  Now I give the oral cat medicine as needed (as determined by bowels).  And the cat is happy, hunts, purrs and so far so good.  This is a godsend as the cat hates oral medicines and hides and throws up and so on and just the medicine alone resulted in an expensive visit to the vet a couple of times a year and a very sick cat.  What a difference this cat food has made.  Interestingly the vet said it shouldn't make a difference.  But it has made a big difference.  :)<br /><br />What initially convinced me to try this product from Amazon were the customer reviews.

review/summary: Very nice sipping vodka
review/text: Many of us have experienced vodka from our youth, where it was popular for mixed drinks.  Having good taste was about paying a little more to minimize the impact in the morning.  We wouldn't notice the taste differences when used for mixed drinks, or drunk as frozen shots, often drunk quickly.<br /><br />We went to a vodka tasting recently that featured 5 vodkas of varying prices and made from different ingredients.  We sampled them straight up / neat, one at a time.  The best of the lot was the Karlsson Gold.  Yes, it was a tasting sponsored by Karlsson, but it had a good selection of other vodkas, including one we had been buying, but I was impressed enough that we bought a bottle to enjoy at home.<br /><br />The flavor from the Swedish potatoes is quite good.  There is more flavor than just the vaguely sweet flavor I find in vodka.  It is difficult to describe, but I imagine that someone who appreciates dry brandies might enjoy it.<br /><br />Because this is about flavor, you would not use Karlsson Gold in mixed drinks.  You probably would not taste the difference, and it costs more than less flavorful but otherwise good brands.<br /><br />These are first impressions.  I'll update the review in a few months, or when the bottle goes dry, whichever comes first, and give my thinking then.

Had so many issues finding a food she liked and could bite Poodle 30 put an end to those issues.<br />You can read the ingredients here: [...]  (BTW - when all the food recalls was happening, I called and was able to speak to a real person who was able to tell me that Royal Canin Poodle formula was totally safe. I like a company where you can still talk to a person, instead of a recording!)<br /><br />This food is so good, that I give my baby two each time she goes out and comes in as her treat and it is better for her than most treats out there on the shelves.<br /><br />I have shared a cup with two of my friends who have poodles (toys) and both are now using this and very happy with the product as well. This size is a significant savings too!<br /><br />Now that she is older and has some issues with her teeth, I can add a little water and let it sit about 10 minutes and it is still the taste she likes but softer and I know she is getting the nutrients she needs.<br /><br />So, if you poodle has his/her pom pom's in a wad over ucky tasting big dog food, you won't be disappointed with this!

review/summary: My dogs love it!
review/text: You'd think by looking at her that our 8 lb overweight toy poodle would eat most anything, but she and our 4 lb boy toy are finicky eaters.  They love this food.  It's the only one that I've found willing to publish it's caloric content (361 cals./cup), so I now am able to regulate the amount of food fatty gets (224 Cals.) and make sure that our hyperactive little boy gets all that he needs (244 cals) each day.  Stores don't carry the 10 lb bag, and most of them in town don't even carry the 2.5 pounders.  This was a great deal, and the superseal bag keeps it fresh.  Oh yes, the tiny size pieces 9mmx10mmx4mm are perfect for their tiny mouths.

review/text: My math professor is a professional dog trainer and she highly recommended this for my dog. It actually saved my dogs eyes cause hes a really picky eater and we would always feed him homemade chicken and I guess he was very low in vitamin A so after we switched him to dog food (we mix it with cottage cheese or else he wont eat dry dog food at all) he started to see better.<br /><br />Im not a vet or anything but this is my personal story.<br /><br />Great buy. Don't get generic dogfood you need to treat your dogs like a member of the family so dont cheap out and get something high quality like royal canin.

review/summary: Best Honey EVER!
review/text: Just got my first jar of this delicious antioxidant honey.  I'm very impressed and will definitely be a returning customer.  This raw honey is delicious and has bits of propolis and pollen in it.  This is the first time I've ever had any Buckwheat honey.  It's awesome.  The cost is very reasonable, too.  The only suggestion I have that would make it a perfect product would be if they would use a glass jar instead of plastic for this product.  I know that would probably drive up the cost of the product and shipping but I think glass containers are safer and "greener" (if I can wear my "it ain't easy being green" hat for a bit) in today's world.  I highly recommend this product and the company!  :)

review/summary: Solid yeast that produces some amazing aromas
review/text: I wanted a beer similar to the Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier -- a bananay, clovey, tart, crisp hefeweizen. It produces. This is a profoundly top cropping yeast that produces some amazing aromas. I used a very simple extract base. Little more than a few pounds of wheat DME and an ounce of whole leaf Hallertau hops. Fermentation started about 68 and rose to 74 before settling down at about 68. The yeast remains in suspension for a long time, but the suspended yeast and soft flavors from it are expected in the style.<br /><br />This is fast turnaround beer. I started with a 1.044 gravity and finished at 1.011 10 days later. Maybe a week in bottles and its ready to roll. Very nice flavors. Wyeast recommends slightly underpitching or fermenting at the warmer side of the temp range to accentuate the banana aromas. Go at the cool end and pitch normally to accentuate clove. In the future, I would cold crash it over night at least to clear up the beer just a bit. Its not going to be clear as water, nor would I want it to be, but its just a bit murky for me. I didn't cold condition it at all.<br /><br />A few things. You will need a starter unless the pack was fresh. They have a 6 month life on them. Mine was 5 months old. I hit the activator pack, let it swell, and then did 1L simple starter (shaking with oxygenation at outset) for about 18-24 hours. I don't think you can expect to just pitch one pack if the yeast is near the end of its 6 months.<br /><br />Two, this yeast seems to produce copious sulfur smells later in fermentation. I thought my sewer backed up. That will clear, but it takes a few days for the gas to percolate out. You will likely need a blowoff tube. Leave about a gallon of headspace in your fermenter and use a blowoff tube until the krausen settles or there will be a mess.<br /><br />This is kind of a cool yeast in that you can easily harvest from the krausen, rinse it, and reuse it a second or third time because it is so profoundly top cropping. I have read that there are some genetic changes in subsequent generations of this yeast that cause it to lose the banana and clove production characteristics. However, it would seem that so long as you avoided any unwanted organisms in your yeast drippings, you might be able to continue using it for an american style wheat to get that clean, tart flavor without a lot of the banana notes. Just something to think about.<br /><br />These are living organisms so you might want to think about ordering this during the winter instead of the summer heat unless the seller is including an ice pack. I think you will pay a price in viability if you don't heed this advice.

It was not shipped on ice. Obviously it didn't matter, but I know these are supposed to be shipped and kept cold, so I guess I'll be getting them from elsewhere now.

review/summary: THE perfect Hefe Weizen yeast for your recipe!
review/text: This brand is great because of its "Smack Pack" which rejuvinates the yeast while it feeds them before being introduced into my (and yours) perfect beer recipe.  This yeast strain is way better than what White Labs or some dry yeast can do in the end result (your beer mug).  You can use this Yeast for Aventinus, Weihenstephaner and Paulaner Hefe Weizen clones.  Plus the date on this package was VERY recent, no old yeast here!

review/summary: I am an adult with GERD
review/text: I recently ended up with GERD and a really bad bleeding ulcer, due to stress and grief.  I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving.  Some types of baby food stay down,  where as other types cause me indigestion just as bad as adult food.  This specific sweet potato one seemed to ease my acid refluxing and indigestion and sooth my throat.  I'm not at the point where I can eat the whole container yet,  but this is a good start.  This also has a pleasant taste.  Some of the baby food is just bland and boring,  but this one is alright.  Not the best but still alright. Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems.  Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in,  and need to retrain your stomach and intestines.  Just be careful,  some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />By the way,  this doesn't have all the nutrients you would need to survive.  As a adult you'd need about 12-16 small jars a day and you'd need to make sure you get enough protein.  So be careful,  this is only a temporary fix for people with ulcers and GERD.

It saves a ton of room in the kitchen, rather than having them tipping over in the cupboard.<br /><br />One surprising thing we also discovered is that our cat who has a low appetite loves this simple pea baby food too. It has been healthy for my baby and a real treat for my pet. Good stuff.
