review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I have always loved these chips and buy them often at the grocery store. Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin). They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email.

review/summary: two small issues
review/text: I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these "MINI WHITE ROUNDS" and an equivalent order of "TATO SKINS".  The "skins" arrived unbroken while the "rounds" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the "skins" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the "rounds" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a "tostitos" or "mission" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the "Tato Skins" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something.

review/summary: crunchy, tasty, wholesome
review/text: A marvelous crunchy treat, acceptable to even the most finicky toddler. Wonderful with salsa and sour cream, hot spinach and artichoke dip, and many more ways. If they used a different fat to cook them (the label currently says safflower and/or canola) they would be perfect. I love that they're free of GMO but I'd be even happier if they contained a healthy fat such as lard or coconut oil, or even olive or sunflower or grapeseed would be an improvement.

review/summary: Broken Chips
review/text: These are great chips!  I also like the red chips.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon ships these out in the vendor boxes which are very flimsy.  All of the chips end up broken.<br /><br />It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection.  The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile.

review/summary: A rare low-salt chip
review/text: My wife says that she can taste a mild sweetness from the blue corn -- I cannot.  Honestly they taste like regular corn chips to me.  The difference is that without a thick coating of salt attached, like essentially ever other chip on the market, I _can_ taste what's on top of my chips.<br /><br />Me, I like 'em with nacho cheese.  It's amazing to not have my lips searing from the salt as I eat hot dipping dressings.<br /><br />I wish I didn't have to buy a case at a time to get the good price, but the bags are fairly small, so you'll go through them fast at a party.

review/summary: Garden of FakeLime Detergenty Flavors and other Natural Flavors
review/text: I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as "Chili & Lime".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is "NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues.

review/summary: BEST baked chips ever!!
review/text: I had these chips on vacation and could never find them in any of my local stores including Whole Foods.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!

review/summary: Garden Of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips
review/text: Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around.

review/summary: a little too salty for my tastes....but....
review/text: I liked everything about this chip except they are too salty...  I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free.  Balanced them out.  Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to "clean" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.

review/text: These taste great.  More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.<br />Salty enough too, unlike say Tostitos which have reduced the salt far too low.  But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.

These chips are great for nachos or with good salsa, and probably other things I haven't tried. Now that I've been eating them without salt for so long, eating salted chips is like an overload. You'll get used to it and appreciate the health benefits.<br /><br />I only wish they were cheaper and came in bigger bags!<br /><br />My mouth is watering now...

review/summary: not correc size
review/text: This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.

Most of the items I received were only 2 to 3 weeks from their sell by date and are rancid or stale. It was a huge disappointment receiving these and I will never order this product again.Neither will i recommend anyone buy this product from Amazon. It makes you think that Garden of Eatin products are not good but I have bought them before at my local grocery store and they tasted great,so I know for sure that the problem is with Amazon stock. For me, thats $120 wasted as returns are apparently not possible. very very disappointed with Amazon.com, because i shop at Amazon.co.uk very often and have rarely been disappointed and even when there have been disappointments, they are immediately rectified. Amazon.com does not allow refunds or returns on this item, so beware!

review/summary: Causes dark eye circles on my light dog
review/text: I switched my dog to grain free a few years ago as he has itchy, sensitive skin and taking out the junk helped. I have a great dog-sitting situation with my upstairs neighbor, where we take turns caring for each others dogs, and when I found they were also serving their dog a high-quality non-grain food (not wellness), I switched to the same food to make it super easy to just to hand off the dogs and not worry about the food. All was well, until the company stopped making that food recently! The upstairs neighbor decided to change to this food, and I was happy to follow along as it fits all the requirements of high quality, etc., and it's easily available online and at Petco. But I noticed something interesting...my dog's bug eyes are relatively watery (due to being, well, bug-eyed), and the tears have taken on a very dark color since switching to this food. Not to mention he's itchy again! I didn't want to give up on it without a good trial, so I switched him to another high quality food for a bag (doing the proper transition, not to worry), and sure enough the dark tears lightened considerably. I switched back to Wellness for another bag, and man, those dark tears are back. It's definitely the food.

review/summary: The best chai EVER!!!
review/text: Holy moly this is the best pre-made chai I've ever had, hands-down, and I'm very, very picky.  Oregon chai?  SIckeningly sweet.  Dragonfly?  Boring!  But this stuff?  It's complex, very spicy and only slightly sweet.  I became an addict when I had a dirty chai (for the uninitiated, that's a chai latte with a shot of espresso...try it, it'll change your life) at a local coffee shop and it was seriously the best hot beverage I've ever tasted.  I went back to find out what they used: Tipu's Chai.  I can't stay away from that place now, I go at least twice a week to get my fix, and have started making approximations of dirty chais at home too (a bit of very strong coffee can substitute for the espresso).  It's so good that once I start drinking it, I literally can't stop until it's all gone.

review/summary: Love Haribo... but not these
review/text: I love Haribo gummi candy... gold bears, fizzy colas, happy colas, plain strawberries.  However, these (which I hoped would be like the plain strawberries but with the added cream flavor) are way too sugary sweet.  The "dusting" of sugar is more like a gumdrop coating of sugar and takes away from the Haribo gummi texture that I love.  My family liked them okay (not as much as other gummi candies, but much more than I liked them).

They harden up, and then the texture becomes more like the ones that I really like.  I hope these do not go away!  :)

review/summary: Strawberry and Cream Heaven!
review/text: The first bite is like biting into the sweetest strawberries and most delectable cream you've ever tasted! I was hooked at that instant. Yes, they're sweet, but not overly or syrupy sweet. Not nearly as sweet as, say, a chocolate candy bar of any commercial variety widely available. The texture is perfect...chewy but still soft, and they don't cling frustratingly to your teeth. This was my first taste of Haribo candy, and I am very impressed. I plan on trying more based on this experience. But what I can't stress enough about this candy is the amazingly real flavor of sweet strawberries and cream on your tongue. A major treat!

review/summary: This Is My Favorite Haribo Candy So Far
review/text: I discovered Haribo candy this year.  I started out with Haribo gummi bears & I loved them, I proceeded to twin cherries and while delicious, I still preferred the gummy bears.  However, my all time favorite so far is Strawberries & Cream.  I love the sweetness and texture of the sugar and softer consistency. My only complaint is that that the strawberry flavor is barely discernible, if at all.  It's pure sugar.  I always buy the 12 packages because they help to control how many Haribo candies I eat...as a matter of fact, I restrict myself to a 1/2 bag a day.  However, I can't leave a half bag of Strawberry & Cream Haribo for the next day.  I have been eating one package a day, I may have to stop ordering these because they leave me without any selfcontrol.

review/text: The flavor of this product is okay but they are just too sweet.  The texture is more like a firm gumdrop rather than a traditional gummi candy.  Trolli sells a version of this that is a little more fruity/flavorful so it doesn't come off as being so sweet.  They were just okay and I wouldn't buy them again.

review/summary: Haribo of Germany
review/text: Haribo is a great candy company from Germany.  It has been around for a long time.  This company was the first to add citric acid to the gummi bears which makes the candy not to stick to your teeth like the juju gummies here in the states, which I think have no fruity flavor like the Haribo gummies.  I had all kinds of gummies from Haribo.  The frogs and raspberries and the strawberries you can only get in specialty stores, sometimes at the airport.  In Munich airport you can get a big bag with Haribo airplanes but I have never seen them anywhere else.  Now Haribo has factories around the world, even in Baltimore, MD. There is a flavor difference though depending on where the candy is manufactured.

review/summary: pretty sweet ...
review/text: Sure, a candy is supposed to be sweet but Haribo very often understands to find that fine line between great sweet treat and too sweet. These are very sugary with the added sugar coating. The candies are softer and easier to chew than the usual gummy bears or happy colas which makes it easy to gulp down a whole bag in no time - even if the first few bites make your tounge stick ;-)<br />The German strawberry version "Primavera" is a very different kind of candy - be careful not to confuse these two (like I did ...).<br />To give you an idea where my Haribo taste buds come from: love Happy Cola, Fizzy Cola, Haribo Confect and several other Haribo candy that, unfortunately, are not available in the US.

review/summary: My FAVORITE baking bar
review/text: Ghirardelli absolutely makes the best baking bars out of all the different brands within a reasonable price range.  I like to eat these bars straight without even using them to bake because they have such wonderful undertones in the deep chocolate flavor.  Hershey's and Baker's have nothing on this bar; those taste too processed and chalky.  I definitely recommend this bar if you like unsweetened chocolate for snacking, and would definitely recommend this for your baking needs, too.<br /><br />One note about the price, though - it is a pretty good deal to get this for $3.50 a bar.  However, if you can, try to wait for the 12-pack to come into stock so that you can get a better bulk price, and also free shipping, since the shipping for just one bar is kind of steep.

review/summary: Best healthy oatmeal!
review/text: This oatmeal is great, its hearty and filling and tastes great, I eat it for breakfast almost everyday, sometimes for dinner too when Im in a pinch and need something quick and healthy. I change it up by adding fruit or a sprinkle of plain cinnamon (not cinnamon sugar!). I will continue to buy it, not sure if Amazon has the cheapest price though.

review/summary: Tastes a little cardboardy and does contain sugar
review/text: I was looking for a good instant organic plain oatmeal and settled for this variety due to added flax seed. I was a little disappointed with the taste. To be fair, I missed the fact that this has added sugar but wanted to mention it so others don't overlook it. But, the oatmeal had an underlying aftertaste. It reminded me a bit of cardboard (not that I eat cardboard but it took on that smell). I usually buy Trader Joes boxed instant and the taste can't even compare to TJ's variety. Darn it. I liked the convenience and price.

review/text: I was trying to find something good and nutritious for my daughter to eat in the mornings.  She loves this oatmeal!  I make it with lowfat milk and add bananas and she eats the entire bowl.  Lately she has even found where I store the remaining boxes and she will bring them to me.  Its great to find such a healthy morning meal that is quick and easy that she will gobble up.

review/summary: Excellent oatmeal recommend over the target stuff
review/text: I bought this after trying the target stuff.  You know the one with the old man on the front.  I thought it was tasty until I found out the strawberries were artificial! I went out to seek something of better quality and low and behold I found this on Amazon.  I just got mine today and tried a first bag.  It was not too sweet, just right.  I like the flax seeds as well.  One bag can fill about a 6-12 oz cup fine, whereas with the stuff from target I had to use two bags.  Excellent product, I'll definitely be coming back for more after I finish this batch.

review/text: This is probably the best instant oatmeal out there.  I think this is the best flavor in Nature's Path line of instant oatmeals though others are good too.  Mix it with berries or nuts for a really excellent breakfast.  Of course, this is not oatmeal with real thick oats but on the other hand, it does not take 20 minutes to cook either.

review/summary: my favorite oatmeal :)
review/text: I eat generally the same thing for breakfast. It could be either cream of wheat, oatmeal or toast with almond butter and some fruit. I have tried all kinds of oatmeals, organic, instant, steel cut, i mean the list goes on.<br /><br />I have to say this is my favorite. I do have to warn you this comes pre-sweetened so don't go dumping in sugar or whatever sweetener you use before you taste it. I make it with a half water and half soy milk. I also add 1/4 cup mixture of raw almonds, cashews, dried blueberries, dried cherries and chia seeds. This makes a wonderful, nutritious and filling breakfast. I highly recommend.

review/summary: Good stuff, great price, lovely start to the day
review/text: This plain flavor is a welcome alternative to so many over-sweetened and overprocessed quick oatmeals.  I pour this into a glass Pyrex 2-cup measuring cup, add water, microwave for about 2 minutes, and mix in some ground flax seed for a little extra flaxiness.  It's quick and easy, and amazon.com's 6-box price is less than half of what I'd pay at the grocery store.

review/text: I was introduced to this sauce by a neighbor and the whole family is now keen on it. It has just a little more zip than Tabasco but the flavor beats everything, including Tabasco, hands down. My whole family are hot sauce lovers and some like the sauce so hot it makes you cry, however, this is not the case with Matouks....... it is the flavor, man, it is the flavor. Try it on an omelet or with blue corn tortilla chips straight from the bottle. You'll love it! The Amazon service was spot on too.

review/text: Matouk's sauces are made for true lovers of heat, so if you're timid around hot foods, try another brand. If you're ready to bring the heat, Matouk's Salsa Picante brings the flavor of the islands to your food and leaves you gasping but ready for more. If you're brave enough, the endorphin rush will make it worth your while.

review/text: My son is on a Gluten Free diet and finding good healthy snacks that fall into that category, and that taste good enough for him to eat...is very hard.  He loves these bars.  He thinks they taste like cocoa krispies and would eat the whole box if he could.<br />They are packed full of vitamins and minerals and are organic for those that are concerned about that.  These bars are on average, pretty expensive in the stores, but I can purchase them off Amazon for much cheaper and I usually buy them in bulk.<br />If you have a picky eater, or if anyone is on a specific diet, these might be something to consider.  As many know, it is hard to find Gluten free snack products that taste very similiar to regular ones and these really do make the cut.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E46GFA">EnviroKidz Organic Koala Crispy Rice Bars, Chocolate, 6-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: These bars have a lovely chocolate flavor, but it isn't intense.  There are no chunks or chips or chocolate, but rather just the entire bar is chocolate flavored.<br /><br />The organic and gluten-free ingredients are pleasing to me, and I feel they are of high quality.<br /><br />There is no high fructose corn syrup, thank goodness, in these bars.  They do contain invert cane juice, which is 1/2 fructose.  So, if you have an intolerance to fructose, keep this in mind.<br /><br />These bars remind me of Rice Krispie Treats, though not quite as dense or sticky.  They can be messy for small children, but what kid doesn't like messy food?  They stay very soft and fresh in their individual wrappers, too.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this snack for adults or kids with gluten-free diets, or those looking for a yummy and sweet organic snack!
