review/summary: best oil i have found
review/text: I have searched for good olive oil for years and one day my brother in law gave me a small bottle of Bariani olive oil he got in a specialty stoor on Marthas Vinyard. When the oil was gone we were lost. After calling him he told me to go on line and try Amazon. This is our third time and we get the large bottle of oil and the Balsimic Viniger they make to go with it. Positively the best vinager and oil going. We will not even try another brand. I cant wait to have a salad for dinner.

review/summary: A new experience in olive oil - smooth & peppery!
review/text: First of all, this item came well packaged in eco friendly packing peanuts. Run them in a bit of water and they disintegrate into nothing! I am into trying to be 'green' so I thought that was nice. It came on the day they said it would.<br /><br />As for the olive oil, I needed a high quality oil to get the proper fats into my family. I love a good oil but I am no expert in oils. I think this one tastes smooth and peppery, not heavy. I will use this oil for dishes where I don't need it heated, and I will use my cheaper stuff on the stove.<br /><br />UPDATE Jan 17, 2012 - Good stuff, esp on a salad with a good balsamic vinegar. I would give it 5 stars if my palate were more refined and had experienced more EVOO's out there.

review/summary: Best Olive Oil I've bought!
review/text: I was listening to public radio one day awhile back ago, and the topic was on olive oil. I learned alot from this program and it really wasn't something that gave me much thought, until then. My<br /><br />"better half" never liked extra virgin olive oil because of the rancid flavor. Alas, cheap olive oil, walmart brand! Since then Iv'e tried several different brands. I love Lucini and Lucini garlic infused, which combined with a baked potato, is out of this world. The Bariani is really tasty and I've fried with it, mixed it in dips and on and on, it's the most flavorful to me.From what I gather this oil is somewhat made the old-world way, no fancy process or frills, the real stuff and it shows in it's flavor and sight. The only complaint I had with my order was when I recieved my bottle it was frozen solid and luckily the glass didn't crack. I live in WI and this was in Nov. So I faulted knowone.  Don't be afraid to try different brands and I will eventually give the Creta brand from Greece a try.Give Bariani a shot, it's that good!

review/summary: Fan for 6 years
review/text: I've been buying Bariani Olive Oil for over 6 years. At first, I couldn't find it anywhere and they didn't have the online website so I had to call Emmanuele Bariani in SF and order the product over the phone. Now I buy from their website directly. This oil is amazing. And I understand all the reviews, positive and negative. It's a matter of taste. For me, this works. It's cold pressed. It's kept in a dark bottle. I can support it through my orders and help the company grow. Overall, it makes me happy. AND I cook with it. That's right, I cook it - when I need to cook olive oil - and it tastes fantastic either way.<br /><br />Give it a shot, make your informed decision, and then move on if you don't like it. Or get addicted like I am.

review/text: I discovered Bariani at my CSA during the 90s and remember it as a superior and tasty product.  So I ordered a case (6 bottles) of 33.6 oz Bariani this fall 2010 and boy, was I disappointed!!!  This oil has a BITTER finish.  Sore throat bitter! I dont remember it being like this--this bitterness is memorable!  Has the production changed?  Does the oil get damaged by heat in a warehouse situation?  First impression is pleasant but the flavor is soon replaced by an extreme bitterness.<br /><br />I'll use the Bariani for cooking and hope that Im not poisoning myself.

review/text: We like a full flavored olive oil and this one sounded like it might fit the bill; however, it has a rather acidic, tangy taste we don't particularly like.  In an pinch I've used it on salad and it was OK, but I wouldn't use it as a dipping oil.  It's fine for cooking, but there are other less expensive olive oils that are also good for cooking.

The first whiff gives a hint of stale and when blind-taste-tested in my home kitchen by my husband, my ten year old and me- dipping crusty sourdough bread-straight-up, no herbs, no garlic no other flavors- 2 out of 3 of us selected the OTHER first-cold-pressed, Virgin Olive Oil from Italy;  we were trying to buy more American stuffs but will stick with our imported Italian olive oils for now. OK,  for me, this one is fine for sauteeing- just not the best fresh flavor for dipping or dressings. In case it it matters substantially-  the bottle indicates: 'Harvested  Fall '07 and Bottled 6-21-08'

review/summary: Very poor quality
review/text: I have done considerable reading on olive oil quality and sad to say, there is quite a bit of adulterated oil on the market. I cannot determine the true source of their oil, but each of the three bottles I purchased had a very acidic bite to it: either the oil was rancid or simply of very poor quality. Good oil will have a smooth buttery quality to it --- you can sip olive oil with the same delicateness of palate as you would wine. This oil however completely fails this test.

review/text: These were a gift and were as expected except for one detail: these are NOT the regular size Swedish Fish, they are a miniature version.  Each fish measures approximately 1" long and 1/4" wide.  Neither the item description here on Amazon nor the product packaging stated anything about this, so the recipient and I were both quite surprised when he opened the bag!  The taste is the same, but I really feel that such a major variation from the customary should be announced so that the consumer is aware of just what it is that they are purchasing.

Can't really justify the price for Da Vinci.  Torani was strong enough to provide flavor and go a long way before needing to be restocked.  I am sorry I bought three bottles of Da Vinci.  But I am certain now, after my taste testing, that no matter what the flavor, Torani has a satisfactory rating with me, and Da Vinci has an unsatisfactory rating.

review/summary: Tasty Treats For Toy Dogs
review/text: I am lucky in that my 1 year Chihuahua isn't picky about his snacks and will eat just about anything. This product is no exception. I gave him one and he promptly took it to his favorite "eating spot" on the rug and went at it. I like the fact that it is low in fat and has somewhat natural ingredients as well as being good for the teeth. Since Chihuahuas can have dental problems, I am all for products that keep their teeth in good condition, since dental cleanings are quite expensive. Anyhow, he knows where his treats are kept and will eagerly anticipate getting one of these or some other tasty snack. Although it's made in China, my dog hasn't had any adverse reaction to the product. The product can get expensive but you can probably find a deal on it at your local pet store. That's how I first discovered these.

review/summary: Good Dog Treat
review/text: I have bought these many times for my two hungry golden retrievers.  This is one of their favorite treats.  They have had before the rice balls that are on the ends of these dumbbells and the treat in the middle is an added bonus.  They are crunchy so it helps keep their teeth clean.  Will be back buying these as they go thru these quickly.

review/summary: Great, but a little pricey
review/text: I have two dogs, a Cairn Terrier/Chihuahua and a Yorkie/Chihuahua. Both are rescue dogs, and both love treats. Chik 'n Dumbells are their favorites by far. I have to ration them in order to make them last as long as possible. I would be willing to buy a larger size, or buy a larger quantity, if the price would come down. They are easily the most expensive treats I buy. Great product.

review/summary: Pet NShape Dumbbells  32oz
review/text: MY dog doesn't like many treats so I was delighted when I found the small packs at Petsmart.  They no longer carry them. Going online, I discovered that you sell them. For several months I have purchased these from you and my dog has loved them.  My last order seems to have changed.  The texture and color seem different and my dog won't eat them at all.  I don't know if this is a one time thing or the change is permanent.  I am very, very disappointed. The other treats I bought at the same time are the same, or at least she eats them sometimes.<br />So I probably won't be purchasing the dumbbells again, especially since the price has gone from under $30 to $40...<br />Thanks<br />Marye

review/summary: 5th Avenue is #1
review/text: 5th Avenue candy bars are truly one of the best out there.  Far superb to the oh-so-sugary, too-sweet Butterfinger, the 5th Avenue takes the combination of peanut butter and chocolate and adds a satisfyingly audible "crunch" to the whole affair - without the interruption that comes from using whole nuts in the bars, as you may notice in Snickers or Baby Ruth's.<br /><br />No, 5th Avenue's distinguish themselves from Butterfingers in the fact that they maintain some semblance of the flavor of peanut butter within their golden centers. Butterfinger seems to content itself with stirring sugar water with a small dollop of peanut butter (and perhaps some food coloring, I'd dare say) before coating the confection with a thin layer of chocolate.<br /><br />5th Avenue, on the other hand, does the lovers of the peanut butter and chocolate combination true justice. Your teeth will glide through the thick, milk chocolate coating before they are but momentarily halted at the crunchy (though not nutty) peanut buttery center; each rapturous bite offers such satisfaction that you will hardly want to have to wait to swallow one before greedily taking another.<br /><br />This review was written by a lover of other chocolate/peanut-buttery delights as: Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (regular or bite-sized), Nutty Butty Bars, Reese's Pieces, chocolate cookies with peanut butter chips, Buckeyes, and peanut butter pie with chocolate shell crust, and S'mores (you must add peanut butter to your grahams for the perfect S'more, y'know).

review/summary: Good stuff!!
review/text: My parents used to buy the Underwood Roast Beef spread every so often when I was growing up. Sadly, the stores around here don't sell it anymore- it's become quite difficult to find anywhere, really. On a whim, I decided to see if Amazon had it, and as soon as I saw that they did, I had to buy it. The stuff is still as tasty as I remember it to be. We always spread it on bread with mayo, as the spread itself can be a bit rich. I sometimes like to mix it with a little mayo and use it as dip for carrots or spread it on crackers.  When the package came, the whole family decended on it like a pack of wolves. lol The 12 cans didn't last our family too long, but it was well worth the cost. I plan on buying more sometime in the future- I just wish I could find it in my local stores.

I think the prices being asked for the Italian imports are ridiculous.  In a blind taste test, I know this would equal other parmesans going for 10 times the price....guaranteed.

review/text: I'm an avid runner and I was getting tired of eating the really sugary peanut butter. I purchased this kind after recommendation from fellow runners and I must say I love it. You can actually taste the peanuts in it and the honey balances out the salty peanuts with a natural sweetness. If you think that the regular natural peanut butter is to salty I would try this kind! I loveee this peanut butter. It really is a great product. Only problem I noticed is while stirring the oil in, the oil tends to spill out so be careful.

review/summary: WARNING: Addictive!  Ohhhhh so good!
review/text: These wafers need to come with a big warning "Addictive"! It takes a lot of self control to stop eating them.  If I did not exercise a lot of self control I would eat a whole bag. Wafers come in a resealable bag, and in theory can last a long time... but in my house the longest one bag lasted was 2 days!<br /><br />I bought the lemon flavor of Loacker's Quadratini wafers. They have a nice strong lemon flavor - nicely tart with a sweet creamy finish, crunchy and pleasant on your tongue. You can chew a wafer to get the pleasant crunch on just hold it in your mouth and let it melt slowly.  Either way you will get an extra ordinary taste experience!<br /><br />I am attaching a photo and two cookies shown from different angles.  Each cookie is 1 inch square. Each consists of 74% lemon cream and 26% wafer.<br /><br />Wafers have no artificial flavors or colorants, and no preservatives.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Unbleached wheat flour, pressed coconut oil, glucose syrup, sugar, whey powder (milk), dextrose, soy flour, barley malt extract, lemon juice powder 2%, salt, leavening agents (sodium hydrogen cargonate, disodium diphosphate), emulsifier soy lecithin, natural vanilla pods, lemon-peel-oil, spices.<br /><br />Loacker wafers are made in Austria and Loackers company had been known for their wafers since 1925.<br /><br />Ohhhh, so good!

review/summary: Delicate Hazelnut Wafer Cookies: Magnificent!
review/text: These are essentially the yummiest, most delicate wafer cookies I've come across. The hazelnut tastes exactly like Nutella, perfect. Each little cookie is 0.5 Weight Watchers points, which is terrific for those of us watching our figures. I usually have four cookies (2 points) with my tea and am VERY satisfied. They taste so decadent. I'm going to try the Lemon next and hopefully will be able to track down the Espresso flavor!

review/summary: Melt in Your Mouth
review/text: I opened the box when I had two friends visiting!  They went home with at least two packages each as they were having weekend guests.  I still have a bunch.  They were a hit. They are so fresh and so satisfying. I just ordered the chocolate ones for next time.  I plan never to be without them.  I want them on the tea table always.  Trust me.  Read the label - they are great.<br /><br />So, I am adding to the review!  The two friends who were here when the cookies arrived,  I had shared some of the cookies with them  raved about the cookies, wanted to know where I got them and are ordering them.  One had a house full of guests and I had given her 2 sacks, knowing she was having Pumpkin Festival guests - she said they all want these cookies.  I think they are all natural products so that helps.  I have the chocolate ones in my shopping cart but am holding off as I am eating too many,  I ate - alone - one sack on the weekend.  I dare not open more this week.  You have to try these.  I am sure I did not dream about them.  They are not too sweet.  I think you can read the ingredients.  Great for people with braces.  Sigh!<br /><br />OKAY, OKAY, OKAY - I AM BACK TO ADD ON . . . I just bought the dark Chocolate - I don't even like dark Chocolate so I chose that as friends will like them for dessert and I won't be tempted (fat chance) to eat them.  I know I will.  These are the best cookies ever and my lemon ones went so fast.  You will love these cookies!

review/summary: Loved the Dark Chocolate; now I want to try the Lemon...
review/text: I ran across the dark chocolate ones in Italy at an Autogrill highway rest area.  There were snacks aplenty, but the picture on the bag + the fact that it had an extra 20% attracted me.  So, I got a 10.58 oz bag!  I find them satisfying after eating just a few.  It seemed like a never-ending bag.  I googled when I got home, hoping to figure out where to buy more, and ended up here.  I'm glad I did because, after reading some other reviews, now I'm anxious to try the lemon ones!

Some flavors are hard to find (or to nab on Amazon, since they sell so quickly!) but you will never be disappointed by these perfectly bite-sized pieces of chocolate, or lemon, or tiramisu, or (my fave) hazelnut!!  You will be hooked on them!!  The only trouble you will have is knowing WHEN to STOP eating them!!  I LOVE THEM!! And I keep coming back to Amazon for more, as they have the very best price for the Loacker offerings!!

review/text: These are the best wafers I have EVER tasted. I have a sweet tooth and traveled the world (so I have tried many sweets) but nothing compares to these wafers.<br />Also there is one other flavour Amazon does not seem to sell and that is the coconut wafers. Absolutely unbelievable taste and this is an understatement. It has the perfect combination of sweetness, flavor, size and once you start eating it you cannot stop.<br /><br />My favorite are Tiramisu, Lemon, Hazelnut and Coconut. The rest are fantastic too but I have my own I like the best. Italian products - cannot improve on perfect.<br /><br />Watch your waist line though  :P

review/text: I actually was in San Francisco when I first tried these wafers. I fell in love with them instantly. When I got home I tried hopelessly  to find them in my area, with no luck at all. Thank goodness for AMAZON I now can enjoy them without having to drive almost 5 hours to San Francisco. And if I may add very reasonally priced. They are not overpowering with the amount of sugar other wafers have but yet are so delicious. I can't wait to try them once again.

review/text: i grew up in italy and loved these wafer cookies... i had almost forgot how good they were. then i decided to order some just to refresh my memories and ended up eating 4 out of the 8 bags in less than a 24 hour period (i did have some help). everybody that tried them asked me where i got them.i bought the hazelnut ones and i think that hazelnut is such a better choice to combine with chocolate and cookies than peanuts like they do here in the states. i wanted my friends to try different flavors so i ordered tiramisu, vanilla and lemon.....i see they have an option to deliver them ever month or two but i think they should deliver them weekly. lol.

review/summary: Loacker Quadratini Hazelnut Wafers
review/text: I have to say I was looking forward to getting my favorite cookie, without paying the local $4.89 per package.  I always buy from Amazon whenever the price is right, and they have what I want.  The packages of wafers came as expected, however when I got them, one package had it's seam split and wafers throughout the box and they were less then fresh.  The other packages appeared to have gotten excessively warm as the wafers had slid off of each other, causing a "slanted' wafer.  Not the upright wafer cookie I expected.  All in all, I will take a second look before I buy eatable items from Amazon.

review/summary: Love them, but hard to find...
review/text: ...Though this may be simply due to this being a new launch by General Mills.  I first came across these bars in the snack aisle of a pharmacy, if you can believe it, and by the next day, came back for a bag full.  The best thing about them is that, so far, they actually taste like a bowl of Lucky Charms without all the mess of milk and a spoon(!).  The individual bars usually come in boxes of six individually wrapped treats, the price is still quite reasonable in-store (Wal-mart only so far) at around $2.30 a box, so the package deal here on Amazon sounds like a deal.  Surprisingly, I found that these treats are much more filling yet still sugary-tasting than many other cereal bars I typically try such as Rice Krispie bars, those thin little 'flavored' granola bars, or even the Cheerios-like cereal bars.  In fact, Lucky Charms Treat bars actually seem to have less calories and sugars included than if you actually had time to sit down for a bowl of cereal!  So... if you're a parent, you can be at least a little more at peace with giving the kids what they want anyway.  And if you're an adult that's still a big kid at heart (like me), you can enjoy a nice sugar-rush from your childhood as you run for that last bus to work... marginally on time, for a change.<br /><br />P.S. I've also tried GM's new Golden Graham Treats cereal bars and, while not quite the same feeling is evoked here (I'm a marshmallows girls; what can I say?), I'd recommend those as well if you want a little change of pace.  They're just a little too sticky for more than the occasional, at least for me.

review/text: Tea's Tea (Ito En) generally makes pretty good products. This Apple Black Tea is a good combination of light apple flavor that doesn't overpower the tea itself; the blend is smooth with no harshness. It is not too sweet, but adds just the right amount of flavor to an already excellent black tea. This is probably one of the best flavored teas made by Ito En. Buy in bulk.. I find it difficult to find these teas in my area, so I love the subscribe & save program for this!

The dryland hills of the Palouse in eastern Washington and northern Idaho produce the best lentils, dry peas, garbanzo beans and wheat, much of which are exported to India and Asia.  Pardinas are great in soups, salads, casseroles and rice pilafs.  Palouse Brand are the only brand of lentils in my kitchen.
