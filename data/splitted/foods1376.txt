review/summary: fruition snack bar
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I am not a vegan, & I ordered this product assuming it was similar to a granola bar. That being said, I think that vegans or those on raw food diets will probably love this product. I am apologizing in advance for my ignorance to the vegan lifestyle & raw food diet.<br /><br />The bar has just enough strawberry taste so as not to be overwhelming, & the taste isn't artificial. I also love that each bar contains 4 grams of fiber because it can be difficult to find high fiber foods that also taste good. I would eat these bars based on the fiber content alone. The cost seems high to me, but I am not used to buying these types of food. Overall, I would say that the Fruition bar tasted pretty good to a meat eater.

review/summary: Aftertaste ...
review/text: I have had a Fruition Strawberry Snack Bar for my afternoon snack today.  The taste is unusual and one can taste the elements, a bit of nuts, some dates and oats, and strawberry puree.  The bar is nicely chewy without pulling out your teeth - not as crunchy as granola, which is a good thing.  I give this item 4 stars.  It loses one star because there is a sort of sour aftertaste that lingers.  Overall they are good.

review/summary: Great Energy Snack for hikes or bicycle rides
review/text: I received this product throught the Vines program and could not have been more surpised or pleased with a product.  If you have ever had a Cliff Bar or Laura Bar and wished for something between the two, look no further!  This bar comprises what I feel is the best of both.  It is easy to chew (not hard or gritty) and it is also not sticky (who needs sticky hands when you are either hiking or bicycling?).<br /><br />The bars are easy to open one handed while riding and do not require a ton of water to consume!  Do not let go of the wrapper though, remember to put it into your pocket!  The package that I received were strawberry and while the bars have a good fruit flavor, I would have been hard pressed to say "strawberry" if I had not known ahead of time.  Still, they are convenient, taste good, and are easy to carry in a Jersey pocket or pack.<br /><br />These bars have earned a definate place in my riding essentials and hiking essentials list.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: A yummy and healthy snack bar.
review/text: PROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar, Strawberry is a very yummy treat for your taste buds and it's all natural goodness.  I was surprised by the fresh taste of this fruit bar (a lot of different bars I have tried over the years tend to be kind of stale) and for being a vegan friendly/health food, I was impressed by it's taste.  If you're looking for a natural alternative to the plethora of mass produced and chemically enhanced nutrition/energy bar then you'll want to pick up one of these.  Try it. you'll like it.

review/summary: Healthy, but not a great taste
review/text: I took these into work for my coworkers to try.  Oddly, some of them complained it was too sweet, others that it was not sweet enough.  There seems to be the same range of opinion in these reviews.  I suppose we all have different ideas of what constitutes 'sweet'.  The overall verdict on the bars was that they were acceptable, but not great.<br /><br />The texture is soft, and slightly chewy - a paste.  The flavor is mostly dates or figs, with only a hint of strawberry.  Neither texture nor flavor were to my personal taste.<br /><br />If you incorporate supposedly healthy snack bars into your diet, then you want as much variety as possible, so you should try one of these to see if it suits.  But take note of the price.

review/summary: Nasty.  My dog wouldn't eat it.
review/text: I have never written a one star review.  Ever.  Now, I've broken that hurdle with these bars.  I'd give them minus stars if I could.  They're that bad.  What putrid cesspool did these come from?  I've seen more appetizing grizzly bear poop that probably would've tasted better.<br /><br />I picked these up from the post office and was hungry and thought I'd try them.  Strawberry, organic and all natural -- sounded really good.  I eat organic and all natural foods, so it's not like I'm  unfamiliar with the concept.  The box said they were vegan.  Okay, not all vegan stuff is great, but a lot is pretty tasty.  This stuff is horrid.  I can't begin to tell you what they taste like -- sickly sweet paste with sawdust and a bit of strawberry flavor might come close.  The word "super food" is a lie -- I hated the bar immediately, regardless of how good it was supposed to be for me.  I handed a piece to my husband who likes twigs and granola and he made a face.  One of my dogs took a sniff and walked away.  I convinced her to take a piece and she set it down and sort of ate it --  and then looked at me like I had played some cruel joke.<br /><br />Now I'm stuck with 11 bars to foist off on people I hate.  I could've gotten a cool book read and instead I opted for this.  Don't buy these, they're nasty.

review/summary: I've run out of them and can hardly wait for more
review/text: I wrote a four-star review of this product 14 days ago. How do i know that? Not by the date, but because I've just finished the last bar. I had written I liked this product, but now I'm hooked! In spite of the high price, I will be ordering more. Very sneaky, Probar, for giving them away. And now, fourteen days later, I realize that my four star review had to go. The Fruition bar is now my favorite snack.<br /><br />These are not "granola bars." Their texture is akin to a Fig Newton's center. I had originally written that I wished they had more variation in texture, but I came to really love the chewy, gummy quality of these bars, and enjoy the simplicity of them. Doesn't sound very appetizing, but they are quite delicious, and the 1.7 ounce bar actually fills me up, which is not something I can say about any other snack bar I've tried.<br /><br />There is not much strawberry taste, which I find good, for strawberries, when not fresh, can taste truly fake. These do not. In my opinion, they have just about the right amount of sweetness, though one reviewer wrote "too sweet". Sweetness is rather a Three Bears kind of thing, isn't it? Unless there was either no sweetness at all or a ridiculous amount, sweetness is one of the most subjective tastes there is. I know one person who thinks three tablespoons of sugar in one 6 ounce cup of coffee is perfection, so if you're anything like him, pass these by and pick up one of those snack bars that is a candy bar in misleading packaging. This is not one of those!<br /><br />The predominant taste is of dates, quite like a the aforementioned Fig Newton, but less sticky. The date paste, oats, and brown rice syrup are all organic, but the rest of the product is not, which is too bad. Another negative is the relative lack of nutritional value for a 160 calorie bar, but it's about the same as most. Since I've enjoyed these bars so much, I'm not complaining about any of it - just supplying information.<br /><br />I love the chia seeds, and I would imagine they add greatly to the price of this product. For whatever reason, those seeds are expensive - I've seen them sold for sixteen to twenty bucks at health food stores, so when I'm grumbling about the price of the Fruition bar, I should keep that in mind. I add chia seeds to many foods. They're great for the digestive system.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a big taste sensation, you might be disappointed. If not, I'd highly recommend these bars. I'm sorry I've run out. That's a great review in of itself.

review/text: If you actually finish eating an entire bar, then good for you because you must have no taste buds. If I didn't get these for free, I would never even consider purchasing them. Nobody cares about how healthy something is if it feels like a brick sitting in your stomach. I brought the rest to work to get rid of them and the reaction there was exactly the same as mine. Needless to say, I threw the rest in the trash. Forget this strawberry 'snack' bar and eat a real piece of fruit instead.

review/summary: Wholesome, yes; delicious, no
review/text: The manufacturer claims these snack bars are made with organic, vegan ingredients. The top four ingredients, as listed, are organic date paste, organic rolled oats, organic brown rice syrup, and strawberry puree. While it's clear these bars are nutritious and very possibly wholesome, they don't really taste good.  In fact, they look kind of ugly and unappetizing upon opening, and sort of smells funny, too.<br /><br />Each bar weighs 48 oz. and packs 180 calories, 20 of which from fat. There's 0g saturated fat and 0g trans fat (remember, 0g means anything less than 0.5g, since these guys are allowed to round the numbers). Cholesterol is 0mg and sodium 20mg. Total carbs is 34g, with 4g of dietary fiber and 22g of sugar, not great if you're diabetic.<br /><br />In short, if you love wholesome foods, you'll probably like this. But if you want healthy foods that also taste decent, this is probably not it, but perhaps still worth a try.<br /><br />Box says "made in the USA," but no mention of where the ingredients come from.

review/summary: tasty date bar with strawberry flavor
review/text: ***Edited on 5/25/2010***<br />I've eaten a few of the bars and shared them with others.  Everyone really likes them.  My only problem is that I believe I am allergic to something in them.  I find my throat and inner ears get itchy when I eat them.  I can't blame the bar too much since I'm the one with the reaction.  I rarely react to foods, so this was a surprise to me.  I'm adding this as a note for others who may have allergies.<br /><br />****original review***<br /><br />I eat lots of different "snack bars."  I've tried a number of different vegan or organic bars and these rate up there will the top ones.<br />In essence, these are date bars with a strawberry flavor.  The strawberry taste was more an aftertaste for me not hitting until well after I had started eating the bar.  They are soft and chewy and a nice snack.  I tried eating it for breakfast (I'm not a big breakfast eater, but eat a lot of these types of bars for breakfast), but I was hungry an hour later.  So, they are good for a quick snack, but I wouldn't rely on it for keeping hunger away for more than an hour or two.<br />If you don't like dates, avoid these.  If you are looking for an abundance of strawberries, don't look to these.  If you want a quick snack that is healthy, then go for it.

review/summary: Strawberry/Date flavored snack bar
review/text: Lately I have been trying to avoid the sugary snacks and started buying snack bars that have more healthy nutritional values.  Having just finish off my box of Clif bars, I was interested in trying these PROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bars.  Taste is slightly higher than the bland of the oatmeal with a Strawberry flavoring mingled with Date Paste.  Not an unpleasant taste but only one of my kids like it.  The ingredients show no sugars added so the 22g of sugar must come from the Date Paste, Brown Rice Syrup, Strawberry Puree, and Apple Juice.  The superfood name is more than likely derived from the additional ingredient of white and black Chia Seeds.  In today's health world there are many Chia Seed claims, but I'm not sure all of these are proven yet.  This is not a bad snack bar and does satisfy the afternoon hunger cravings.  With the price of over $2 a bar, these are considerably higher than other snack bars out there..I think Clif bars were around $1 per bar. I would still look into buying a few of these to have on hand when the vending machine starts calling.

review/summary: It's a date bar!
review/text: If you were to give me this bar site unseen I never would have guessed it to be a strawberry bar.  It's not.  The primary ingredient is organic date paste, followed by oats, brown rice sugar, and then finally strawberry puree.<br /><br />But it's not a bad taste at all, especially if you like dates like I do.  Although the bar is gooey, it breaks down fast and doesn't stick to your teeth.  It's like eating the insides of a Fig Newton, seeds and all.  I don't taste any cashews although they are also listed as an ingredient.<br /><br />Although the taste is not what I expected, this is not a bad fruit bar.  It's not crumbly or crunchy and it packs easily inside a backpack.  But if it's strawberries you want, you may want to look elsewhere.  Although there are strawberries in this bar, the taste is well disguised.<br /><br />One bar yields 160 calories, 3% fat, 11% carbs, 1% sodium.  This is not recommended for diabetics.

review/summary: they must be healthy
review/text: There are foods that are so good, you eat them even if they're bad for you.  Then there are foods you have to kind of force yourself to eat because you know they're healthy.  This bar leans toward the latter type.  If you took strawberry oatmeal, mixed in some wheat germ for added grainy texture and somehow got it congeal/solidify into a bar these would be the end result.  True, I don't find them as inedible as a Soyjoy bar (which can only be described as flavored, pressed sawdust).  These are a dense, filling and portable nutrition bar not to be mistaken for a treat.  I'm going to put the rest of mine in the car for emergency rations should I ever get stuck in an inordinately long traffic jam...or maybe a snowdrift.

Lays in your stomach like a lump of...well. Now, it is a very healthy slab of icky paste, and I like that it's not too sweet. It is also gluten-free if your branch of religion believes that oats are gluten-free. However, these lumps will only serve to be my desperation snack for those extra hungry late afternoons.

That being said, I think a good truffle oil can really accent certain dishes with nice truffle essence and flavoring. I thought I was getting a good deal on this white truffle oil when I found it. However, it had absolutely no flavor or scent of white truffles at all. Literally smelled and tasted just like regular olive oil. I should have returned it after first opening it, but didn't bother. I will have to be very selective and look for products with many positive reviews going forward when buying truffle oil.

I love the smells like the heater kicking on for the first time in the fall, the onions/celery/bell pepper being cooked up for stuffing, etc. My family has been big Pennsylvania Dutch Egg Nog drinkers. Love the stuff and love that it's cheap (BIG family). I spent the holidays with my in-laws in the northeast and had this stuff for the first time. From then on, I was hooked!! You have to like egg nog of course, but the fact that it's chocolate too is even better. Very creamy, but not too thick like some other brands can be. The only drawback is I can't find the stuff where I live so I have to ship it in, which turns out to be pretty expensive in shipping costs especially since the product is usually less than $10 a bottle! I would recommend this to every egg nog lover!!

And I LOVE that you can put it in the dishwasher & don't have to worry about a wood handle or bristles burning and/or trapping bacteria - my old brush always kindof gave me the heebie-jeebies, basting raw meat with it and then having to hand wash and air dry - thoughts of salmonella were never too far from my mind.  Definitely an improvement over standard brushes (which trap either too much or not enough sauce usually anyway - this one picks up just the right amount.)  This is one grilling tool that is going to get some use in my oven cooking, too!

review/summary: Works Great - Almost
review/text: The Grill Friends Silicone BBQ Brush works great, almost.  Over the years I have used a variety of BBQ brushes and mops, some working better than others.  Friends, and various articles, have sung the praises of using silicone brushes and mops, especially in regard to clean up.  The clean up is fantastic and quick.  The angle and length of the Grill Friends brush is good, although a little longer would be nice.  My only negative observation is that a bristle brush provides better coverage and holds more sauce.  Recognizing that this is the nature of the silicone beast, I really shouldn't gripe.  I use it and like it, and feel it works well.  I have recommended it to friends, so all-in-all, it's pretty darn good, and it's at a great price.  How it holds up remains to be seen, but if you are looking for a silicone brush, you should consider this one.

review/summary: Saved me from 2nd degree burns
review/text: My wife was getting a little tired of me torching my arm hairs every time we wanted to have BBQ chicken so I decided to get this item in hopes that it would save me from my own ineptitude.  Luckily, in this case machine has proven smarter than man again (or at least smarter than this man) and I could not be more pleased with this high-quality grill tool.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to grill without the trips to the ER.

review/summary: Awesome Grill Brush!
review/text: Does a wonderful job with the sauces and cleaning is very easy. Nice bent design makes it easier to apply sauces to the items towards the rear of the grill without burning yourself on the warming tray above. Would recommend this a thousand times over the traditional bristle brushes that are almost impossible to clean.

review/text: We were in the market for a new basting brush for the grill when we singed the hairs on our plastic basting brush. This one works great! It doesn't hold as much sauce as traditional basting brushes--but it also does not pick up sauce from what you just basted like traditional basting brushes can do. It's also incredibly easy to clean.

Our favorite is fried haddock in coconut oil with a sprinkle of fresh lemon, salt and fresh pepper. Simple, and perfect.<br /><br />You can also combine with a little egg and cream to make a lovely crumbly (and low-carb) pie crust. Great for quiche.<br /><br />Bob's quality is very high and this is a good price for 24 oz.

review/summary: Perfect size snacks for Dog Toy
review/text: Until recently I was purchasing these snacks at my local Pet Supermarket. They no longer carry them so I went to Amazon.com. The reason they are perfect for my two dogs ( a Lab and a Chow mix) is not the size obviously but because I have a dog toy that is one of those toys that you pull out the center and fill the different layers inside with treats. After putting the center piece back in you shake it around and the dog has to learn to push it with his nose or paws to get the treats to lay just right to fall out. Well my Lab learned in one day and just loves this toy. The ONLY treats that I have found that fit are this brand and he loves all the flavors but especially the cheese flavor and the yogurt brand. There are quite a lot in one bag and reasonably priced. Yes, I will buy more!<br />Buddy Bits Rocks!

review/summary: Buddie Bits Review
review/text: My three chihuahuas (4 lbs, 8 lbs, 9.5 lbs) love these little treats.  The treats are small so that they are easy on their little mouths and teeth and they are small enough not to contain way more calories that I want them to have (have to keep them trim and healthy).  They are also lightly crispy rather than hard and crunchy (many chihuahuas have dental problems), so I don't have to worry about gum  or tooth damage or pain.  From the response that I get whenever my chihuahuas just see the package in my hand and the way they dance around until they get their treat, I have no doubts about how much they enjoy these little crispy treats.<br /><br />I first purchased Buddy Bones (a bigger treat but same recipe) from my local Pet Supplies store and broke them into smaller pieces because they were larger treats and my little dogs had some trouble chewing them.  Pet Supplies quit carrying these treats so after checking Petsmart and Petco, I was getting a little discouraged.  Then I had the (its seems to most non dog lovers I'm sure) thought to try on Amazon and here they are. Not only did I find the treats my dogs love, but I found a much smaller version and I do not have to break them up into smaller pieces.  Now when it's treat time, my three little dogs don't look at me with disappointment any more.

review/summary: My Dog Loves These Treats - Far More Than Any She Has Ever Had In Her 12 Years As My Companion
review/text: I received these Best Buddy Bits for my dog about 6 weeks ago - and she absolutely loves them.  At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats.  That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one.  She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling.  However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats.  I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me.  I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.<br /><br />My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds.  However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats.  Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats.  I am certainly glad I purchased four bags of these Best Buddy Bits.<br /><br />I will have to tell you that until I received my shipment from Amazon, for some reason, I thought these treats were named Best Buddy BITES.  I do not know how I made such a blunder.  Imagine my embarrassment (in front of my dog since she was the only one around) when I realized that I had been wrong this entire time. Oh well, at least I am certainly straight on the name now!<br /><br />One last item, the Crude Fat (min) level of these treats is 13%, it is a bit more than I usually like to give my dog, but I will overlook it on these treats because she absolutely goes bonkers for these treats.  The things I do for my dog.

review/text: Best Buddy Bits are perfect for training.  I have 2 small dogs that I have trained in agility and as therapy dogs.....they won't even take another type of treat. Also, great because my hands don't get the smell on them from the other type of treats that are soft and chewy, so I can leave these in my pocket or hand without fear of the smell getting on me....so nice...people that train dogs understand this......  Will do all their tricks and listen perfectly for these treats......was so happy to find them on Amazon, my local pet store carried them for a long time then tried something new. I think they are going back to Best Buddy Bits after talking to the manager, if not I will continue to purchase them through Amazom.com.  THANKS!!!!!

review/summary: Yeah  for Best Buddy Bits
review/text: Our dog Callie loves these treats.  Her Auntie from Connecticut sent her these for her birthday and she loved them so much that after she ran out, we found them at Amazon. (of course)  We bought 2 more bags.  Callie sniffed the box they came in and got all excited.  She has the nose of a lab.  She is a 60 pound dog and these little treats go a long long ways.  They are small in size but get so much reward for the bite.  One bag will lasts for several weeks because you choose how much to give.  You can give 1 or 10.  The bag never seems to finish.  There is a lot of enjoyment out of one of these little bags because you can teach your dog tricks and reward them with like I say 1-10 little bits.  We love them also because they are healthier than other treats.  She loves them because they are good.  That's all that matters.  By the way you can't beat the price.

review/summary: best dog food around
review/text: I've been giving my dog this food since she was a few months old.  We just recently switched to the adult version.  She is very healthy and I get compliments all the time about how wonderful she looks and how shiny her coat is (she's a chocolate lab).  I tried a couple other foods before Bil-jac and they always gave her slightly runny stools and fouler gas.  The gas is still there (she is a dog after all) but it's not as bad.  I've recommended it to others and they've reported back how much their dogs like it and how much healthier they seem.

review/summary: Dogs Love it.
review/text: First off, I am a member of BzzAgent, a product testing commuity and so I reeived a coupon for a free small bag.<br />I have 3 dogs.  Two are seniors and one is a pup.  We tried it on the two dogs outside first considering our indoor dog has an extremely sensitive stomach.  The two outside loved it.  Their bowl was empty an hour later when I walked back outside, which is a great sign.  The brand is a reliable brand that actually tells you how much meat is in their product.  The only downside is at my local store, a 6lb bag is almost $20.  Even with the free coupon I still had to pay a couple of dollars and tax out of pocket.

review/summary: Excellent Dog food For Active Dogs
review/text: We recently were given some Bil Jac from Bzz agent to try out.  We now have a new family favorite!  I just love Bil Jac and our dogs do too!  They actually prefer it to our old brand.  They also are one of the few dog food companies that tell you how much food you have. It has added benefits in that it's packed with nutrients so the dogs need less food, and then well you can figure out the rest!

review/summary: Bil-Jac - The Best!
review/text: I can't say enough about this brand and compnay. They are in the USA and have been in bussiness for over thirty years even though they do not do commercials.<br /><br />Please visit their website to understand their quality control and cooking methods.<br /><br />No gluten<br />never been apart of a dog food recall!<br />Made in the USA<br />balanced and easily digestible<br />fair price<br />10lbs of fresh chicken per 15 pounds of food<br /><br />I have fed my last three dogs this brand and use the large breed primarily because it also has the Glucosamine and Chondrotin for joints. I have a 20lb 1 yr old cocker spaniel (female) and a very large 75 lb Stantard poodle (male)<br />They chose Bil-Jac after many trials. Elvis my big poodle is 4 yrs old and Scout is 1 yr old. Both live on the lake and are very active all year round.<br /><br />Please choose a food like this one with meat as the first ingredient and u should be ok. Ofcourse some people will have dogs that require rx food for special problems but this food is solid.<br /><br />On premium foods like Bil-Jac you dog will eat less because each serving contains more of all the good things than lesser foods. This also means less doo doo and illness in general.<br /><br />Thsi food is guaranteed by Bil-jac and their retailers even if the bag has been opened!<br /><br />Don't forget viit their site and you'll understand. Also remember dogs are omnivores not carnivores so they need some digestible carbs.<br /><br />Did you know that most food allergies come from fillers, dye, poor quality etc in dog foods? The higher the qaulity and cooking and processing etc the less likely you are to have allergy issues or other problems.<br /><br />Good luck and do give Bil-Javc a try since you have nothing to lose and everything to gain!<br /><br />amy

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.

review/summary: Bil-Jac Dry Dog Food - Nice to the chickens your dog will eventually eat.
review/text: I received a free 5 lb bag of Bil-Jac dry dog food that I received as part of a Bzz Campaign for being a Bzz Agent.  After allowing my precious little Cavalier King Charles Spaniel to consume this for the past month, I have to say I am pretty impressed.  Here's the rundown of what I liked (and didn't) about it:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-They use a TON of chicken to make the dog food - 10 lbs of chicken for a 15 lb bag! (read, less fillers)<br />-the chickens mentioned above are raised on a family farm where they free to happily run around until your dog eats them :)<br />-my  picky dog LOVED the taste of the food and gobbled it up every night (I may need to try their diet variety next)<br />-my #1 favorite thing about this dog food is my dog did not throw up the entire time she was eating it.  She is prone to episodes where she cries out in pain from having a sick stomach and throws up all over the place.  Didn't happen the month she was on Bil-Jac but happened as soon as we ran out and I served her old dog food to finish it up.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-although they use less fillers than other dog food, the fillers they do use are made out of corn. There is a lot of debate on whether corn meal is good for dogs.  Bil-Jac's website says they use a process that is highly digestible and is healthier than rice.  I'm not completely sure.<br />-price.  A 5 lb bag will run you about $17.<br /><br />Is the price tag worth it?  For me and my dog the answer is YES.  Having a food that my dog likes (and that I don't have to clean out of my carpet when she regurgitates it) is important to me.  Plus I don't mind paying a little extra for those happy chickens. :)

review/summary: Insanely powerful
review/text: I bought this oil after reading all of the reviews that mentioned just how strong it is.  However, it can't be understated just how powerful it is.  I have been using it for making cinnamon hard candy.<br /><br />I put a half teaspoon of the cinnamon oil in a blue, Kitchenaid measuring spoon and set it aside for a few moments.  When I picked up the spoon again, I noticed that the oil was blue colored.  Upon further inspection, I discovered that the oil had actually eaten away at the plastic--it was like I had put nail polish remover (acetone) in the spoon.  Do not use this product with plastic measuring spoons!<br /><br />If you're planning to make hard candy with this as well, I'd also recommend that you let the sugar mixture cool quite a bit before adding the cinnamon oil.  Adding it at the 300 degrees F needed for the hard crack stage just leads to an overpowering cloud of cinnamon in your kitchen and flavorless candy.<br /><br />This product is good stuff; just be very careful when using it.

review/summary: Awsome Cinnamon Oil
review/text: I ordered this because as a teenager I used to make cinnamon toothpicks. I have tried others and they were not the same, so I purchased this in hopes it would be different, and oh yes, my prayer answered. I used this oil with toothpicks to help me stop smoking, this is one great product. I have to slightly lick the toothpick befor placing the whole thing in my mouth or my mouth would be "on fire". After that it is just perfect, the oil takes the nicotine bleeding through my gums and it covers the taste so I can go about my business and not think about smoking. You are asking, has it worked? And my answer is "YES", it's working and going on 8 weeks now. Thanks to this oil it has helped ease the pain and cover up tasted I was hoping it would. As another poster stated, it is very potent so you may want to dilute this. Thanks for a 100% quality product.

review/summary: fantastic for ice tea
review/text: I bought this cinnamon oil specifically to improve the flavor of<br />ice tea.  I am too busy to steep tea, so I just have a gallon<br />jug that I put up 16 bags of tea (1 bag per 8 ounces of water:  You<br />can use bulk tea to save time and money:  I use 1/2 regular and<br />1/2 decar so I don't get too much caffein, and I try to drink 32<br />ounces of it a day) and empty the tea out of the bags<br />and into the jug, fill it with water, shake it and put in the refer (<br />tests prove that there are just as many antioxidants in refrigerator<br />tea as in steeped tea!)<br /><br />After at least 24 hours, I strain it into another jug, add stevia,<br />and 1 or two drops of cinnamon oil per cup of water, shake and<br />use as needed.  It VASTLY improves the taste of the tea, also<br />helped me overcome a diet coke habit and with all the studies about<br />the benefits of tea and cinnamon, I feel good about drinking it.<br />Try it.  You won't be sorry (and since there are 2400 drops in<br />the 4 ounce bottle of cinnamon oil, it ends up costing you only<br />1 or 2 pennies per cup to drink the tea!  What a wise and cost<br />efficient way to improve your health!

review/summary: Great cinnamon oil
review/text: This stuff is great.  It might be more expensive than the "cinnamon flavor" or "cinnamon extract" you get in the grocery store, but it is so much more concentrated that it works out to be cheaper in the long run.  I made cinnamon hard candy.  To 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup corn syrup I used 1 teaspoon (see update below) cinnamon oil.  That made a strong cinnamon flavor without being really hot.  Yum.<br /><br />Update:  The first time I made this I added the cinnamon oil when the candy was still 290F.  I got a cloud of cinnamon steam in my face and perfectly flavored candy.  I just tried it again but I let the candy cool slightly before adding the cinnamon.  I got less steam (but still a lot) and candy that was WAY too spicy.  I assume that the first time a bunch of the cinnamon oil evaporated, so the amount you need depends on the temperature of the candy when you add it.  Next time I am going to add 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon to the slightly cooled candy.

review/summary: Great Product - Brings Back Memories
review/text: I've been retired for a little over 4 years now. When I was in grade school, we used to go down to the local pharmacy and buy "Pure cinnamon Oil" and would soak toothpicks in it overnight. These "Hot Toothpicks" got hotter as you sucked on them. I saw a write-up recently where some folks were using them to control smoking and for weight loss. Well, I quit smoking 17 years ago, but I sure could use some help with weight loss. I went to my local Rite-Aid pharmacy, but they said they no longer carry cinnamon oil but that I could buy it in the "Spices" section of any supermarket. They were wrong! you can get Cinnamon EXTRACT, but that's just for cinnamon flavoring when you are making baked goods or candy. I wanted the Hot Stuff, the Pure Cinnamon Oil, and that's exactly what I got when I ordered the 8 oz bottle of it from Olive Nation, using Amazon.com. It works so well that I ordered a larger bottle, the 16 oz version the next time I needed to get some more. BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU HAVEN'T EVER USED THIS CINNAMON OIL, OR IF IT HAS BEEN AWHILE SINCE YOU'VE USED IT ---you can burn your lips and tongue if you are not careful. YES, I know this from experience! My suggestion is to start small ---- put several toothpicks in the oil for six hours. Take them out and let them air-dry (caution: don't dry them on paper or cloth towels or the towels will absorb much of the oil.) I dry them on mosquito netting. Try those. If that's not hot enough, double the soaking time. I normally leave mine in for 72 hours, then dry them for 48 hours. I've also found out that the flat toothpicks absorb better / quicker than the round ones. But you can chew on the round ones longer before they start to splinter. --- Good luck!

My sister and I could spend a dime each (or a quarter if they were really strong) for super-hot toothpick that would last for hours. I found the intensely strong cinnamon oil I was looking for and have already had several flashbacks. This stuff is seriously potent - be careful when handling. Wash hands or use vinyl gloves - don't get it near your eyes, or even on your skin/lips/tongue unintentionally. The 10 cent toothpicks were soaked overnight and the 25 cent ones for several days.  Man do I miss the 80s - Enjoy!!

This oil was exactly what I needed, it made a lot of cinnamon toothpicks and I still have some left.  Very happy with the product.

review/text: Very good quality. Was not aware of it's potent pureness, apple butter turned out quite cinnamonity to taste.  Had to add another bushel of apples to cut the taste.

review/summary: This is not the real thing
review/text: First of all this stuff is Cinnamon Leaf Oil and NOT Cinnamon Bark Oil. Olive nation is misleading people by not making it clear that this is Cinnamon leaf Oil. Even the label on the bottle they sent is different to the one on Amazon. Don't get me wrong,this stuff is Potent and will burn your hands if you are not carefull but it has no smell. And what is point of it if you don't get that classic Cinnamon scent? Only Cinnamon Bark oil will give you that. Compared to Cinnamon Bark Oil you can't smell this stuff. I wanted this stuff for my house, after seing them used in hotel in Sri Lanka (where the best Cinnamon Oil comes from)but I might as well throw it.

review/text: Just what I wanted to add flavor to hot drinks. I had to find a way to put tiny amounts into drinks. You can't even use a full drop. White coffee with white chocolate and .05 ml cinnamon oil is fantastic.

review/text: Very good product, made excellent cinnamon candy.  Arrived as ordered, very satisfied.  Also great for cinnamon apples.  Try it using hard crack recipe for candy, red food color, dip the apples.

review/summary: Not quite LorAnn quality, but for the price it's good quality.
review/text: Say you want to demolish a small house. An nuclear weapon will get the job as well as anything so why not use it? Just because it works doesn't mean it's the best solution or the most cost effective. A nice chunk of C4 might work just fine. This stuff is C4. I've been a consumer of LorAnn Cinnamon oil for over 20 years and I've never found anything as potent or as expensive.<br /><br />For 8oz, $25 was too cheap NOT to try. I entirely expected to be disappointed but for the chance I wasn't, $25 was worth the risk. I'm accustomed to paying ~$2.50 for 1/8oz (1dram) of LorAnn oil which is ~$20/oz. That makes this product 8 times cheaper. In my opinion the flavor is about 90% and potency is about 85% that of LorAnn's version. Since LorAnn oil is powerful enough to actually cause dangerous reactions (like extremely hot chili peppers), that can actually be a good thing. I'm conditioned to both well enough to consume things most people wouldn't dare try and this oil is still strong enough that I handle it carefully. The flavor is a bit more like that of "RedHot" hard candies rather than overly-intense cinnamon (which is the best way I can describe LorAnn cinnamon oil).<br /><br />If you're into cinnamon toothpicks or candy flavoring, I can't imagine this being anything less than sufficient and for 1/8th the cost, you have to at leave give it a shot. They have smaller quantities if you don't want to risk $25.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'll ever spend the premium for LorAnn again now that I've had this, but then again, I have the equivalent of 64 drams now and I don't think I've used that much cinnamon oil so far in my life so it'll be a while before I have to purchase again :) The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it's not a 100% substitute for LorAnn cinnamon oil, but I wish I could give a 4.5 or 4.75 stars instead of just 4 out of 5.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: My wife said she couldn't find good cinnamon oil for her candy at the grocery store anymore and was in a panic because the grandkids were asking for some of her home made cinnamon candy. So I searched the Internet. I've had good luck with Amazon so I started there to see what I could find and to read the reviews. There were a lot of positive reviews on the OliveNation Cinnamon oil sold by Jr Mushrooms & Specialties so I ordered a 4 ounce bottle. When it arrived I opened the bottle, took a whiff and dipped a toothtick on the bottle for a taste. WOW!..This is the REAL DEAL!!!!! If you looking for a good Cinnamon Oil, you just found it.

review/summary: Love It
review/text: I'm a huge fan for cinnamon. The taste, the smell, and the sight is enough to make my mouth water. I purchased this cinnamon oil for no other reason but to have some delicious cinnamon oil at home. If you're worried about wasting your money on weak cinnamon oil, then you should definitley have no worries with this stuff. After seeing the reviews and how people make cinnamon toothpicks, I decided to do it too. Let me tell you, after washing my hands (with soap) then doing the dishes, my fingers still smelled (and tasted) like cinnamon! This stuff is really strong, and the toothpicks will just about burn a hole in your lip if you leave it sitting there. These toothpicks are great to carry in a mint tin to use after a large, garlic/onion meal. And since it's pure cinnamon oil and not candy or gum with sugars, its great for your teeth, digestive system, and breath without leaving a nasty aftertaste. All in all, this is great oil; a bit pricey but worth it. Also, the oil you soak the toothpicks in can be resused over and over again, as long as the container is sealed shut; so I can see this oil lasting for a very long time.
