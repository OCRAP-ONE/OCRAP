review/summary: Deliciously Addictive
review/text: I seriously love this drink.  When I was a kid, I remember when my father would buy a coconut; we'd open it and drink the water inside.  There was never very much but it was delicious.  We bought a coconut maybe once a year.  Now it's readily available all over New York City.  I have tried all of the flavors and in my opinion the Mango is by far my favorite.  It is a wonderful balance between staying true to a real coconut water flavor and taste with a compliment of Mango flavor.  I am a huge fan.  I feel a burst of energy every time I drink it and it tastes so great.  When I have it in stock at home, I drink more of it than tap water.

review/summary: Zico deserves ZERO STARs
review/text: I don't know where to start. I feel like cheated. This product is described as "Pure Premium Coconut Water" but it tastes more like little bit of coconut oil mixed with water and served in a cheap plastic container. This product does not at all taste like coconut water. When you take a sip the first thing it reminds you of is "Plastic".<br /><br />I have tried many brands of coconut water and this by far is the WORST. I have grown up drinking coconut water fresh from the shell. So I know the real taste. See my  review for "Vita Coco".<br /><br />I had seen all the recent negative reviews. But they all suggested that there was a problem with one particular batch. I also noticed that Amazon had stopped selling this to investigate the problems reported in recent bad reviews. So when this product again came up for sell I trusted that Amazon has addressed the issue. I was always attracted to the packaging and wanted to try this for some time. Plus there was 15% off coupon. So I went ahead and ordered a case. Big Mistake!!<br /><br />Amazon does not accept returns for this product. So only thing I can do is "vent it out" through this review. This is my first negative review and I believe Zico absolutely deserve NO STARS. I am giving one star because Amazon does not allow zero stars.<br /><br />BTW, the case I received has expiry date of Dec 2011. I want to see reviews from other shoppers who have bought this along with me.

review/summary: Tastes Like Chocolate Milk! (somewhat)
review/text: I've never been a big "health nut" and but when a "health nut" friend of mine had me try a Zico coconut water drink (plain) I was under the continued opinion that stuff that's "healthy" for us isn't healthy for the tongue (i.e. taste).  It wasn't until I was at the local supermarket and tried the Zico Chocolate Coconut Water and fell in love with my first "health drink".<br /><br />I would strongly recommend that you try this great drink before supplies run out!  It's a very popular drink and according to the agriculture website coconuts are becoming harder to get because of the broadened use of coconut water and milk.  So as I said TRY it before they run out.

review/text: I love coconut water... and I love chocolate and putting them together only seemed like a match made in heaven. The first time I tried it I became hooked but once you are 1/2 - 3/4 of the way through the 12pk I felt like I may have had enough of it and wanted just plain coconut water. I definitely like the chocolate flavor but it is more of "I need to be in the mood" type of thing rather than being able to drink it daily like I can with plain.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: While I love chocolate, I normally do not like chocolate flavored things. You know, things that aren't chocolate but are meant to taste like chocolate, such as chocolate Bonne Bell Lip Smackers, chocolate flavored Skittles, and cheap "chocolate" easter candy. I thought this would taste like super-watery chocolate milk and kept the first bottle I bought in the fridge for a month because I was too scared to try it, but I was completely wrong. It's delicious!!! If I had to describe the taste, it would be like melted dark chocolate gelato with a hint of coconut. I work at a small, outrageously overpriced local grocery store and we are selling it there for 2 dollars over the price of the per unit adjustment of a case here on Amazon (though I bought my bottle at one of those trendy chain health food stores for 1 dollar more over Amazon's price). So buy one bottle to see if you like it, and order the rest on Amazon. These prices can't be beat.

review/text: Living in Florida in the summer time is great but, it also dehydrating so, I have learned through friends and then internet information how good coconut water is for you to replenish what your body needs, (I am not a Gatorade fan), I needed to find something that I liked.  I tried other coconut waters and then read how Zico was the best to do what it said it would.  I searched and found the chocolate coconut water and tried it.  Now, I am addicted, it is absolutely delicious.  Great chocolate taste, REAL chocolate taste and not too sweet. It is great just as a pick-me-up chocolate need, that is good for you.  I have both the regular coconut water and the chocolate.  It is a treat!

review/summary: I Thought I Hated Coconut Water (Until Zico Chocolate!)
review/text: Having heard many people express their undying love for coconut water, last year I decided to try some. After about the first sip of the plain unadulterated coconut water I got at the grocery store I knew it and I were not going to be friends. I couldn't even force myself to finish the carton. I could not figure out why everyone was so excited about it and decided it just wasn't for me. Then, one day earlier this month I saw Zico Chocolate in the cold case at a convenience store, sandwiched between juices and sports drinks. I was hesitant to buy it considering my previous experience with coconut water but the lure of chocolate was too much. I am so glad that I decided to go for it! Zico Chocolate could not be more different from plain coconut water. The weird (almost like bad molasses) flavor I found so unappealing in the plain was missing completely from the Zico Chocolate. Because they added some coconut cream it is ever so mildly creamy and the chocolate is nice and rich like semisweet dark chocolate. Just like plain coconut water it has an enticing naturally occurring nutrient content including some calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, vitamin A, and phosphorus. The only nutritional downside is that there is some added sugar, bringing the total sugar for one 14 oz bottle up to 18 grams. However, for me drinking a Zico Chocolate is often a replacement for either a dessert or a sweetened iced tea so I'm not really ingesting any more sugar than I normally would be. If you don't mind the added sugar and/or haven't been pleased with the taste of other coconut water I highly recommend trying Zico Chocolate.<br /><br />This last bit is about buying from Amazon and not about the product itself. This is the first time I've bought this particular product from Amazon and I am very happy with the purchase. It cost me significantly less per bottle to have it shipped by the case from Amazon using subscribe & save than it costs to buy in any store near me ($.75 - $1.00 less per bottle). Although buying it this way made it ineligible for Prime 2-day shipping, the box still arrived here the day after I ordered it and in perfect condition; that is good customer service!!!

review/text: I have to start with the fact that I was extremely skeptical on a chocolate coconut water.  I expected a watered down chocolate milk taste.  I was actually resistant to try it the first time for fear of ruining my coconut water experience.  Needless to say with my five star rating I was impressed. This beverage is hands down the healthiest way to get your chocolate fix and hydrate at the same time.  I have converted at least half a dozen people over to this beverage.  Everyone has that "commercial" look of being surprised on how good it is.  I highly recommend this product and think it is a home run for Zico.  I expect some of the other brands to follow soon.

review/summary: Zico Coconut Water
review/text: Zico's taste is the best of all the pre-packaged young coconut water I've tried.  Nothing beats fresh young coconut water straight out of the coconut, but this comes close to the flavor.  Don't waste your time on canned coconunt water - it's awful IMO.  Zico has a lower sugar content than the other brands I've sampled (14gms/serving vs. 20gms/seving).  It is isotonic, high in potassium and rich in electrolytes.  You can practically live on it!  If you have an upset stomach, it settles it immediately.  I have an aunt who was hospitalized and unable to eat.  Her potassium levels were very low.  She was able to drink this and keep it down.  It helped improve her postassium levels and settled her nausea.  A friend of my  9 yrs. old son's had a "tummy" ache while we were at the state fair.  I happened to have a Zico in my purse and gave it to him.  He loved it.  His stomach ache ceased and we were able to enjoy our time at the fair.

review/text: First, I agree with the other reviewers about the "off" flavor and I am confused about why they decided to add "natural flavors" to coconut water that already tastes great by itself.  We are big fans of coconut water and have replaced all other drinks with it at family and other social gatherings.  But yesterday one of our family members pointed out the the bottles are plastic type #7 (unidentified plastics created after 1987, including the plastic type BPA!) and even more puzzling, the bottle lists another plastic type next to it saying its also a #2 plastic type but its HDPE compatible.  Its so frustrating (and embarassing that I didn't catch it before putting in the coolers)!

review/summary: A Chocolate Lover's Dream Come True!!!
review/text: I've been a big fan of coconut water for a few years now. When I saw the chocolate flavor, I couldn't imagine how coconut water and chocolate could go together in such a way that it would be something that I would really enjoy drinking. Boy was I wrong! After reading a lot of the reviews, I decided to give it a try. It is sooooooooo delicious! How could they make something taste this good out of combining coconut water and dark chocolate? I don't know but I will be coming back for more as I just increased my delivery rate on my Subscribe and Save plan. This is a great way to satisfy a chocolate craving - it tastes so indulgent, get rehydrated, and it's good for you! ZICO really outdid themselves with this one. I highly recommend this product!!!

review/summary: It might not be the plastic bottle that you're tasting...
review/text: I looked deeper into the description of these and found this:<br /><br />***ZICO 11 oz. tetra cartons are produced in Brazil and deliver a light, refreshing taste.<br /><br />One-liter cartons are produced in Thailand for a more nutty flavor profile, similar to fresh green Thai coconuts from the grocery store.<br /><br />And 14 oz. bottles are a nutty blend of Brazilian, Thai and Indonesian coconuts.***<br /><br />So you might not be liking the taste of the coconuts from Thai and Indonesia instead of it being the plastic bottle.<br /><br />I'll be staying with the original formula since I bought some from Trader Joe's and really like it but it is the Brazilian coconuts only.<br /><br />Mystery solved?  Let me know what you think.

review/summary: Great tasting!! Two thumbs up from a pregnant lady!
review/text: I am pregnant and was getting charley horses, and a friend recommended that I look into coconut water. Each bottle has more potassium then a banana--which sounded great to me since I hate bananas! I ordered a case of the chocolate flavor, since I had heard regular coconut water is not too good. I LOVE this! It's great-and keeps you hydrated while giving you some great health benefits.

review/summary: Coco Puffs?
review/text: I've tried several other flavors of coconut water and they're all pretty good.  As a choco-holic I had very high hopes for the Zico chocolate coconut water!  I was not disappointed...this water tastes more like liquified coco puffs cereal with just a hint of coconut.  Maybe that sounds gross, but it was really pretty good!  Very refreshing!

review/text: ZICO pure coconut water is a wonderful beverage; it is refreshing and comforting to my body after strenous activity, I also drink it to calm "sweets" cravings! ZICO tastes like the real thing; I grew up in the tropics and drank coconut water regularly(out of the fruit) and ZICO taste pure and unadulterated. I don't like the packaging; it is a bit bulky,however; I still like it better than canned products (the can adds a metaliqui flavor to the drink).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SRH2B6">ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 33.8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: Chocolate+Coconut+Hydration = HEAVEN!!  So I put this to the test after one of my triathlon training sessions yesterday.  Not only did it completely quench my thirst and hydrate me, but the taste was sensational.  Light enough to drink post-workout but also filling enough to feel refreshed.  It kept me from feeling that 3-4 hour post workout fade.  I was alert and ready to go the entire day!  What a difference from the high fructose hydration drinks that are out there.  A 10!  A true taste sensation!

review/text: I've been an avid ZICO drinker for over a year, sticking mainly to my fav pineapple.  I wasn't sure how Chocolate could go with a coconut water, but i am sooooo impressed and glad i tried it.  It's not necessarily the ZICO flavor i grab after a workout, as i still love pineapple (though chocolate is great in my morning recovery smoothie), but it has definitely replaced my mid-afternoon snacking habit in a much healthier way.  Best of all - i've got the whole house hooked on it, so my kids now choose healthy hydration instead of the artificial and high calorie stuff they used to drink.  i'm sold.

We usually drink them in the morning for breakfast to jump start our day & sometimes after dinner to satisfy our sweet tooth.  I can't wait to tell my friends and family about them!

SO the true test was with my 5 year old, the ultimate (and brutally honest) chocolate expert.  It was in the evening, so i only let him have half the bottle, but no joke - he woke me up at 2am saying "mommy, i need more of that chocolate zico"...<br /><br />What a great option for us fitness moms out here!

review/summary: The best coconut water out there
review/text: Growing up, I was used to coconut water all the time. While none of the brands selling coconut water are close to the real thing (FRESH coconut water), Zico comes the closest. It comes the closest in my book because it doesn't taste as adulterated as some of the other brands. I can't make a claim about the flavored versions of this drink but for the natural flavor Zico wins hands down compared to Vita Coco and O.N.E.

review/text: I've been buying ZICO with mango in 11.2 oz. tetra-paks almost since they started offering them here on Amazon.  However, just as another reviewer explained, the most recent batch I received was horrible, it went from being the best coconut water to the worst I've ever had.  The packaging was slightly different and most alarming, the individual box no longer says anything about being from Brazil.  If this continues I will never buy this product again.  If you are having the same experience, please speak up on here so maybe we can get this fixed......

Not too overwheleming like some other coconut waters. I absolutely LOVE it!

The tetra packs were really refreshing and tasting real. Being from a south-asia country where freshly chopped coconut water are available, I was really impressed with the tetra packs that was available from ZICO previously. With the added flavor in these, I can feel the artificial flavor when I drink from the bottle now. ZICO has to go back and NOT add the flavor to make it REALLY natural and original. But overall I guess I could give a B+ rating on the product.

Irreplaceable of course by the juice we buy that's been packed already. But to compare I bought 3 brands,  the Vita coco, One , and Zico. The first 2 have a distinct taste but both tastes good the only thing vita coco was 100 percent coco juice while one coco juice was gently pasteurized. The packaging was great you don't need a straw to drink right away. I bought the bottled zico and after my first drink the taste of plastic container was very evident. That was the downfall for me but just tasting it and taking away the plastic taste on my mind it was good but the taste of plastic ruined it. Maybe next time I'll try the tetra packed zico to see if I'll like it better.

review/text: I found this coconut water to be almost tasteless.  It was more like water with a slight coconut flavor.  Coconut waters are quite expensive, and I like more coconut flavor.  No true complaints, there are just others I prefer to the Zico.

review/summary: Zico - subscription ordered
review/text: Zico water is fantastic.  Drink only when it's chilled. The taste of Zico water taste is more consistent when coming from the bottle rather than the tetra pak.<br /><br />Amazon grocery suscription service. I ordered Zico ahead of the summer months on subscription ordering under the assumption that was getting the bevvy for $2 a bottle. When the refill was sent, the total cost went up by $6.  After contacting Amazon customer service, it was explained that Amazon.com charges whatever the price is on the day your order is refilled so that you really never know what you will pay.  Bummer and boo on amazon.com for not knowing what subscription pricing means. Yeah Zico!

review/summary: Amazing taste - much better than any regular coconut water
review/text: Having been raised on a tropical coast, I have had tons of fresh young coconuts. Though no packaged coconut water comes close to the taste of fresh-from-a-tender-coconut water, Zico is the best one I have found so far (have tried many others sold here at Amazon and elsewhere; Vita Coco is the 2nd best in my opinion). Coconut water is awesome in terms of being nutritious and refreshing, and sodas of course don't hold a candle to it. I have tried both the Zico 'natural' (as in no added flavor) and the Zico mango flavored, and must say that the mango flavored one wins hands down. The regular one has a slightly 'cooked' or 'boiled' taste to it (as packaged coconut water is pasteurized), and maybe the mango flavor covers that in the other one. Tastes great whether cool or cold; probably better the colder it is. The mango flavor is very delicate, and does not take away from the coconut water itself, somehow enhancing it and making it even more delicious. Plus, the first time I got this the price was fantastic, 8 dollars off from the usual 24 due to a lightning deal, making this even sweeter (no pun intended, the coconut water has only a touch of sweetness, no added sugar - just the right, natural amount). Hopefully this will be back in stock soon so I can 'subscribe and save' to keep the price low.

review/summary: My favorite - and it's coming back soon!
review/text: Zico in the tetra pak is my favorite coconut water, and the passion fruit is my favorite flavor.  Coconut water isn't for everyone, it is a very faint, mild taste, but it is very pleasant and refreshing, especially during or right after a workout.  I have tried pretty much every flavor of every brand, and Zico in the tetra pak is the best, doesn't have the weird aftertaste that some of the other brands do.  I like mango and plain OK too, but the passion fruit is my favorite.  Coconut water is not for those who are used to strong, very sweet drinks, but if you're looking for a healthier, better tasting water this might be for you.  And though it's out of stock now, Zico says it will be back in distribution later in summer 2010.  I can't wait!

review/summary: getting addicted to...
review/text: wasn't too sure about the taste or the product being from concentrate so i asked ZICO what's up with that--i'm not about to put in anything fake or artificial in this temple!!! got a pretty detailed response from their CS team,<br /><br />"Thank you for taking the time to reach out to ZICO regarding your feedback below.  While I'm disappointed that you do not like the taste of the new ZICO in a bottle, I did want to please clarify a few misconceptions that I believe may exist.<br /><br />* Rationale - The reason for launching the bottle was pure and simply consumer demand.  Our active lifestyle consumers wanted a packaging solution that allowed them to enjoy ZICO coconut water in a way that met their needs.  For a number of reasons, tetra packaging was not that solution so we came up with the bottle as a result.<br />* Taste - You are correct that the new ZICO taste is different from the product in the Tetra, however that is due to the fact that for the bottle, we are using a blend of coconuts from around the world, rather than simply coconuts from Brazil, as we do in the carton.  This blend was selected for its lighter taste, it's naturally lower caloric content (20% fewer calories per oz.) and it's naturally increased sodium levels to optimize hydration benefits.  The taste you are experiencing is intentionally different, but it is due to the blend of coconuts we are using rather than the packaging.  The good news is that we are continuing to manufacture ZICO in a carton so that consumers like yourself can choose which taste and nutritional profile they prefer.<br />* Packaging - Contrary to what you would expect, the new ZICO bottle actually has a lower carbon footprint than the tetra pack:<br />o Tetra packaging is only recyclable in 40% of the U.S. and today less than 1% is actually recycled.  To do so is extremely energy intensive, as it requires separating the multiple layers of materials that make up the carton.<br />o The ZICO bottle is #2 recyclable, accepted in almost all curbside recycling programs nationwide and currently 40% of all HDPE bottles are recycled in the US<br />o ZICO bottles are made domestically, which means we have reduced the impact (fuel, energy, pollution) of shipping full-strength water and packaging materials around the globe<br />At ZICO we take our impact on the environment very seriously, so I would like to reassure you that our decision to launch the bottle was entered into with the environment top-of-mind and this decision was embraced fully by retail partners like Whole Foods, who understand the environmental realities of tetra vs. HDPE, despite consumer misperceptions.<br /><br />I apologize for the long response to your inquiry, however you clearly have a passionate viewpoint on the new bottle, so I wanted to make sure that we provided you with the proper insights and facts to be able to make your decision.  And regardless of your final decision, I would like to thank you again for taking the time to write to us, as it's feedback like yours that helps us ensure we stay true to what consumers would like."<br /><br />Felt a lot better with a better understanding. The new natural is getting addicting. my body is craving this stuff after a workout.

review/summary: Zico coconut water is a terrific natural LAXATIVE
review/text: Zico was the sponsoring sports drink for SF Marathon 2011.  I took a free bottle of Zico after I had completed my half-marathon and drank it at home; within several minutes, I had a case of diarrhea.  Then it struck me: I realized that this may be the reason I wanted to take a dump during the race.  After I had run 10 miles at 8 minutes/mile, I was getting dehydrated and picked up 2 cups of Zico coconut water.  Within several minutes, I wanted to take a dump BADLY.  But I forced myself to continue running for the following reasons: I only had 3 miles to go, it's my rule to NEVER stop to use the bathroom during a race, and I had trained several months for the race (training hard on hilly terrain for this particular event).  With me painfully pinching my buttocks the last 3 miles, I slowed down to over 9 minutes/mile while so many people were passing me.  I couldn't sprint the last stretch, I was just trying to hang in there despite the hardship of not letting "it" out.  After I finished, I went straight to the portable toilets to relieve myself... which took 15 minutes; this would have been devastating had I used the bathroom during the race, but certainly not as bad had I lost control of my bowels during the race.  I could have finished with an awesome time had I not had wanted to take a dump during the race.  Once I found that Zico was the cause of my diarrhea, I did an internet search on "coconut water laxative" and an ABUNDANT number articles of how coconut water is such a great natural LAXATIVE.  The bottom line is this: Zico coconut water will help you "run", but in the wrong way.  You'll be putting much more muscle power into your gluttonous maximus than your legs while racing.  Oh, and one more thing... Zico doesn't even taste good.  >:p

I like to drink coconut water before going to the gym because I've found it helps with endurance. It is not as convenient for me to carry the larger (by about 3 oz.) bottle, especially since I can't finish the entire thing in one sitting.

review/text: I absolutely love the plain Zico Coconut water - I drink at least 1 or 2 of the large tetrapaks a week.  I have also enjoyed some of the other brands Mango flavored coconut water (O.N.E. and Vita).  So the logical progression was to try the Zico Mango.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. You can't taste the Coconut, but instead are overpowered with this terrible synthetic tasting Mango flavor that leaves a disgusting aftertaste that almost "stings" the back of my tongue. Like I said before, I am almost addicted to coconut water, and I hate to let things go to waste - but I couldn't even finish this bottle.<br /><br />After looking at the ingredients - Coconut water from concentrate and Natural Flavors.  I don't know what type of "natural flavors" they are using, or what constitutes a "natural flavor".  Whatever it is, it's disgusting.<br /><br />I recommend trying one of the other brands coconut-mango mixes that actually adds small amount of Mango Puree.

However, this was the first one I tried in a plastic bottle and was disappointed to find that there is a little bit of a plastic flavor to it. Zico's great, but I'm definitely going to stick to the box from now and on.
