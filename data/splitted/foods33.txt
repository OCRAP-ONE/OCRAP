Hard to tell a difference between this and the gluten-y version.<br /><br />I love companies that make gluten free versions of their foods!

review/summary: Best Mix- especially for waffles!
review/text: We have tried a lot of different GF mixes and when I found this new mix from Bisquick, I decided to try it.  I made waffles for my family and even my kids couldn't tell they were GF.  They almost taster better than my original wheat recipe.  No strange texture or after taste.

review/summary: An easy solution, but...
review/text: ...this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of rice-based gluten-free mixes. The mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatile.<br /><br />I will use the mix I have, but I'm not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry. I'm not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis, which is usually a sign that this isn't a hit in my household.

review/text: When I discovered my sensitivity to gluten about 6 months ago, I was dismayed by most of the horrible gluten-free foods on the market. I have since found some substitute foods that are acceptable to me. Bisquick gluten-free pancake and baking mix is one of them. I use it every Sunday to make either pancakes or waffles. I recommend this mix whole-heartedly!

review/summary: I would say just 'eh'
review/text: I bought this immediately after finding out I could no longer have gluten. From everything I was reading it seemed daunting to mix different flours to make anything.<br /><br />The boxes are SMALL!  While this mix is okay for making pancakes, the biscuits are alright, and to use it as a coating chicken fingers is 'eh', I'm glad I bought it when I was first diagnosed.  It helped ease my transition into gluten free cooking and baking.<br /><br />Now that I know what I'm doing, I will not buy again.  It's much cheaper to make my own flour mixes at home and use those to make pancakes, biscuits, and breaking for chicken fingers.  And my own mix tastes much better.  But, if you are new to gluten free, definetly pick this up, it will help with the transition!

review/summary: Wallpaper Paste
review/text: I read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles.  So I whipped up some pancakes, breakfast-for-dinner style.  I'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF, so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love, but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes.  Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another GF flour.

review/summary: The Best Pancake Mix - BY FAR!!
review/text: This product is BEYOND AMAZING! I have been cooking pancakes in assorted ways for four decades. And, for home use, no other product comes close to this Bisquick Gluten Free Mix. It is superior not only to every gluten-free product on the matter; it is ALSO superior to every other mix (gluten-free or not) on the market. Friends and family are constantly amazed and surprised when I serve them breakfast. So, to everyone and anyone, don't make the mistake of associating this Bisquick product w/ other gluten-free products that result in food that tastes like cardboard.<br />Last thought: Thanks to Amazon for making it available as a subscription purchase, since I can no longer find it in any South Florida supermarkets.

review/text: We've been using Pamela's for making pancakes and waffles, but I saw Bisquick and grabbed a box to try it.  It made the absolute BEST waffles we'd ever had - gluten free or not!  Pamela's has you separate the egg yolk from the egg white and made making our Saturday morning waffles tedious.  I added two packets of Splenda to Bisquick's batter and everyone (including my super-picky kid) came back for seconds.  I was a little worried because the batter seemed a bit gritty, but they baked up very smooth and fluffy.  My husband made fried chicken from the mix as well.  We didn't have any left overs of that, either.<br /><br />Way to go, Bisquick!

review/text: After finding out I had a sensitivity to wheat, I searched for alternatives. I decided to try this mix and make some biscuits. Wow, were they good! They sort of reminded me of challah with a slight eggy flavor. They came out more like sandwich rolls (rather than flaky biscuits) but not quite as big. I'm thinking of making them super size next time so I can slice them in half and use for my lunches. After eating corn tortillas every day, I'm glad I found something else I can have. I also made an oven pancake with the mix and that was very good too. I highly recommend it.

review/text: I was happily surprised with this product. I read other negative reviews and was honestly disappointed in Betty Crocker gf cake mix so I didn't feel the need to try this. I finally bought it at a whim when I saw it at my local market and I am happy I did. I am a baker at heart and love to spoil my family with homemade deserts and pancakes on the weekends. I have adjusted my cooking and baking to primarily gf for the past year now and am happy when I find a gf alternative that cooks & tastes like "the real thing". Another plus is that I can buy this at my local market (which does not carry too many specialty foods) and don't have to make the extra trip to the higher end store.<br /><br />I made pancakes today and they were a hit with everyone. Will definitely use it to try other recipes.<br />Only downside is the cost and size of box; very pricey and very small.

review/summary: Just needs larger boxes
review/text: I've been gluten free for 12 years now, have tried many bread mixes, and I love this one.  So does my husband, who is not gluten free.  I hope that everyone supports these Bisquick products, since big brand gluten-free bread and pasta products are so rare, and so rarely good.  It was something special for me when these came out (if you can imagine waiting a decade for this, you'll understand).  If those of us with celiac disease/gluten-intolerance keep enjoying them, maybe the price will come down (though it's not bad now) and they will offer bulk deals.  It will also wake up other manufacturers.  I would happily order a case or much larger package.  I can make my own bread, but I prefer to use a mix, and use my cooking time for main dishes.  So don't hesitate to try it, I can't imagine being disappointed by this product.  However, I do find it for less at my local grocery store.

review/summary: Yahoo for Bisquick!
review/text: Extremely happy with Bisquick gluten free!  I had no idea what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised.  I always preferred Bisquick pancakes over other popular brands through the years.  I am happy to say that I can eat my favorite brand of pancakes again without any health repercussions (gluten intolerant).  My next objective is to make the roll recipe on  the box.  I wish all manufacturers would take note of the rising gluten problem in this country!

review/summary: Ah, finally some good-ol' dumplings!!
review/text: I was amazed to find this on the shelf of my favorite grocer (sorry to say, cheaper than it is sold here, even with subscribe and save....).  First thing I made was my childhood favorite - dumplings - and they were just like I remembered them to be!  The whole family was happy with them - they were such a big hit!  I can't wait to make blueberry muffins this summer.  I have never been able to duplicate the taste of Bisquick with any other gf recipe, and no other recipe for blueberry muffins is quite the same, in my opinion.<br /><br />Thank you, General Mills!

review/summary: I've tried them all--this is the best!
review/text: Like the title says, I have tried (nearly) all the brands, spent a lot of money, and in the end these are the best Gluten Free Pancakes I've had.<br /><br />I am not happy about the lack of fiber, and the the starchy flours used. But a handful of ground flax seed makes up for that.<br /><br />I am also happy about a brand that helps you to make biscuits and other things from the same mix. Other companies sell biscuits and pizza dough as a separate item, duping the customer to spend even more money.<br /><br />Compared to the many other brands, these do not have a "funny" taste or smell from odd flours. These are made mostly from Rice and Potato flours. You just feel NORMAL.<br /><br />I hope they will come out with a "whole grain" version from Brown Rice and Bean flour.<br /><br />TIP: To get the fluffiest texture use BUTTER instead of oil. Room temperature butter.

review/summary: Good Cobbler
review/text: I am a Bisquick biscuit lover from way back, and I thought the biscuits made per the recipe were a little blah, but I think they would be perfect using butter or margarine in place of shortening, so I have hope. As far as the cobbler goes, I made a triple berry using the shortcake recipe on the back (which calls for butter rather than shortening) as the crust. It was amazing.<br />If you are expecting the ease of regular bisquick, forget it. This is not a "just add milk and stir" kind of product. The biscuits require the addition of egg, shortening (cutting it in, but it is easy and not too messy to mix with your fingers), and milk. Also wish there was more in the box. Most of the recipes on the back require the use of the whole box.

review/text: I like this product, and will order it online again since it is a much better price than the grocery store.  I wish the box was a bit bigger, but it will do.  It is plain, but it makes a light and fluffy pancake.  You can add flavor with vanilla extract, cinamon, or blueberries.  I liked the texture of the biscuit recipe, but it came out more like a muffin.  I'm going to make it in a muffin pan next time and put cranberries in it.  I made my biscuits with butter.  If you are creative with the use of add ins, I think it would make good quickbreads, but not the rising type.

review/text: My wife and daughter are Celiac but my son and I are not. We have been using Bob's Red Mill GF pancake mix and it's pretty good but you can tell it's gluten free. The pancakes we made today with this Bisquick mix were amazing. My mother, my son, and I could barely tell them from the normal wheat version on flavor. The texture is a bit different but they're light and fluffy unlike a lot of overly dense GF versions. We'll definitely be stocking up on this and using it with some of the old stand-by regular Bisquick recipes to see how it works in them.

review/text: Going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease---- but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional---and definitely not recommended. I knew something was amiss when I opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand. Putting my reservations aside, I proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box. Needless to say, the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange. I would not recommmend this product for pizza dough.

It's also more economical than making your own (who wants to buy 5+ flours just to make a cake??). And this one never has that strange metallic smell others like Bob's have. I find myself making pancakes, biscuits, cupcakes again after years of going bread free due to a wheat allergy.<br /><br />My one complaint is that I can't seem to find this in any local store; I have my fingers crossed that Amazon continues to carry this!

review/summary: Not San Francisco Bay Coffee Company
review/text: My parents fell in love with 'San Francisco Bay Coffee Company' coffee, which use to be available at our local AZ Costco. For christmas I looked every where for this coffee & found what I thought was a great value on Amazon. When I bought it (12/21/11) there was "No Image Available", should have been my first warning sign. They had lots of pictures of the 12oz bags of coffee from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Co, but I wanted something bigger, and this was 2 lbs. Now there is a picture availble, but if you look closely it's "Roger's Family Company" coffee, who is technically located near the San Francisco Bay Area. So if you're in love with San Francisco Bay Coffee Company, don't buy this coffee. But on the upside, since I waited till the last minute to buy it, I gave it to my parents for christmas anyway & explained what happened, but they said the coffee was pretty decent. So still makes a nice cup of coffee, just not San Francisco Bay Coffee Company coffee.

It usually takes him five minutes.<br /><br />On the other hand, my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and won't leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up.<br />While I understand that ValuePetSupplies.com sponsors good causes, I will be spending an extra 15 cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat.

review/summary: Small Diameter - Good for small dogs, not for our 44 lb dog.
review/text: I ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re: small diameter size.  Absolutely true, and I regret making the purchase. For the same price, I briefly ordered from a different Amazon vendor the same # and length bully sticks for the same price.  Difference?  Original vendor bully sticks were on average 3/4" thick.  This vendor bully sticks are at MOST 1/2" thick, with most closer to 1/4".<br /><br />What difference does it make?<br /><br />Our dog, a slender 44 lb. mixed boxer/chow, would take 3-5 days to get through a 3/4" bully stick, and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one.  These new thin ones she completely consumes in less than 30 mins.  That makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag!<br /><br />Will not order again from this supplier.

review/text: The thickness is just as described. They are not thin as straws like some other reviews had stated. My 2 pet chihuahuas love them very much. It usually takes them an hour or so to finish chewing so it's a great time passer for them. One negative thing I'd complain is the strong smell of the bag, though. I have to tuck it away in a corner in order not to smell it often when pass by. This might not apply to everyone, since my nose is a bit more sensitive than most normal people. Over all, I'd had given 5 star if it wasn't for the smell, I have to give 4 stars for now.

These new mixes will not work with older recipes, that called for the 18.25 ounce size of cake mix. That rules out a lot of our favorite cakes. Even a plain cake will be changed - it won't bake up as high or as big in the pan. Duncan Hines just lost me as a customer.<br /><br />Pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes (at least, not yet). I will be buying them. If they shrink in size, I will bake from scratch.

I will not buy Duncan Hines again unless they go back to the 18+ ounces or go to 9 ounces for $.54.  Consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product.

review/summary: America's Favorite Cake!
review/text: It must be true because it says so on the package: "America's Favorite Cake."<br /><br />I seem to remember a check box on the 2010 Census regarding cake preference, but I don't think I voted for Yellow Cake. I would have voted for Devil's Food Cake, although it may be politically incorrect these days to mention, you know, The Devil, so I may have voted for German Chocolate Cake, but Germany is, you know, the Old Europe, so I  may have voted for a chocolate cupcake. But without peanuts because so many people are now allergic to peanuts that they can't even serve 0.5 grams of salted nuts on airplanes. Sigh.<br /><br />Where was I? Hmmm? Oh, yes....<br /><br />I certainly would vote for Duncan Hines cake but I feel it should be mentioned that this is not cake.....yet. This is cake mix.<br /><br />Its sort of a cake fetus, or a cake stem cell. It still needs lots of development. You have to add additional ingredients and warmth and time to develop the mix into a cake. There is the promise of cake, but unless you follow the protocol written on the box very carefully, you may not get cake. Depending on what you do, you may get something very odd and rubbery or something very dark and charred.<br /><br />It's complicated!<br /><br />Amazon has allowed third-party vendors to offer Duncan Hines Cake Mixes for sale for quite some time. An example of this is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IMS5K">Duncan Hines Classic Yellow Layer Cake Mix 18.25 oz - 6 Unit Pack</a>. Amazon, being a very clever retailer, has obviously read the numerous, highly enthusiastic customer reviews for this product, and has now started selling these products directly to its customers, so many of whom must be begging for a six pack of a product readily available in any supermarket or convenience store.<br /><br />In order to enhance customer demand, Amazon's copywriters have outdone themselves listing this product's outstanding features:<br /><br />-Pack of six, 16.5 18.25 ounces each (now 1.75 oz. lighter!)<br />-The moistest, most delicious<br />-A special treat for the special people<br /><br />Of course, "the special people" must be those who voted for Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix. That's why it's "America's Favorite Cake". Makes perfect sense. This is a Democracy! This is a great country and this is great cake mix!<br /><br />Another thing you should know is that you get six boxes of cake mix. This is enough mix to incubate a very, very big sheet cake that would require a very, very large incubator or oven. You could also prepare a tall 12 layer cake which would kind of look like a miniature version of the Coit Tower in San Francisco. Certainly enough "the moistest, most delicious" yellow cake for a very large number of "the special people".<br /><br />Finally, a charming aspect is that on the very same page as this product, Amazon suggests "Customers Who Bought This Product Also Bought": Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes, Refills, Case of 4 / 84s (336 ct). Obviously, "the special people" anticipate getting down with this cake. Six boxes of cake mix is bound to make a mess in the kitchen and later on, there will be cake crumbs on lips and chins and fingers.<br /><br />A few Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes could come in handy!<br /><br />Smart!

review/summary: Actually pretty good.
review/text: Ghirardelli isn't the finest chocolate you can buy, but it's pretty good, and the Intense Dark Assortment is both inexpensive, and provides you a few possibilities.<br /><br />I've lately taken to unwrapping a 60%, 72% and 86% cacao square for each dinner guest and setting them on an individual saucer, to serve as an after-dinner sampler with red wine or Scotch. That's been a pretty popular approach. A similar approach also works "therapeutically"---if someone's having a bad day, sitting them down with a small assortment of increasingly intense chocolate isn't a bad path to feeling a little better.<br /><br />I do wish that there were the same number of each in the bag; that's the only downside. Of course, if you really want the sets of three to serve to guests, you'll have to go through the tiresome task of somehow eating the extras. Darn.

review/summary: Chocolate is good for you!!  Eat more.
review/text: Many reports are coming out about how chocolate is actually good for you, so eat more!  This is the perfect chocolate to do that with.  The varying levels of cocoa are perfect to help adjust your taste buds to eating dark, dark chocolate. It's not an easy transition for a milk/semi-sweet kinda gal, but this chocolate is affordable and so tasty.  I also like that I can just have one (as they are individually wrapped), and choose my %.

review/summary: Great Dark Chocolate for Yourself or for Guests!
review/text: I love this sampler of Ghiradelli Chocolate Intense Dark Squares especially now that nutritionists recommend you have an oz. of dark chocolate each day that is over 70% cacoa.  Chocolate is a vegetable a friend reminded--it's a bean!<br /><br />These chocolates are affordable, tasty, rich, intense, silky smooth and just the right size.  I love to serve them for after dinner.  The squares are fairly large and individually wrapped.  It's great to have different amounts of cacoa depending on guests' tastes.  Dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some.  Of course, the darker the chocolate, the healthier so you can work your way up to the 86% cacoa. Great to have on hand for the holidays.  If you are on a diet and want a low calorie chocolate healthy treat, having these individually wrapped dilutes the temptation.  I'm happy with one square most days.<br /><br />These are a great non-guilty pleasure that are good for your health!

My family always had this (mild) on the table in Southern California and now that I've been transplanted in South Florida I am happy to mail-order.

There are some other good brands oout there, but this is the best and nothing compares to it. The Hot sauce has reasonable heat and bite and adds unique flavor to your favorite Mex foods. The taco (Mild) sauce is milder and just perfect on tacos, enchaladas, tostadas, tamales, Bell Beefers, and frozen mex dinners. The harder to find green sauce is to die for. Great on everything! Unfortunately I don't see the green stuff on Amazon but you can find it. Just get it. Try all three. I grew up with this stuff so am very partial to it. I keep about five or six bottles (each variety) on my shelves at all times.

review/text: I gave this as a gift and it was a big hit.  Nothing was broken, it was gift wrapped (paid for this), and even came with additional salt samples.  I was surprised at the amount of salt in each tube.  More than enough to get numerous meals of use out of each.  It was well recieved and I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.  I will say I think the shipping cost was a tad high, but the salt was a good deal so it evens out.
