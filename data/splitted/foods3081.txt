review/summary: Upscale, versatile, delicious!
review/text: These are great crackers for entertaining and also for munching on by yourself.  Their fresh, go-with-everything taste and their smooth, balanced flavor and texture make them the perfect foil for wine and cheese, hors d'oeuvres, etc.  Just pull a tub of cream cheese out of the fridge, spread it on some of these, add celery or bell pepper bits or some thin-sliced deli-meat (or not!), and you have last-minute munchies to hold everyone over while you prepare dinner.  Or lay them out on a platter with some Havarti, Jarlsberg and/or Brie, with a fresh herb or some grape clusters for decoration, and you've got an elegant accompaniment to your favorite red or white wine or cocktail.  Or just throw some in a Ziploc and take them in your backpack on a hike or in your purse for a quick snack around town.  Except for the Mini version (which is even nicer -- please, Amazon, bring them on!), what more could you ask for?!  :)

review/summary: Red Oval Stoned Wheat Thins--why so expensive and hard to get?
review/text: Great crackers!! I have eaten these for years. But WHY are they SO EXPENSIVE?? The cost of these is really out-of-control.  And why so hard to get?? Walmart used to carry them but do not anymore. Who wants to have to order crackers online, for pete's sake, and have them arrive nearly expired and all broken up??

review/text: If these wonderful crackers are okay when you recieve them (not stale as some have complained), you are golden.  Put them in your FREEZER in the original box and they last a long time!  If you use them infrequently, only take out what you want and keep the rest frozen.  We have a hard time finding them, too, but Big Lots is another avenue to try. Sometimes they get a shipment in and I stock up.  This way sounds much better though. I won't have to make disappointing trips to the store.

review/text: I can see why most supermarkets have stopped carrying Stoned Wheat Thins - they have become too expensive to stock. Online vendors charging more than $5 for a box of crackers - pretty steep.  Good thing we can still find Akmak locally. TJ's has some odd brands of crackers that might not cost as much per pound as chicken or pork.

review/text: They are almost half sardine half tuna cans. My cats don't eat the ones with sardine at all. He generally does like tuna cans. For tuna cans, sure I have the concern that because of heavy metal pollution, tuna are not that good. So I would just give him tuna cans occasionally. But I don't think he likes TIKI tuna cans as much as the Werura ones. Yet still it is good to try since every cat has difference preferences.

For the next three days I could barely speak.  I had burned my lips an the edges of my tongue so bad that only ate soup for the three days.<br /><br />Now wiser I still use them to battle a craving or two, just not in such high quantities.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the wood has an odd smell/taste that takes some getting used to (the mint flavored ones have the same smell/taste).  I assume this is the natural taste of the wood coming trough.

review/summary: Swedish Yummy-ness!
review/text: I was very pleased with the handling by iGourmet: the wedges of vacuum-packaged cheese arrived in a box with cold packs so they were still chilled (not a worry in winter but good to know if ordering during the summer months).  Vasterbotten cheese is to DIE for; it's beautifully aged and slightly salty like sharp cheddar, but with a savory taste all its own.  It's perfect when paired with dark sea-salted chocolate, in a sandwich, or just nibbled on all by itself.  We ordered four 8 oz. wedges and with great reluctance gave three of them away as Christmas gifts.  This cheese is made in only one locale in Sweden, in the Vasterbotten region (it's what they're famed for, amongst other things), and there's only so much of it produced at any given time.  You may have to sign up for an email alert letting you know when it's available, but believe me, it's worth the wait!

review/summary: Escargot-Tasty but Pricey
review/text: I had never tried Escargot(food grade snail) before. I can honestly say that my first experience, while a "Do it yourself" experience, was quite good. The snails have a very delicate and some what earthy taste mixed with an even lighter seafood taste similar to mild flavored scallops. The butter mixture on the pre-stuffed extra large escargot was a little to strong for the delicate taste of these wonderful creatures. I would recomend removing the snails from the shell immeadiately after cooking and allow them to drip a little before eating to get less butter and more snail flavor to truly appreciate their flavor. The shipping on this item was quite a bit more than I would have liked to pay....but is well worth it if you've ever been curios about trying this dish. The texture might freak you out if you're not familiar with clams, mussels and oysters....as these have a soft and slightly chewy consistency that quicky melts in you mouth. An EXCELLENT appetizer dish for surf-n-turf or just part of a seafood dish. If you can find a similar quality dish elsewhere with less shipping costs, I'ld jump on the opportunity to enjoy these!

review/text: I have been eating Ritz Bits for years now, and have generally enjoyed all of their flavors. I actually bought these new 'Kickin' Cheddar' by mistake, thinking that they were normal cheese Ritz Bits. In fact, these treats are quite delicious. Largely speaking, they taste like the normal cheese Ritz Bits, but with a background of jalapeno spiciness.<br /><br />They are not hot, but then again neither is the spiciness just a "hint" of spiciness. I found the flavor to be really nice - spicy, but not hot. The box says that nine Bits add up to 150 calories (carbs 17g), so you can easily munch six for a quick 100 calorie treat.<br /><br />What can I say? I like these crackers!

review/summary: Thought I'd found my BBQ sauce for life!
review/text: I love the taste of Bulls-Eye!  I found out that I was on my last bottle of the 'original'  - I like the other flavors as well - so I went by my local grocery, and I don't know why I looked on the ingredient list, but there at the top of the list, the main ingredient was High Fructose Corn Syrup!  I was shocked.  Didn't buy it of course, because besides the taste, I also love that I don't have to eat HFCS. I then checked the bottle I had at home.  Unbelievably, my older bottle had no HFCS in it at all.  So I'm savoring it for as long as I can until I can find a suitable replacement.  What genius at the company took a ridiculously fantastic product and decided to ruin it?!  Almost every BBQ sauce out there has HFCS in it, which is why I was so happy when I found Bull's-Eye.  If you love Bull's-Eye as much as I do, please let the company know how much you enjoyed their original non-HFCS formula.<br /><br />Bullseye originally didn't use HFCS so....<br /><br />I wrote a note to Kraft extolling the virtues of their great decision to keep HFCS out of their sauce.<br />Well, I got a note back saying this:<br /><br />Thank you for visiting [...]<br /><br />The formulation of BULL'S-EYE Original Barbecue Sauce has indeed changed and I'm sorry you were disappointed with your most recent purchase. Your experience is important to us.<br /><br />BULL'S-EYE Original Barbecue Sauce is committed to bringing the flavor you enjoy, while minimizing the impact of rising commodity costs to ensure we're providing the best possible price to consumers. To continue delivering the barbecue sauce you love we are now using high fructose corn syrup in all BULL'S EYE Original Barbecue Sauce.<br /><br />Product made with high fructose corn syrup can be identified by the ingredient statement on the back panel of the bottle.<br /><br />Our staff works very hard to provide the best tasting and satisfying products to the preferences of most consumers. Your opinion about the product is important to us as well and I will share your comments with our product development staff.<br /><br />Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts.<br /><br />Kim McMiller<br />Associate Director, Consumer Relations<br /><br />I went to my local Shoprite and culled the HFCS bullseye sauces out of the group, and bought all the others.  That will give me time to find a new bbq sauce.  You'd think Kraft would be smart enough to charge more for the HFCS-free sauce for the folks who really want it, instead of loosing us as customers altogether.

review/text: This item came well packaged, and arrived in a timely manner after I ordered it, so I do appreciate that fact.<br /><br />However, it was way too salty for me.  It was also quite overpoweringly 'fishy' - duh! - but I had thought that perhaps the spices and smoking would provide a less fishy taste, while adding some additional good taste to the salmon.  I did not taste the spices or smoking at all, just fish and salt.<br /><br />Not to my taste, I'm afraid.

It's not too salty, and although there could have been a tad bit more smoke taste to it, this is the best salmon jerky I have tasted.<br /><br />My only gripe with it is the price.  I would eat 3-4 packs of this every night if I could afford it, but I can't and I find it very hard to stop eating it for budget reasons.  :o(<br /><br />I guess I could buy one pack at a time, but that would leave me in serious cravings for more so I have actually stopped buying it.

review/text: Before I bought this (there was a great promo at the time, $20 off 2nd 5 lb bag and free shipping)I read reviews saying how great it was, but now the reviews are gone... very weird! So anyways, I have a Cuisinart Grind and Brew, I have had one for 7+ years before they even had the carafe version.  The only weird thing about this coffee is that it leaves little "rocks" behind in the grinder (and this is a newer cuisinart grind and brew). All other brands, xxxbucks, etc doesn't do that. But the flavor is great, we like ours strong but without that dirt flavor like some of the xxxbucks cofee has so this is great for us!

review/text: I drink this with sparkling water...the taste is great.  If you're not worried about calories you can stop reading.<br /><br />But if you haven't tried it before, don't be fooled by the name "drinking vinegar": there are a lot of sweeteners in this.  Here are the first four ingredients:  Cornelian cherry and pomegranate rice vinegar, high-fructose corn syrup, dextrose, fructooligosaccharide.  That's vinegar, then three sweeteners.  The remaining ingredients are apple juice, mixed apple juice, and water.<br /><br />Two ounces of this drinking vinegar has 120 calories.  So this not the Miller Lite of drinking vinegars.<br /><br />One other thing: since Cornelian cherry is a type of dogwood, this should probably be called "Sempio Drinking Black Rice Vinegar -- Dogwood/Pomegranate"...

review/summary: Koala's March Cookies - Delicious!
review/text: Koala's March (that's actually the name in the yellow box, you'll occasionally find packaging with this written in English) are absolutely delicious. The outside of the cookie kind of tastes like a really thin fortune cookie - basically just a very sweet and crunchy cookie. The inside milk chocolate is sweet, but not so sweet that it's overpowering like a lot of chocolate tends to be. It's incredibly smooth and the texture over all is great. If you're trying to find these IRL (if Amazon is out, or if you're just looking for them quickly), they're available in a lot of Asian markets. No asian market where you live? Try a store like Wegmans if you're on the east coast, or something similar (Maybe a Krogers elsewhere?) in the Asian food section. They do seem to be consistently at the Wegman's I've visited. (Erie PA has them every time I've gone.) If you're on the fence about them, I'd recommend trying 'em out. If you like chocolate, you'll like these.

review/text: My kids and I LOVED Koala Yummies and could easily sit down and polish off a box or two between us.  When they were discontinued, we were all disappointed and couldn't understand why anyone would want to stop making such a delicious cookie/candy treat that was relatively inexpensive!  Not too long ago, my son asked me about these cookies.  We did some searches on the internet and discovered that the cookies were still being made but primarily for the Asian markets. After a little more searching, I discovered that they were available on Amazon, being sold by a third party seller.  After taking a chance and ordering 2 bags, i was pleasantly surprised when they arrived quickly and were exactly as wonderful and satisfying as I remembered.  In the last month, I've placed a total of three orders from Amazon and see myself returning regularly in order to restock the Koala Yummies!!  Thank you Very Asia and Amazon for picking up where the grocery stores left off!!

review/text: We had to get this toothbrush kit for our cat who has a bad gene pool regarding his teeth.  It works just great and the cat doesn't really seem to mind having his teeth brushed at all.  After paying $300 to have them cleaned, this is definitely a good investment.  If your cat has bad teeth, or even if he doesn't, this is just a good habit to start in your cat's hygiene.  It definitely saves on the health bills later!

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: I bought this product for my 2 cats who are age 4 and 5.  I tried brushing with just water first.  I had a hard time even getting the cats to keep their mouths open.  I was able to brush one of my cat's side teeth but it made his gums bleed.

review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE these!
review/text: This is the best thing ever for my toddler to get his veggies! We just call them "fries" and he gobbles them up. Make sure he has some ranch to dip them in and he doesn't know any better. The carrot ones we can disguise as sweet potato fries and the cauliflower ones really look like regular french fries once they brown. They both taste really good as well. The apple fries I use as a dessert for him. The broccoli ones are a bit hard to disguise as he sees green and immediately turns his nose up. We used to buy these from a retailer in Arizona and we moved to Springfield, Illinois and no one carries them. I have to resort to buying them online for the time being. They are a bit expensive, as we used to get the larger bags (16oz I believe) for much less than these 4 bags combined. But I'll keep buying them if my picky eater will eat them!

review/text: We have only tried the cauliflower ones so far but my whole family likes them.  I heated them in the toaster oven until the edges started to turn a little golden brown and they were perfect. We like them plain or dipped in sugar-free ketchup.  But the price here is way out of whack.  I got them at Super Target for $3.99 per bag.

review/text: I am thirty... something, and I love veggie wedgies.  Is that wrong? They are like french fries but more nutritious, and quite frankly, they taste much better than frozen fries.  The consistency is amazing.  They stay crispie out the outside even if you eat them slowly, taking your time as they cool.  I highly recommend them.  Not just for grown-ups... great for kids too! I think it is a really cool concept to create foods kids love, but making them healthier by filling them with nutrient-rich vegetables.  Give them a try - you won't be disappointed!

review/text: Wow, these are pretty incredible! my kids don't eat anything healthy, I am lucky if they eat a pizza with tomato sauce! I put a plate of the broccoli fries in front of them and they didn't flinch! They are fat free... i guess because they are baked, and have like 4 ingredients on the list! I had to bake for a little less time than the instruction said, other than that they were flawless at my house!

review/text: I read a review that said these packs were so weak he needed 4 packs of these Boyds Coffee for the little 4 cup brewer - I thought he was one of those espresso-super-strong coffee drinkers --- FOUR PACKS IS JUST A REGULAR STRENGTH IN THE TINY DRIP COFFEE BREWERS.  Way too costly - you do the math --- it would be cheaper to go anywhere for a nice coffee than to invest in these ridiculously weak coffee packs.  Do not buy unless you want to buy tons of packaging - they are a waste of money & space - this order comes in a huge box - it really takes four packets to brew a REGULAR cup of coffee!<br /><br />Where are all the nice filter packed coffees we get in our lovely hotel rooms???

Highly recommend trying it considering the price isn't too shabby either!

review/text: When trying to navigate through the wheat free options, it is difficult to know what my 6 year old will like.  It is so hard to watch as he becomes more and more aware of the world of wheat that he is missing.  These chewy cookies are as about as good as wheat free gets--good texture, great taste and a near perfect substitute for a regular cookie.  He's even content to eat them as mini cupcakes if I cover the dome shaped cookie in frosting.  Also great with a mini scoop of ice cream between two.  Freeze and have a tasty ice cream sandwich.

review/text: Due to nursing a baby with severe food allergies I was on a very restricted diet for about 10 months.  When I found the Enjoy Life brand I was SO excited.  These cookies are just alright.  I prefer the Hard Chocolate Chip Cookies over the Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies (in the Enjoy Life brand).  The taste on these is definately not like a regular chocolate chip cookie, it has a bit of an after taste.  But if you're diet is limited, or you have a gluten, dairy, or other allergy they are a good alternative for a sweet treat.<br /><br />I do LOVE the Enjoy Life chocolate chips, though! They sell these by the bag.

No after taste to them at all. Which I love! Glad to find these aren't crumbling in my hand. The only drawdacks is I wish it was a bigger cookie and the chips taste more like nuts than chocolate. Should be labeled mini cookies. The calories aren't bad compare to other are alittle more calories. Definately keep getting these. Give you that sugar fix you need without the gluten, nuts and dairy!

review/text: Disclaimer: I do not have a gluten allergy nor am I lactose intolerant. I had/have an egg allergy however. I still eat a small amount of eggs occasionally (years of adolescent reinforcement, go figure); I'm okay if I eat an omelette with less than 2 or 3 . .. o 0 O ("I should probably stop.")<br /><br />The cookies. I am vegan 2-3 days of the week, mostly because I'm curious--and I want to "be real (as possible)" about my love for animals. I've never was really fond of dairy even though I've never had a serious issue with it. Also, I'm Asian, so I was raised on soy products. I am curious about what would happen if I stopped ingesting soy products. I grew up on Chips Ahoy!, Keebler's, Mrs. Fields, Pepperidge Farms, ... . For what these are, being Gluten-free, Nut-free, Soy-free, ... FISH-free(!), these packaged goods have my thumbs up. Usually, these "healthy  alternative" items don't end up tasting all that great because of a lack of fat and sugars. Not so with these.<br /><br />I like them: they're soft, bite-size. Only 12 per box though--that's kind of lam. A serving is two cookies. I eat them with hemp milk. I ate the box in three sittings, though I could probably do it in two, or one.<br /><br />These are the only cookies I know of that are Gluten-, Nut-, Dairy- and Soy-free. I've also tried Lucy's and Pamela's. They taste great too. But I'll choose these "less is more" Enjoy Lifes.<br /><br />p.s. - Google for "oreo stuffed chocolate chip".
