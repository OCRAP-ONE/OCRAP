review/summary: Simply The Best "K Cup" Cup Around
review/text: I'm a serious coffee drinker. I like it strong, rich and interesting. My wife prefers a good but milder variety. We've tried many, many K-Cup varieties and found several one or the other of us enjoys, but until now none that pleases us both. SFB's Rainforest does and in spades.<br /><br />This, to me, is simply the best "K-Cup" coffee around.  The details of the packaging are described elsewhere, but (to me)the biggest difference is that these 'not quite K-Cups' have more body than the regular fully sealed type - and lack of "body" is (again, to me) the biggest single failing of even the best K-Cup coffees.<br /><br />Great coffee. Ready in minutes. At a fair price. Doesn't that beat all? :)

review/summary: great cuppa
review/text: I have subscribe to these to get that extra discount which makes them a not bad price compared to others one cups. As most others have pointed out this is not a true K-cup as the base in not plastic. These make a nice strength of coffee for your medium cup size. It is a little weak coffee for me on the larger size. They come in three bags and I do wish that they could be resealed but I solved the problem by placing them in an air tight container. When I opened the bag of coffee I was hit by the smell of fresh ground coffee. I hadn't realized how much I have missed that smell. You don't get that with the plastic cups. Over all I thought it was a good price and makes a nice cup of coffee. I will be keeping my subscription.

review/summary: I am in love with this stuff
review/text: I loved my Keurig before San Francisco Bay, but now I am a little obsessed.  I find myself waking up earlier and earlier just so I can have my first cup of morning coffee...  yum!  I look forward to opening that ziploc bag and smelling the coffee goodness waft out.  I am definitely in love with the price.  The ONLY thing I am not in love with is the decaf selection.  I would drink even more decaf (i drink plenty now...) if there were more options!<br /><br />Yes, as others have said, this is NOT A K-CUP! This is a mini-filter, so you have to keep it sealed or refrigerated until you use it.  It contains more coffee, for a bolder, more delicious cup than the k-cups usually offer.  I can hardly go back to k-cups anymore.

review/text: I've been a longtime Starbucks fan, but this is my new favorite! Because of the new, environmentally friendly kcup design, you get the heavenly coffee aroma from the second you open the vacuum sealed bag, a bold cup of coffee that wakes up your tastebuds and lingers on your tongue; it holds up to creamer too and the price can't be beat, as far as I can tell. If you are looking for a robust cup of coffee you won't be sorry.

review/summary: At last!  Good coffee for the Keurig!
review/text: I love coffee.  Good coffee.  For many years, I have bought high-end beans, stored them carefully and ground them right before making a pot of coffee.  My husband and I have a fine dining restaurant, and the coffee we serve there is simply wonderful, because I carefully sourced the coffee we buy to get the best possible flavor.<br /><br />So, when I was given a Keurig as a gift, I was not exactly thrilled.  I am the only coffee drinker in our house, and I thought it would be wonderfully convenient, although I was concerned about the quality of the coffee available for it.  I had no idea it would be as bad as it was.  I know you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you meet a prince, but I sure didn't think I would buy and taste so much pitifully poor coffee in my search for something good.  I tried so many of those environmentally-unfriendly little plastic cups, and even the five-star ones were ... meh.  I even bought several contraptions that let you use your own coffee, but they were more trouble to use than making a whole pot of the stuff, defeating -- for me, at least -- the whole purpose of having a Keurig.  I seriously considered just giving the thing away.<br /><br />Then I saw these lower-priced, more environmentally-friendly pods from San Francisco Bay.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  When my pods arrived, I opened the bag and was greeted by the wonderful aroma of GOOD COFFEE!  My hopes soared.  When I tasted my first cup, I was so happy that I went through my office giving pods to my coffee-loving friends (we use Keurig at my day job).  It's still nowhere near the coffee in our restaurant, but I can at last have GOOD COFFEE at work!  The fact that these are more environmentally friendly and cheaper than the bad K-cups I've bought in the past is just a bonus!<br /><br />I bought several varieties and am happy with all of them, though the Rainforest Blend is my favorite so far, rich but not bitter and with wonderful coffee flavor and aroma.  It's a bit of a pain to keep them in a ziplock bag, but you get used to it, and the coffee is certainly worth it.<br /><br />FWIW, I also tried another environmentally-friendlier pod, Cameron's, and found it not nearly as good as the San Francisco Bay coffee.  I'll stick with SFB from now on, and I'm keeping the Keurig.

review/summary: Neat new more enviromentally friendly K-Cup Option
review/text: I was initially shocked when I initially opened my parcel and found these very cool new San Francisco Bay Coffee Organic One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend, 80-Count. First this is a great value at $33.00 including free shipping with my Prime Account. For those of you who have not tried Prime membership it pays for itself in between 60-90 days with moderate use and I believe Amazon still offers a 30 day free trial which is worth looking at to experience the benefits. I've had my membership for 3 years and its a great value! Enough for the the Amazon commercial back to the coffee. Price per cup is the lowest I have found anywhere at just under 42 cents. The normal K-cups are all plastic while these have a plastic ring with a fiber filter bag. Its not 100% recyclable but its a big step forward as the filter will break down quickly and the coffee grounds will then fall out allowing those to decompose as well. That leaves a small plastic ring (which looks recyclable) and foil top left. To assist to keep your coffee fresh you receive a reusable lightweight recyclable plastic tub with an airtight lid that holds about 8 K-cups for peak freshness. In addition each 8 K-Cups is sealed in a vented recyclable bag inside the box so you open one and put them in the storage tub after. Nice touch.<br /><br />This is a robust organic coffee with a smooth finish, its gives me above average caffeine buzz, please note I am not big coffee drinker, more a 1-2 good cups a day guy and I like to have variety, thus my move to a Keurig system (which I love and have spread this to 6 others in my family as well as many at my office). Thi is a good coffee with nice flavor and I also like the fact its organic, a little more recyclable and a good value. A++++

review/summary: Anxiously awaiting more like this - awesome new cup design!
review/text: The San Francisco Coffee Company has a fan here.<br /><br />Let's face it, what used to be an economical way to have a perfect cup of coffee has nearly become an all-too-expensive luxury.<br /><br />When I got my first Keurig coffeemaker years ago, (free from Green Mountain - the very first model made) I was impressed that I could get a consistently delicious and hot cup of coffee that compared with coffeehouse coffee for about 25 cents per cup at home. As the prices have risen over the past few years, we have cut back and use it probably half as much as before. Unfortunately, it is not the coffee but the packaging that costs so much more.<br /><br />Now that prices for many K-cups have risen to close to a dollar apiece, I was extremely pleased to see that someone has begun to offer a more economical and eco-friendly cup for the Keurig. I ordered a 36-pack of the Rainforest Blend to try it out at about .40 per cup - a reasonable price, in my opinion. The coffee is delicious (I will review the coffee itself after sampling some more) and the cups work without issue. In fact, I hope to hell Green Mountain licenses these guys' design to cut the costs of their products (maybe then I will start buying theirs again.)<br /><br />An added benefit is that it is MUCH easier to open the cup and efficiently remove the grounds for composting, before trashing the remains. I would guess I could fit the remains of 1,000 of these cups in the same garbage bag space as 100 of the conventional K-cups. Do yourself (and the world) a favor and start composting now.

review/summary: The smell of real coffee that's very good!
review/text: I think I read every single review here before ordering. At the low, subscribe-and-save price with free shipping, it was a no brainer to give this coffee a try. They arrived quickly and were packed in sealed, thick plastic bags. When I opened one of the packs, I was in heaven over the fresh smell of coffee! I have missed that with the conventional plastic k-cups. I don't know why more coffee companies wouldn't want to use the filtrated type k-cup method over the plastic. It's more natural and I don't see an issue with losing the freshness of the coffee if stored in a zip lock bag or container. Some complained of sediment in the bottom of their cup. I have not had this issue. Nor do I have those few tiny grinds floating in my coffee anymore as I sometimes had from brewing from the plastic k-cups.<br /><br />As for the taste of the coffee: I am a coffee snob. I admit it. I wouldn't be caught dead drinking convenience store coffee or Maxwell House type coffee! This is a smooth blend with no bitter aftertaste. It smells heavenly as it brews and is not weak. It tastes like a medium blend with slight hints of a dark roast. Some days I like it that way and other days, I run it through the Keurig twice for a lighter, yet still smooth taste. I end up with a large mug of coffee for (at this current time on subscribe & save pricing) less than twenty-five cents a cup!<br /><br />I can't imagine ever wanting to have my coffee brewed through a plastic k-cup again or paying sixty cents a cup for other k-cups.<br /><br />Enjoy this fabulous coffee and bravo to this coffee company for coming up with this far superior filter-style k-cup!

I'm betting the OneCup design is a little more eco-friendly as well.<br /><br />My suggestion to the manufacturer would be to make the plastic bag resealable so that I don't have to transfer the OneCups to a Ziplock container.  Other than that, a great product, deserving 5 stars!

review/summary: Fantastic K-cup!!
review/text: Bought a box of these from BJs before I found them on amazon. Let me tell you this is one GREAT cup-o-joe. I was a bit skeptical because of the kcup redesign but it brews perfectly in my B70.  I've been brewing kcups almost exclusively for the past few years, and as another reviewer noted I didn't realize how much I missed the smell of a freshly opened bag of coffee. These things smell Fantastic!  They come packaged in multiple vacuum sealed bags of 8 or 12 depending on the size box you order, I put mine in a vacuum sealed canister to store them on the counter once I open a bag due to the open bottom design of the kcup.  I'm really impressed at how full bodied this coffee is, I absolutely love it, kinda reminds me of a toned down version of  Timothy's Midnight Magic.  I think the thicker nature of the filter and open cup design allows for a more efficient extraction because this coffee turns out perfectly every time.  I also subscribed to the "fog chaser" variety which is very good but a slightly less robust cup.  For now I'm hooked on the rainforest!<br /><br />08/11/2012  Still loving the rainforest blend.  This is by far my favorite k cup of all time. This is the closest you'll get to a fresh cup of "coffehouse" coffee from a k-cup.  I just wish they would come out with a decaf blend also.

review/summary: too strong for me
review/text: I am normally a breakfast blend drinker. I decided to try this because bb wasn't available. Although my friends and family like it I felt it too strong. Packaging is great and price is too. I'm ordering breakfast blend today and hopefully that's good for me.I'm giving it five stars though because it is good quality.

review/summary: AWESOME!
review/text: I've been a huge fan of k-cups for several  years now, but have always felt bad about the environmental impact of the plastic cups (I even tried to figure a way to recycle them for crafts!) These little "suspended filters" are AWESOME and the coffee it equally AWESOME.  The flavor rivals my favorite Newman's Own or Green Mountain k-cups.  I have already turned several friends on to this coffee!

review/summary: Coffee great, Cup does not fit Keurig machine well
review/text: A friend gave a few cups of this to try.  Coffee was great.  The cup did not fit my Keurig Special Edition (a few years old) model well.  It did not fully seat in the cup holder and top would not close completely unless one held it down during brew cycle.<br /><br />Too bad, it seems like a nice lower waste design for the coffee holder cup.  But it simply did not fit my machine properly.

review/text: This was a great bargain for the K-cups. It was less than half the store price, these funny cups use less plastic but still work in the machine and they were delivered very quickly. The coffee is a little stronger, I think since there is a filter bottom instead of just 1 hole so more coffee seeps out. I just run the machine cup-less for hot water and dilute it myself.

review/text: I was a bit skeptical about trying this product.  I wasn't sure if it would work in my Kuerig.  It is like the k-cup without the plastic cup.  It works just fine & is more environmentally friendly.  The coffee is bold the way I like it.  I would compare it to Emerils big easy bold.  K-cup prices have gone through the roof so it is nice to find an alternative.  I would recommend this if you like a bold cup of coffee.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKAA2">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup, Rainforest Blend, 36-Count</a>

review/summary: best k cup I've tried
review/text: We've been using the Keurig for a few years, shortly after they became available for home use. We've tried many brands of K Cups and these, to me, are the best!<br /><br />The coffee is shipped in vacuumed  sealed plastic bags and once you open them, the  aroma is quite intense and intoxicating. After enjoying a few heavenly whiffs, be sure to get a BPA free plastic container that locks air tight. This will ensure that these new style cups don't get stale.<br /><br />Of course, the coffee is sooo good that they likley won't be around long enough to get stale!<br /><br />The flavor is rich and full bodied. It's strong, but not in the bitter or acid tasting sense, only in richness. My 18 year old daughter loves it as does my husband who general prefers breakfast blends that are lighter. I am so happy to have found this and thankful for the other reviewers whose reviews encouraged me to try this. We used to have many great options with the Subscribe and Save offer and a variety of coffees, but since Green Mountain has bought up all these coffees and refused to allow Amazon to do Subscribe and Save anymore, it's just ridiculously expensive to buy them if you have multiple coffee drinkers in your house.

review/summary: San Francisco Bay Coffee ( Eco Friendly)
review/text: This is a very innovative idea no cup just the exposed pod.  This product fits perfectly in the Krieg, it did arrive in a plane Box with Three individual bags with vents, and after opening I placed the remaining pods in a zipper bag to preserve the freshness.  I do go through them very quickly, I don't really have to worry about them going stale.  For the price of this it is totally acceptable.  Its a Dark smooth roast, I'd call this a Medium roast very good even at the largest setting, not watered down.  I will recommend this to my friends.  Great product & good Price.  A new Favorite of mine I will defiantly reorder.

review/summary: Too strong/Same taste as Organic with the yellow cap
review/text: This brew is just Ok I will not buy again. I love the packaging, less waste and cups brew just like original keurig. The taste however was not to my liking. It was just like the organic blend with the yellow lid except with a little less bitterness and just a little less burned taste. The aroma and basic taste however were the same. I read on here in another review that they may stop making that brew so if you liked it this will be a very good alternative for you. But for me this is not pleasant. I may try another flavor because I do like the packaging. That is the reason for the three stars not the coffee..

review/summary: Will keep this one coming!
review/text: 1.  I adore the flavor. I find it well balanced and smooth but bold with a slightly toasted flavor. Do not let the pictures deceive you, the pods work perfectly in my Keurig B60 machine.<br />2.  It's comparable to the Newmans Own Extra Bold organic with less intense bitterness. If you like your coffee strong and bitter this may not be for you.<br />3.  The packaging is fine. It comes in vacuumed sealed bags. The pods are hard topped with a tea bag type of material bowl bottom that will allow the coffee to steep when the water is injected into the pod. This design leaves the coffee vulnerable to air and dust if not stored properly.  It's an easy fix. I just toss them into a ziplock bag when I open a vacuum sealed pack of pods. Not a big deal.<br />4.  It seems like the pod design is why the coffee comes out so well. It is ultimately more like how a traditional auto drip maker produces coffee without the wait or waste.<br />5.  Considering the quality you cannot beat the cost.

review/text: I absolutely love this coffee.  I have purchased the French Roast, the Rainforest Blend and the French Roast Decaf.  I love the aroma, deep color and superb flavor of these coffees.  I savor every step of the preparation in my Keurig coffee maker.  I inhale deeply from the canister I store them in, I smell the pod before placing it in my Keurig,  I relish the heady aroma as the coffee brews and then immerse myself in the exquisite flavor which is so deep, rich and intense.  If you love full-bodied coffee then this brand is the one for you.  Excellent!

review/summary: Best K-Cup Coffee...And less plastic to waste.
review/text: No worries about not being full plastic K-Cup. It is basically a plastic ring with the foil top. A "mesh" filter bag replaces what we are used to being a plastic cup in traditional K-Cups. I guess this means less plastic waste. In the future, I plan to try to compost the mesh bag part. Haven't figured that out yet. No matter. It works just fine.<br /><br />This Rainforest blend has quickly become my favorite coffee. I'm no coffee geek, but if pressed, I'd call the flavor full and round. Not bitter. Not too strong, not too weak. I drink my coffee black, and this one does it for me.<br /><br />If there is a negative it is that the enviro-friendly packaging means that, once opened, you have to keep the un-used coffee in a plastic bag. We use one of those K-Cup Caddies, and this coffee sits on the counter in a plastic bag...next to that caddie. Small price to pay, I think.

review/summary: Good coffee, good price, less packaging to throw away!
review/text: I haven't found a downside to this coffee.  Bought it after receiving email from Amazon highlighting the San Francisco brand, which I had never heard of.  (Since Green Mountain instituted multiple price increases in 2011, and discontinued Hazelnut Dark Roast and a couple other favorites of mine, I have been seeking other alternatives.)  This was a much better price so I decided to try it.<br /><br />Didn't even pay attention to the photo that shows it is a bit different from a regular k-cup.  Surprised at the lack of the plastic cup portion, and very pleased.  My first thought was less crap to throw out into the environment.  Because it is not in a sealed plastic cup, and the plastic bag does not reseal, you need to store in an airtight plastic container or Ziploc bag, as others have mentioned doing.  As G. Eppinger said, the price justifies a little less convenience, and I am happy with less waste.<br /><br />I thought the flavor was great.  I buy only the extra bold flavors of whatever k-cups I purchase, and I did not find this to be weak.<br /><br />I would recommend this coffee, plan to buy it again, and will probably end up putting it on subscribe-and-save.  Green Mountain can keep raising their price if they want, I've found something new.

review/text: I bought these "kcups" to save money as the cost on my usual Kcups rose to 51 cents a cup on subscribe and save and I could not find them cheaper anywhere else online or locally. These ecocups produce a nice cup of medium strength coffee (not as strong as a regular Kcup). I use the Fog Chase and French Roast on the 12 ounce setting but the Rainforest is too weak to use  so I have to use the 8 ounce setting. The Big plus with these ecocups is that they are really good for use with your own coffee! I use DisposaCup Lids to refill these ecocups over and over again! That's a great vaule at 38 cents a "Kcup"!! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NM9YW6">DisposaCup Lids - 100 Disposable Replacement Lids for Use with Any Keurig K-cup - BOX of 100 LIDS</a>

review/summary: Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig
review/text: As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!

review/summary: Very impressed
review/text: I picked up this coffee for my husband because we recently was given a Keurig coffee maker.  I walked into the house this evening and he started raving about this coffee.  I was told that it is full bodied yet very smooth.  There is a slight astringency that adds a kick to the coffee.<br /><br />They aren't actually in cups but rather little bags with a hard top.  And it comes in 3 bags of 12 rather then in a box.  I can appreciate this fact especially since the savings is passed on to me the customer.  Now if only they would also make an iced tea.

review/summary: Surprise!
review/text: My first surprise was opening the box and finding a different configuration from K-Cups.  The individual package has a plastic ring at the top for sturdiness, covered with foil (as is any K-cup; but from there it is completly different.  There is no plastic cup, only a very fine filter material holding the coffee in a space that is half of what a k-cup would use.  I have seen some reviews that assume this means there is only half of the coffee of a k-cup; but it brews a rich full cup.<br /><br />The first thing that I did was try to find my refillable k-cup to hold it.  Doesn't fit.  Next, I tried placing it into the metal filter for the refillable k-cup.  Doesn't fit.  So I threw caution to the wind, placed the little packet into the b-75 as if it were a real k-cup.......guess what.....it is.  It worked great, will probably keep the lower piercing needle from plugging and made a very nice cup of coffee witout all of the high tech k-cup innards.  Since the is a green mountain compny. i guess they are trying new configuraions.  This one works; but it will require smaller stocking orders much more often to maintain freshness.........a major plus for the original k-cup.<br /><br />I am a strong advocate of sustainable agriculture and fair trade for the farmers.......+++ with this line

review/text: This is a favorite here.  I don't notice an after taste, but I am a heavy cream user.  Love the simple mesh cups and the full flavor as well as the fact that when I order the 36 box they are packaged and sealed in set of 12.  so some of the things other commentors didn't like are actually why I like these.  Will set up an autoship option and save even more on the 36 pack offer.  It makes this the best priced K-Cup I have found.

review/summary: Wonderful smooth brew,  lingering aroma at excellet price!
review/text: I dont't normally leave a review,but due to the costs of the kcups, i recently purchased an ekobrew reusable filter for my Keurig. Upon finding this item<br />( 36 for 20.00) I thought okay , I will try it. The rainforest brew is a true medium brew, just a bit on the light side, and finishes wonderfully and smooth. The aroma from brewing one cup lingered in my kitchen for hours! Yes, you cannot "display" them in a Keurig holder due to the packaging, but I store mine in a tin next to keurig, clean and tightly sealed. No drip, no problem with brewing in my machine. Love this item, will be back for more.

review/summary: Not a fan
review/text: I am not one for coffee that is over roasted or extremely strong.  But after reading other reviews and seeing the prices, I signed on up to try both the Breakfast and Rainforest blends.  Some said they were similar to other Kcups they had used, like Donut People, and I have to disagree.  Even upon receipt I could smell the over roasted aroma, but gave it a try.  Luckily we'll have enough company to kill 160 of these things...and I will suffer through a few 12 oz brews (to get it as weak as possible) myself.<br /><br />If you like Green Mountain Kcups, stick with them...this is not what you are looking for.

review/summary: No, they're not traditional K-Cups, but they work fine
review/text: The biggest differences I've noticed between these cups and the traditional plastic K-Cup are (a) they seem to leave a little more sediment in the bottom of the cup, and (b) they produce more "crema" - the brownish foam floating on the top of a good cup of coffee - than most other K-Cup products.  So far, only the "Extra Bold" varieties of traditional K-Cups have come anywhere near the amount of crema generated by these babies.<br /><br />But crema doesn't make up for lack of flavor, and I thought this variety was on the weak and watery side.  It's more like Maxwell House or Folgers than a real gourmet blend - color me distinctly unimpressed.  I found the French Roast variety grew on me, and the slightly "off" taste I thought I noticed at first didn't really bother me by the time I got to the end of the last bag.  But these I'm having to almost force myself to drink.  I didn't think I'd be buying the French Roast again when I first tasted it, but I've changed my mind.  This stuff I'm definitely NEVER buying again - in fact, I'm thinking about taking the last two bags into the office and leaving them by the Keurig for my co-workers to sample rather than drinking them myself - I dislike them that much.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I worked briefly for the company that makes these in the late '70s.  Since I had a personal connection to the product, I really wanted to like it.  Couldn't swing that with this stuff - I didn't care much for it at all.

review/summary: Unusual for me to not like a coffee
review/text: I really like Blue Mountain coffee the best..Great flavor acid profile is great, and I grade others based on that.  I like breakfast style most, high caffeine light roasts. I will drink almost any good coffee.  Dark Sumatra's ,, medium roasts, I will drink them and if I don't love them they are still ok to pretty good.  Then we get to this coffee. West coast coffee is on my least liked list, although I drink Starbucks with no problem.  This coffee smells bad to me.  It's organic, and I like organic, but it's like too organic.  makes me think they got some organic compounds from the fields in the mix.  Must just be too strong for me.  After mixing my cup well there is a heavy precipitate on the bottom of the cup that looks like chocolate syrup.  I don't like to waste stuff I buy but I find myself grimacing when I think of drinking a cup.

review/summary: AWFUL -  WATERY - NO REFUND ALLOWED
review/text: I bought a box of 36 Fog Chaser and a box of 36  Decaf.  Both are so weak, too weak even for people that like weak coffee. I really mean watery.  The water just flows right through the filter giving you a cup of slightly brown water.  I am very disappointed that I cannot return them.<br /><br />There is no label on the packaging and no label on the box. I thought there were label laws.  No instructions or anything with my purchase.  The pods come in a clear bag in 3 sets of 12. Once you open The clear bag you will need to find a container because they will be exposed to air.  Why no label on the bag?<br /><br />I like the concept but maybe the filter should be thicker so the water stays in longer or maybe you could make a stiff filter that gets punctured by the Keurig machine. Use unbleached filters please.<br /><br />I'm confused if this is organic coffee. On the San Francisco Bay web site it seems to be organic but it does not say organic on the pod.<br /><br />Thanks for your attempt but I would like a refund.

review/summary: Great cup of coffee
review/text: I decided to give the San Francisco Bay Rainforest Blend Organic Arabica onecup a try this morning.<br />When I open the box I notice a similar smell as the Fog Chaser blend but not nearly as strong.<br />Oddly I find the description on the Box exactly the same as that of Fog Chaser.<br />Their Website shows this as Reguler Full city Roast and describes it as follows :<br />Our certified organic, Rainforest Blend is an artful mix of coffees from Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, and Indonesia that produces a smooth, yet full-bodied taste with lively acidic notes.<br />The onecup brews perfectly in my B70 and like it smelled befor brewing produced a more delicate cup than the fog chaser but still very flavorful when brewed.<br />Maybe this is the same blend of coffee beans only roasted alittle lighter?<br />The wife and I tend to favor the Dark Roast extra bold Kcups and on occasion Medium roasts as well.<br />This Rainforest Blend is alittle light for me but it's really flavorful and wins me over all the same.<br />So far I'm really liking these offerings from Rogers Family company and would purchase them again if the price remains competitive to Kcups.<br />I was originally concerned by the fact they are not individually sealed for freshness.<br />The wife and I normally drink 2 cups a day so we can polish off a box of 12 in three days once opened so the coffee does not lose much freshness.<br />The downside is we need to drink only these for three days in a row instead of mixing it up depending on how we feel each day as we currently do with Kcups if we want to keep them as fresh as possible.

review/summary: Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig
review/text: As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup.  Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon.  Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!

review/summary: Great Taste - Less Waste
review/text: Local BJs had this on sale for $28 per 80 cups.  Thought It would be worth a shot.  Well, after getting it home, I was pleasantly surprised on a couple notes.<br /><br />First, the coffee is delicious.  Good body, bright flavor.  Really nice cup of coffee. (I don't use cream or sugar.)<br /><br />The second surprise is that the K-cups aren't full cups. Plastic is only used for the rim to provide rigidity so the cup will hold up under the pressure of the brewer.  My guess us that they use about 66% less plastic - less waste, less mess for the landfill. Aside from the rim, there is the filter material, which seems to be a better filter than in the full plastic cups.<br /><br />Finally, I've used the Eco-Cups over the years and really liked them, because I could use my own coffee.  The only problem is that cleaning them is not easy.  I had tried the MyCaps so I could refill the original K-cups with my own coffee.  While they worked well, cleaning the cups was messy (hence switching to the Eco-Cups).  These cups work GREAT with the MyCaps, since they are so easy to clean out and not messy at all.  Instead of trying to rinse out the used coffee, I now just peel the foil, and push the used coffee into into a container so I can compost it.  Then, with a simple rinse, it's ready to refill and pop on a MyCap and brew again.  What's great is that the coffee, itself is excellent and you can reuse the filters over and over with your own coffee.  Now, I keep a box of this coffee around for when I don't have time to do a refill, and refill when I want a little variety.  Best of both worlds.<br /><br />By the way, refilling them with the same grind-your-own, whole bean coffee also saves money (a lot of it).  You can do that by buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RO5M1Q">San Francisco Bay 100% Organic Coffee Rainforest Blend Whole Bean 3 Lbs</a> from Amazon. How can you go wrong?

review/summary: A Good Cup of Coffee
review/text: This is a nice, somewhat mellow but rich cup of coffee. I like the packaging because I have had more than a few normal K-cups either explode or backfire in my Keurig. With this type of cup, the water has no place to go but out through the filter. It's pure genius if you ask me. I do prefer the Rainforest Blend to the Fogchaser from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company. I found the Fogchaser much more acidic and, though it could be a coincidence, my heart rate went to about 120 after 2 cups of Fogchaser. Of interest, the pack of 3 I received did not come in boxes with any descriptions on them. They were just 3 thickish cellophane bags with 12 cups in each, which I thought was strange because when I ordered the Fogchaser, each pack of 12 was in a box and I was able to give one as a gift to my coffee buddy at work. As for the coffee getting stale as others are concerned about, well.....coffee doesn't last very long around here. 12 cups goes in much less than a week and I have not noticed any staleness by storing these in my upright Keurig carousel. That's probably because this particular carousel does not leave the bottoms of the cups exposed to air. I digress. I do recommend the Rainforest Blend -- it's a great cup of coffee at a really good price. And less packaging to boot.

review/summary: Great Concept & Taste
review/text: Truthfully, I ordered this because of the potential cost savings and after receiving the shipment and brewing a few cups, I was very pleasantly surprised. I had previously ordered the Timothy's Rainforest Blend to brew as an espresso shot (smallest setting) and as a flavorful cup of coffee (on the largest setting). They taste almost identical...with this version getting my vote as the best of the two. It's roasted just short of the burnt tasting French Roast, so it has flavor without the biter, heavy, overpowering taste some of us don't like...so you STARBUCKS PEOPLE, YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS and may call it weak...you guys have to stop basing all your reviews on that flavor profile as being 'correct'. This is a coffee brewer created mostly on convenience...you can't base a decent K-cup review as a direct comparison to a freshly roasted, freshly ground, drip cup of coffee! Base your reviews on how CLOSE we get to that...not that it's bad if not achieved.<br /><br />The folks caught up in the design difference are confusing to me, all it is is different. It has a solid plastic rim with the standard foil top, with a mini paper filter basket full of ground coffee attached to it...that's all it is. All I did was clean out the detachable basket that the cartridge sits in on the machine to get out any grinds that may have collected in there from previous K-Cups and everything from that point on was exactly the same...other than having to store these unique cartridges in a zip-lock baggie to keep them fresh. To me it was nice to get that coffee aroma once again similar to making a fresh pot of ground coffee...it's a sensory thing with me that I enjoy before brewing.<br /><br />This quality of coffee is a keeper for me and I have since put it on the auto ship program. To get 80 cartridges for $28 delivered (.35 per cup) is tough to beat...like before wholesale coffee prices went through the roof a year & a half ago! To all the Keurig owners out there, definitely give this brand a try in a roast you like...I promise you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Weak at High Setting
review/text: This product is an interesting cross between a Keurig cup and a pod.  They work in my old B-70, but just from looking at it you can see that it contains less coffee than a typical k-cup.  As a result, it brews a decent cup of coffee on the lower setting, but it's weak as a grande.  That may work for you - at the current subscribe-n-save price it's cheap for a k-cup.<br /><br />The flavor is perfectly ok - I'm not a coffee purist, but I'd call it a dark blend more akin to Sumatran than Colombian, i.e. not so smooth.<br /><br />There is one thing I guess I should add - these things have a pod-type body, i.e. a filter-packet holding the coffee, instead of the k-cup's all-plastic body.  Typical pods come in individual sealed packets to preserve freshness, but all 12 k-pods in each SFBay box are in a single, non-resealable plastic envelope.  This means that once you've opened the envelope, you're losing freshness faster than usual.  Again I'm no purist, but this would lead to staler coffee if you're not brewing these in a hurry - or resealing them somehow?  The box offers no advice or directions.

review/text: I love the way this is packaged (other than, as others have noted, you need to keep the K-cups in a resealable bag, so they're not quite as convenient as traditional K-cups in terms of storage).  But the coffee is only so-so.  Had several others try it, and they were not impressed, either--they liked the packages but didn't like the coffee.

review/summary: Spoiled batch made me shake my head and say "bleh!"; Very Strong Coffee
review/text: First the good:<br /><br />The lack of K-cup and packaging in small plastic bags allows for a one-way valve, which releases the gas that builds up around coffee while keeping air out, this is an awesome idea. Because of this you should NOT put the coffee into a zip-lock-bag, but instead keep it in its own plastic bag and use a paper-clip to keep it air-tight.<br /><br />Further, the lack of 'cup' for the K-cup allows the water to filter through the coffee in a more natural-way. This means that in order to make up for the lack of directional k-cup they use more grounds. More grounds is awesome because it avoids picking up the bitter parts of the coffee.  This perfected style of coffee brewing is why there is little in the way of bitter in the coffee.<br /><br />These are the two stars.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />It tastes like sipping petrochemicals. The danger of not burning the bean with a very dark-roast is that you get to taste more of the bean. The problem with these beans is that they taste like gasoline. All of the work and benefit of creating the most flavorful cup of coffee, which is what SFBay has done, is totally lost because the beans they use are not to my taste. I can only offer my own opinion of the matter, as taste is not an objective trait, whenever I drink the coffee it makes me shake my head and say "bleh!"<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Despite how bad the coffee tasted I drank through the first package slowly; now I'm on to my second package. It is VERY strong coffee, but not rancid. I would revise up to four stars given the quality of coffee I'm getting now, but since I was clearly sent a rancid pack of coffee I have to drop it to three stars.

review/text: The coffee is too strong for my taste and the container does not fit well in my carousol.  Also the price of initial purchase is satisfactory however does not stay that way, which makes it too expensive.

review/summary: Not a k-cup
review/text: Either for licensing or cost reasons, these arent k-cups.  Its the top of a k-cup with the filter bag full of coffee stuck to the bottom.  Therefore the coffee wont stay fresh and while you could put it in a ziploc or other storage container, the coffee is going to be exposed to air and go stale a lot faster than a k-cup.  They also dont fit well into a k-cup holder.<br /><br />I wont buy this brand again.  One of the main reasons why I like k-cups is they keep the coffee a lot fresher than regular coffee in a bag.

review/summary: you get what you pay for
review/text: I bought these because it sounded like a good deal.  Old story, You get what you pay for.  I knew I was in trouble when I opened package.  It didn't even smell like coffee.  I used top setting because I don't like super strong coffee.  Still did not smell like coffee, smells like mud.  Pretty much tasted like mud also.  Bitter mud.  I will try one more on different setting before throwing them away.  BUT they also jam in the cup holder thing.  Bottom came out fine but top was jammed in and took quite a bit of manuevering to get it loose.  NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.

review/summary: Half the coffee of a normal K-Cup
review/text: I purchased thinking it was a great deal for the price.  To my displeasure, the K-Cups are tiny at only about half the size of a normal K-Cup.  This results in a very weak cup of coffee and requires 2 K-Cups to achieve what is normally provided by 1 typical K-Cup.  I should add that the coffee is also lacking in flavor.

review/summary: Funky Pod Brews an Excellent 8 Ounce Joe
review/text: I purchased the SF Bay "OneCup" without paying much attention to the use of the phrase "...for Keurig K-Cup Brewers," so I was surprised upon opening the first box of SF Bay OneCups. I didn't connect with the carefully chosen description which never called the product "K-Cups".  They probably would have liked to call them K-Pods, if it weren't for potential trademark issues.  Another reviewer remarked that they are a cross between K-Cups and pods.  I echo that.<br /><br />The pod units fit perfectly in our Cuisinart K-Cup, and are dimensionally similar, with the top being pretty much a K-Cup twin, and the pod material provides the filtration.  No post-brew drip issues either.  Since they aren't hermetically sealed, you will find a zip lock bag or other airtight container handy.  I'm guessing that the pod material is more biodegradable than a real K-Cup, and probably worth the trade-off, requiring more care to preserve freshness.<br /><br />If you are looking for a medium bold blend, try the SF Bay Rainforest Blend. Funky pod brews a nice 8 oz. cup.  I will be ordering again.

review/summary: Impressed doesn't cover it!
review/text: I saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. I've been looking for a delicious dark roast organic coffee that wasn't bitter. My first shipment was scheduled to arrive on June 6, but to my surprise, arrived June 4. I opened up the box, and was pleased first off to see that the pods were packed into bags of 8, in order to keep them fresh longer. This was a plus, because no one wants stale coffee that has lost it's 'umph', and I had wondered how I was going to manage to keep all of the pods fresh until I used them up. The exposed filter had concerned me, but with the amount of coffee I drink, they won't have time to go stale opening one of the small bags at a time.<br /><br />My curiosity about the coffee couldn't stand any more, so I cut open one of the bags. The smell was amazing! Before I had even brewed my first cup, I knew this was going to be good. There was no 'burnt' smell to the coffee, just pleasant, rich aroma. Although I had already had my normal 4 cups for the day, I just had to have a cup immediately to see if it tasted as good as it smelled. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was quite impressed.<br /><br />The coffee is rich and bold without the bitterness of many dark roasts. It's very smooth and just begs you to drink more. I'm not an expert, so I won't try to rate the acidity, flavor notes, or anything like that, but I am a life long coffee lover and 4 cup a day drinker, so for me to say that this coffee is impressive means that at least I have some experience with different tasting coffees and it has passed my personal tests. If you prefer a 'weaker' cup of coffee, you can even brew twice from the same pod into a larger travel mug. It's good either way, I just personally prefer strong coffee.<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee for it's flavor, it's value, and on top of those, the fact that it's organic and produces less waste than typical K-cups. If you are looking for a smooth, dark roast coffee, by all means give the San Francisco Bay Rainforest Blend a try. You'll be glad you did.
