review/summary: Haven't used yet but pleased thus far
review/text: I purchased these beans here online because of the great price.  My local grocery stores (S&S and WFs) wanted upwards of $14 for just 3 beans.  I was surprised at how cheap they were thru this seller.  I placed my order on 7/5/11 and received the package on 7/11 so not a bad turnaround.  As reviewed by others the beans were soft, fragrent (but not artificially perfumed) and supple.  I think these beans were even a lil longer in length and thicker than what I'd seen in stores.  I haven't used them yet but will soon for making homemade desserts.  Best of all, I won't have to rationalize their use as if they were gold because I got them for such a steal.  I think I'll definitely be back for more soon.

review/summary: Really nice product
review/text: We wanted to make a recipe for vanilla bean ice cream and when we went to the grocery store to buy the beans, discovered the Madagascar beans (McCormick) were $14.99 and you only got 2 in a jar.  Since that would bump up the cost of my quart of ice cream tremendously, I decided to check online and we found and ordered these beans.  I was notified that they were shipped the following day and received them safely in a bubble-pack envelope via USPS about 3 days later.  They are long, plump, fresh beautiful beans and they smell heavenly.  If you need some vanilla beans, do not hesitate to order these.  You won't be sorry.

review/summary: Beautiful Beans at a Beautiful Price
review/text: My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KYSLMW">Cuisinart ICE-21</a> ice cream maker had a recipe for fresh whole vanilla bean ice cream that I wanted to try--until I encountered the $15 price tag on a single bottled bean at the grocery store!  So I ordered 7 fresh beans from Amazon (specifically from JR Mushrooms, shipped by OliveNation) for less than half that price.<br /><br />Seven plump, flexible, aromatic vanilla beans soon arrived.  It was a treat just to open the package, because the beans smelled so good.  They came in a sealed but resealable plastic bag, which I put into a glass jar in my spice cupboard for long-term storage.<br /><br />The French Vanilla Bean ice cream turned out to be wonderful! And I have enough reasonably priced beans left for six more batches!

They were in a vacuum  sealed bag, and once I opened them I stored the beans in their original bag in an airtight jar. They were excellent quality beans in terms of freshness and flavor, and they were a good value too. I would definitely order these again or recommend them to someone else.

review/text: When I opened the package at home, it smelled like an ice cream shoppe.  I used my vanilla beans for making Banana ice cream, and it came out amazing.  The beans were still plump, and not hard like the ones in my grocery store.  Plus they were a fraction of the price, even when I only bought the 7 bean package.  Considerable amount of savings with the larger packages, I just wanted to make sure I would use them first.  They are about gone, so the next time I will be opting for the 1/2 or 1/4lb packages.

I've bought these twice and the delivery has been fast and the beans excellent.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend these for making homemade vanilla extract, two cups of rum, vodka, or brandy, one vanilla bean split, and six or eight weeks undisturbed.<br /><br />It's a great deal. Jump on it now.

review/text: I first found these magnificent Madagascar Vanilla Beans on David Lebovitz's web site that links to his Amazon store! I ordered one, then two, and more. I have given the web address to countless people, so they too can place an order. I have people who know people, who know people, emailing asking where they can order this fabulous product at such a great price. I place an empty bean pod into a canister of sugar and use it when I need just a hint of that marvelous vanilla taste. The beans are a treasure on their own, flavoring everything better. Place your order with this fine company, but please leave me and David our fair share!

review/summary: Vanilla beans
review/text: This is the 2nd time I've purchased these vanilla beans.  Prior to this I would purchase vanilla beans at the retail store (bakery supply or grocery).  I was so disappointed in the quality of those beans that I was ready to stop using vanilla beans altogether.  The beans came in a plastic vial and when I opened them they were so dry they were brittle.  How happy I was to get my first order from JR Mushrooms.  They were fresh, large and delivery was quick and accurate.  I have and will continue to recommend this product & company.  Before retiring I had been a professional cook & baker & I want a quality product to use.  I make my own vanilla extract which is much better than most vanilla extract that you find in the stores.  All it takes is a little alcohol (I use vodka) and these good vanilla beans.  You get this recipe with the vanilla beans.  These are a staple in my cupboard.

review/summary: Wonderful Vanilla Beans!
review/text: I have to agree with most everyone else's reviews.  These are really wonderful.  I had them laying on my counter for a number of days before using them but they made my kitchen smell absolutely divine.<br /><br />They are much more pleasing to the eye than the tiny amount of dry shriveled up very expensive few you can buy in a jar at a grocery store.  These are moist and plump.<br /><br />100 percent vanilla extract has become so expensive it makes me cringe so I am using these vanilla beans to make my own extract (lifetime supply?). You can find recipes to make your own extract online.  It's very easy to make but you do have to let in sit for about 8-12 weeks. This would made wonderful gifts when finished. I am also using it to flavor sugar and plan to us it homemade ice cream this summer.<br /><br />I have bought food items from this seller before. They are very reliable and you get what you order in the mail very quickly.  I have really been surprised by how quickly I have received my orders from them.  Wonderful products AND service.

review/summary: Seems like fine quality
review/text: Item was packaged well, and seems to be of good quality, based on my limited knowledge of vanilla beans.  Though I love pure vanilla extract, I'm new to using the whole bean.  I withheld one star just because the flavor, when using the entire bean (skin included), had a subtle "grassy" taste.  This may be normal, or due to my inexperience and/or improper preparation of the bean, but I thought I correctly followed the directions I had read elsewhere.  Regardless, I'm happy with this product.  They certainly smell incredible, and will make your storage area smell delightful.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I've been buying vanilla beans at my local natural food store forever but decided that I need to find a cheaper source since I am using a full bean every week.  Two beans cost $10 at the natural food store.<br /><br />These Bourbon-Madagascar vanilla beans are fantastic.  They are plump and moist and very fragrant.  My only complaint is that they ship in a plastic bag--shipping is incredibly fast so the time in the plastic bag is minimal and I put them into a glass jar as soon as they arrive.  (My concern with the plastic bag is that the beans can lose their moisture much quicker if not stored correctly.)<br /><br />I will be buying more of these beans very soon.

I immediately put one of these beans in the vodka base for my own vanilla extract and the color and fragance were recognizably vanilla extract in half an hour.  Normally, the process takes about 3 months, but at this rate the extract will be ready to use in a couple weeks. Prompt shipping.

I am very happy with my purchase and can't wait to use them up and get more.<br /><br />Have recommended JR Mushroom's - vanilla beans to all my friends.

review/summary: Excellent pods and value!
review/text: Shipping time was fast, I got my order in about a week and the beans were quite lovely. I could even smell the vanilla when I picked up my mail even though I couldn't pin point what/where it was coming from my huge pile of packages.<br /><br />My pods were shipped in a bubble mailer, so they could easily get damaged while being handled in the mail. On the other hand, they arrived just fine. No squashed pods or oil smears AND the shipping was free. My pods also arrived in great condition, ver fresh (moist and pliable - and not at all dried out or fragile) so absolutely no complaints for my own personal uses. They'd have to go through a wringer or twisted in a pretzel to be crushed or snapped apart and that could happen sometimes when the mail gets sorted, so that's something to think about if you need these for presentation purposes.<br /><br />I will be making future orders with this company for sure, especially when the winter months roll around for home made hot chocolate and eggnog batches! Thank you so much for the wonderful value and great service!

review/summary: Food TV is making me hungry...
review/text: Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar "Bourbon Islands," Mexico and Indonesia. It took me years to get up the courage to buy a vanilla bean.<br /><br />When I did, I found the flavor was truly superior to vanilla extract. While you don't want to use vanilla beans in everything (too expensive!), you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream.<br /><br />Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes. The list goes on and on. There are so many uses for vanilla. Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean.<br /><br />Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America.<br /><br />Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet. The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution. It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract.<br /><br />I've been using pieces of vanilla beans, but on Food TV<br /><br />they always split these down the middle and also scrape<br /><br />out the vanilla for superior vanilla flavor.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I'm no expert, have never bought vanilla beans before. However I am out of vanilla "extract" and decided the best way to go was to make my own. I just split 7 of these with a pair of scissors and dropped them into 2 cups of vodka. Recipes I have read vary from less to more beans. I may buy more to add. But right now I am just enjoying the aroma. I never want to wash my hands again!

review/text: I really like Argo Teas from my trips to the store in Manhattan.  Their Earl Grey Creme had been the best Earl Grey I ever had (and I have tasted many).  Not sure why, but they changed the formula about a year ago.  I keep buying samples, but the new formula consistently tastes nothing like Earl Grey, it is closer to current black tea.  So I am disappointed about that, but their two other black teas in the sampler, Nilgiri Black and English Breakfast are excellent.

review/summary: Made a Great Christmas Gift
review/text: This past Christmas, I was just totally out of ideas for Christmas gifts plus I live in a rural area, it's over an hour in good weather to get to decent shopping and you can double that time if it's snowing so I have to be super organized about my Christmas list. Also, I don't want to buy just any old thing. I want it to be something they will use and enjoy.<br /><br />I had been shopping for an electric kettle for myself and was reading reviews on those here on Amazon and happened to run across this cocoa and I knew what I was going to get various family members for Christmas.<br /><br />This is a great gift because who doesn't like cocoa? I've always liked this brand of cocoa. It dissolves easily so there's no clumps, there are lots of flavors to choose from and most of them taste really yummy. I ordered a bunch of these, various herbal teas and the electric kettles and was done with the bulk of my shopping in about 10 minutes and all without leaving home. What a relief!<br /><br />Everyone seemed to really like these and I didn't buy anything useless that would just clutter up their house.<br /><br />If you are a baker, this cocoa with some homemade bread for toasting would be fantastic too.

PS, Idk why, but theres a dingo dental mini bones...its the same as the other regular mini bones. those are also cool. I find those last the longest, so get those if you want these bad boys to last.

review/text: Having a finicky four legged eater can be challenging when they are smaller than your average small breed. I have a teacup yorkie, who like most fur babies is spoiled rotten, but most products out on the market and readily available are too big for tiny bite, and those we do find tend to be discontinued by local stores. We use to give my dog the mini dingo bones, which she loved but really had to work for. The goof balls are better for her size and age, really easy to get to the chicken meat. these are great for older dogs or puppies.

review/text: Why would a huge plastic container of round cheese balls be selling for over 20 dollars?  Are you kidding me?  And the worst part is that the regular cheese curls are a thousand times crunchier and tastier anyway.  Cheese balls taste rather hard and lack the cheesy flavor in comparison to the actual curls.  Either way expect cheese stains all over your hands, and especially the furniture and Nintendo equipment (including TV and Wii remotes) in the living room.  A product that I fail to see why anyone would consider purchasing considering the many flaws.

review/text: I was hoping this would be a great chew for my dog's teeth, along the line of a bullystick. She's not much of a chewer, but I hoped the flavor would entice her to spend some time gnawing on this. But this isn't really designed for that. It's very crispy and breaks down quickly. While she loved the flavor of this--Tripe--she devoured the whole thing in less than a minute, negating the use of this as an aid in caring for her teeth. For my purposes, I don't think I'd buy it again. But if you're just looking for a tasty treat for your dog, this may be for you.

For those of us who can't stroll down to the local store and buy fresh ones (and I expect there are many of you out there), I think these are a good way to go.

review/summary: Like cheetos for babies
review/text: My baby is almost 8 months old and she's showing an interest for finger foods. She hasn't learned the pincher grasp with her fingers yet so she can't feed herself cheerios but she sure loves to hold sticks of food in her hands. I try everything my baby eats and when I first tasted these, they reminded me of Cheetos. The cheddar flavor is very evident. Some pieces are small -- some even too short for her to hold -- looks like sizes vary slightly. She hasn't had any choking issues with these since they melt in your mouth fairly quickly. Sodium value is also fairly decent. I have noticed though that if opened (with lid on) for more than 1 week, it starts to become less crunchy and more on the chewy side.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts from label:<br />Calories 35, Serving Size 18 pieces, Servings per container 6, Sodium 50mg<br />% Daily Value for infants 0-1:<br />Protein 0%, Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 6%, Iron 10%, Vitamin E 20%, Zinc 15%

review/summary: very hard
review/text: These will be great for my daughter when she's over a year old or so, but at 11 months, she is not quite ready for something this large and crunchy.  They don't dissolve easily like the Gerber lil crunchies or puffs and I had to dig a whole wagon wheel out of her mouth so she wouldn't choke because she put the whole thing in there and it just sat there without dissolving, even using her teeth and gums to try to mash them.  They are about the size of a quarter so I tried cutting them up into cheerio size pieces but they still just sit on her tongue and don't dissolve and she has a hard time swallowing even the smaller pieces.  I bought a bunch in bulk so I will save them for when she's a little older.  I just wanted other parents to be careful what ages these wagon wheels are fed to.

review/text: I like the veggie dip and the garden tomato flavors best but I think my little one would eat any of them.  He loved the puffs and now the crunchies.  They are a perfect size for getting him to feed himself but they can get messy.  Even when they get stale, he loves them.  It's a good snack for him and definitely a little overpriced, but Amazon has them cheaper than any store in my area. And I'm as a first time mom, I'm a sucker for any baby related foods that seem healthier than what my nephews are eating.

review/summary: Son's favorite snack!
review/text: I started him off on the Puffs, since I was a little afraid of the Crunchies because they looked so big. But he actually has a lot easier time with these. They seem to dissolve a little better than the Puffs, and since they are bigger he can manipulate them better. He either holds them while he noms on one end (they dissolve fast), or he's able to push it around in his mouth well enough that he doesn't gag. The Puffs tend to go to the back of his tongue and he often coughs and gags on them. They are nutritious, and there may be better snacks out there but for right now these are awesome.

review/text: We attribute our son's new-found interest in eating finger foods to these little cheese sticks.  He first discovered them on a visit to grandma's.  They're perfect - long enough that he can hold them in his hand and still bite off the ends, and he appears to think they're quite delicious.  He's start being interested in other finger foods now that he has mastered these, but they are by far his favorites.  Would definitely recommend!

review/text: Gerber has an amazing line of products for babies and toddlers, but this product is a miss.  The Wagon Wheels are extremely hard.  They do not dissolve at all in the mouth.  I had hoped they would be similar to the puffs Gerber makes (only larger), but they are nothing like them.  We had to toss these.  I was scared my child would hurt her teeth or choke.

review/text: I wish I knew how to make these with a bit less salt. ALL my kids want to eat them from the 13 y.o. down to the toddler, but we try to save them for travel or a special snack because they cost so much per pound!<br />They do taste very good. They are more spicy (not hot, just spice) than I had anticipated, but my toddler likes that. If yours doesn't like spice or you don't want them to eat a snack with a higher salt content (for toddlers) I'd skip buying this.<br />I did buy these earlier, but then waited to feed my son until he was old enough to handle the spice.

review/text: I got these for my 8 month old twins, who at the moment are very big on self-feeding (and not on spoon feeding haha).  These are nice because they are bigger than the puffs and easier for them to hold on to.  They are pretty good, basically just a healthier version of cheese curls though.  My mother-in-law bought them the cinnamon maple flavor, and they are wonderful!  I wish they had a variety 6 pack on Amazon so that we could try all the flavors!

review/text: My 10 month old loves these. I've tried the Veggie Dip as well as the Garden Tomato. Actually, my hubby loves them too so I find myself running out pretty quickly!<br /><br />I love the fact that these are tasty, healthy, provide teething relief since they are crunchy, yet soft enough for our (as yet) toothless baby to "chew", melt in her mouth pretty quickly so there's no choking hazard, and are easy for baby to pick up with her own hand. Sometimes when my daughter is in a fussy mood and wont eat anything else, I put some of these in front of her and while she's concentrating on feeding herself, I sneak in a few spoonfuls of food. Very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend.

These were an instant hit with him as not only are they great tasting but healthy and safe for babies as they melt away in the mouth. My 3 year old also likes to share it with him and takes some to her pre-school. Its convenient on the go and reasonably priced. I recently got some Gerber Graduate coupons and combined it with sales and got some great deals.

review/summary: Great Puff alternative to the "Fruity-yogurt" kinds
review/text: Our daughter loves these!  She had a lot of trouble transitioning to solid foods, and we had to take her to a specialist. The specialist mentioned that if your child has trouble with solids and with chewing motions... you should use foods that are longer and thinner to encourage chewing on the sides of the mouth. These were perfect.  THey can be easily cut into rounds using a serated knife, and to encourage chewing, they are long enough for you to hold them to the one side of the mouth.<br /><br />Also, since our daughter loved puffs of all kinds... we wanted to at least introduce a variety of flavors. The garden tomato ones were a hit right from the get go and we continue to use them in "mixes" with other easy to pick up foods (goldfish, veggie crisps, etc.)<br /><br />Would recommend, will buy again!

review/text: I bought these for my almost 9 month old twins. I was totally shocked by how hard these wagon wheels were. I bought them thinking they would be like there other products, soft and safe to eat. While I can break them up into little pieces to eat that defeats the purpose I could just give Cheerios for a fraction of the price. I have to say i dont feel comfortable giving them a whole one to eat, they put in there months and they take forever to dissolve. Big miss on Gerbers part for these items.

Look around for a better price: I was able to find a great deal at my local BJ's club: a mixed 6-pack for $9.99. At the supermarket, they are $2/can.<br /><br />Whenever we go out and run errands, I make a snack container for him. I mix a bunch of different snacks together and let him choose what he wants when fussiness ensues. He always chooses these or the Dr. Sears yogurt melts.

review/summary: VERY HARD
review/text: MY DD has trouble with solid foods but loves the puffs. I ordered this to get some variety from the standard gerber puffs/ sticks.  Unfortunately I ordered a pack of six thinking that these would have a similar texture to the other snacks.  These snacks are hard for ME to chew and actually cut the roof of my husbands mouth when he tried them. At first we thought it was just a bad canister, but when we opened the next canister... same issue.<br /><br />IF your child is to the point where they can chew these... they certainly are not in a stage where they need puffs anymore!<br /><br />Would not recommend.

The only bad thing about this particular product is that he REEKS of maple syrup the day after having these for snack (no more than 1/2 cup size serving). It is a 3 feet away and can smell maple syrup type of odor - even after wash hands, face, and taking a bath.

review/summary: Big hit with my daughter
review/text: My daughter loves these!  I used to be so super worried about her choking on anything; I even used to cut those Gerber star puffs in half.  Then one day she just chewed it up.  So I then tried the Gerber crunchies and she loves those too.  The cheese are her favorite, but she doesn't like the cinnamon maple ones.  Then I tried the Gerber Wheels and she loves them.  She holds them with one hand and then bits a piece off and chews it.  They are harder than the rest of the snacks but they still dissolve.  She did stick the whole thing in her mouth one time and I told her no, and out it came.  She hasn't stuck the whole thing back in her mouth since.  I would defiantly recommend these, just watch your child while she is eating them.
