review/summary: Doesn't take a genius to figure it out
review/text: We bought this for our dog as a way to feed him his kibble and entertain him for about 20 minutes a day at the same time. Out of the box, it took him about 10 minutes to figure it out and empty it of the 1 1/2 cups of small kibble. If we fed larger kibble, it might take longer. But because I had read other reviews, I knew this to be the case and followed the advice of others on here. I added some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CSAJ96">small tennis balls</a> to the jug and then threw the kibble in on top of it. That helped in 2 ways. First, the kibble didn't spill out of the neck while I was filling it from the bottom. Second, it slowed down the amount of time it took our dog to empty it (about half an hour).<br /><br />Just a word of warning: you will have kibble all over your floor until the dog goes back to eat it up. Ours is pretty good about going back to clean up after himself but you have to have patience that he will do that.

review/summary: Challenging but not frustrating
review/text: A friend of mine had just bought this for her dog who seemed to find it challenging and recommended it to me.  My Rottie Sarah figured this out pretty quickly; within two minutes she figured out if she pawed at the rubber throat side, it will upend and kibble will come out. Second round she graduated to that plus nosing it up the rest of the way.  Third she figured out putting one paw on the rope helped her paw it upend with the other.  She's also lifted it up in her mouth, open end down. In defense of the toy, she previously learned to do this with kibble in Kongs so she may already understand "things that if tipped upside down dispense treats".<br /><br />She's a pretty smart dog but of course everyone thinks their kid is the smartest in the class :)<br /><br />I've read suggestions on adding balls to it to make it more difficult, which would slow her down, but I was hoping to be able to increase the mental challenge not just reduce the randomness, so this now is as "difficult" mentally as it'll get.<br /><br />She's completely ignored the rope except as a way to upend it.<br /><br />On the positive side, it does provide her mental challenge, slows down her otherwise rapid eating, and isn't so difficult that she gives up or gets frustrated.  She also has the Kong wobbler which she's figured out (gets her nose under the fat end and just keeps rolling it to get the kibble out), which is a pretty good product, but the Busy Buddy is a bit more challenging.

review/summary: A Thinking Dog
review/text: This is my second Tug-a-jug, I purchased my first in December of 2008. When my it went to a new home with a foster dog, still in great shape, I knew I needed to purchase another for my Service Dog Toby, as he loves it too. This Tug-a-jug is larger than our last; it is the Medium/Large size. Toby enjoys trying to get whatever I put into it and puts a lot of thought into it. He even prefers having his regular food out of it, even though he could simply go to his bowl to eat. The bottom easily screws off, I fill it with his food, a few treats of varying value and one extremely high value treat (EHVT) that really doesn't come out, but he has hope that some day it will. When I wash it, he gets the contents and thus the EHVT. He knows that I unscrew the bottom, but of course without opposable thumbs, alas he can not. Even so, he tries to figure out how to do that. Dogs can use a lot of energy thinking, chewing and exercising, so I like to give him a variety of each to keep him content. Our last Tug-a-jug being smaller, he would pick it up from the bottom to try to get the food out, this one being bigger, he can no longer do that, so he's had to change his tactics and I've enjoyed watching how his mind works.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I just got this toy for my 1.5 yo German Shepherd. He's a big chewer, and true to the breed's intelligence, and I have been looking for something to keep him occupied when I have to leave the house. This is it, I put a hand full of training treats in it, and it keeps him occupied for over an hour. I am slightly worried about the durability, but so far it's stood up to full grown GSD which is the true test for any toy in my mind. Well worth the money for any smart/curious dog.

review/summary: Busy Buddy keeps my bichon "Shiloh" busy
review/text: My Bichon "Shiloh" really loves his Busy Buddy treat dispensing toy, he has had this toy for over a year now and still gets excited when I offer it to him. He's the kind of dog who when bored and/or anxious tends to chew on his tail and paws, so this is a welcome distraction. I offer it about once a week. I used to leave his toys laying around in his dog bed or crate, but found that he loses interest so I tend to rotate offering 2 or 3 toys every few days. Any small treat works well, as long as it's not his usual dog food. I thought it was a little expensive, but it's durable, easy to instill the treats, and challenging enough to keep him busy for at least a half an hour, but not so hard that he loses interest. I'll try to attach a 45 second video of him playing with it.

review/text: This is a nice change of pace for my dog from the kongs. Lately, everyone has been making their treats smaller and easier to get out of the kongs, so I'll definitely be using this more.

review/text: I have had this toy for three months. My big dog loves plastic bottles and will assume every water bottle is meant for her so I was curious about how this toy would go over. It was a definite hit!  She loves it and ever after the beagle has tried to destroy it you can hardly see a mark on it!  At least as far as dogs are concerned I think this might be indestructible.

review/summary: Dogs love it, but...
review/text: Our dogs (30lb and 40lb Corgi/border collie mixes) love it, it's about the right level of difficulty.<br /><br />It was evident pretty quickly, though, that as soon as our bigger dog figured out how to sink his teeth into the plastic enough to pick it up from the bottom and bash it against things to shake the contents out that it was going to have a rough life, and so it's proven.<br /><br />After a couple months of fairly regular use, the body of the jug has split all the way down from the mouth to the bottom cap on two sides.  It still works, but the pieces are only held together by the bottom cap and the rubber ball at the mouth.

review/summary: Brain vs. Brawn
review/text: So I am the proud owner of an almost 80-lb. 1-year-old lab mix whose sole mission in life is to seek and destroy.  I have been looking for toys that would hold his interest longer than the 5 minutes it takes him to rip them to pieces, and saw this at my local pet store, but in the small size.  I was thrilled to see the larger size on Amazon, and ordered it.  This is a toy for smart dogs, and, of course, I like to think my dog is smart.  However, he may be too smart.  Gave it to my dog tonight.  It was interesting to watch him try to figure out how to get the treats out, and he seemed occupied.  I walked away to leave him to his work.  10 minutes later, he had chewed through the rope coming out of the top of the bottle.  He cheated.  This had potential to be an awesome, time-consuming toy to same some of my sanity.  Unfortunately, if you have a strong chewer, or a dog who can figure out the short cuts, save your money.

review/summary: Plastic can crack from a strong  chewer
review/text: I have a three-year old lab/chessie mix. She's a fast eater and a strong chewer so I bought her the Tug-A-Jug to slow down her eating (and give her something to chew on).<br /><br />It does slow her down. It can take her up to a half hour to eat a meal instead of two minutes.<br /><br />I've given her food a couple of times without the bottle, but she prefers the bottle now.<br /><br />Updated section!<br /><br />As she become a strong chewer, it's fairly easy for my dog to chew off the bottom part that's screwed on. This leads to the possibility of her swallowing a sharp piece of plastic.<br /><br />It's a great toy, but only for dogs that aren't extremely strong chewers. My dog loved this, but it's too much of a safety hazard for her to have again.

review/text: I got this toy for my Border Collies and they had one really good play session with it before they tore it up.  The bottle itself survived, but the rest of it was ruined, so you couldn't use it as a treat dispenser which was the point.  I was hoping it would keep them busy/entertained. I think it would be okay for dogs that aren't as aggressive though.  My dogs can tear up pretty much anything though! lol

review/summary: If it's hard for ME to get the treats out, I don't think my dog's going to have much luck.
review/text: I was really rooting for this toy to work out, because my Frenchie Tobias loves playing with plastic bottles and he loves treats. The Tug a jug should be the perfect combo, right? The one I purchased had the rope, not the rubber thing. In theory, when you tip the toy treats should fall out relatively easily, according to various instructions and videos I found through internet searches. But even with small kibble, it is extremely difficult to get any treats out of the toy. Poor Tobias was quite frustrated. I helped him out by holding onto the bottle so that he could tug on the rope. He pulled quite hard for a good five minutes, after which one piece of kibble fell out.<br /><br />He's actually quite clever, and he's extremely food motivated. I don't know if something was wrong with this particular Tug a jug, that it was so difficult to get the treats out, but it's definitely not working out.<br /><br />I only give two stars because he did not destroy it, although he was throwing it around and chomping on the bottle part. He did leave scratches all over it, but hasn't yet managed to crack it. However, I think it's only a matter of time.

review/text: I was initially surprised how big the toy was (small), but my dog (12 lb Terrier mix) ended up loving it anyways.  I feed him his meals between various puzzle toys and it does wonders for his destructive tendencies.  I was upset when it broke after only one week.  I have mostly carpet with minimal tile floor, so not sure if he got rough with it on the hard surfaces.  I tried taping the bottom shut after I fill it with food, but eventually the screw part totally fell apart and I had to throw it away.  Not sure I will buy another one at this price.  :(

review/summary: Not for use on hard floors
review/text: This is definitely more challenging than a tricky treat ball or a twist n treat saucer, and our 55 lb pit mix really enjoys it.  However, it should not be used on hard floors.  After only 3 weeks the entire top is completely cracked, and it's only a matter of time until the entire thing is going to be broken.  Upon discovery of the cracks we started letting our dog play with this on the carpet, but it was too late; the damage was done.  We considered duct-taping the top to keep it in place and all in one piece, but it was too difficult to try to get the kibble in to the little space on the rope end.  We will probably buy another one of these since it is so much for for our dog, but I wish that it was more durable so that he could play with it in the kitchen on the tile floor.  Allowing him to play with it on carpet = lots of vacuuming of the kibble crumbs!

review/summary: Can be noisy
review/text: Our dog likes this toy which we had gotten hastily at a drugstore when we realized we left her toys at home while on vacation. We fill this with Zukes or with crushed Nuturo choice snacks and leave it for her when we go to work. This can be a really long toy for your dog due to the small opening near the rope and it's good to check that what you put in will actually come out. Our dog gets her treats out be picking this up by the rope and then flinging it across the room (much to the chargin of the tenants below our apartment). She also just chews on the rope when she is bored and also tries to tug the rope back and forth in order to dislodge some of the treats. The best method for her however is to throw it and although it's durable, your wood floors may not like it and it can be somewhat noisy. But for this price, your dog will get a relatively long lasting treat dispenser that you can manipulate in order to increase or decrease the difficulty of earning their treat.

review/summary: My Puppy Loves This!!!
review/text: I bought this toy for my puppy (She's a frug, 3/4 French Bull and 1/4 Pug) It took her a while to learn how to get the treats out. When she's a little hungry and she's in a hurry to get to the treats, she brings the jar to me so I can shake out some treats.  For treats we use Rachel Ray's Nutrish dog food. The pieces are just the right size for the Busy Buddy. The only problem we've encountered is that our puppy chewed up the cord. We've tried a few different cord replacements and haven't found one that works very well. We don't recommend letting your dog take it to bed (especially if he/see sleeps with you) because you'll wake up with pieces of treats ... well you just won't like it! Other than that, it will keep your puppy well occupied.

review/summary: Too easy
review/text: I have a dachshund/terrier mix who is 2 years old. I bought him the Busy Buddy for the same reason everyone else probably does: he needed more mental stimulation. I brought the toy home, loaded it up, and offered it to my dog. He quickly figured out the rope was restricting the flow of treats. He promptly chewed through the rope, leaving a knot in the bottom of the bottle and the rest of the rope and other knot on the floor. Without this restriction he figured out (within a matter of minutes) that if he threw the bottle into the air, the bottle would bounce, sending a treat or two flying out of the mouth and onto the floor. It should also be noted that this toy IS breakable. However, your pup would have to have pretty strong jaws like my dog's.<br /><br />Synopses: Great toy if your dog isn't smart enough to chew through the rope or try to break the koosh ball.

review/text: Purchased our Tug a Jug after my 12yr old beagle shredded an Atomic Treat Ball. I went with the TAJ because of the sturdy hard plastic and rubber neck and the ease of cleaning it out after each 'session'. These were both issues with the ATB. I did remove the rope IMMEDIATELY after buying it because 1) its not able to be thoroughly cleaned and 2) it is a MAJOR igastro-intestinal blockage risk should your dog injest all or some of it(I've seen this first hand, I work at a vet). Its an expensive, invasive surgery that can be easily prevented with the TAJ if you remove the rope!<br /><br />My dislikes for the TAJ are:<br /><br />*The rope. I'm still surprised that dog toy manufacturers still use rope in their products despite the documented risks to and actual deaths of beloved pets! Toys should not be a death trap. Shame on you Busy Buddy.....<br /><br />*You can't adjust the kibble opening or dispensing rate of the kibbles. My dog figured out the first day that if he picks up the base LOTS of kibbles come out. I do understand this is due in part to my removing the rope, but its still an issue. Its annoying since he's not really 'working' for the food and he's done after just a few minutes, bored again. I've had better success plugging Kong toys with peanut butter or cream cheese and freezing them.<br /><br />*My dog will only play with it on the carpet because of the noisy, yet more sturdy hard plastic. It is very noisy on our kitchen linoleum and I can't begin to imagine it on tile! Blue prefers the carpet for more silent snacking, but this means dog food on my carpet and carpet fuzzies on the TAJ :( We've sort of solved this with making him snack on a small mat/rug that can be cleaned.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I would recommend this toy to pets that are not heavy chewers, as I don't think this would stand up to pits, rotties and other heavy chewing/large breed dogs. Its also a great toy for dogs that aren't such gifted problem solvers(like my beagle) since it IS such a simple design. Also a breeze to clean and fill with the screw-on base for the owner and it will hold a good amount of kibble.

review/summary: Great toy!
review/text: My 6 year old puppy LOVES this toy!  She is a crazy Sheppard mix, 60 pounds and full of energy.  I love finding toys that challenge her and keeps her busy for a while without my arm having the toss something every 30 seconds.  At first she didn't know what to think of it and got a little frustrated that she couldn't get to her treats, but after a few times with patience and encouragement from mommy, she turned to a pro!  She plays with it so much and understands to stop tipping it over when all the treats are eaten.  She got a little too good and now I have to dilute her treats with dry dog food.  Best treats for this toy: Zukes Mini Naturals Dog Treats.  Pitfall: I hate the screw-on bottom; I can never seem to get it on right so I put all the treats in through the top.  No a big deal for me, but might matter to some.  Bottom line, I'm happy if there is a toy that keeps my crazy puppy entertained.

review/summary: Fun but not sturdy
review/text: My puppy loved this toy...but it lasted less than a month! The rope was easily chewed up in a matter of minutes when my back was turned - unlike most other rope toys we have that have lasted since we got her 6 months ago. Then, she was tossing it around with the remains of the rope, and the bottle hit the floor and the screw on end broke. So, now we can't put treats or toys in the bottle - which is the whole point of the toy! If your dog isn't a rough player, then this is a great toy...once they figure it out. I was very disappointed that this seemingly tough product broke so quickly.

review/summary: No Match for a Boxer
review/text: My 3 yr old 75lb boxer is a heavy chewer and has a really long attention span to toys that give him a challenge. So at first this seemed like a promising toy.  It lasted maybe one week before my boxer figured out that picking it up in his mouth then dropping, no slamming, it on my hardwood floor gets pieces of food out. The end cap, which screws on and is plastic, never stood a chance. it broke off and I was able to screw it on once more before bits of plastic shards were on my floor and victory was his.<br /><br />It now sadly sits in the dogs toy box he doesnt like it anymore now that it doesnt dispense treats. lol. I wish I could get my money back or get a new plastic screw cap for it.

review/summary: Not a good toy for chewers
review/text: I bought this item for my dog to play with. She was smart and can get out all the food in it. Initially I like it since it was entertaining for my dog. However, my dog quickly chewed open the rope - only the 3 time I used it.<br /><br />I think there is a problem with the design - it will be great if the rope can be replaced with some better material so it does not get chewed immediately.<br /><br />I asked some dog friends and they pointed out the same problemm. I would not recommend this item for dogs who chew. Well, most dogs chew, so...There are many other interactive toys that you can try.

review/summary: Not for use on tile floors, but otherwise, amazing!
review/text: My four year old beagle loves the tug a jug! It was recommended by the shelter I adopted her from, and it keeps her busy. I give hre about a third of her meal in her bowl, and the rest in the tug a jug.  It took her a few tries to get the hang of it, but now she rolls it around and has learned to put her paw on the bumpy part to tip the jug up and empty the food out. It works great with her kibble (eukaneuba adult maintenance small bites) but she goes crazy when I put her high-value treats in it like little pieces of string cheese.<br /><br />There are two down sides - one, since the rope never comes out, the part inside the jug gets kind of gross with all the food. its a little hard to thoroughly wash, but it can be done. Two, I had her at my parent's house and they have tile floor.  She banged it hard enough to break the plastic on the end piece (it unscrews on the bottom of the jug to let you put the treats in) - so I suggest not using it on tile floor and of course, quality supervision.<br /><br />I leave it out after she is done with it and she often returns to it during the day just to check and see if she missed anything! Definitely recommend. However, I will saw that these products are significantly more expensive at Petsmart/Petco - I recommend Target, Amazon, or a local shelter's shop where the proceeds go back to animals in need.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Can be dangerous
review/text: I have purchased many Premier brand products and liked them, especially the Busy Buddy dog toys.  However, the Tug-a-jug is not one of them.  The treats do not dispense as easily as some of their other products so some dogs may get discouraged.  My dog stopped playing with it due to that.  The  tug-a-jug can be a dangerous toy being made out of very hard plastic almost as hard as glass.  If one dog is swinging it, it can injure another animal standing by.  It also can do damage to furniture, walls, etc. I purchased the large size. Today my dog found it after not using it for a very long time and was playing with it and cracked and broke the whole end off leaving sharp plastic edges.  Luckily I noticed it right away or my dog could have ingested that!  I did buy it in 2009 but my dog hardly ever played with it so I am not sure how long they would last if a dog played with it frequently.  Premier has so many other wonderful dog toys to chose from.

review/summary: Decent toy and kept the dog interested and BUSY!
review/text: If the container wasn't so loud and we could find the correct size/shaped treats to put in it this product would get 5 stars. It keeps our Pit/Lab mix busy and gets her thinking which let me tell you is amazing since she's quite "thick" in the head... I've found a few smaller sized treats at Petco and put a handful in at a time. Make sure to put different sized treats in it too or else the dog will dump them all out and then fill up way too fast. The plastic has held up fine on our tile floor except for the teeth marks but I'm not too worried about it breaking like other people have posted.

review/summary: Great, but potentially dangerous.
review/text: This is one of my dog's favorite toys.  It has entertained her for many hours.  Prior to her getting the rope out of it, she would swing it around like a mace or weapon and bang people on the knees if they weren't paying attention.  Now that the rope has been shredded, I strategically put a larger treat in to prevent the kibble from just falling out.  Good idea, but the design could be modified for safer play.

review/summary: Not for Big Dogs
review/text: Granted I didn't take into account that my dog would chew through the rope, but my Pit had this destroyed in less than 10 mins.  The sides of the bottle are too deep to really dispense without having to tip the bottle, so she got a little frustrated trying to get the treats out.  She ended up bringing the toy to people to get the treat out for her.  Well, she got tired of that and just decided to eat the rope off.  I was really excited to get this toy too, she needs mind games to keep her busy.  This one just doesn't hold up.  Totally not worth the $20 I wasted.  I'm sticking to Kong and West Paw toys from now on.  They are the ONLY brands I have found to hold up and cost less than the new poser brands coming out.

review/text: My wife bought this for our Cane Corso when he was 8 weeks old.  He wakes up in the morning, does his job and gets that bottle and starts banging it around.  We all love it because it definately keeps him occupied and us laughing, where as he gets bored with the other toys.  Unfortunately, he's banged it around so much that he has actually broken the bottle in two.  He's 4 1/2 months old now and even though it broke, it did take a lot of beating and banging before it broke so we will definately be getting another one.

review/text: My parents have a Carolina Dog who is not a big chewer. She loves this toy, and it keeps her occupied for a while. Seeing how much she loved it, I decided to get one for my 1 year old beagle. Within an hour or so, he had the rope completely chewed up which takes away the real intention of the toy. He still plays with the bottle itself, but there's no point in putting treats in it because they just fall out. This toy is not for hardcore chewers.

review/summary: My dachshund plays with this every day.
review/text: I see the small size has the rubber version of the "rope" as opposed to the rope that is really a rope.  Maybe the real rope would last longer, but even with our "rubber rope" chewed in half, this toy works great, I just leave the big end of the "rope" inside the jug, where it slows down the treats from pouring out the end.  I just put a handful of dry food in through the small end of the jug (easy to do, now that the rope isn't there, much easier than unscrewing the big end).  Since there is only a handful of treats in it, my dachsie has to stand it up vertically to get them out.  It keep him busy for 20-30 minutes.  I always give it to him when I'm going out of the house, and his tail never stops wagging as he works the food out. My downstairs neighbors haven't complained yet about the odd clunking sounds ...

review/text: It took my 4 month old Westie a week to figure out how this toy worked, but now he can get most of the kibble out in about 10 mins. It is a great toy and it definitely keeps his attention.  The one I have has an actual rope and not a rubber rope, so it has lasted. He has managed to chew off a few of the spikes on the rubber ball. Some end up on the floor and some in his tummy. I think the toy might be better if it didn't even have the spikes on it, so I wouldn't have to worry about him eating them. Overall it is a great toy and the jug seems very durable.

It is definitely a tough toy, but my dogs only play with it when there are treats inside. Then they get the treats out and don't touch it again until I put more treats in it.  I thought they would chew on it even when no treats were inside because they always want plastic bottles which I don't like them to have. Overall, this toy is durable and a good toy if your dog will play with it.

review/text: My dog really likes this interactive food dispenser. I put her regular dog food in it, when I use it. She learned within 5 min. how to grip onto the rope and shove it in & out to get her food to come out(hers did not come with a flexible rope,her rope is a fake straight stiff rubber rope). Sometimes she gives a playful growl to it while she is trying to get the food out. This toy keeps her busy for a short period of time and if your dog gulps down food, this would definitely keep them from doing that.

review/summary: Our dog loves it!
review/text: We have a 30 lb Doberman Pinscher mix puppy that is about 5 months old who absolutely loves this toy!  Because we knew he was going to be a bigger dog, we opted for the medium/large size, which for his current size, is a little big for him now.  But he manages fine with it, plus I like that he can't throw the toy in the air like he does with so many of his other toys.<br /><br />We've had this toy for about a month now and use it at least 4-5 times a week.  Initially, our dog was a little slow in understanding the concept and wasn't very interested in it.  But after a few days, he got the idea and now gets excited whenever he sees us filling it up.  We usually fill the container with a mix of his kibble and some cut up treats for a total of about a 1/4 of a cup and it keeps him occupied for about 30-45 minutes at a time.  We haven't tried adding balls to the jug yet to increase the difficulty, but we may do so soon.<br /><br />This toy has been a savior to help occupy him while we are busy trying to do things around the house, such as cook dinner or do laundry.  I also give it to him to prevent boredom as well as help get rid of some excess energy that he still may have at night since he will push, drag, and carry it all over the place as he is trying to get out the contents.  After a month of use, the only thing that has some signs of wear and tear is the rope.  Our puppy hasn't done any damage to the actual jug yet.<br /><br />On a side note, I have seen the smaller ones in the store that have rubber/plastic ropes, which do not seem to be very durable, but ours was an actual rope, as in the picture and has held up great with our dog.  We have been so pleased with this product, that we bought the smaller one for a family member's new puppy.

review/text: My Lab Mix loves this toy.  When he was a pup he had a hard time figuring it out and would get frustrated and just bark at it.  But as he got older he tossed it around enough to get some food out.  What really helped was sitting down with him and shaking some out, getting him to pull on the rope etc.  What you can also do is take out the rope if that makes it easier and then if they'd got the hang of it add the rope again.  Using smaller food helps too.  It was fun to see him finally figure out a strategy for getting the food out.

I figured I'd try to lure them into playing with it by putting some really really yummy people food in it for them to sniff out. That definitely worked.  But they lose interest in the toy itself once the treats are gone.  Unlike another toy I purchased that they play with whether or not it has treats in it.<br />You have to show your dog how the treats slide out when you tug on the rope. I don't think my dogs are stupid but they just didn't get it until I went over it a couple of dozen times with them.

review/summary: Great toy for food-oriented dogs
review/text: My brother turned me onto these toys, and I'll be forever grateful. I have a Chihuahua-shaped vacuum cleaner of a dog who is utterly obsessive about food, and a neurotic Shep/Lab mix who will turn her nose up at food in a bowl, yet gobble up "found" food. These toys are the ideal solution for both dogs. The Chih works harder to get the food out (we have the med/large size jugs, so they're pretty big for him to manipulate), which means he's burning off calories. He tends to be a bit of a chub, so this is a good thing. The Shep/Lab mix has an easier time of it, but the toy keeps her occupied and she seems to enjoy it. I've just adopted another dog from the shelter, and gave her her own Tug-a-Jug. It's great for her b/c she has to stay crated a lot right now (healing from her spay surgery, plus the vet put her on very restricted activity while she recovers from an upper respiratory infection). I make sure to put the jugs away when I leave the house (don't want anyone fighting over food), but they're wonderful for when I'm working from home and need to keep the dogs busy while I'm on the phone with clients. (Murphy's Law of Dog Ownership #1: Your dog will bark like a freaking maniac - but for no discernible reason - the moment you get on the phone with the client you've been trying to reach for a week.)<br /><br />Our experiences with these toys have been great, so I heartily recommend them. My Chih has been determinedly trying to manipulate his jug into spitting out more food for the past 30 minutes, and his tail has been wagging the whole time.

review/summary: good idea in theory
review/text: Even though I used small puppy kibble, my puppy could not get the kibble out of the bottle. For the treats to come out, the dog needs to pull on the rope and whip the bottle around. Because of the shape of the bottle, the kibble will not spill out on its own while lying on its side. I would think that holding onto the rope and whipping it around would be quite dangerous for the dog as well as anyone standing nearby - the bottle is made from hard plastic and would definitely hurt if it hit you.<br /><br />I decided to remove the rope completely and tried putting in a little ball to slow down the flow of the kibble. That didn't work either - the ball completely blocked the opening (maybe I'll try again with a smaller ball). In the end, I just ended up putting a larger treat (a small milkbone biscuit) in with the kibble and that seemed to work a little better. My puppy is able to get the treats to spill out by tipping the bottle upright. I think I need to experiment more with different sized balls or milkbone biscuits so the kibble spills out easily, but not too easily.<br /><br />On the plus side, the large opening on the bottom of the bottle is great. It makes it very easy to fill the bottle with kibble or treats.<br /><br />I gave this product a 3 because it does what I wanted - it slows down my puppy's eating and keeps him busy for a little while, but for us, it didn't work the way it was intended to work and has the possibility of injuring the dog.

review/summary: too scary for my dog
review/text: I was all excited to find a toy that my smart, chew happy dog could play with. What I did not keep in mind, is that she is scared of anything that relates to people, even if it has food in it (she is a shelter rescue). She likes me getting food out for her, but never got into bouncing it around to figure out how to get food out herself. Two weeks later it is lying in a corner, ignored, full of yummy treats. I still think this toy has great potential, but I don't recommend it for a timid dog, that gets spooked easily. My dog loves her Kong chew toys. I was hoping to find something that will take longer to get the treats out.

review/summary: great feeding option
review/text: I received the first jug as a gift for my golden retriever (80 lb.), then bought a second one when I picked up a Wheaten terrier (30 lb). Both dogs enjoy working their breakfast kibble out of the jug. The Wheaten will eat until full and the retriever, true to his nature, can't stop eating and playing. They are able to almost completely empty the jugs. Their size difference changes their strategies a bit but doesn't affect their ability to play.<br /><br />When first introducing the toy to the dogs, I "primed" the jug by spilling out a couple high-value treats mixed with kibble (later moving to only kibble). The rope knot inside the jug can also block the entrance, so I was careful to make sure that the knot was well inside the jug. And I made sure to fill the jug about 3/4 full because the jug can clog if it's totally full and I didn't want them to be discouraged if it was too unrewarding. Now the dogs are more experienced, so I don't prime the jugs anymore. I am increasing the challenge by sitting the jugs upright and will soon be moving to asking them to find the jug.<br /><br />The container is easy to fill but the cloth rope makes cleaning a little more difficult. My Wheaten uses the rope to retrieve the jug from under the coffee table but I'm still considering removing the rope because of hygiene and because it blocks the jug opening.<br /><br />I recommend this if you have dogs cooped up indoors, if you have dogs that need to keep themselves occupied, and especially for large-chested breeds who gulp down their food (because the jug forces the dog to literally only eat a couple kibble at a time).

It shows no signs of wear and tear, even after he carries it around several times a day.  Our Golden Retriever, Gennie, will follow him around and help with "clean up", so she loves it, too!<br /><br />Why not five stars?  It's a bit difficult for those with grip problems to load the kibble/treats in the bottle and keep it from falling out.  Would make more sense if the part that screwed off was at the end with the hole/rope/spikey-rubbery thingey.

review/summary: Great toy but won't last long for strong chewers
review/text: This toy was extremely great . . .My dog learned how to think and figure out ways to get the treats. I have 2 criticisms: 1) if your dog is a strong chewer, that rope won't last long. . . . but that's only if you leave the toy with your dog to play with; if you only use it as a way of dispensing food, then you should take it away after he has finished getting his food/treats out; that should hopefully allow the toy to last longer 2) i wish the bottle itself was made of rubber instead of hard plastic. I have (soft) wood floors so i cringe every time my dog plays with it on the floors . . .it can be loud and my dog's strength when he's playing with it causes me worry that i'm going to find dents in my soft wood floors. Other than that, it's a great toy and I would recommend it.

review/summary: Fun toy, unreliable for meal serving though.
review/text: This toy is great fun, my dog enjoys playing with it.  However toys like this are typically used to slow down how fast your dog is eating.  Due to the design of this toy, your dog may get frustrated or lose intrest in eating his full meal by "playing" with the toy because they do have to work very hard to get a treat.  Or be big enough to grab the toy in their mouth and dump the food/treats out.<br /><br />If your looking for something to slow your dogs eating down then look at other toys like the Kong Wobbler.  Or the Steggin Egg.  You'll almost be gaurenteed your dog gets his full meal with those toys.

review/summary: Isabella gives 4 paws up!
review/text: My 4 month old Standard Schnauzer really loves this toy so far. It's quite large for her and I almost waited to introduce it to her until she got bigger, but she'll take the rope in her mouth and drag it all around! (Mine has the purple and white rope which seems better quality than the older style solid purple rope that breaks easily.) She knows the kibble is in there but can't seem to figure out how to make it fall out. But we play with it together and she's getting the hang of it. It's a fun toy for the both of us to play with now and once she gets older and can figure out how to get the kibble out on her own, she'll love to play with it as a distraction until I return home. High quality, very sturdy, I am very pleased!

review/summary: Dog and I both love it! Definitely worth every penny
review/text: Took my dog all of three minutes to figure out there's food inside, and tricks for getting it out! It keeps her busy for hours, it's definitely not easy for her to get to all the food. Her favorite trick: She holds the rope down with one paw, and smarks the bottle with the other paw so that some kibble tumble out! So far, it's holding up well, and she's not exactly gentle with it! Had it for a week, and usually she destroys toys within a day or two...She's 25 pounds. I ordered the small, and it's still big enough that she can't get her whole mouth around the rubber stopper. It also has an actual purple/white rope, not a rubber rope like the picture shows. Love it! Will definitely get another one when this one does finally die. Best $10 investment I've made in a very long time.

review/text: This is a great toy, but the bottle is just too big for a small dog.  The only way to get the treats out is to turn the bottle upside down and my dog's mouth is too small to grab the base of the bottle and he weighs 20 lbs.  He can demolish a bully stick in less than five minutes, but cannot grab the base of this bottle to stand it on it's top.  It's a clever toy for a medium to large dog!

The only problem is she figured out how to get the bottom off (where humans fill to bottle) before she figured out how to use it as designed. So, if you have a corgi or any extremely bright dog, you may want to consider gluing the bottom shut and taking a more difficult approach of filling with treats via the top.

review/summary: Aggressive Chewer
review/text: I have a pitbull mix who is just a year old.  She was a stray I found at our school.  She chews everything (leather shoes, her bother's ears...) and she is inqusitive so I began a search for the perfect toy for her.  We have tried toys that are for aggressive chewers, many only last a day!  If she can't get it started one of her brothers help her out.  She is smart and needs to think as she chews.  We came across the Tug-a-Jug and decided to give it a try.  She took to it right away.  It has holes in the bottom so the smell of the treats continue to hold her interest.  The screw-on lid has fine threads so she can not unscrew it.  The rope cord is frayed on the inside to hold in the treats for longer play time.  The unit is made from strong plastic and is too big around for her to use her powerful jaws to crack it.  The rubber ball end is a good place for her to hold as she carries it around the house. Once I fill this toy with food I know she will be ingrossed for at least an hour while she works on getting all the treats.  A couple of things to keep in mind, the treats add to the dogs calorie intake so you have to cut down on meal time, and it can be a weapon if your dog likes to throw it around (I know this from experience!).  The first one I got for her, the cord was much more frayed on the inside so it took longer for her to get all the food. The reason why I had to purchase another Tug-a-Jug is she finally chewed through the rope.

He never gets frustrated with it because it is fun for him to drag it around by the rope.

review/summary: One of the few toys that gives me some down time.
review/text: I have a German Shepard Dog, who is trained as a service dog.  While out in public, he receives lots of stimulation, and if I'm asked first, he receives a lot of attention too.<br /><br />As a service dog, he's with me 24 seven.  Everywhere, everyday, all the time. He's a high energy dog, loves playing fetch with balls, but doesn't much like my tv, computer, or napping time. I love him dearly but everyone needs a little away time.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of Busy Buddy toys for him.  The number of Squirrels at two different sizes, and cut the bottom fingers different lengths so some drop out treats easier, some harder.  He enjoys them, they bounce funny, but he can empty them pretty quickly.  Which leads to them being dropped on my lap repeatedly, and not always in the best place.<br /><br />I found the tug a Jug which I didn't expect to last a long time because of the hard plastic jug. I also figured he'd pull the rubber tug out by now time.  Much to my surprise, he's been playing with it for almost a year with none of the problems I'd expected, other than having it dropped on my foot or lap.<br /><br />I've been able to use his normal brand of Kirkland Chicken & Rice kibbles dog food, mixed in with some Beniful for a change of pace. By using his normal kibble, it keeps the cost down, and allows me to adjust his meal portion size accordingly.<br /><br />It's also about the only toy he doesn't bring out to the back yard to hide and then can't find it again.  Which sends me a clear message he is very focused on this toy.<br /><br />Even though he's a large size dog, I didn't buy him the large size, in part because I prefer the rubber tug, in part it keeps the amount of treats down.<br /><br />I highly recommend this toy (and toy line) for their design and not making it impossible to use normal kibble instead of expense treat products designed only for their toys.<br /><br />I'd have given this 5 stars if they'd made the outside of the bottle with a rubber coating, or rubber bumpers so it isn't so noisy on non carpeted flooring.

review/summary: 40 lbs boxer mix loves it and hasn't been able to chew it up!!!!
review/text: I got this for my 40 lbs boxer mix. He loves most toys but usually tears them up. At first, he didn't know what to make of it as he thought it was a "pull" toy. Pulling on the rope actually puts a stopper on the bottle and the food doesn't come out. My 5 year old tried to "show" him and after a couple hours of on and off play he figured it out. He actually LOVES it and sometimes just carries it around empty or chews on the rope. You have to use small, hard food so it comes out easy. I tried crunching up small treats but it just stopped up the bottle. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO KEEP DOGS ENTERTAINED AND BUSY.<br />UPDATE: This morning (one day after I wrote the above), I put his food in his bowl for breakfast. Usually he gulps it down quickly...this morning he looked at it, walked away and brought THIS TOY to me, dropping it down in front of the food. I put the food from his bowl into the toy and he immediately tipped it over to get the food out and was clearly having fun. IF THIS DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH HE LOVES IT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES.:)

He's a chewer, and within an hour had the rubber-rope gnawed in two. But someone posted a photo of the modification they made post-rope that saved the day: inserting a tennis ball into the bottle. AMAZING IDEA! Whom ever came up with that should write the company and suggest the modification. He can't get through the bottle, and the ball blocks the hole enough to where he really has to try to get the treat out. It is loud, but this is the first toy to survive my lab. If it's lab proof, I'm sure it can survive anything!

review/text: I bought this a few months ago, and my two puppies are still playing with it.  My pups are now about 13-15 pounds, and while they play rough with each other, they aren't too rough on this toy.  I know a lot of people mentioned their dogs chew right through the rope, but this was not the case in our house, which I was glad to see.  They seem to focus on scratching at the purple spiked piece and don't do much flailing around by the rope, so that could be why.<br /><br />One of the dogs figured out how to use it right away, although it took her a couple of weeks to get a little more aggressive with it.  It took the other one almost a month to not be afraid of it!  It never fails, though, when they go for their toy box, this is the toy they pull out and play with for a good 20 minutes.  I have no complaint about the quality of the product, and it keeps my dogs happy and entertained.

At first I fed him only from this toy, but now he's calmer so I feed him in his bowl too, but he generally prefers to feed out of the toy. I knew when buying he would chew the plastic rope off immediately, and he did. Some come with a nylon rope, which would take longer to chew off. Since I have the large, and the rope is gone, I put in one or more large treats (depending on how hard to dispense I want to make it) and regular size hard dog food and a few small treats that will fit through the neck. The rope definitely blocks well and can be replaced; for me it was easier to put a larger dog treat in to block. With the rope I needed to use small bite dog food because it came out very slowly, and he would lose interest.  Interestingly he loves the enlarged end of the plastic rope to chew on (not good for swallowers). Very sturdy and easy to fill as long as you line up the spirals. He's never opened it. He knocks it around with his paws and nose and grabs the neck with his mouth and throws it around. So far no damage, but it is sturdy and could possibly break something when tossed. Worth the slight risk. After almost 8 months he began to chew off the plastic ring around the neck, which he loved doing, and does attract him to the neck where the treats come out. Recently he started chewing the neck off, which is why I'm buying another, but I plan on using this one until he gets down to where the neck is gone, as it still works and he still loves it.

review/summary: Good toy, but best for a clever pup
review/text: I bought the Tug-a-Jug after having bought the Twist n Treat. It's a good toy, but I would say it's ideal for a dog of above-average intelligence. The Twist n Treat only requires your dog to nose it over. This one has a more complex mechanism that requires more work. Our dog couldn't get much out of it the first few tries but she is very food motivated and now can empty one in about an hour or so. The advice to fill it more than half full on the first go is good. In all, I like this toy, because it's harder and requires more time and effort from a dog that the typical treat dispenser, which is good if you want to give you dog something to occupy her. If you are looking for a first food-dispensing toy, I would recommend getting the Twist n Treat first, however.

review/summary: Well made, but only for the very food motivated
review/text: I bought the Tug Jug for my dog because she was jealous of the cat's Slim Kitty food dispenser and she likes to play with rope toys.  I guess jealousy and rope are not enough motivation for her to play with it.  They need to be very food motivated because it is very challenging to get the treats out, and unfortunately she isn't a big eater.  It is a very sturdy and well made toy, and it is not as easy for them to get the food out as the other treat dispensing toys that roll around.  She only shows interest in it if I play with it with her.  I could see how it would be a great toy for the very food motivated dog who has a lot of dexterity.  Also a funny side note, the package came to me opened by the post office already because apparently on x-ray in looks like something dangerous.  Someone thought that a person would buy a molotov cocktail on Amazon, I guess.

review/summary: Hard to interest my pooch.
review/text: I have a 16lb Dachsund and we have a very hard time finding toys that she is interested in. We adopted her, and her home before us was as a breeder at a puppy mill where they kept her in a crate her whole life. So long story short, she has no idea what to do with toys and really, I'm out of ideas. She gets interested at first, but has a really hard time manuevering the bottle to get the treats out (she has had back surgery to repair paralysis in her hind end from ruptured discs so is not super agile). Also I think my little wiener has a little trouble figuring it out and I'm not sure how else to show her. I do like to toy and it has withstood her frustrations but I think I need more help with it. Some helpful hints or instructions would be greatly appreciated.

review/text: My 13 lb dachshund is extremely destructive with his toys and needs a lot of interaction with most toys constantly.  I filled this toy with organic cheerio type cereal and he was delighted.  It took him about 3 minutes to work out how to get the treats out.<br /><br />I dropped a star because he is able to pull small chunks off the purple molding.  I sort of expected that because he is like that with everything though.  Luckily, he spits the rubber out after he pops it off, so I can let him play with it when I am home to supervise his play.

review/text: My dog just isn't a "tugger" by nature. She doesn't get this toy, and the same hard plastic that makes it super durable also makes it super LOUD when it hits the hardwood floor. Noise=scary. My dog developed a phobia of this toy long before she ever figured out how to get the food out of it. I had to pass it along to someone else. Hopefully it will find a home with a dog who really loves it.

review/text: The toy got a lot of interest, but I eventually had to take it away because of the way my dogs chose to play with it. They would grab it by the rope and shake their heads to release this treats, subsequently beating walls (or worse, human legs) that were near them. It appeared to be sturdy, and probably would have been a good toy otherwise.

review/summary: Cute...but not Westie-proof
review/text: Got this for my West Highland Terrier for Christmas and she loved it.  It kept her busy as soon as we gave it to her.  She was completely focused on getting those treats out of the bottle...however, she re-invented the toy and got all of the treats out by actually chewing through the thick rope that is attached to the toy.  (She managed to do this in about 5 minutes in a roomful of people.)  It's a cute toy and a great concept - and she did enjoy it - however, I think this toy would work best with a dog who is not quite as focused, or creative in problem-solving as our westie seems to be.  The plastic bottle and rubbery ball are very sturdy and are continuing to hold up well.

review/summary: Cool, but my dog quickly destroyed it
review/text: I wanted to use this as an alternative to a Kong, to fill with lunch for my dog on days when she would be alone all day while I was at work, and my husband was out of town. The product arrived with a rubber "rope" with a ball-like bulge on the outside, and a cone-shaped plug on the inside, rather than the actual rope pictured on the page. For the first 3 days, it was wonderful. She was very excited and interested in how it worked, and it seemed to keep her occupied. On the fourth day, when I got home, I saw her chewing on the little ball-like bulge, which she had handily chewed off of the rubber "rope". I worry that she would be able to chew off other pieces, and that she could choke on a lump of rubber that size, so I haven't used the product since then. Too bad, because it seemed neat. I would only recommend this product if your dog is a VERY weak chewer.

It really is a good idea though and I do like how well it was made.

My 45lb border collie mix chewed through that in almost record time.<br /><br />He really likes the toy. He just picks it up now by the knobby top and drops it to get the treats out. I will probably try to put an actual rope and stopper in to fix it. I am just disappointed that it wasn't as shown.

review/text: We had an earlier model of this jug, with a rope instead of the rubber "rope."  My dog was able to get the food out a little easier, which I preferred.  This rubber thing in the middle quite effectively blocks the food and my dog gives up.  She used to eat her whole meal everyday in the old jug.  So I am disappointed they changed it.

review/summary: Great for a food driven dog
review/text: My youngest Miniature Schnauzer is very food driven. I'm not sure why but he has always had a bad habit of "wolf"ing down his food.  I have resorted to locking him in a seperate room, away from my other two Miniature Schnauzers, placing a tennis ball in the middle of his bowl and feeding him large kibble sized chunks of food to get him to slow down during feeding time.<br /><br />Toys like the "Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug" is great to keep him busy and entertained because if there is food in there, he's going to work at it until he can get to it.<br /><br />It took him a little while to 'get' that the food comes out of the front of the jug and previously he was trying to pry off the bottom, chew the front , purple hard rubber ring around the neck of the bottle and then he finally figured out how to get the food out and is content trying to do so until all the food it gone.<br /><br />My other two are just not that determined.<br /><br />I agree with everyone here, if you have an aggressive chewer this may not be the best toy but if your dog isn't an aggressive chewer but a food driven dog this toy will keep him busy.

review/text: My Westie liked this at first, but it didn't really hold his interest.  Plus, you have to fill the bottle about half full.  He gets bored after removing a few items, and then you either have to waste the food by replacing it with smellier food, or just leave it sitting around.  I think I just need to try with food he enjoys more, but I wanted the point to be that he would eat his regular food from this toy.

review/summary: Very engaging
review/text: This is the first morning my dog is using this toy. So far, it seems great. She is a 7-month old german shepherd/husky mix with a lot of energy who loves to play and figure things out. Sadly, she has a soft-tissue injury so is not allowed any walks, running or playing in the park for 3 whole weeks! We needed to find alternative outlets for her energy so she wouldn't turn into a raving beast from the frustration. The Tug-a-Jug has kept her full and undivided attention for 45 minutes so far. We also purchased the Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone, which she also loves. I'm very happy with this product. She's a powerful chewer, so I know she's going to chew right through the rope and spikey ball on the top. But I will take the advice of another reviewer and just put a tennis ball inside and I am sure it will still work just as well.

review/summary: Better, but still room for improvement
review/text: I bought the largest size available which was described as "medium/large" for my 25lb dog.  The toy was delivered and was too big.  The old versions had a rope but now the 'rope' is made out of that purple rubbery stuff that's much more durable and will last longer.  My dog was fine with playing with it on the carpet, but on linoleum or hardwood floors it's way too loud.  And who wants to use it on carpet when food leaves crumbs and stains?  The plastic bangs on the floor and my dog is timid to begin with and can't deal with the noise even with high reward treats.  I also don't want to teach him that making loud noises is okay. I returned this.  They should line the bottom and top sides of the bottle with the rubbery stuff so it isn't so noisy.

review/summary: We loved it, but...
review/text: My boston loves this toy!  It keeps her busy for quite a while and she's a heavy chewer, so it held up... for a while.  Like others, she has managed to chew her way through the rubber rope that comes out the end, but only a little at a time.  I keep a good eye on it and when it looks like she's about to get another piece off, I just cut that little bit off with a pair of scissors.  But the fact that it can be cut with scissors might give you a clue as to the constitution of the rubber rope.  Also, the plastic jug is fairly durable, but in her frustration to get at the kibble inside, Roxy has done a little damage to the plastic, making it hard to screw the lid back on straight.  So the good news is, great concept for a little dog (it's a small toy, don't give it to a lab, that's not what it was meant for), but maybe not as indestructable as they might think.  I'll buy another one, mainly because Roxy went into hysterics when I tried to hide it from her for a few days.  Clearly her favorite of all toys!  Doesn't want to eat out of her dish anymore!

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>This video shows Taxi (soft coated wheaten terrier) opening and playing with his Christmas/10th Birthday present... a Tug-a-Jug. He's played with it a few times now and he still doesn't get that he needs to pull the cord to get the treats to come out -- although he really enjoys knocking it around until the treats accidentally fall out. I bought the large size after reading the reviews because of the cord. The large size had the plastic cord which is easier to clean. The smaller size has the rope cord. Taxi is not a big chewer, so I felt comfortable that this toy would durable - and it is. I filled it with stinky treats which he can smell through both ends... but those treats upset his tummy a bit, so I'm going to have to try something else. I couldn't find the ingredients of the treats that are sold with the Tug-a-Jug, so I didn't buy those.

review/text: There are 2 design issues with this toy: 1. in order for the rope to go back in, it needs to be PUSHED back in - this is difficult for a dog to accomplish without human help as it is not a stiff rope, but a flexible one. 2. When the dog pulls on the rope, it lifts the bottle up into an upright position, and when it's vertical the treats don't come out.<br /><br />My dog quickly figured out that the best way for the toy to "work" was if I set it up and let him pull the rope out while I held the bottle horizontal. So my dreams of independent play have not yet been realized.
