review/summary: Hayashi is the best!
review/text: I am so happy Amazon has finally started to ship Hayashi. It is so hard to find here in the US, and when you do find it, it is absurdly expensive and almost expired. This stuff is like a Japanese beef stew. It comes in a block rue form to make what is called Hayashi Rice. All you do is cook some thinly cut beef with some sliced onion and carrots (you can add other vegetables if you wish to experiment) and then add the correct amount of water, bring to boil and add the appropriate amount of Hayashi rue. It has a very smooth taste and tastes as if it originates from a tomato base (but without the normal tangy tomato flavor). Most people pour it on top of Japanese rice like you would Japanese curry. If you're looking for a warm and easy to make meal, this is it. One box of hayashi will serve a large family or provide a small family with enough for two meals. This pack includes 10 boxes so you'll be hard pressed to run out of the stuff quickly (unless you live in my house). The box includes two blister packs of the rue. Each blister pack can be divvied up to make 4 blocks of rue in case you want to make an individual size serving. Each block of the four out of one blister pack is supposed to be equal to one large serving.<br /><br />I ate this stuff all the time when I lived in Japan. It was my favorite dish and my wife would make it for me on a weekly basis. Now I can have it on a regular basis here in the states. Thanks Amazon!

review/text: Wasabi Mayonnaise livens up cold cut, tuna and chicken salad sandwiches, and it is very hard to find.  Even when you do, if you check the ingredients you will likely find that the jarred product does not specify wasabi root.  This product contains horseradish, green coloring and other ingredients.  You dissolve the powder in water making a paste, and add to regular mayonnaise. Mix well.  Devise a proportion to suit your taste. Start off with modest amounts of the paste.  The 14 oz container will go a long way.

review/summary: Strange inflammation response
review/text: Truthfully wasn't crazy about the taste of these but reason for the low rating is more to post a heads up warning. I noticed a trend in drinking this with a headache response. From an old neck injury I could get headaches from reinjuring or aggravating it. This tea triggered that same response which was very surprising. It made me think that many people could be triggering similar inflammation without ever tracing it back to the tea.  So just heads up if you are susceptible to this type of pain.

There were given ample opportunity to respond to 6 emails and 2 phone calls and they did not.  I would be very careful doing business with this company.  Even though it has great reviews, I have heard that companies pay for people to do these reviews for them.  I don't know if that is what happened here, I only know that we were totally ignored on a $55 total order.

More importantly, they love him with very easy digestion.  He is only 7 months old so I wanted to be careful to give him a food he could easily handle and this whole line seems to qualify.  I wanted to give him some good treats as well instead of just using his kibble for that so I ordered some of these cookies.  I also got some of the Wet Nose brand and while those seem too big for him and I have to break them up, these are not.  They are a nice size, about the size of a quarter, and flat so his little mouth can fit over them.  Just perfect and as a bonus, they contain no wheat.  They will be a staple in our house for our little Sheldon and we are all happy about that.

The good news is that I did not feel any negative side effects but I was taking this for weight loss and I did not lose very much weight at all while on this.  When I began taking raspberry ketones along with the green tea, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYRW6G">Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder</a>, this is when I started to actually lose weight.<br /><br />I read an article that said taking them together created synergistic weight loss effects, and so far I have lost six pounds in the past 17 days compared to just a couple pounds when I took the green tea on its own.  There are a lot of good health benefits to be had by taking green tea on its own too but for energy and weight loss, adding raspberry ketones to the mix has been great.

review/summary: Great for Kidneys, High cholesterol & HPV
review/text: Life Extension did an article on Green Tea Extract and if you have Kidney disease, high cholesterol or HPV, I highly recommend Green Tea Extract. Make sure it has the 98% Polyphenolds in it. Someone said it made them nauseous; make sure you take GTE with food as you should with most supplements. A large study found GTE:<br /><br />* prevented kidney damage<br />* powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, both in the kidney and in other tissues<br />* Helping maintain healthy blood cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride levels already within normal range<br />* Enhancing immune function<br />* produce a rapid clinical response in at least 69% of women with human papilloma virus (HPV) lesions on their cervixes, which in turn dramatically reduces their risk of cervical cancer<br />* cancer cells can be triggered to undergo programmed death; green tea extracts are among the many nutraceuticals capable of inducing apoptosis

review/summary: CLL (leukemia) Usage and Real Benefits Otherwise
review/text: I too use this to slow my CLL.  The Mayo Clinic Study mentioned below found improvements in lymph node shrinkage or lower WBC, or both, in 60% of CLL patients during their two clinical studies.  Then the Japanese supplier used by Mayo stopped making their pure testing preparation because there was more money in hard tumor research. So the third planned study never happened. But the dosage is 4,000 (yes, four thousand mgs) daily.  So I am taking twelve of these a day (2 X 6 daily).  I have been doing so for a year.  It's hard to tell what effect this is having on my leukemia, but my lab results seem to be pretty stable.  This was recommended by my oncologist, a CLL specialist.  This must be taken with food or within an hour or so of eating.  There have been very significant and very clear benefits beyond the CLL issue.  All of my typical  "normal" prostate issues have resolved.  I'm 62 and had no real problems with prostate issues, but I am, excuse me, peeing like a twenty year old again.  Also, the with loss benefit is very real. But this dosage is huge. Here is the link to the Mayo study: [...] If amazon strikes the link Google "mayo clinic - green tea extract.

review/summary: Highly rated -- especially for CLL patients
review/text: My alternative medicine doc, who is also an MD, recommended this product due to my leukemia.  There was a study by the Mayo Clinic of patients with CLL  [my form of the disease]  and there were some statistical data showing benefits for CLL patients who took a green tea extract -- strength not specified by the Mayo Clinic.  I ordered this product as soon as I was diagnosed, and found immediate relief from swolen glands, and night sweats.  I contacted the manufacturer, using the info on the label, and they have oncologists as consultants. The response to my question: "how much can I take?" came back as 3 times daily.<br /><br />Five months later, swelling is minimal, night sweats rare.  Doctor says my WBC is stable....  Those results are hard to dispute, in my opinion.<br /><br />Given the info above -- this is a great product, full of good anti-oxidents, but with some minimally proven benefits for CLL patients, like me.<br /><br />Shipping was extremely prompt, so I couldn't have asked for more from them.<br /><br />Five stars!!!

review/summary: Not the best decaffeination process
review/text: I called the company because my concern is how they decaffeinate their product and I was disappointed that they used some solvent (ethanol in the process) rather than the safer CO2 process.  So I ordered ECGC from NOW and its fairly decaffeinated only 4 mg of caffeine and they use the CO2 method.  Do your research.  I think if you are going to take something for your health then it should not have residues which may be undesirable.

Remember that chemically speaking this is no different than any other prescription or non-prescription drug you might take in terms of it having both benefits and side effects. Even the benefits can be side effects when combined with certain medications. That said, this is particularly safe, but still you must mention it to your doctor.

review/text: I was very excited to find a quality green tea extract. Unfortunately, every time I take it, I get very nauseous. I felt this way for 5 days straight after I began taking it so I stopped taking it for 4 days during which I had absolutely no nausea at all. The very first time I tried taking it again, I was extremely nauseous within the hour. I've even tried taking directly with food, doesn't help. I have read that polyphenols can cause nausea so I'm guessing it is the high percentage that is to blame.

review/summary: Great potential, bad result...
review/text: I was excited when I saw this sitting on the shelf of my local grocery store. Having lived in an Arizona Border town for the better part of the last decade, I love the variety and complexity that comes with authentic Mexican cuisine. I recognized Bayless on the back of the package (he demonstrates some incredible and authentic South of the border recipes with his show on PBS), and immediately thought I would really go for this.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the sauce has a great initial flavor, but is followed by an aftertaste that I can only describe as "diet soda" for those that know what I mean. It has a cloying dull and sweet aftertaste that clashes horribly with the spicy, savory qualities of the spices and meat. It literally tastes like I sprinkled stevia or nutra-sweet on my tacos. Evaporated cane juice is listed on the ingredients, and although I suspect that this is the culprit... I can't say for sure.<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed, especially knowing the quality of food that Bayless promotes on television. With the disgusting aftertaste and sweetness removed, I would have put this sauce 5/5.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.

The olives were, indeed, stuffed with a white pasty substance that the label claimed was bleu cheese.  It was grainy and crumbly in the mouth and had none of the classic bleu cheese flavor.  A great olive stuffed with great bleu cheese can be a transforming taste experience; these olives are common olives stuffed with nothing special and do not belong in my cupboard.  I'm sorry I tried them, but it won't stop me from enjoying the great olives where they can be found.

review/summary: Quality is great; Amazon price is typical
review/text: Our family has decided that it would be wise to store a year's supply of food as a hedge against inflation as well as preparation for food supply disruptions due to natural or man-made disasters. Rather than just toss a bunch of mysterious items in the basement that would get thrown away in 20-30 years, I've been buying bulk grains from my local natural food store and cooking with powdered milk and eggs and such.<br /><br />This is my preferred brand of brown sugar. Fair trade is great, and the taste is very rich. I often settle for the store brand at the major, nation-wide natural food chain store when I shop locally. I only purchase this brand on sale as it costs about 15% more and I use a lot in my baking and cooking, plus we're buying ahead for our food storage. The price here on Amazon, using Subscribe & Save, will make this produce equal in price to the store brand, so I'm going for it.<br /><br />I have also had fewer issues with this brand (over the store brand) being hardened in its packaging. That makes me think this is a thicker, sturdier plastic less prone to tiny air holes, though I can't prove this suspicion.<br /><br />You can certainly buy cheaper brown sugar. I will continue researching local options for larger sizes in organics, but, in the case of this particular product (brown sugar), my cooking experience makes me willing to pay extra for this brand.

review/summary: Best brown sugar I've ever used!
review/text: I have been using this dark brown sugar for a couple years. I just started selling my organic baked goods at the local farmers market and I use this along with the light brown sugar (also from Wholesome Sweeteners) in my cinnamon rolls. They are fantastic! I think the trick is using THIS brown sugar. It's much darker than the dark brown sugar you buy in the stores. It's so worth the money!

review/summary: Fair Trade Organic sweetness
review/text: Crystals are larger than traditional superfine sugar, but the fair trade and organic qualities make this product better than regular sugar.  I have not experienced any sticking problems, but brown sugar of any brand can clump together.  Wholesome Sweeteners is a little more expensive than the non-fair trade and non-organic sugars, so I have adjusted recipes in order to consume less sugar - healthier.

review/text: This product has virtually replaced all of my regular flour needs. As a pescetarian, I also try to watch my carb intake. I bake and fry/stir fry things alot. This past weekend, I made low carb onion rings (check food network website) and they were great. This flour is already cooked, so when frying it it can burned quickly as well. If you don't like the slight grittiness of this flour, you can also add regular flour (no more than half of the recipe's requirement) and your meal is still considered low carb.Plus, this price can't be beat anywhere with the subscription highly recommended!

review/summary: Dogs Love Dingos
review/text: I have yet to encouter a dog that doesn't enjoy Dingos. From the youngest puppy to the oldest senior, they all have loved the various Dingo bones and treat.<br /><br />The biggest challenge is buying a size big enough to prevent the dog from eating it rather than chewing it.  This is not true of all dogs, but if the dog has food or treat issues it can be a consideration.  They really lovethese treats and seem to not want to be patient or risk not getting the entire bone. And most of the dogs I have given these to also tend to want to chew them from start to finish, so I do have to take the treat away from a dog occasionally.<br /><br />There are Dingo imitators out there that cost less, but I have yet to find one that is of similar quality. I have tried a couple and will continue to sample others, but so far there is not a generic Dingo equivalent.

There have never been any digestive or intestinal problems of any kind.  I cannot say enough great things about these bones!!!

review/text: All my dogs love these bones. They won't touch regular rawhide.I have three small dogs and I get these big dingo bones because only the largest one (a cockapoo) can actually make any noticeable headway in chewing them. So she starts them and the other two finish them over the course of a few weeks. This way, they are not so pricey and they are large enough that the choking concern is diminished. But because of other reviews, I still am in the room when they are chewing them.

review/text: Russell Stover Pecan Delights revisted---I bought a 11 oz box of this variety of chocolates at a local drug store chain for $4.99 plus 7% tax on 9/15/12.  I don't know what Russell Stover has done in the pass five years, but boy what an upgrade.  I originally gave them a 4.5, but now they have achieved perfection 5/5.  Rich caramel and juicy pecans with super smooth milk chocolate--superb!<br /><br />The candies are housed in a very attractive gift box with a bow design that simulates gift wrapping paper.  The chocolates are true to size as indicated by the photo on the box.<br /><br />The photo also shows that the chocolates contain bits of pecans rather than whole pecans.<br /><br />The picture also indicates that there are rather large chunks of pecans, and again they are accurately depicted on the box.<br /><br />The chocolates look exactly as pictured on the box.  The candies are coated in a medium dark milk chocolate with chunky clusters of pecans and a sugar center.<br /><br />The gooey caramel center is not quite caramel.  It is more like a gooey syrup mixture.  These chocolates are delightful.

They were doing a promo of this product and I fell for the great tasting flavor and just the right amount of HEAT, not overpowering. When I ran out I tried to purchase more only to find out this was only a promo of this product and Sam's said they weren't getting any more. By this time I was hooked on LaSabrozita salsa HABANERO. By the way this product is more like a hot sauce then a salsa. I use it on most everything. If your a Hot Pepper Aficionado you will agree with me, this product tastes GREAT! It's good to know Amazon is promoting this product. I will purchase more when this supply runs out!

review/summary: Great product, but wish I could order a smaller case
review/text: I fell in love with these crunchy, cheesy snacks while living in Baltimore about 16 years ago.  When I got back to my "real" home in the Deep South, I was saddened that I couldn't find them anywhere (once I drove 150 miles to a grocery store that SAID they had them, only to find them sold out!).  These cheesesticks are fantastic with soups, but also great for snacking by themselves.<br /><br />My only complaint is that 12 boxes is a pretty big order, even for someone like me who loves them.  I would like to be able to order a smaller quantity. . .maybe about half this size.  Still, I DO love 'em, so it's not really a deal-breaker.  A smaller-size offering would also be more desirable to someone who hasn't tried them yet; 30 bucks is a lot to spend on a snack item you've never tried.<br /><br />But I do hope you WILL try them, and that you enjoy them as much as I do!
