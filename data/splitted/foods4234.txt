review/summary: Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/text: I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it.

review/summary: Bitter Green Tea
review/text: First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit "add to cart" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought "oh, boy" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The "burnt" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .

review/summary: This tastes like CINNAMON OIL, not a traditional chai blend
review/text: Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed.

review/text: I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a "burnt" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away.

review/summary: This is a staple at my house
review/text: I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of "tea time," where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic "bite" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the "subscribe & save" option, this is an especially good deal.

review/text: I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment.

review/summary: Excellent Mellow Tea, Hot or Cold
review/text: This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet.

review/text: I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil.

One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality.

review/summary: My 'everyday' tea. :c)
review/text: I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)

review/summary: Time for Tea!
review/text: I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too.

review/summary: Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green
review/text: I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.

If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!

review/summary: Not green, not good
review/text: This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste "green" (ie: doesn't have that fresh "grassy" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again.

review/summary: Cuppa Green
review/text: Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are "watered down" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.

review/summary: Great value, great for your health
review/text: I'm not naturally drawn to any tea, but for health reasons I've been trying to pick it up for years, mostly trying green teas. I never could make a habit of it until I found a small box of this locally. In the past 5 months, I've averaged 4 cups a day and have officially developed a healthy habit. I'm still not in love with the taste, though I find white tea easier to stomach than some green teas that were grassier, but I do enjoy the experience of drinking white tea and I enjoy its effects. Rather than a caffeine buzz, teas have a balance of caffeine and l-theanine that provide mental clarity and aids focus, and the balance in white tea is just right for me.<br /><br />POP white tea brews darker than a more costly white tea I was given, and I do suspect that darker color means lower quality, but the price is right. The bags also brew more cups than an equivalent bag of black tea, furthering the value. I have no trouble getting 6 large cups of tea from a single bag, and arguably, the second cup is better than the first. I'm on my second box of 100 from Amazon, and having recently discovered this listing that offers subscribe and save, I'm likely to buy much more in the future.  Previously this was an $.08 per day, $.02 per cup habit, but now it could be a $.05 per day, $.01 per cup habit.  How many healthy habits are this affordable?

review/summary: Spice cupboard staple
review/text: I love OXO, and have both the chicken and the beef in my spice cupboard at all times. It's a dry boullion cube that can be used to quickly make a soup base, add to gravy, etc.  The cubes are fairly large, and you can crumble all or part of one into whatever you are cooking. It dissolves quickly, unlike some of the moist cubes, which can fall to the bottom of your pot and sit there.<br /><br />I was introduced to this product when visiting in England, and have since purchased it at a local British shop, or online. I never see OXO in stores, but I think it's much better and easier to use than any of the boullion normally found in grocery stores.

review/summary: Total Zero Tastes Different Than Sugar Free - Don't Like
review/text: I highly recommend you buy a single can of the new "Total Zero" version of Red Bull before you buy a case of Total Zero.  That way, if you don't like it, you've only bought one can, not 24.<br /><br />I'm a long time user of both the regular ("Original") version and the sugar free version.<br /><br />For my tastes, there isn't a huge difference between the Original version and the sugar free version, but there is a noticeable difference between the sugar free and "Total Zero" versions.<br /><br />Everything tastes different to different people, but I don't like the new Total Zero version.  It leaves, for me, a mediciney after-taste.  If you are drinking this late at the bar with your favorite adult beverage, you might not care, but I drink my Red Bulls by themselves as a pick me up during the day.<br /><br />Now, what do I do with the 23 other cans....?

review/summary: Prefer over regular Red Bull
review/text: I had not tried Red Bull Total Zero prior to purchasing the case on sale at Amazon.  I've had the regular and the sugar-free flavors and to me, I prefer the taste of Total Zero.  In some ways the flavor doesn't seem to be as strong and overbearing as the normal Sugar-Free can.  I don't really notice any strange after-taste in comparison to the other Red Bull flavors, they all have a similar "mediciney" taste.  I would definitely recommend trying a single can before the purchase of a case, unless you can get it on sale and want to take a chance.

review/text: I haven't received it. I don't give a crap if it tastes like donkey piss. I bought this to support a private company that was willing to take a tremendous personal risk to support private, non-.gov near-space endeavors. There's no other way to do it. The Soviets and NASA got the whole kit and kaboodle going 50+ years ago. Our 1/2 century's long exodus from dependency on a single cradle planet started from a .gov seed, and HAS just begun. But, our success depends on private enterprise, and that is the era we have been segueing into over the last 40 or so years. SpaceEx, Baumbgartner/Red Bull, and MANY others -- they are the NEXT gigantic LEAP for mankind! I do my miniscule part here, buying a case of Red Bull post Red Bull Stratos.

On top of school I have a 1.5 hr commute to and from school so this really helps keep me alert. Just make sure you accomplish what you really need to do when you first drink it. Sometimes I put my work off a little bit and find myself ready for a nap or an advil after the red bull has worn off.

Red Bull has helped me function as I recouperate.  [BTW, severe fatigue after stroke is helped by raw adrenal tissue tablets.]

review/summary: Works For Me
review/text: The folks in Austria have come up with a fine product. I gulp down a can of this sugarfree Red Bull every morning about an hour before I make my daily walk. It has made the walks much easier to complete and also increases the walking speed which in turn burns more calories with which I am glad to part. I happened to be over at Sam's club a while ago and they carry this product for 33 bucks and some change so I picked up a case while there. I live about 10 miles from Sam's so with gas prices ever climbing plus the state sales tax it would not be worth a trip just for the Red Bull. For only a couple bucks more Amazon will deliver a case right to my front door. Kinda pricey but the benefits to me are worth the cost.

review/summary: Red Bull sugar free, the nectar of the gods!!
review/text: Red Bull sugar free is the best.  No crash from sugar and still the same amount of caffeine as regular.<br />I used to drink regular Red Bull but I found that my eyes would really hurt from all of the sugar and that there would be a pretty substantial crash a few hours after consumption.  I typically drank one a day.  I guess you can say that I may have a Red Bull addiction.<br />Since switching to Red Bull Sugar Free, there is no crash and none of that funky eye pain mid-day; and since it is sugar free it's got less calories.  That's my justification at least :)

review/summary: The best energy drink, but super overpriced.
review/text: I think that almost everyone would agree that Sugarfree Red Bull is, without considering price, the best diet energy drink there is.  The flavor is great.  A bar at my university had a $2 (sugarfree) Red Bull & Vodka special... probably the best drink special that exists anywhere.<br /><br />But price is a big consideration, and $2+ for an 8 ounce can is ridiculous.  For everyday waking up/making it through the day energy I've switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>, as 30 cents per pill is much better for my budget.<br /><br />But if a can is free, or if there's a good special on it, I'll never pass up a sugar free redbull and vodka at a bar, my day has been made.  I just wish that Red Bull wasn't so expensive.

review/text: Ah Red Bull, equally fantastic as an energy drink or as a 'mixer' for 'adult beverages,' as my Grandmother used to call them. What can I say that you don't already know? Weather you're looking for an shot of energy or something tasty to blend with vodka and a fresh lime, Red Bull will not disappoint.<br /><br />I find that the low calorie version has about the same flavor as regular, but feels thinner in the mouth. I actually prefer the low cal stuff, and its a staple in my fridge.<br /><br />I should also mention that Red Bull can only truly be appreciated if you've had other 'lesser' energy drinks (rock star comes to mind). Red bull is superior in taste, consistency, and usually has fewer calories. I've tried a good number of energy drinks, and Red Bull is easily the best out there.

review/summary: The Most Popular Energy Drink in the Phillippines
review/text: Red bull energy drink is very popular in the Philippines. It is used by many workers to help fight daily stressors. As for my part, I use it whenever there are upcoming long examinations and oral recitations in our law classes. I need to stay awake for long hours in the evening just to read through long legal excerpts so I can have few wise statements to utter during oral recitations. I need enough energy to endure the brain torture I will experience while I take the two hour of mental battle I will enter into come final examination day.<br /><br />It is no doubt effective but the moment its energy boosting effect wears down; I have no choice but to sleep. Unfortunately when I sleep, it meant sleeping for more than eight hours which is not very healthy. I still prefer the use of my Gene Eden products as natural supplements. It offers long lasting energy which I definitely need since I am working law student. However, I only get it every time I receive packages from my aunt in the US since Gene Eden Vir 101 is still not shipped by Amazon here in the Philippines.<br /><br />Please ship them soon so I can have regular dose of this wonderful product. Thanks!

review/text: Sugarfree Red Bull is by far better than its sugar filled brother. With only 10 calories per can, it tastes lighter and crisper than that "other" Red Bull. It can't replace the morning coffee, but after a workout, it can make you feel significantly better until you can replenish with food.<br /><br />However, the prices on Amazon are NOT a good deal. The only way it is a good deal is if you simply can't find the product anywhere. You can regularly find a 12 pack at any Wal-Mart or grocery store for $20. If you really need 24, then go buy two 12 packs for just over $40. Why would anyone in their right mind pay $10 more? But gas you say? Please, if you spend $10 in gas to get to the store, then by all means buy your Red Bull here. Anyway, to reiterate, great product-horrible Amazon prices.

review/text: My son was initially on Enfamil Infant and he had terrible gas, was crying all the time, he was unable to sleep day and night, and he had frequent bowel movements. I decided to try Gentlease and ever since he became a different baby. He stoped crying constantly, his bowel movements stabilized and he was able to sleep.<br /> Yes, this formula comes in 32 oz cans but I use breast milk storage bottles. I open one can at a time (that way I do not have to worry about formula expiring once opened), pour formula into these bottles and store them in the fridge. I use 5 storage bottles at a time and my baby finishes that in less than one day.<br />This formula also comes in 2 oz ready to use bottles that is convenient on the go.<br />It is great formula, with proteins partially hydrolized ( which makes it easier for digestion), also has 80% less lactose than regular Enfamil. This really helped my baby.He does not suffer anymore, and I do not have to suffer watching him in pain.

We almost feared that we had a colicky baby, but around 3-3.5 months old she started settling down as her digestive system matured. She was BF for the first 6 months, so needless to say, when we had to slowly start transitioning her to formula around 5.5 months (due to low milk production) I was terrified that the painful gas and fussiness would return. My daughter wouldn't take the powder version and they used RTF at the hospital to supplement her the first couple of days due to low birth weight. I mixed Enfamil's Infant Premium and Gentlease RTFs in the beginning in hopes to transition her to 100% Infant Premium (which she is on now). I am not entirely sure if Gentlease helped with my daughter's fussiness and gas, but it definitely didn't hurt or upset her digestive system. It didn't interrupt her daily BM (considering that she was coming from full-time BF to formula) and she also didn't notice the taste difference from the Infant Premium.<br /><br />After reading the other reviewer's comment about receiving spoiled formula, I tasted each can I opened.  Gentlease tastes like a slightly watered down version of the Infant Premium, but it does have a very slight bitter after taste that the Infant Premium doesn't have (which is normal). The formula from Amazon had a long expiration date (which means it was fresher) and the cans were dent-free, but I still made sure to taste every batch I made. The cans do need to be opened with a can opener and must be used within 48 hours after opening. I transferred the entire contents to an airtight pitcher and used it that way because you should not be storing an open can in the fridge. Overall, I liked the formula and would recommend people give it a try to ease the transition from BF to formula.

review/summary: Severe Gas Gone
review/text: We were using the regular Enfamil and my daughter had severe gas. It caused such pain that she couldn't sleep at night. We tried several other formulas, which only caused constipation before using this. She eats it happily, her gas is on a normal level, and there is no more fussy baby due to stomach pains.<br /><br />Not only that, but our current pediatrician is very happy that we are using Enfamil. My daughter has something impacting her growth and if we were using certain other formulas they would have recommended we switch.
