review/summary: BEWARE OF A RECENT CHANGE IN THIS PRODUCT
review/text: I have purchased Back to Nature Crispy Wheat Crackers consistently for a year.  We eat a case a week (6 boxes).  Also have the saltines on hand and graham crackers.  Received 2 cases of Crispy Wheat Crackers last week and opened them last night.  Every box of the 12 boxes I received were loaded with salt - more salt than ever.  They are so salty they burn your mouth.  You can feel the salt and see the salt.  This seems to be a manufacturing problem.  I have notified Back to Nature about the problem and we will see if they fix it.  In the meantime beware if you purchase the product that you may receive mostly salt and no cracker !!!!

review/summary: What a Treat!!
review/text: Back to Nature is a great company in regards to quality, taste and cost. These are my favorite crackers and I could honestly eat a whole box in one sitting. They are similar to "wheat thins" but even better. Amazon provides a great way to purchase in bulk "subscribe & save" try it out and enjoy the benefits.

review/text: Anyone who ever comes into this house and eats these crackers thinks they are amazing little treats. My kids are addicted as well as a few little friends who ask for them every time they visit. I buy them in bulk because with amazon prime, I can get them for a few cents cheaper than in the cheapest grocery store... And they are often all bought up in the store before I get there so this is very convenient... Of course the price could change but right now it's a good deal.

review/summary: The Best of Crackers
review/text: I found these crackers a few years ago at a health foods store.  They are simply the best snack cracker around.<br />Amazon, of course, beat the price at the store hands down.  I always wish there was more in the box, but that<br />is today's market place.  More money for less product seems to be the norm.  However, I will buy these wherever I can because they are great with salads and on a road trip.  Good buy at Amazon and shipping as always was a breeze.  Right to the door.

review/summary: Yummy and Healty Too!
review/text: Back to Nature has a hit with these crackers.  They're thin, taste great and don't have all the extra added unhealthy ingredients found in most crackers. These taste much better than wheat thins and are reasonably priced.<br />My only recommendation would be to change the inner packaging. If the manufacture is going to use a plastic bag to hold the crackers it needs to be more durable and resealable to keep the crackers fresh.  The bag inside the box tore completely, top to bottom, when opened and I had to replace it with a Ziploc storage bag to keep the crackers fresh.

review/summary: I like their nougat swirls better...
review/text: These don't have any weird taste to them, but they just taste sweet - not much chocolate or vanilla flavor. I was hoping for a sugar-free chocolate fix to replace mini Tootsie Rolls, and these aren't it. I'm not diabetic - just hoping to spare my teeth, and aspartame gives me a headache.<br /><br />The packaging doesn't say how much xylitol is in them, so I assume that it's not a particularly significant contribution to the 6-10 grams of it that my dentist recommends, but probably not a problem of overeating the xylitol (which can cause some bowel effects, though not dangerous).<br /><br />Dr. John's does have a helpful website and some products I like, though, with varying amounts of xylitol, and a list of how much xylitol is in their Simply Xylitol candies that are made for getting 6-10 grams of it per day.<br /><br />For chocolate cravings, I prefer their sugar-free chocolate hard candies to this caramel. They also have chocolate and vanilla nougat swirls that taste much better.

If you like Twig tea, I do believe Choice Organic has the best price point out of all the brands.<br /><br />Twig Tea is "essentially caffeine free" and has a smooth, balanced,non-bitter and ever so slight wood-sy taste.<br /><br />I heard that this tea is balancing to the taste buds. So, if you've eaten alot of sugary foods and / or salty foods,<br />this tea will help you balance out those taste buds. I found this to be true and I like drinking it at any time of day  or night.

review/summary: Maruchan Ramen, Picante Chicken, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)
review/text: This particular flavor is not available here locally, so since I've never had the opportunity to give it a try I picked it up when it showed up as one of my daily quick picks. It still costs twice the price I would have had to pay if it were available in my local Wal-Mart however.<br /><br />I am somewhat of a sissy when it comes to spicy hot foods so I was hoping the flavor to be mild, just as a few reviewers had suggested it to be. Here's what I had discovered: The degree of zestiness varies from package to package. One package may be quite hot, while the next package may be more to my liking by being quite mild. I found myself checking each flavor pack prior to adding it to the noodles and picking out some of the pepper flakes if it appeared there were too many to my liking.<br /><br />Overall the flavor is quite good, but is inconsistant from package to package. I don't intend to purchase again myself, Picante is just not my cup of tea, however I would recommend it to those who might like some zest in their noodles.

review/text: This is my favorite flavor of Ramen, and a frequent inexpensive guilty pleasure for me. I like it best when the water is drained off the noodles and the flavor packet is mixed with melted cream cheese and stirred in. If it's not spicy enough, a little hot sauce does the trick nicely. Unfortunately, even on sale the Amazon price is almost double what I pay at the store for these little packets. Only buy online if you can't get it any other way.

I'm not a huge fan of spicy spicy things... this has quite a bit of spice but it is not unbearable.It has a unique flavor, almost like you're eating mexican food but in a noodle soup.  If you like things with a bit of a kick of flavor but definitely not HOT I think you will like this flavor because it really is pretty yummy :)<br />You can definitely find it for a cheaper price at a walmart or a local food store that carries it.

review/text: Item shown is not what you will get. Its also not one pound. Its in a different package and only weighs 13 oz.. The seller Petco did issue a refund to compensate for weight. If they haven't already, they need to put up the correct packaging and weight. I had ordered 10 packs, so that was about 30 oz less than what I thought I was getting. I like these treats for my dogs and they love them. Very high in protein.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: This is a very interesting type of snack. I can't really think of any "American" counterpart that most people would be familiar with. I was introduced to it by a nephew of mine who loves snacks from Asian markets. This is a Korean chocolate type of snack.<br /><br />It's a sponge sandwich with a cream filling all covered in a layer of chocolate. When you bite into it, it's the texture that you enjoy first, your teeth break into the thin chocolate skin then sinks into the sponge and cream. Then you masticate and mix it all up in your mouth. The taste is great too, it's a creamy, chocolately, sponge cakey taste. Most important, it's not too sweet, like many creamy chocolately snacks.<br /><br />It's hard to review tastes to people because it's so subjective. All I can say is that it manages to mix up those 3 ingredients (cream, chocolate, sponge) up very well and you should give it a try if you like these kind of things. Oh, and there's an imitation brand that looks very much like this (down to the size and color of the box) but tastes horrible! Make sure it's Orion brand.

review/summary: Orion Choco-Pie is the best!
review/text: I love Orion Choco Pie! It's much better than the Lotte brand Choco Pie which has vanilla cream - the Orion brand has marshmallow cream which adds a much better texture, and the cake itself is not as crumbly. Both are chocolatey and delicious. But to be honest, a box of 12 pies should not cost $10. That's ridiculous. You can get them for $2 a box at your local Asian market.

review/summary: oxymoron: Amish Country - Hydrogenated Canola Oil
review/text: I was excited to find high heat oil since our local store was temporarily out of our usual brand. I assumed this would be natural and just oil like the sunflower and safflower oils we usually buy at New Seasons.  Then there's that word, "Amish" - evokes images of natural, of the earth.  It arrived with its Beta Carotene enhanced color - OK, I'm all about carrots, but then I read the rest of the ingredients, "partially hydrogenated canola oil."  I don't need anything hydrogenated, partially, or otherwise, on my popcorn. If that's what I want, I'll walk down to the Valley Theater and buy a bucket.<br /><br />At least Chefs.com found irony in it as well and quickly gave me a refund over the phone for the amount I paid.

review/text: The oil is fine, no real complaints there. I think the type of popcorn you use determines flavor a lot more than the oil you use does though.<br /><br />The only negative is the shipping charges when added into the cost of the product. You can likely find something at a local store for about the same cost, and avoid paying for shipping.

review/summary: Amish Country Popcorn Popping Oil
review/text: I bought this popcorn popping oil because I thought that it would be better than the typical Orville Redenbacher's. Sadly, it was just about the same. It didn't give my popcorn much of a buttery taste unless I used a lot of it which is the same experience I had with the Orville Redenbacher's. I just use normal oil and add my own butter now since most oils I have tried do not make my popcorn taste that buttery.

review/summary: Better than I thought
review/text: I decided to open my pail of Augason milk and was I surprised how this really tastes great. I actually think this tastes better than the milk in the dairy section of the supermarket with perhaps the exception of organic milk but organic milk was too expensive for me. I use more of the powder to water ratio than they recommend. So I have now gone through my first pail and ordered a second.<br /><br />The advantages are that you can make enough for your present use; like for a bowl of cereal or a gallon and not worry about a freshness date from one at a grocery store. don't get me wrong, the powder milk that has been added to water will eventually go bad; but what I would like to emphasize is your not adding to your carbon footprint by having to recycle or throw away all those used milk cartons from the store.<br /><br />I have ordered from here on Amazon the Hamilton Beach Single-Serve Blender to mix the powder and water; we'll see how that works out.<br /><br />My brother scored some protein powder (and some other Sam Andy products) at a garage sale of all places and the protein powder tasted great with this product.<br /><br />I would recommend that you purchase the #10 can first to see if you like it. As for me I'm sold on it

The other reviewer said something about lime so that'll be my first guess. But who knows if or when I'll ever wanna open my $9 lollipop. I'm weird like that.<br /><br />/sigh<br /><br />Anyway, I must've been using a "real" pipe when I ordered this.

review/summary: Excellent Product - been using this for years!
review/text: Titanium Dioxide is a very common food additive which is used as a white pigment. It's naturally occurring and about 4 million tons are consumed per year worldwide. The only research on it as a possible carcinogen deal with it being INHALED (breathed in), not ingested (swallowed) in plants which manufacture it, where workers are exposed to hundreds of thousands of times more material than what exists in food. I guess someone was too busy oiling their skin up to visit Wikipedia. :)<br /><br />As far as the pill itself, cut one open and you'll find exactly what you paid for - a little coconut meat and a lot of oil. I'm not real crazy about coconut, so being able to swallow a softgel pill is a lot easier for me.<br /><br />I've been using this product for years, and I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Great diet aid
review/text: I've been using coconut oil supplements to help my post-baby weight loss diet and I really feel like it's helped. Especially for those meals where my will power fails and my family is dying to eat out and I eat a little less than as healthy as I want. Usually I would put a little bit of weight back on after those episodes but with the coconut oil the fat doesn't hang out in my body and my weight stays the same. Also my hair looks and feels wonderful and my skin is softer. I take two with lunch and two with dinner rather than four at once also. Great product! Sometimes these types of pills smell or taste funky before you can swallow them or give me some indigestion. But not these. The pills are pretty large though.

review/summary: AVOID THIS - EAT COCONUT OIL!
review/text: This is the biggest waste of money and scam I have seen in a long time. Raw, organic coconut oil is definitely one of the healthiest additions you can make to your diet. (Ignore the claims that because it has saturated fat it must be bad for your heart - WRONG! Not all saturated fats are bad and coconut oil has medium chain fatty acids which means the fat gets converted in your liver into energy and is not stored by the body nor will it clog your arteries.) Anyway, in order to reap the benefits of this wonderful oil you need to eat about 2 -3 tablespoons a day, starting with 1 and working your way up.  Guess how many of these pill you need to take in order to accomplish that feat? Something like 40!!  Have fun swallowing that many pills and just think about all the yucky gelatin you will be consuming that comprises the coating of these things!  You are much better off purchasing raw, organic coconut oil and mixing it your oatmeal or drinks.  Use it for cooking and throw away every other oil you have in your kitchen, except olive oil, and you will be on your way to better health.  Research the benefits of raw organic coconut oil online and you will see that I am right about this.

Not sure what that material is, but am glad that I decided not to take them internally.<br />Also after doing some reading on Titanium Dioxide (listed as an ingredient)found that it is "Classified as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans" by IARC.  Now I plan to stop using it on my skin and throw away the rest of the bottle--should've done my research before buying.

review/text: Oberto Thin Style Peppered Beef Jerky is the only kind of Jerky I will eat. I've been eating it for 30+ years. Buying online is far cheaper than purchasing in the store. Plus it is low fat and full of protein. I love this stuff :)

review/summary: Too Salty
review/text: I had a balance left on my gift card and saw that the jerky was on sale.  So I bought a couple of cases.  This stuff was extra salty, too salty.  Something must have been wrong with the batch.  You could actually see the salt on the jerky.  Had to throw it away.

review/text: This is how jerky is supposed to taste. Extra salty bite with a good chew. If you can't make a nice "brothy soup" with your jerky, then you're probably eating the wrong jerky. Keep the soft sweet glazed gourmet crap outta the jerky industry because it's definitely killing it. Lol at the people who says jacks links is a superior product. Oh boy Oberto's thin style is the way to go.

review/summary: Amazing - Favorite Beef Jerky by Far
review/text: Omg... this stuff is an orgasm in a bag. But seriously, this is by far my favorite Beef Jerky. Texture, salt level, and flavor are excellent and is a definition of what beef jerky should be. People can keep their soft "Natural style" stuff, I'll take this anyday.

The jerkey is nothing like it used to be... It said new on the packaging but same great taste... It was so gross my cats turned away!!! Hopefully the ter. pep. bites will be good!!!

review/summary: A poor option
review/text: There's a lot of beef jerky choices out there.  This stuff had a dry, brittle, hard to chew consistency and poor flavor.  Not for me.<br /><br />On the positive side (sort of) I got a package that was 1 short of the four packs that were supposed to be in the box and had a post-it note indicating that one was missing - but it got sent anyway?  Odd.  When I let Amazon know, they refunded my entire purchase price.  Bad product, good customer service.  So I didn't feel bad at all when I tried several bites from two of the packs, then tossed the whole batch in the garbage.  Oh boy, Oberto.

review/summary: OK, but not great
review/text: This is marketed as "thin style", which is quite appropriate.  The thinness of this jerky gave it more of a paper type consistency, which, for my family, really robbed us of some of the jerky texture and chewiness that we so much enjoy.  If you prefer thin jerky, then you'll probably fairly happy with this.  We'll stick with traditional jerky from now on regardless of the price.  The taste was OK - again, not great, but certainly acceptable.  It was good enough that our whole family would welcome it as a snack.  If we enjoyed this style more, I'd have given this 4 stars.

review/summary: NOT The *Classic* THIN STYLE!!!
review/text: This jerky is delicious, but please don't think it is the Oh Boy! Oberto Thin Style from 15-20 years ago.  You remember, right?  It was about as thick as 4-5 sheets of paper and oh-so easy to chew?  Well, this product is pretty damn THICK for a supposed "thin" jerky.  If all you care about is flavor, then go for it.  It's salty, but that's what makes it good.  I was hoping it would be the classic thin style, but NOPE.

review/summary: Regular is Salty--Peppered is Great
review/text: I would say I get less salt from sucking on a handful of sunflower seeds. This was horrible. Despite what the package says this is not the original jerky. I would eat a bag a day back in 2005 and 2006, so I was so excited to see this but it did not taste at all like the jerky from way back then.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just ate the thin peppered beef jerky and was surprised by the difference between the flavor of the peppered and the original flavor. Two thumbs up for the peppered jerky, in fact they don't even tast like they were made from the same company. I will make sure to always only buy peppered.

review/summary: Salty leather strips
review/text: If you like beef jerky that is dry, over salted and super tough then Oberta Peppered Thin Style is sure to please. Despite being very tough in the first place the poor meat quality contained large amounts of gristly material that simply could not be chewed. The peppered flavoring was not bad and the only notable highlight in an otherwise terrible product. So two stars on the review. Otherwise this is worst quality jerky I have ever tried.

review/text: I'm so glad I found this product here at Amazon. It has been my favorite beef jerkey for the past 15+ years, and unfortunatly it's not so easy to find in the supermarkets anymore. It seems more people go for the thick jerkey, and flavored with sweetners, but this one is salty and very thin, just perfect, and adding the pepper makes it perfect for me. It is a little expensive for the amount you get, but worth it for me.

Price is good for the quantity in the bag too.<br /><br />Now that I live in Florida I can't even get Oberto Jerky in the hard variety.

review/text: Pro: It is probably close to the genuine article.  Real preserved beef slices.<br /><br />Con: It is really salty and it is not just from natural sodium chloride. It is full of preservative sodium.  It does not actually taste like a culinary creation.  It seems like chemically preserved salted beef.  It is so bad, I am thinking that I could make a better version by putting some sliced beef seasoned with salt, pepper, and sugar in a large biscuit tin along with a smouldering hickory block.
