review/text: I am very happy with the 56 beans I received.  They are plump and every bit as good as the ones I can find locally for several dollars apiece. At this price I can actually afford to use vanilla beans rather than substitute extract.  Don't hesitate to buy these.  If you don't expect to use all 56 in the year or so shelf life, give them away as gifts (they make great hostess gifts).  You will make everybody happy and still come out ahead financially.

review/summary: First Vanilla Beans ordered, but seem great so far
review/text: This is the first time I have purchased vanilla beans, so I do not have anything to compare them to.  I purchased the vanilla beans with the intention of making homemade vanilla for ourselves and family.  This was the best value that I could find anywhere.  The vanilla has turned out well.  My wife just used some for baking the other day.  Compared to purchasing vanilla at the store (about $2 per ounce), the homemade vanilla is significantly cheaper (about $.50/ounce).  Again, I do not have other vanilla beans to compare these to, but they have produced a very good vanilla extract.<br /><br />Update March 2012: People all loved the vanilla that was made with these vanilla beans. One of our aunts kept getting compliments on her frosting, and the only thing she changed was using the homemade vanilla which was made using these beans. When we are ready to order more, we know where to get them from.

review/summary: Flavor and fragrance, and suggested uses!
review/text: The beans came in a vacuum pack, so were very fresh and moist.  They seem to be somewhat longer than beans I have purchased in the past.  I keep them in a tall Bodum glass storage jar, and they continue to be perfect.<br /><br />Here are some ways to use them that may be interesting to some of you foodies.  Also, you will be putting the beans to good use until you use them in recipes.  You don't want to waste that fragrance and flavor!<br /><br />1) Put several whole beans in a tall jar with raw sugar.  Shake it up from time to time.  The beans will dry slightly and infuse the sugar with their wonderful fragrance and flavor.  You will enjoy this vanilla sugar in coffee, tea or other recipes!<br /><br />2) Put several whole beans along with a couple of squares of Bakers unsweetened chocolate in the container with your coffee beans or ground coffee.  Again, the beans will dry slightly.  If you grind your coffee fresh, break off or cut a piece of dry vanilla bean into your coffee mill.  Your coffee will be absolutely delicious!  (I use a burr mill.)<br /><br />3)  If you like vanilla vodka, rum or other spirit, put one whole bean in the bottle.  Within a few days, you will have a lovely infusion.  You can use the single bean repeatedly.  When you decide to give it a rest, put it in the sugar jar, or use it in recipes.  It will still be full of flavor.<br /><br />4) Split a couple of beans and put them in a small bottle with some dark rum.  Keep it tightly closed and in a dark place.  Within a week or two, you will have a delicious alternative to commercially made vanilla extract.<br /><br />Enjoy your beans!  Get creative!  At this price, you can afford to go over the top!

Nice moist sticky vanilla beans not dried out and leathery like the ones you pay four times as much for at the grocery store.

review/text: I'm making vanilla extract and vanilla sugar, so I order these vanilla bean because they were the cheapest I could find. I opened the package and the beans were in another package inside, instantly I could smell them.  This was the first time I bought them and they looked plumper than the ones in the store. I put 5 bean cut lenghtwise in 750ml vodka a good brand and it's been a few weeks but it's already medium amber color and I can see vanilla oil when I shake it once a week.  They are different then I thought they would be but my sister said that they are normal. I can't wait to try it out. The rest of my vanilla beans are in my freezer so they keep longer.

review/summary: Very Vanilla and at a great price
review/text: I had been looking for vanilla beans locally, saw the price at whole foods (one sad looking shriveled bent over vanilla bean for 5.98!) and decided to check online. After reading the reviews I ordered the Madagascar Vanilla beans. The shipping was fast and the beans are vacuum sealed. I figured the best way to find out if they tasted as good as they looked and smelled- very plump and fragrant, I baked vanilla bean cupcakes with vanilla bean icing. With vanilla bean being the star of both recipes it had to be outstanding, there was no hiding behind other flavors. The scrapings came out moist and my cupcakes came out great. I am so happy I have found this source!

I'm only down a few days, but already the color is fantastic.<br /><br />I realize it can be a bit pricey, but you do get a lot of beans, and the flavor is wonderful. You can definately tell the beans are there, and you feel the teensy crunch of the little beans. I've used it for vanilla bean cupcakes, and I was happy (and so were the 24 people that devoured them!)<br /><br />Highly recommended. Oh, if you want to make the best of them, make your own extract!

review/summary: Mmm Vanilla makes my home smell like happiness.
review/text: I can't get Vanilla beans where I live (Okinawa Japan) so I had to send away for them... which is always a gamble.  I found these beans and was thrilled by the amount of beans for the price.  The reviews for the most part seemed good... so I ordered.  Oh man! I am so glad I did.  They smell wonderful.  I could even smell the aromatic little gems through the plastic wrap.  I have not yet used them to make my vanilla bean ice cream so I am not sure about the amount of "flecks" that seemed to bother one reviewer... but I gotta tell you... as plump, as soft and as fragrant as these beans are I just know they will make great ice cream.  I used them to make my own vanilla extract and my entire house smelled wonderful!  Not sure why some other reviewers didn't find them as aromatic... must be a bum batch.  Sorry that happened to them.  I hope that doesn't happen to me as I will be ordering more and more and more of these.  Anyhow, after using 30 beans to make 10 little jars of vanilla extract I still have quite a few beans left to make tons of other vanilla laced goodies.  Excellent product and I couldn't be more thrilled with them.  :)

review/text: Arrived quickly ..packaged as described .. Beans looked plump , However not so sure about the product .. First time with vanilla beans so not quite sure what they are suppose to look like ..only a very faint,faint smell of Vanilla ..smelled more of Bourbon than Vanilla ..Used 80 proof Vodka and half of the beans ..but it looked like mildew floating with the Vodka as well in my canning jar .. since I used a sterile jar ...it's not from my jar ... they arrived quickly  so I figure they came that way ... didn't see the mildew till I put it in with the Vodka..did a video on my phone of the floating mildew but can't get it uploaded ( not sure how just yet but will figure it out soon and leave an update )after looking up further on another site what they are to smell and look like .. I feel I got a poor quality and even mildewed product .. tried to leave a review of 3 stars because I was unsure of the product and it wouldn't let me thus the 2 stars ...did not contact the seller since I could not leave the feedback ! Will not be using this product or the rest of the beans since I already lost out on the Vodka as well.. This is my first bad review on a product .. been using Amazon since the 90's and had great luck on all the other products I have ordered ..I hate leaving bad reviews is why I waited and the product received great reviews is why I ordered them .

review/text: I bake a LOT for my work, probably 10 cakes, a couple cheesecakes, and half a dozen apple, blackberry, and lemon meringue pies per month. So I have used and tried MANY different baking products... some great, some sucked. These vanilla beans are amazing! I designed and made (from scratch, of course) a baby shower cake recently using these beans and the recipient's parents (who hosted the party) were so pleased with all the rave reviews that they tipped me $100. Yes, you read that right! :) In case you're wondering, I used Rose's Heavenly Cakes "Deep Chocolate Passion wedding cake" for a chocolate cake (w/ added vanilla seeds) and a triple recipe of "Brown Eyed Baker's" vanilla buttercream underneath. Ohhh, it was divine.<br /><br />I use the empty pods in my sugar jars (another tip: use baker's sugar in place of regular sugar, no gritty texture in your finished goods!), I stir creme brulees and cheesecake batter with it, and even put them into my cream jar when we have overnight guests having coffee with us in the morning. I really should buy stock in this company so that they NEVER go out of business! ;)<br /><br />I'm sending a bag to my mom for Christmas, I know she'll love it too!

review/summary: Pleasantly Suprised!
review/text: After reading numerous reviews on these beans from JRmushroom and debating on whether or not I really needed them, I finally decided to just go ahead and order. At my local grocery store 1 woody, dried out bean is $7.99! These beans arrived 2 days after I ordered them and the quality is amazing. All of the beans are 6-8 inches long, juicy, plump and full of seeds. They have oily skin (as vanilla beans should) and the aroma is divine. I made vanilla bean cupcakes and vanilla bean ice cream and started homemade extract(half of this pack, about 22 beans). These beans are perfect. I can't believe the quality for the price. If you are debating, go for it. You won't regret it!<br /><br />******UPDATE*******<br />I am still just as pleased with these beans as I was when I first got them. After 3 months of maturation, my homemade vanilla extract is excellent! Dark brown and slightly "syrupy" and it will only get better with age. Total price of the beans used in the extract (22 whole beans, split ~$10.00) and the alcohol (smirnoff vodka750 ml. ~$9.00) just under $20.00 produced an entire quart/32 ouces of fantastic extract and seeing as the "pure" vanilla extract in my grocery is about $6.00 per 2 oz. bottle the savings is tremendous. I would still be saving a fair amount if I purchased vanilla in bulk (like at Costco.) It is simply a win-win.

review/text: I've never ordered vanilla beans before this, but the product arrived quickly and well-packaged.  The package is one of those resealable zipper types that so many other things come packaged in nowadays.  It says approximately 54 in the description, but I counted 48 in my package.  A real bargain compared to some places I've checked.  Some beans were thinner than others, but they were moist, pliable and very fragrant.  I checked another website on storage, and they recommended that you store them in a sealed container but not airtight and never refrigerate or freeze the beans.  If you put them in an airtight container you need open it every few weeks and let the air circulate.

review/summary: Happy Cook!
review/text: These beans arrived in great condition. They are mid grade quaility or better, certainly better than any you'd find in your average supermarket. Great price on this number of beans. Packed in airtight container, package small enough to fit in your mailbox. The beans are cured well, I've made several batches of ice cream with these beans, even after steeping for up to half an hour they are still strong enough to be reused in other applications (vanilla sugar, vanilla vodka, steeped with tea to add flavor, etc)If I had anything negative to say it would be that the beans are a bit on the small side, but as they're sold by wieght here, this isn't an issue.

review/text: I left the feedback couple days ago. Today, I made Creme Brulee that required a vanilla bean. So I opened the package, I realized right away what other reviewers had said "It's plump and moist" even though I have never used vanilla beans! I was so thrilled that I had to leave another review...I know this is the only place that I would get vanilla beans. Thank you so much, JR mushroom for such a fantastic quality and price!!!

review/text: I have ordered these beans twice now. I have made my own vanilla extract, vanilla sugar, homemade chocolate sauce, eggnog, cheese cake, white cake, pancakes, and so on and so on. EXCELLENT!!! The beans are supple and very fragrant! YUM! Makes me want to bake something every time I smell them ;) As others have mentioned, vanilla beans in local stores are $5 per bean on up...this is a great value and I intend to order this over and over again...the taste is wonderful and I go through them fast! Using these beans make me feel like a professional chef ;) Please don't have any doubts, order and enjoy!<br /><br />Update: 03/09/11<br />Still buying them and still very pleased! WONDERFUL!

review/summary: It was okay.
review/text: Overall, I was happy with my purchase.<br /><br />This was the first time that I bought vanilla beans online, and so thought that Amazon would be the safest route to go.<br /><br />First off, my advice is to buy the beans on a Monday. The shipping is fairly fast, but I ordered them Wednesday night...so the package was stuck (with the sweltering summer temperatures) at a post office for the weekend. I'm not quite sure if that affected the vanilla beans or not.<br /><br />I made a batch of vanilla extract with a few of the beans and was shocked by how much white "fluff" came out of the beans. I just pray that it's vanillin and not mold.<br /><br />The vanilla beans have the scent of vanilla enshrouded in cigar smoke. As bizarre as that sounds, that's a fairly accurate description.<br /><br />The package is airtight and was small enough to fit into my mailbox. There was no hassle whatsoever with signing for the postman.<br /><br />I just hope I don't get food poisoning when I first use my vanilla extract...especially since I love to share my baked treats with family and friends.<br /><br />Would I recommend buying from Amazon? Sure! Personally, however, I will try out a different source next time (if only to see the difference in vanilla beans and shipping).

I pictured someone holding them against their sweater while trying to get them in the bag. I obviously have no idea how they got fuzz on them but I was disappointed for that reason.

review/text: I have bought things from this company before and I guess I expected more from their vanilla beans. They have a weird smell, maybe a little burnt? I don't think they are supposed to smell like that. They are plump vanilla beans, but don't have the aroma I expected. Overall, I guess they are just ok. I wouldn't buy them again. And now I have a 1/2 lb. of vanilla beans that I don't really want to use.

review/summary: Great Beans for Vanilla Extract
review/text: I have been researching how to make my own vanilla extract.  I found many great articles and suggestions for making vanilla extract, but I ran into a very important issue - which beans to use?  After careful deliberation, I decided to purchase these beans for everyday baking and a variety of Mexican beans from this same company for ice cream only.  These beans came promptly and in great condition - they were plump, and had a wonderful fragrance.  I will update this post in 6 months and let you know how the vanilla turned out!<br /><br />Here is the link I used to research which type of beans I wanted to use for my extract.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Received my beans today
review/text: I was super excited to find my beans in the mail today, I placed my order on Sunday and they shipped on Monday. I was however a bit disappointed when there were only 43 beans in the package. I was truly hoping to get closer to the approx 54 they state. The beans were very aromatic and to me they seemed quite nice. I have never dealt with vanilla beans before so I guess my comparison is quite limited :) I am using them to make my own Pure Vanilla for baking so I guess I will find out in 6 mos how it turns out. Nice buy but disappointed in how many I received.<br /><br />ETA: After thinking about my review, I wasn't thinking about the fact that these are measured by weight. That does make a big difference. I was disappointed because the recipe I was using called for 40 beans and in the end I only had 3 leftover to use for something else. I will definitely be buying more though!

There is no reason to buy vanilla in a brick-and-mortar store. You can buy literally 50 times the beans for the same price here on Amazon, or through other online retailers who buy more directly from growers.<br /><br />The beans themselves are great. I have made creme brulee, hot chocolate, vanilla extract, and sauces with them, and they never disappoint. Can't praise highly enough.

I have purchased beans in grocery stores, and the so-called "gourmet" shops, and have gotten stale beans and paid premium prices.  These beans come in two heavy plastic vacuum sealed envelopes.  I popped one bag right in the deep-freeze, for future use.  The one bag I opened, and used a couple beans to bolster my homemade vanilla extract, and I have made vanilla sugar, and used the beans in homemade cakes and ice cream.  The flavor is spot-on!  This is the most economical way to get real, quality vanilla!  Bon app&eacute;tit!

review/summary: Wonderful Product
review/text: I purchased this product in Aug. It shipped quickly and with no problems. The beans were moist and smelled amazing. I used almost all of them right away for homemade vanilla extract and have a couple still in a ziplock bag (still moist and aromic).  I was able to get 24 4oz bottles with 1 and half beans in them plus a 750ml bottle with about 8 beans as well. I will update on the flavor of the beans when the vanilla is done in a few weeks.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Delicious. The beans that I received were good and fresh. They were soft and seemed almost oily but naturally so. Highly recommended if you are looking for fresh vanilla. There whole beans are much better than pre-ground type. And the aroma was fantastic. I hope they continue to offer a good quality product.

review/summary: great vanilla extract and bean quality.
review/text: I kept 8 whole beans out of bag for recipes calling for vanilla bean. The rest I split open with a razor knife and using a teaspoon extracted the paste and set aside. Then I chopped up all the bean pods to 1/4 inch and placed them in a mason jar with a fifth of Smirnoff vodka, sealed and set aside for 6 months. Strained the batch with a extra fine sieve. Fabulous flavor after aging. Used this extract in a creme brulee, custard, and pastry. Amazing vanilla flavor.<br /><br /> And here's the happy kicker. Bought a fifth and made another mason jar batch with the originally used beans. After just 6 weeks, I used this recycled batch in a creme brulee, can't tell the difference. I will continue to age the new batch, (shake the jar once in a while, storing it a cool dark place). I got enough vanilla extract for the rest of my life. No more $6-7 2 ounce bottles of the national brands for me- with my homemade stunningly flavorful. Good luck.

review/summary: I HATED vanilla until I started buying these!
review/text: When I first ordered these in Aug. 2010, I ordered two 1/2 lb bags. thinking that I would need that much at the rate I would be using them. I made homemade vanilla extract, I put 1-2 vanilla beans in my cookies (which I make at an ungodly rate!), in ice cream, and various other treats and I only ran out in Feb. of this year! so it took me two years to go through 1 lb! I love these vanilla beans. They are fragrant and moist. After I scrape the beans I throw them in my sugar container. The sugar absorbs the moisture from the spent hulls and the end result is a very fragrant vanilla flavored sugar! If I have too many on hand I will let them dry out and throw them in a spice grinder, until they become a fine powder. It is great to sprinkle in coffee or on top of oatmeal or waffles in the morning! vanilla beans are too expensive to waste so use up as much of it as you can! Make sure you store them in an air tight container! You want to keep them moist. I bought an OXO Good Grips POP container just for the purpose of storing my vanilla beans.<br /><br />and just a note...even though I clicked the same link I originally purchased the beans from in 2010 and they came from a different company...International Spice Holdings LLP. AND even when I go to my orders to leave the review (it even says International Spice Holdings LLP  on the invoice) it brings me to the JR Mushrooms & Specialties page!! They were packaged differently from the first time I got them too! But that made no difference in the quality!

review/summary: Love these beans!
review/text: I live in a fairly large city, Green Bay, so one would think that it would be relatively easy to find some good vanilla beans. This just isn't the case...<br />Almost 6 months ago, in February, I purchased 1/2 pound of these vanilla beans and I couldn't believe how fast they were shipped to me! And I was beyond excited to get them!! I made my own vanilla extract with some of them, shared some with friends, and made lots of vanilla sugar. Sadly, I ran out of my beans and had to suffice one time with a bean that wasn't quite as good... But, I just placed another order for some more of these beans, so I'll be happy as a clam again in a few days!<br /><br />My vanilla beans arrived perfectly plump and juicy. They have great flavor and made my entire house smell wonderful the entire time I had them. I even told my boss how great they were, and she paid me to add on a package of the beans for herself. I would definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Awesome!!!!!!!!
review/text: I was looking for a good deal on vanilla beans and thought I might be taking a gamble when I ordered these, but I was pleasently surprised. The aroma of vanilla could be smelled before I opened the box. The beans were moist, and pliable. I used one to make a large batch of oatmeal yesterday with some cinnamon and sugar and it was delicious. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the resealable bag they were sent in won't do a darn thing to keep air out.  So I followed the advice someone else left on another review and wrapped them individually in plastic wrap.  I will up date this post in a few months to let you know how they fare over time.

review/text: I purchased these beans to make some homemade vanilla extract. I found some vanilla beans at a market near me, but they were sellng 2 beans for $8!!! These were delivered early on a Saturday instead of the Tuesday they were scheduled. The beans were in a nicely vacuume sealed bag, but I was still able to smell the strong vanilla scent. I used a ton of beans for the extract and still have a ton remaining. The beans were moist and plump.  I will update after my extract is complete and after using it to make vanilla bean ice cream.

review/text: I thought these arrived on time, and packaged really well sealed in an airtight plastic. I used them to make a huge batch of vanilla extract. I put them in a large jar with Vodka in February and the extract was ready by April. Whenever I need vanilla beans (like when I made ice cream a couple weeks ago) I just pull a bean out of the extract, snip off the end and squeeze the paste right out. Works perfect! (Got that idea from Ina Garten, love her!)

review/text: I had purchased some extract beans (from another company) and was looking forward to trying the higher grade beans.  When I opened the package (which arrived promptly) I was not blown away by a heavenly aroma of vanilla and at first was dissapointed, the beans, however, were (are) moist and plump and when I made a custard with them the flavor was rich and heavenly.  I put the beans into a couple zip lock bags and put them away, and a couple days I started smelling this amazing smell, like REALLY nice pipe tobacco, it of course was the beans (I bought a nice airtight container for them)<br /><br />These are fantastic and far FAR better than anything I've ever gotten from the grocery store, I will be buying these again (and again).

review/text: Got the vanilla bean order today and like other 5 star reviewers I am impressed with the quality of the beans.  They are moist, fragrant, and slightly oily (as they should be).  They came vacuum sealed in a heavy plastic bag.<br /><br />I am impressed with the value (paid $23.27 here on Amazon.)  Last time I priced vanilla beans in my local Whole Paycheck analogue, they were $7.95 for three; last time I broke down and bought them there, probably 16 months ago or so, the beans were not as good quality.  Last time I priced Bourbon Vanilla Extract was last Christmas and it was $14.95 for 4 oz.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the quality, the quantity (60 beans in my half pound) and the value.  I have a quart of extract "brewing" already; I even sprang for the high-dollar microdistillery brewed vodka!

They aren't quite as long and fat as some that I got at a gourmet store for three bucks each, but the flavor is equally excellent. And really, 54 beans for the same price as six at the local store? I can afford to use more :)
