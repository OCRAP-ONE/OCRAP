review/summary: Very bland and weak coffee
review/text: I will admit that I like strong flavorful but not burnt tasting coffee. I give four stars to the Tully House Blend, but this Breakfast Blend is quite weak.<br />After ordering fifty of them, my husband and I in desperation have been trying to use them up by putting a kcup on espresso setting and using 2-3 kcups on Expresso  as needed to fill up our coffee cup. I'm sure it's a  fine Kcup if you like weak coffee, but...

review/text: I recently found this blend available at my local Walmart (sorry Amazon, but it had a great price). It is a light blend such as I prefer, and tastes wonderful.  I could not detect any aftertaste as you get with medium or dark coffee blends. I previously wrote a review for Green Mountain's Nantucket Blend which I recommended to those that prefer medium blends.  However, this particular blend is just right for me.  I highly recommend this blend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer light blends.

review/text: I had received a Keurig coffee maker for the holidays and have been hooked since. I am not a real strong coffee person so this morning blend is perfect. Consistant in flavor. The only reason I gave it a four is once you buy the machine you are basically locked into buying the cups.. It does have the reusable pod tho. I believe the prices could come down. In the store the prices are outrageous, but on Amazom they are reasonable somewhat..

review/text: I have usually ordered my K-Cups direct from Green Mountain, but thought I'd try Amazon's larger package and subscribe/save. The box of 50 works out to about a month's supply of coffee for me, with drinking a couple of cups a day.<br /><br />The taste is good--it's not a strong coffee, for that you need something like Green Mountain Coffee's Extra Bold.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA30ZU">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold) K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers, 50-count</a><br /><br />It's not too heavy of a coffee, but none of the cups I have brewed have been the weak water that a few other reviews suffered from. Bad batches and bad quality control may be the issue.<br /><br />If you double-check the prices and get a good batch, it's a better than average cup of coffee.

review/text: I love this coffee.  I'm a fan of lighter roasts.  I like the lack of bitterness and higher caffeine that comes with them.  This one is my favorite.  For most K-Cups, even lighter roasts, I have to run the machine twice through one K-Cup to get a decent, not overly-strong, cup of coffee.  These come out perfect for me with one run.  I do tend to go through them more quickly because of that, but that's okay. The great coffee is worth it!

review/text: I knew there was something wrong when I opened the outer packaging from Amazon an it contained loose coffee grounds.  I found the Breakfast Blend box to be leaking the grounds.  When I opened it I found several of the K-cups had lids that were applied off-center, thus not sealing the K-cups and the grounds were spilling out.  I have used LOTS of K-cups and have NEVER seen this before.  Poor quality control by Green Mountain with this batch.  Shame on the folks at Amazon for packaging up a box that was obviously leaking it's goods.

review/summary: Love Green Mountain Breakfast Blend -- Great Coffee!!!!!
review/text: I just recently got my Keurig, and I've been trying the sample pack of coffee that came with it.  So far this is by far my favorite.  I nice mild coffee taste to enjoy in the morning or anytime.  I actually wish they made this coffee in a decaf version also so I could enjoy the great flavor of this one anytime!  I think this will be the main coffee in this house; I've tried some of the others and liked some of them more than others, but this is the runaway favorite.  I tend to put a good bit of cream and sugar in my coffee (can't stand it black!) but the nice flavor of this one comes through the cream and sugar.  (I've found that cream and sugar can't cover up the taste of coffee I don't like!)  I don't care for the bolder coffees at all (I don't feel like getting slapped in the face by my coffee in the morning!)<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to give this a try if you like a light roast coffee with a mild, pleasant taste in the morning -- you won't be disappointed!!!

review/text: What I received today in shipment is a joke! I have the product on the desk in front of me. I see 4 packages of Green Mountain Coffee..Breakfast Blend. The 4 packages arrived NOT in an outer box! The packages are held together with yellow strapping tape. ALL 4 packages are ripped open in one way or another. One package has the bottom ripped off almost entirely and several coffee pods are missing. This disaster of shipping  was sitting out on my front porch in 95+ heat on a very humid Texas day. Mice, giant tree cockroaches, or kitties could have been prowling around inside the boxes. I can't believe UPS even accepted such a crappy packaging attempt. PLUS...I tried to find this Mike's Grocer online. The address on the return slip is 7 Prospect ST APT #4....an APARTMENT???? How do I even know where in the heck these pods originated? I LOVE Amazon and buy almost everything from them. This is my first REALLY horrible experience. Amazon....please get rid of this retailer!!!!!! Brenda Spurlin

review/text: A great way to save money on buying K-Cups - in supermarkets these go for about 8-9 bucks for 12 cups.  You save so much money buying them in bulk like this, if you use them regularly.  I just picked up the 96 count after buying the 48 count 3 months in a row.

review/text: This Breakfast Blend from Green Moutain coffee company is my favorite flavor of coffee when I just want a regular cup of coffee without that extra kick from a bold blend or a flavored coffee.  It has always been consistent and calming in its flavor.  It is top-notch coffee.

review/summary: Not the best, but CERTAINLY, not the worst!
review/text: This is a breakfast blend coffee and, for many coffee producers, a breakfast blend also means "the strongest daggone brew we can make" mentality.  Well, caffeine is caffeine and this guy is a bit strong for me.  I prefer Caribou's breakfast blend over this Green Mountain version. It's just entirely more smooth, no bitterness at all, and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I think this one tastes a bit burnt, like Starbuck's, not at all as nice as some of their other blends (especially the pumpkin spice - awesome!).  Try it to see if it suits your taste but get the 12-pack first.  Otherwise, if you think the way I do, 24 of these guys is a LOT of coffee to wash down!

review/summary: A Wonderful Organic Flavorful Granola
review/text: A lot of people who have tried this granola gave it poor ratings.  It is not full of chocolate at all, I will be straight with you. I even shook the box to mix it all up sense during shipping contents tends to settle but even after doing that it didnt make a difference. I had to look so very hard for any chocolate but the few pieces I did find were coated inside oat clusters. I thought that there would be nice sized pieces of chocolate like on the box but not so. The chocolate that is present in the granola is delicious, I do wish there was more though. The flavor of this granola is so comforting and actually very addictive.  It is not overly sweet and not too bland, its perfect. There is a nice toasted nutty like flavor and the crunch is so comforting when eating.  There is also a slight chocolate flavor which is really nice. Now as for the almonds there are slivers present but the granola is not filled which is actually great to me because I think too many nuts would be too much if that makes sense. I think that you should at least try and find this in your local grocery store before buying it on amazon.  I have and I really like it so I may just be buying this off of amazon.

review/summary: Favorite Granola
review/text: For years I've made my own mix of granola, and then I discovered this, which is almost exactly what I was mixing up myself. The nuggets have just the right crunch, and the chocolate pieces tend to be stuck in the middle, which keeps your fingers from getting melted chocolate on them if you're munching on it as a snack. For breakfast with milk I suggest adding some raisins or craisins, and then it's exactly like my custom mix.

review/summary: Where's the chocolate?
review/text: I don't know if I happened upon a bad box of this cereal because bowl after bowl the question on my mind is "where is the chocolate?" Granola? Check.  Almonds? Check.  Chocolate? Negative.<br /><br />I have to say I'm a little saddened but the very visible absence of chocolate pieces in this cereal.  When I was half way through the box, I literally poured it out on a plate to see if there was one substantial piece of chocolate.  I found none.  I did find a few chocolate pebbles and I mean small, small pebbles that when consumed with the granola couldn't really be tasted.<br /><br />The granola itself has a pleasant flavor and I like almonds but I was excited to have a bit of chocolate in my bowl.  No such luck with this box.  Cascadian Farms makes some nice products and the granola cereal appears to have potential as a granola almond cereal.<br /><br />Parents: Be aware that the second ingredient for this cereal is sugar if you follow the rule that first, second, third,(whatever number) ingredient should never be sugar for kids.

review/text: I love this cereal.  However, it is fair to say that it does not look like they picture it on the box.  You cannot see chunks of chocolate in the cereal, but I can assure you it is there. It seems as if they added the chocolate while the granola is hot, so each chunk of chocolate ends up covered in granola.  The result is that some clumps of granola are actually a chocolate-centered granola treat - a very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite cereals.  My previous complaint had only been about the cost which was high when buying one box at a time from the store.  Now Amazon has solved this problem. Enjoy!

So if you are buying it for the chocolate (which I'm assuming anyone buying it would be buying it because of the the dark chocolate because that's what is being advertised on the box) then don't buy it, because there is no chocolate.

review/text: *Chocolates*: I've always been more inclined to dark chocolates, but this place's white chocolate ganache has got me hooked. Audrey, the chef, picks fresh ingredients from local markets and makes mouth-watering ganaches--white, milk, or dark--out of them. I really like the flavors that are brought out by the white ganaches of the passion fruit and meyer lemon--you can taste the rich, original flavors of the fruit encapsulated by the high-quality E. Guittard dark chocolate shells. I am also a fan of the Tahitian vanilla bean chocolate--it just melts in your mouth.

review/summary: good dog food for adult dog
review/text: good food for adult dogs that need low mineral/protein content. BUT...PetSmart sells it, but is very slack on stocking it i've found out. Getting it through Amazon is easier believe it or not, than getting in the car and hoping to get it at my local PetSmart. Amazon does not just "run out", or "forget to stock it". Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: DRY, OLD, STALE - This is NOT freshly roasted coffee
review/text: BEWARE -<br />This is NOT freshly roasted coffee.  It arrived with absolutely NO OIL on the beans.  They were bone dry, with NO AROMA.<br /><br />The bags the beans are sent in are the first indication of a problem.  They are NOT 1-way vented bags.  Those who know coffee and roasting...know that the fresh roasted beans continue to emit a gas for up to several days following roasting.  That is why you MUST use a 1-way vented bag when packaging and shipping fresh beans. The oils will quickly evaporate and the beans turn stale if the beans are exposed to air.<br /><br />I don't know why Camano Island thinks they can package this way for selling on Amazon.  The product the customer ultimately receives is NOT acceptable.<br /><br />I talked directly to Camano Island (since Amazon won't allow returns).  They offered to send me freshly roasted beans AFTER I shipped them the "bad" bags I got from Amazon.  It cost me 1/2 of my original purchase price to ship the "bad" beans to Washington from Michigan!  In my opinion, Camano Island should have only required me to fax or email my Amazon receipt to them or send 1 of the 3 bags to minimize shipping costs.<br /><br />I can only hope that what I receive back from Camano Island is truly fresh.<br /><br />What a terrible experience.<br /><br />I've been let down by Amazon.<br /><br />AGAIN BEWARE of buying this brand, packaged this way from Amazon.  Go direct.

review/summary: Reluctant to try at first and...
review/text: They left me puzzled.  I had my dad bring me these when visiting on a weekend he said "what would you like me to get, I am going grocery shopping" I asked him for Smores Pop-tarts.  He came back with these and said, "sorry no smores" :(  So I said "oh that's ok, I'll try them, no worries"<br /><br />I loved them, I do not normally like fruity pop-tarts but this is something in between.  They don't have that "sour" taste the fruit ones have, it is more in between.  If strawberry milkshake was this good, I'd probably would drink it more often :)

review/summary: Decent Pop-Tart Flavor... But Stick with Regular Strawberry
review/text: Imagine a Strawberry pop-tart, but then add cream and that's what they taste like (duh).  It tastes kind of like Nesquick strawberry milk but more along the lines of strawberry icing you'd put on a cake.  Once hot, they have a bubblegum texture and flavor in the filling that is much more gummy than what you'd get with regular Strawberry.  I don't like them nearly as well as regular Strawberry pop-tarts.  I think I'll just stick with blueberry and strawberry and avoid all other pop-tart flavors from now on.  Now what am I going to do with 12 boxes of pop-tarts in this flavor?  Oh my goodness.  A word to the wise, never buy something on Amazon unless you already KNOW you love it.  But I seem to always go against my better judgment (ex: like when I bought White Cheddar and Broccoli pasta... yuk... shudder).<br /><br />PS: Maybe it is just the particular batch I got, but these always seem to be splitting in half in the toaster (and I'm not doing anything I shouldn't be doing).  The other flavors I've had never did this.

review/text: This was our first time trying smoked salmon that wasn't from Scotland. This is every bit as good and far more affordable. It's pre-sliced (thinly and no bones), lightly and perfectly smoked and easy on the salt. We're going back to serving it for the holidays (with lemon slices, capers and very thin circles of onion)...you can't beat that for a tradition and it's a healthy one!

review/summary: Awesome quality cacao nibs - powerful and satisfying.
review/text: I'm a certified chocoholic with a weight problem.  I had heard that cacao nibs had all the health benefits of dark chocolate (way more, actually) without the sugar and junk food aspects.  They are loaded with antioxidants and have those powerful endorphin releasing stimulants.  They are also quite high in fiber (but also in saturated fats).<br /><br />I got my big pile of Navitas Naturals nibs and dug right in.  Well - these are a bit of an acquired taste; but once acquired, they really satisfy.  Cacao nibs are broken pieces of raw whole cacao beans that have been dried (and that's it).  They are brown, with a dark cocoa smell, and a seductive texture that's partly like a coffee bean (crunchy and hard), and partly like a piece of chocolate (buttery with a crisp and then melting fat).  The flavor initially gives you a cocoa hit and then a winey fermented flavor that is hard to describe.  The aftertaste is bitter like baking chocolate.  Like a coffee bean, there's some fibrous grit with the aftertaste after the creamy fats have dissolved on your tongue.  My first impressions was "phew - that's disgusting".  The winey flavor was off-putting and the bitterness in the aftertaste was hard to take.  That didn't prevent me from immediately having more, however - as the crisp rich creamy quality made me want more.  After a few pinches (maybe 3/4s of a tablespoon) I was flying!  I mean, these things are POTENT.  They really are loaded with all those endorphin releasing stimulants - and man they wake you up and then make you feel loved.  Over the next few days I kept a big baggie of these in my pack and ate them whenever I wanted a cup of coffee.  The stimulant effect is totally as strong as coffee - and more.  To go with the speed, there's a feeling of well being and intellectual stimulation that's seductive in the extreme.  I began to almost enjoy the odd powerful flavor.  My only concerns at this point are whether these are addictive!  About 1/2 way through my bag I have yet to hit a stem or a stone or an inedible piece (unlike what I've heard with some other brands).  The flavor and texture is pretty consistent as I work my way through too - pretty good for a totally raw organic product.<br /><br />I found that I could grind them up into powder in the blender and use the powder to "cocoa" up various foods (especially ones bearing some sweetness).  For example, after my workout I'd put a tablespoon of nibs and a tablespoon of chia seeds in the blender and grind nice and fine and then toss in a fist full of frozen blueberries, a glug of Walden Farms zero calorie chocolate sauce, 8 oz water and two scoops of whey protein powder (chocolate flavor, of course) and then blend.  It all whips up into a rich chocolatey blueberry shake that packs the nutritional wallop of a steak dinner with omega 3 oils, TONS of antioxidants, and a wicked emotional and blood sugar pick-me-up.  You can buy the powder pre-ground, but I imagine the goodies keep better in this coarsely cracked version.<br /><br />All in all - I think of cacao nibs as much as a drug like coffee as I do a food.  People who eat ultra-dark chocolate for the health aspects should absolutely check nibs out because my body tells me they have WAY MORE of the chemical goodies of chocolate with far less sugar and fat.  They also are brimming with a rich raw cocoa flavor that's weird and wonderful and hard to describe.  If you are bent in this way - this stuff is wonderful.

review/summary: Ultimate Organic Nibs Taste More Chocolate-y
review/text: Love love love the nibs. I have tried this brand initially before moving on to a cheaper brand that tastes more chocolate-y!Ultimate Superfoods nibs are the best of the two but you can't get them on amazon.com. Lately, they have been sold out at Mother's and they're very own site, which is making me very desperate. I am a chocolate lover and nibs have totally replaced my craving for chocolate bars, hot chocoloate, chocolate milk, and other sugar-filled chocolate treats! Keep in mind when your trying for the first time: Ultimate brand has that chocolate after taste that you are wanting and give it 4 Stars. Nativas has a more bitter after taste so I give it 3 Stars.<br />Also, nibs are great for your skin. You will notice the difference in a few weeks. Between my green tea and coconut water intake, my skin is loving this nutritional routine.<br />The nibs will give you energy due to the caffine. So, if you feel brain farty...have a small hand full and it will focus you right up. This food is so wonderful, I encourage all who love chocolate and ...want to cut back on the Evil Sugar...to try nibs!!!!

review/text: We first discovered this stuff on a trip through the Hood Valley area's Fruit Loop.  Stopped on a lark, picked some up for family members as a gift.  They raved about it so much, when we came home we picked up a case online here.  If you like extremely potent horseradish cream sauce, this is for you.  I come from a family that knows horseradish well, and this is superior stuff.  Great on sausage, pierogi, ham, you name it.  Definitely worth trying.

review/summary: So addictive, so delicious, so comforting
review/text: My bedside is almost always stocked with a bag or two of these bergamot candies, which I think are the best candies I've ever tasted. I love to curl up with "in bed with blankie, a bear, a book & a bag of bergamot bon-bons" (my husband likes alliteration.)(the bear is a refrence to our dogs as well as to my childhood Care Bear.)<br /><br /> He loves to come into the room to find me literally curled up around our sleeping puppy, as my iPad kindle app and a nearby scented candle cast an otherworldly glow across my contented face and the dozens of candy wrappers strewn about the bedside floor. It's gotten to where I almost can't read comfortably without my cherished candies!<br /><br />Taste<br /><br />The taste is a challenge to describe, but not a challenge to fall in love with. Though "unusual" by American palates, it is not an acquired or foreign flavor like rose or lavender, which we are more familiar with purely as fragrances, not flavors. It has a very sweet burnt-sugar taste at first, quickly melting into a complexity of full-bodied richness, very much like a strong, sweet herbal tea. Which is not a surprise, because the classic, well-loved Earl Grey tea is flavored with bergamot.<br /><br /> The pieces are a square shape that fills my mouth, and they last a good while. I usually end up crunching into them when they get down to a sliver, for a last burst of flavor.<br /><br />Packaging<br /><br />The packaging is simple, and recyclable. It's easy to dig my hand into the bag, pull out a handfull to keep right by my pillow, and grab one at a time. Unwrapping them is a snap - very important for someone with crippling juvenile rheumatoid arthritis - all I have to do is hold each end and tug gently, and the golden treasure is released in one quick motion.<br /><br />Price<br /><br />The only *only* drawback to being so addicted to these candies is the high price. That's the reason i couldn't give all 5 stars. Thank goodness they ship through Amazon Prime! I understand these candies are imported, but at the rate I go through a bag, and the cost per bag (I won't say so as not to date this review) these are even more expensive than they first appear to be. You may think "$x for a mere bag of bon-bons?!" and you'd be right. As in love with them as I am, I cannot always afford such a luxury. Hello seller, hint hint!<br /><br />So I wish wish wish that the price would go down a few dollars, or there could be a subscription service that ensures I'm well-stocked while offering a discount. I buy so often as it is, it just seems like good sense.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />The seller does have excellent cutomer service and superb selection of delights you rarely find in the States. I am a repeat client of the most repeating repeat purchases: I will *never* stop loving these candies. For my birthday and Christmas, the top of my list is a dozen bags, a true jackpot since I can only afford to buy two at a time. Imagine a dozen! And imagine a woman asking for CANDY for her 31st birthday!<br /><br />These bergamot candies are THAT GOOD.

review/summary: Unique and Interesting
review/text: I had an earl grey green tea that I'd fallen madly in love with, and I discovered this candy while trying to recreate that experience without the caffeine that sets me vibrating.<br /><br />The candies come in attractive packaging with stickers and details that are designed to lend it a bit of charm and authenticity.  Delivery was prompt, and as you might expect, these smell lovely right out of the box.<br /><br />They do taste a bit like perfume, if perfume tasted good. They do not taste like Earl Grey, but they never claimed to.  I passed them around the office and the other tea drinkers were excited to try them.  Thoughtful head nods went all around, and the official, unanimous verdict was, "Very interesting."  I'm glad we got to try them, but I don't think it's an instant addiction.  I also don't think they taste at all like burnt sugar!  Just standard sugar and flavoring.<br /><br />They can be sucked on as a hard candy or chewed.  They're just at that point between brittle and soft that reminds me of that old bazooka gum, except of course these don't become bubble gum once you soften them up enough.<br /><br />I tried dissolving them in green tea and got candy-flavored tea that still didn't taste like sweetened earl grey.  Again, not something the seller ever claimed, but I suspect a few more earl grey fans will wander over to this candy in curiosity!<br /><br />I'm not madly, wildly in passionate love with this candy, but it's pleasant and interesting, and I'm glad I tried it.  I may try violet and other flavors in the future.  You only live once!
