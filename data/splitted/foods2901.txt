review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I really like this and I'm back for more. It does have a slight artificial sweetner taste to it. I don't mind at all but I know for some that's a deal breaker. I ordered this in autumn when I traditionally start to crave hot cider. Soon, I found I was reaching for it all the time. It's perfect for when I think I've had enough caffeine for the moment. Plus, it's guilt free with only ten calories a cup. This is the first product I've signed up for auto shipping. I've come back twice now and figure this is gonna be a constant in my cubbard.

review/summary: Some aftertaste, but still good
review/text: Yes, it does have artificial sweetener.  Yes, you can taste it.  I haven't had any artificial sweetener that I couldn't notice.  It's not a super-strong taste though, at least to me.  My daughter tried it and liked it, I didn't even tell her it was in it till after.  Honestly, regular apple cider is just too sweet for me anyway, so this is just as good cuz I'm replacing the slight dislike of too sweet with a slight dislike of artificial.  If you're super-sensitive to the artificial flavor and you don't like any of it then avoid this.  Otherwise, you should try it out.  It's going to just come down to a personal taste preference thing for everyone.

review/summary: Yuck!  Cough syrup medicinal taste
review/text: These are disgusting.  I just bought these and was thrilled to try it out on my keurig.  Green mountain cider didn't have enough spice for me so grove square spiced cider sounded great.  It tastes like cough syrup.  The cherry medicinal taste is not drinkable.  I am going to attempt to take these back to walmart today.  It doesn't taste very spiced either and no apple flavor.  Just watery, weak smell.  The cough syrup smell and taste really is the only description I can give because it overpowers anything else.  I dumped it down the drain!

review/summary: A little weak but tastes pretty decent
review/text: I just received this product today and although I've been disappointed with K-Cups that weren't coffee or tea in the past (like hot cocoa and sweet tea) I figured I'd give these a shot since it was only $9.99 for 24.  I drank it hot, although you can also brew it over ice for a cold drink.  Immediately after brewing I noticed it looked a little weak in the cup, but it smelled pretty good.<br /><br />My reaction to my first sip was a bit on the "bleh" side.  The caramel taste was a little odd and a touch sickly sweet.  However, as I drank a little more it grew on me.  It's certainly not like heating up a nice cup of real cider from a farm, but it's more convenient, it doesn't go bad, and makes a decent little cup of cider on a nice chilly evening.<br /><br />For $9.99 I recommend giving it a shot.  Don't go all out and buy the 3-pack of 18 cups right off the bat though.

review/summary: Extremely unpleasant taste
review/text: I was very hopeful about this product.  While I did not expect anything close to real apple cider, an occasional warm apple flavored drink at work was a welcome idea.  And while this product is sugar free (sweetened with aspartame), that didn't scare me away as I've enjoyed some other drink products sweeted with aspartame.  Well, I brought my new purchase to work this morning, and brewed my first cup.  The aroma was pleasant ... could smell the apple right away and then a few moments later could smell the caramel.  But then I tasted it - and it was awful!  I sipped it hot, sipped it warm, and even tried another cup with a different amount of water.  I'm done!  The taste is extremely chemical with little to no apple taste (nor caramel).  Not sure if I can return the product (will be checking) but if not I will be throwing it away as I would not be comfortable offering to anyone!

review/text: I'm so glad I didn't pay attention to the bad reviews for this product. Obviously, it's not going to taste the same for people who are used to cane sugar and corn syrup sweeteners. Now, most importantly, the taste is RICH, SWEET and hearty. It is not weak, and it even has some of that apple "bite". The smell is just like mulling cider on the stove. Each serving is only 10 calories, and best of all, it isn't full of sugar for those of us juvi diabetics and gastric bypass patients out there. This feels like Cheating! It's absolutely delicious and I intend to always keep it on hand. Thank you Grove Square for remembering the sugar-restrictions!

review/summary: Nice change from coffee
review/text: Nice caramel apple flavor (its an artificially sweetened powder that completely dissolves and empties out of the k-cup). This can have a somewhat strong/tart flavor on small cup setting, so i run the same k-cup twice on 'small' cup setting in a large mug to dilute it slightly more to suit my taste.  Quick and convenient hot apple cider with caramel touch for those occasions when you crave apple cider, hot or cold  add ice cubes).<br /><br />***update*** noticed my keurig was spurting during brew cycle but only when using this caramel apple cider k-cup.  After making a cup of cider, i decided to cut the foil open on the top of the k-cup.  I discovered this stuff clumps during brewing inside the bottom of the cup as a sticky ball.  It has done it on the second pack as well, so might be product & not just a bad batch. Might be clogging up the discharge needle in the bottom of the k-cup.  Just to check out what's inside, I cut open a new cup and small amuont of brown and white powder is all there is to this.

review/text: Yes, it has the "fake sugar" taste, but it's okay.  The real downside to the product is the price.  In a coffee K-Cup, there is more to it than just coffee grounds in the K-Cup...there is a filter etc, and the brewing occurs in the cup.  With these cider K-cups, it's just ordinary drink mix in the K-Cup.  You're better off just buying the powder at the grocery store, and run the Keurig just for hot water, as you would for tea.

review/summary: Grove Spiced Apple K-Cups - Delicious!
review/text: I think the Grove Spiced Apple Cider K-Cups are absolutely delicious!<br /><br />I found the 8 oz. setting to be a bit too strong for me, so I used the 10 oz. setting on my brewer and, for me, the hot apple cider turns out perfect, just the way I want it.<br /><br />I have to watch my carbs, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that these K-Cups are only one carb each.  Before ordering, I noted that under "Product Features" it states that the product is sugar-free; and under "Product Description" it clearly states that the product is sweetened with aspartame.  Therefore, I think it's fair to say that those who prefer sugar over other sweeteners, and/or can't stand the taste of aspartame, may not care for this product.<br /><br />As for me, I enjoy it well enough that I've put it on monthly subscription.

review/summary: Perfect alternative to Coffee
review/text: I'll get this out of the way first... If you are expecting the quality of a few tenths of an ounce of instant "mix" to be the same as a fresh pressed glass of Apple Cider, you're expectations are way too high for a product like this. This is a fancy instant drink mix in a K-Cup package.<br /><br />Just got my first package and made my first cup and it is pretty darn good. I paid $8.50 with the subscribe and save discount and for 24 K-Cups (around 35 cents each), I think it is a pretty good deal.<br /><br />You can taste the sometimes over-sweetness of the fake sugar used (heck, they only have 10 calories, there has to be a trade off!) but I regularly use Splenda in my coffee so it was not a problem.<br /><br />If you are looking for an alternative to coffee or tea in your Keurig brewer, this is a pretty good option and a pretty good price.

review/summary: Did not like...
review/text: The price seemed great.  Until you realize that you're just getting powdered drink mix.<br /><br />This was an awful beverage.  I didn't realize that it was sugar-free until today (I bought and received it 2 months ago), as I didn't read all over the box.  My thought was, I read about it on Amazon. I know what it is.<br /><br />It comes with 3 boxes.  I couldn't finish the first box.  Also, I seemed to get headaches after drinking it.  Now I know that it was probably the Aspartame.  I'm no health food nut.  I'll eat whatever tastes good, but none of the sugar alternatives taste good to me.  YMMV)<br /><br />If you want good cider, I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050JSRU6">Green Mountain Naturals ~ HOT APPLE CIDER ~ 24 K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> from my local grocery store (to try it. I'm now going with the 12-count boxes for untested k-cups and will purchase larger amounts from Amazon if they're worth it), and I think that it's much better.  The apple flavor isn't as strong, and it's not a deep caramelly color, but it actually tastes like apples and spices instead of gross liquid.  Also, I don't think that the price from Amazon is great for the 'Natural' Cider, but I found it in my local grocer for very competitive prices.

review/text: Although a lot of the feedback was mixed on this cider, I was pleasantly suprised. I do however use 2 K-cups on the small cup setting to make a cup because I like the stronger flavor. Will definately buy again.

review/text: It's nothing special for keurig, it's some powder in a plastic cup. Others say you're better off buying straight SF cider mix & making it with hot water, but I can never find that. Just pop this open & mix with hot water.<br /><br />Also it comes out way too sweet on my largest cup setting, had to add more water until it tasted good/normal.<br /><br />If you're looking for a specially brewed item that it is not, if you want instant Sugar Free Cider mix, it is!

review/summary: updated:wound up with a storage humidity problem
review/text: The spiced apple cider isn't bad. It isn't as natural as Keurig cider but it is also 1/3 the price. It has aspertame which I use so I am used to it. Good flavor and a nice break from coffee. Also since I am on a diet, it only has 10 calories compared to 80 for the Keurig cider. For the price it is worth it.<br /><br />Update: after trying these for a box and the Keurig apple cider k kups, I have decided I like these better. I think they have more flavor and are sweeter. I would buy these again before I would buy the keurig ones.<br /><br />another update: I had these sitting in my closet for the summer. Went to make a cup and found that most of the cups had the powder harden(took one apart and it wasn't appealing) and a couple puffed up and broke away from the plastic. I emailed the company and they called back. Gave me SOME of my money back and requested I send a couple of the bad ones to them and they sent the necessary items for me to do that. They said as far as they knew there would not be a problem drinking them but I threw them away out of caution. Seems they are aware of the humidity problem. Wound up testing the powder cider drink you can get at Walmart and put it into my Ekobrew and it tasted fine.  Think I will be doing that from now on.

When you couple the quality of this product and the less expensive cost all I can say is Grove Square you have a winner!  Can't wait to try the other products!

review/summary: Aftertaste kills what could otherwise be good
review/text: I was rather excited when I bought this at Wal-Mart. After all, it's a cider that's low in calories and carbs- something that I'm watching as far as my diet goes. Unfortunately this just didn't live up to my excitement.<br /><br />This smells great, but there's this strange aftertaste that I just can't overlook. I tried pretty hard to move past that and focus on the initial taste (which is decent), but it's pretty overpowering at times.<br /><br />This isn't awful to the point where I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, as there's going to be some who can overlook the aftertaste, but I ended up dumping out the rest of my cup. I just didn't really like this, which is a shame- I love apple cider.

review/summary: overpriced garbage
review/text: The cups are filled with cheap powder containing ingredients that are barely identifiable. The ingredients are listed in this order from the box sitting in front of me:<br /><br />"maltodextrin, malic acid, natural flavors, sodium citrate, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), calcium carbonate, spice extractd, carmel color, calcium phosphate, aspertame, acesulfame potassium, calcium silicate." The aspertame "contains phenylalanie."<br /><br />My husband told me how horrible it was before I tried it and I said if I didn't like it I'd bring the box to work, label it free and be done with it. This stuff is SO BAD that I won't even do that to my coworkers. It is going in the trash.<br /><br />I'm glad we tried the apple cider from Green Mountain Coffee over the weekend because had we not tried it before this garbage we probably never would have tried any apple cider k-cups. GMC has apples and brown sugar in their apple cider k-cups.<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! This stuff is truly absolute overpriced garbage. I cannot be more serious when I say it even smells like chemicals after it is brewed.

review/text: I don't really like the taste of this cider, but my 18 year old daughter, who is calorie conscious, loves them. They seem to quench her desire for something sweet. They haven't really been advertised as such, but the reason they are artificial tasting is because they are sugar free and only 10 calories. The drink contains aspartame and a bunch of things I have never heard of including "phenylalanine"...(wiki)..."found naturally in the breast milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement for its reputed analgesic and antidepressant effects."  I don't know if that's a good or bad thing?? I think I would avoid buying it in the future.

review/text: Bought this flavor because it sounded soo good but after making the first cup I realized that names can be deceiving. The sweetener aspect of the drink taste like sweet-n-low instead of sugar and has a bad after taste. Save ur money this  is not worth it.

review/summary: Horrible Smell, Inconsistent Quality...
review/text: I picked up a box of these at either Target or the Navy Exchange...can't remember. They are absolutely terrible though. The smell alone is enough to make you want to toss out the entire box, but I figured I'd at least try it. Thankfully they don't taste as retched as they smell, but they're still not good. I made two k-cups on two different days thinking maybe the first was just a bum cup...nope.<br /><br />My husband went to make a cup and he remarked right before putting the cup in the machine that it felt and sounded empty. Well, all he got was water with the slightest tint of brown to it. He tried a second cup...same thing happened. He finally said screw it and put in a k-cup of decaf coffee...came out perfect, so it was the cups that had the issue, not the machine.<br /><br />I absolutely do NOT recommend these. I can't compare the smell to anything, but it's truly disgusting. There has got to be a better cider k-cup out there somewhere. For now I'll just stick to my packets of cider mix that require some hot water. At least they have a pleasant smell, and actually taste like cider!

review/summary: Okay if using right after purchasing, but....
review/text: I loved these when I ordered and used them last year.  I kept an extra box in a cool, dry place over the summer.  When i went to make a cup tonite, was dissapointed that it simoly tasted like hot water.  Figuring that it might have been just one pad pod, tried FOUR additional pods with the same result.  Checked the box and expiration is next month....but no warning on the mix evaporating in the cups.  What a waste....very dissapointing since i had thought this was a great drink to curb cool weather munchies.

review/text: I had high hopes for this, despite knowing from reviews here that it contained a sugar substitute. I love hot cider, and especially caramel cider. It smelled great brewing but when I went to take a sip -- ick! The artificial sugar makes this intolerable for me. People who routinely use stuff like Sweet n Low will probably love this. Me, I'm just glad I got this in a sampler rather than buying a huge box as I was tempted to do. Grove Square needs to offer an option that uses real sugar because I think they got it right otherwise. Disappointed. Wanted to really like this.

review/summary: Horrible.  The worst k-cup I've had by far.
review/text: I've probably tried 40+ (maybe more than that) k-cup varieties thus far and this is the only one that is just plain horrible.  The powder rarely comes out correctly (and the fact that you are talking about a powered cider should stop you right there), it has a far too-sweet taste, and well, frankly, it just tastes bad.  My wife and I found the Green Mountain naturals Cider cups on clearance locally (we liked them so much we went back and bought like 16-18 boxes), but I have problems with sugar so I thought I would try this.  Bad idea.  It is borderline undrinkable.  It is, however, better cold than hot, but that's not saying much.  Low price, low quality.  Even the physically cup itself isn't made as well as the "real" k-cups.  It is made to fit in a Keurig brewer.  It is not a true k-cup.  Note that the title says "for Keurig K-Cup Brewers".  It is worded that way for a reason.  Avoid like the plague.  If you can handle sugar, check out the Green Mountain version.  If you can't, well, I've not found a better choice either.  In fairness, apparently everything this company makes isn't horrible.  My wife loves their Peppermint Hot chocolate.  Neither one of us can stand this crap however.

review/summary: Not that bad
review/text: I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, but this product really isn't that bad. There really isn't an after taste and not as intense as I thought it would have been as some of the reviews have made it out to be. The flavor is not amazing, but not bad either. I was expecting a little more zing. All in all, I paid 9.99 for 24 cups and I am not disappointed. Yes the "natural" and "real" product is better (I have tried both), but if I see this product at that good of a price again, I will definitely buy it. 3 out of 5 stars for value and taste (yes it's still enjoyable).

Real apple cider has sugar, so if you have any idea what it tastes like, this isn't it.<br /><br />On the bright side, this doesn't require the Keurig brewer.  Seems like you can just pour this into nearly boiling water.
