Also if you are not using this for little league or something like that you might find yourself unsure what to do with 300 pieces of gum.

review/summary: Great Formula but...
review/text: We received a sample can of this "Blue" formula from the hospital after our baby was born and we used it when we needed to ween from breast to bottle and the baby drank it normal. She got a bit fussy more and more and on a whim we decided to try the "Similac Sensitive" formula in the "Orange Can". Wow what a difference. Our baby drank more of it, it was easier to mix (blue kind of clumpy), and she was less gassy and fussy. It's the same brand Similac only in the orange can. A couple of bucks more is more than worthwhile. Still Similac should get 5 stars but only get 3 on the blue can.

review/summary: One of the best no calorie sweeteners available
review/text: I've tried pretty much all the no calorie and low calorie sugar substitutes available. None of them are perfect. Don't expect anything to taste exactly like sugar except sugar because there is nothing that tastes exactly like sugar except for sugar. That is a fact. The human taste buds, especially in certain individuals, are extremely sensitive to the various flavors each sweetener provides. Often sweeteners are compared to sugar, but in reality high calorie sugar substitutes like fructose even taste different from sugar. So please stop comparing other sweeteners to sugar, because only sugar tastes exactly like sugar, and attempting to find a sweetener with a different molecular structure that tastes exactly like sugar is impossible because the human taste buds can sense even the slightest difference in the molecular structure of the sweetener.<br /><br />Now with that said, there are today available many sweeteners each with their own positive and negative attributes. The number one sweetener in the world is sugar, and most people find sugar to be the best tasting sweetener. That's why it's number one. The low calorie alternatives include both natural sweeteners (erythritol, stevia, xylitol, lo han, etc.) and man-made sweeteners (nutrasweet, saccharine, splenda, etc.).<br /><br />This product is a mix of the three natural sweeteners erythritol, isomaltulose, and reb A (a sweetener extracted from stevia), as well as natural flavors to make the taste more like sugar.<br /><br />Erythritol is a great all natural low calorie sweetener on it's own, but it lacks depth, and imparts sort of a watery sweetness unless mixed with other sweeteners. It goes very well with stevia, and is commonly found mixed with stevia based sweeteners, as is the case in this product. The combination greatly enriches the sweetness of each of the two distinct sweeteners.<br /><br />Stevia normally contains stevioside, reb A (rebaudioside A), reb C (rebaudioside C), and dulcoside A. Of these, reb A is the most desirable, sweetest, and lacks the bitterness of the others. Most high quality stevia products contain mostly reb A. Reb A on it's own has a shallow but pleasant sweetness. It's a sharp sweetness and goes very well with other sweeteners that help broaden it's sweetness such as xylitol, erythritol, sugar, lo han, etc. The fact that PureVia only uses reb A from stevia means that it has none of the bitter aftertaste of some of the other popular stevia products available.<br /><br />Isomaltulose is a full calorie sweetener very similar to sugar but like erythritol and reb A it does not promote tooth decay. It's presence helps to give PureVia a richer full bodied sweetness.<br /><br />Ok, so those are the facts, but how does it actually stand up against the other sweeteners available? The taste is excellent. Most of the people I know who've tried it like it a lot. It has a flavor very similar to sugar, but like all other sweeteners out there, it has its own unique flavor. There is no bitter aftertaste or unnatural chemical taste present. It's sweetness is full bodied, not thin or watery. The manufacturers did a fantastic job of mixing the various sweeteners together to produce a rich full bodied sweetness. It has none of the drawbacks of most common stevia products (a thin flavor, bitter aftertaste), none of the drawbacks of erythritol (watery sweetness), and to top it off its all natural. What natural flavors are added are of course a trade secret, and these are partially responsible for PureVia's flavor being very similar to sugar.<br /><br />PureVia is simply one of the best sugar substitutes you can buy. There are a few others that are as good (such as NuStevia and Truvia), but each one has its own unique flavor. Not everyone is going to agree on which one is the best tasting because each person has their own taste preferences.<br /><br />I really like PureVia's individual tube packets better than those of most other products. They are easier to use. They are tubes rather than flat envelopes. This makes it much easier to dispense.<br /><br />One bit of advice, if you're very picky about a full bodied sweetness, no matter which sweetener you prefer, using more than one sweetener nearly always improves the flavor profile. For example, a mix of splenda, nutrasweet, and saccharine will give a more full bodied flavor than each one can alone. The same is true for the natural sweeteners. Sugar and fructose together give a richer taste when combined together. Stevia and lo han give a richer taste when combined together. In general, the more sweeteners you combine, the richer the taste. You can get a sweetness that is better than sugar alone by mixing different sweeteners together. Also keep in mind that natural low calorie sweeteners like stevia and lo han vary dramatically from one brand to another, with the more refined ones generally being the most expensive and best tasting.<br /><br />A combination I often use is saccharine mixed with a stevia based sweetener (such as PureVia, NuStevia, Sun Crystals, etc.). Saccharin was once thought to cause cancer in humans, but this is no longer believed to be true. Recent tests show it to be one of the safest manmade sugar substitutes available (far better for you than Splenda or Nutrasweet) and it is VERY CHEAP. I use a little bit, just enough to give the other sweetener a richer flavor. Saccharine has an off flavor that's unpleasant if too much is added, so I only add it as a booster. The other low calorie sweetener I'll sometimes add is all natural lo han (such as Lo Han Sweet, Sweet Sensation Natural Luo Han Guo Syrup, etc.). Lo han has a very unique taste, almost like brown sugar or honey. It's rather pricey so I'll use just a little bit. It greatly enhances the sweetness of other sweeteners. I avoid using splenda and nutrasweet because they are obviously very unhealthy. Splenda gives me stomach pains, and nutrasweet makes me feel drugged (driving on a nutrasweet drugged brain is dangerous), so I avoid those like the plague.<br /><br />Give this product a try. Only you will know if YOU like it or not. It is one of the best stevia based products you can buy. Because it uses only reb A from stevia, it doesn't have the infamous bitter taste of many other stevia products. Similar stevia based products with the same quality include NuStevia and Truvia. Sun Crystals is another new stevia based product that I like. It's stevia mixed with sugar, but the stevia extract is not pure reb A and therefore it has a slight aftertaste like Sweetleaf has, but I like it nonetheless.<br /><br />People who like stevia in general are likely going to love this product. People who've tried bad quality stevia in the past and were put off by the bitterness of a poor quality stevia product should give this product a shot. It's not truly a stevia product, because it only contains reb A, and none of the other sweeteners and compounds found in stevia that impart a bitter aftertaste. Reb A is a very decent sweetener, much better than the other sweeteners found in stevia. Most stevia products contain a mix of all the sweeteners found in stevia, plus other compounds present, which impart a bitter taste. Reb A is an isolated sweetener which doesn't taste the same as a full stevia extract. Much like how sugar doesn't taste like sugar cane or brown sugar. Pure reb A is more expensive than a common stevia extract, and so expect to pay a little more for it. The flavor of reb A is a lot better than a normal stevia extract, it's sort of like thin tasting sugar. Because PureVia contains two other sweeteners, and natural flavors, the taste is far better than reb A is alone. I really have to hand it to the manufacturers. They did a great job.

review/summary: BETTER TASTING THAN PLAIN STEVIA
review/text: I made the change from regular sugar to Splenda some time ago. The saccharin and aspertame based sweetners seemed to have a lot of unanswered questions regarding long-term use. Along came Splenda which seemed to have all the right answers and it tasted much better.<br />Recently a few negative murmurs have arisen regarding Splenda, so I thought what do I do now.<br />A lot of folk had mentioned Stevia in the past & I tried it at that time, but the taste/aftertaste just did not work for me.<br />Just the other day in the store I saw "Pure Via" and another similar rendition of a Stevia based sweetner. Tried the PV and so far can say that it does the job well. No funny aftertaste and still some of  the benefits of Stevia.<br /><br />I'll try the other Stevia based product & let you know.......

review/summary: A nice alternative to sugar
review/text: I have been highly averse to "sweeteners" ever since I was a kid watching my mom dump equal in her coffee in the 80's. To this day she still uses whatever fake stuff she can get her hands on. I don't like the taste of any of them, splenda, equal, sweet'n'low. ick. For that reason I've only used raw sugar or when I'm low on $$, white processed sugar just because it's not a bag of chemicals, and that's a plus in my book.<br /><br />Lately I've been hearing about the stevia based sweeteners, and figured it might be time to give it a try. Stevia has been a bit controversial, as it was banned in 1991 by the FDA(but isn't anymore) and now is ban in Europe and a few other locations. But the reasons for banning are vague and don't seem completely investigated, just that there was "pressure from the market" to stamp them as unsafe.<br /><br />It was important to me that it be natural, because I go as much organic/natural as possible. I knew I wouldn't be using a boat load of it, so I'm not concerned about the controversy. I compared a couple of the stevia based sweeteners in price at the grocery store and this was the 2nd brand I tried. Not bad at all, but I really liked Truvia a lot better then this one. My main reason was because it required about 1/2 a packet of truvia compared with a packet up to a packet and 1/2 of purevia to get my coffee where I like it(I used to do a tablespoon & 1/2 of sugar). So using less, making it last longer = more for the $ to me.<br /><br />From a picky taster to you though, this is worth giving a try. I'm not noticing a huge taste difference between this and my usual sugar, which is great. No after taste to speak of. I think people should try a couple of the stevia based brands to see which one suits them best, since everyone's taste buds are different.

review/summary: Your run-of-the-mill sweetener.
review/text: I recently received a box of Pure Via sweetener to try and review from Viewpoints. I come from a family of dedicated Splenda users, so I was interested in trying the new product. I was initially impressed by the packaging, which gives a fresh, light vibe. My only complaint with the packaging is the state in which my sample was received. When I opened the box, Pure Via poured all over my counter. I inspected the box and all of the packages, but there were no tears or breaks in the packaging. I'm assuming, therefore, that the mess was from the packaging process, and not defective packaging.<br /><br />My parents and I each tried the product with food and solo. According to the package, each pouch is the equivalent of 2 Tbsp of sugar. My dad said he put a whole packet on a bowl of cereal and didn't think it sweetened his cereal very much. I put a packet in my cup of coffee, and I thought it did an alright job of sweetening. Typically I put 2 or 3 packets of Splenda in my coffee (I like really sweet coffee) and my coffee was fine for me with just one packet of Pure Via. Mom tried it in coffee and thought it did an alright job of sweetening.<br /><br />We also tried the sweetener solo. We each put some on our finger and tasted it. The general consensus was that it was sweet, but had a slightly strange taste to it. There isn't much of an aftertaste, which is a perk. My mom used the word "bitter" to describe what she thought the taste was, but I don't think it was strongly bitter. It certainly had a different taste from sugar, although I can't place it. This difference, however, was not as noticeable when the Pure Via was mixed into foods.<br /><br />All in all, I thought it was alright. I don't think my parents will convert over from Splenda, but I wouldn't discount it as an option in the future. It was sweet, and the fact that it's zero calories is a definite perk. I didn't think the flavor was very different from Splenda, and it sweetened my coffee just the way I like it. Like Splenda, it is much sweeter than standard sugar, so less is certainly more. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a sugar substitute!

review/text: Yep, great little convenient packets of Stevia for sweetening.  My recommendation would be to use HALF of a packet at a time.  Using the whole packet in a 16 oz. coffee left a very bitter aftertaste.  Still, Stevia will sweeten your stuff without raising your insulin levels, so it's worth the trade-off.

review/summary: It's ok, but a little bitter
review/text: My heart becomes irregular when I eat sugar made from sugarcane, even the more refined types like demerara.  I decided to give this a try in my coffee, instead.  It's hard to imagine something being sweet and bitter, but that about sums up Purevia.  Not the best.  You can soften the bitter with a little honey, but I'm moving on.<br /><br />Stevia is probably behind Purevia's bitter taste, as it is a well-known complaint of that sweetener.  I'm going to try the main sweetener in Purevia, which is Erythrinol, a naturally occuring fruit sugar. The famous natural foods Dr., Dr. Weil, highly recommends it, not only for taste, but he believes it's one of the safer sugar substitutes.  Not much in the way of calories, doesn't cause tooth-decay, gastric disturbances are rare from it etc.  Sounds good.  You can buy it on Amazon in pure form, although one company got some bad reviews because they were selling Erythrinol that had a musty taste (the company was something forest).  I ordered mine from Now Foods.  Still waiting.  Good luck.<br /><br />Update:  I got my Erythrinol, and added about 4 spoonfuls to a cup of coffee, since it's only supposed to be 60-70% as sweet as sugar.  Very quickly, my stomach became upset, and it only took like 20 minutes for this sugar to liquify my entire intestinal track.  Not good.  Also, there is a decidely unpleasant effect in the throat that is hard to describe.  If you've ever had hard candy sweetened with xylitol, you may know what I mean...the feeling that you want to cough because of something chemical, or perhaps your eyes water a little etc.  The sweetness was fine, just didn't care for all of the effects.  It probably needs to be mixed with another sweetener, as it is in Purevia.<br /><br />Right now, I'm trying Splenda, and it's not too bad.  See how it sits.

review/text: Horrible aftertaste! Perhaps I added too much (4 packs) but it was absolutely not edible. I couldn't even drink my morning coffee when I added this. I switched to Truvia and it was MUCH better. Generally, the Stevia plant is quite bitter, but by using the sweetest part of the plant as Truvia has done, the horrid after taste can be extinquished with nothing but sweetness left. I am not entirely sure what part of the plant PurVia uses, but I thought it the most reasonable explanation for the differences between the tastes (Truvia vs. PurVia).

This is the superior product (though I gather that the King Salmon in this brand is even one step higher). It is a beautiful orange/red colour and has moist flesh with a rich and lively flavour (without excessive smoke penetration). Other brands (which had 5-star ratings) were much drier and paler (more like pink than red salmon).

Absolutely the worst smoked salmon I have ever had so far, what a waste of $30+ dollar (16oz) and a piece of salmon!<br /><br />On a side note, I also got 5 different flavoured 4oz "Echo Falls" smoked salmon, all tasted excellent, and pricewise, 4 pack of 4oz "Echo Falls" salmon is equal to 16oz but cost less than $30, will never buy the "Seabear" brand.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: Recently I attended a conference in California where smoked salmon was served as part of the breakfast buffet.  It was heavenly, and I decided to incorporate it as part of my breakfast routine.  I bought a fillet at my local grocery chain and enjoyed it greatly, but looked on Amazon for a more cost-effective approach.  This salmon is from a reputable company, but I have to say I really don't like it, compared both to the smoked salmon I had in California and from my local grocery.  It comes in a broth, and at first feels a little soft when I open the pack, but then when I eat it without the brine, it is actually quite dry.  The smoked flavor is even a little too light for my taste. Truly, I have never cared for sockeye; I've always found it dry even when not smoked, and I pay the extra for king when buying my fresh salmon. I notice other reviewers put this salmon in dips and chowders; I think that is a good solution, but I will cancel my subscription and buy smoked salmon locally for now.

I would rank the taste and overall quality of this salmon as very high, as good as any other store-bought products that we have purchased.<br /><br />The following day I used the broth and remaining large flakes of salmon in a chowder and again it was fantastic.<br /><br />By the way, my cats sampled the skin and dark meat and gave it 5 stars. Nothing goes to waste in our home.<br /><br />I will definitely buy this product again.

review/summary: Hot Smoked Salmon - delicate yet rich in flavor
review/text: This is the ideal product for lovers of hot-smoked salmon who do not live within easy reach of Pike Place Market in downtown Seattle (and that's most of us). I've always enjoyed hot-smoked salmon since the day I first tasted it. I regularly bought those smallish packs at supermarkets for something like $7-10 each. Then, on a visit to Seattle I tasted the "real thing". On later trips to Seattle I would stock up. Then circumstances kept me away from the Emerald City for some time; and I started looking for a replacement source: those supermarket packs weren't good enough any more. That's how I discovered SeaBear. Later, I discovered that Amazon sells SeaBear at an unbeatable price (except when SeaBear has a sale). Now I have a regular order placed with Amazon and they give me an extra 15% off from an already great price. I still recommend that you register with SeaBear to get notification of their specials and learn of some other products which Amazon doesn't stock. Unlike Amazon, SeaBear charges a flat $7.99 for delivery; so when you buy from them it's best to order big but seldom, as most products have enormous shelf life with no need for refrigeration. This product should not be confused with cold-smoked "lox-style" salmon.

review/summary: Outstanding vanilla beans
review/text: These beans come in a vacuum-sealed package to preserve freshness, and it works extremely well--all the beans that Beanilla sells are moist and plump with a wonderful texture and scent. There are multiple wonderful flavors that you can get from Beanilla, and Madagascar is one of the more deliciously exotic ones.<br /><br />I had never made my own vanilla extract before I ordered from Beanilla. Their customer service is superb, and one of their representatives told me by email how to make vanilla extract when I asked, and he also explained why one might want to make his/her own vanilla extract. When you make your own, you can be 100% sure exactly what has gone into the extract, which is not always the case with some types of vanilla extract that you buy pre-made. It is also cheaper and a lot of fun to make your own.<br /><br />Here is the technique for making vanilla extract spelled out in detail for anyone who has not tried it before, and I have uploaded photos demonstrating these steps:<br /><br />1. Assemble kitchen scissors, good quality vodka, a clean, dark-glass jar (I save all my empty vitamin jars), a funnel, a spoon, something to label the jar, such as a self-sticking label.<br />2. Remove the beans from the package. Cut each bean lengthwise in half. Then cut the beans horizontally into pieces small enough to fit in the jar and easily be covered by vodka.<br />3. Place the bean pieces in the jar.<br />4. Pour 1/2 cup of vodka into the jar per every 3 beans (for 10 beans, it would be a little over 1-1/2 cup). Then tamp down the beans so that all bean parts are covered by the vodka.<br />5. Put the lid on the jar and label the jar with this information: what kind of vanilla bean you used, the date, the amount of vodka you used in ounces (or whatever measure you prefer), and the number of beans you used, then place the jar in a cool, dry place like a kitchen cabinet (I put mine with my spices).<br />6. Every week or so shake the jar.<br />7. After 8 weeks, the vanilla extract is ready to use.

review/summary: Outstanding!!
review/text: I used to buy 100% natural fruit roll-ups at a local fruit market down the street from me. They were sold individually for like 65 cents apiece and were AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. They were nothing like the fruit roll ups for kids you find in the grocery stores today. Those things are gross and have no resemblance whatsoever to a real fruit roll up. I used to literally buy like $50 worth at a time and would just eat one after another after another. In particular the Apricot and Strawberry flavors were just outstanding. Anyways, I went to the market one day and they had gone out of business. That was about 8-9 years ago. I tried finding a different store that carried them and to this day I have been unsuccessful. I tried finding them using the internet but unfortunately I just cant remember the name of the company to save my life. I just remember they were sold individually, were round and actually quite large in diameter, and they came attached to a piece of cellophane.<br /><br />I came across Stretch Island Leathers on Amazon just a few weeks ago and got extremely excited after reading the description as it sounded exactly like a fruit roll up, just presented differently. While a Fruit Roll-up is large and thin, The Fruit leather is small and thick. Anyways I immediately order a box of the strawberry and anxiously awaited its arrival. I received my shipment 2 days later and immediately ripped open the box and dug in. They were exactly what I was looking for and they were just as delicious as I remembered them to be. I would up eating one after another after another, just like I used to do, until I had a fairly large pile of wrappers sitting in front of me. I honestly cant even express how excited I really am. Not only did I find what I was looking for, I found it on Amazon which means I can buy them in large quantities for a very reasonable price. On top of that Amazon offers them on a subscription based service so I don't even have to trouble myself with re-ordering more.<br /><br />The bottom line - Stretch Island Leathers are OUTSTANDING and my hunt is finally over. If you are a big fruit lover than you simply have to give these a try. Of course these are not just for adults, in fact these are absolutely perfect for kids especially if your trying to cut down on the amount of junk food your kids eat. They are all natural and have no added sugar. For those that have dietary restrictions, they are also gluten free and dairy free. I honestly cannot give a higher recommendation!!<br /><br />5 Stars!!!

review/summary: Actual healthiness of this product
review/text: I initially wanted to make my own fruit leather but in a fit of impatience, purchased this brand. The only other fruit leather I had before this was the Archer's Farm brand (Target) and honestly, I felt like the taste and texture of Stretch Island did not measure up. After the disappointment began to settle in I started doing more research into the ingredients and process involved in making fruit leather and stumbled upon some eye-opening information. Most companies are trying to market their fruit leather as a healthy alternative to the sugar/corn syrup fruit snacks but in reality, there is little difference in the amount of sugar you are eating. When a product like fruit leather is produced commercially, it often contains fruit concentrates (Stretch Island is made almost entirely of concentrates). Knowing nothing about that process I researched it and found how fruit concentrates are made and how the process destroys nutritional value and dietary fiber that would be found in homemade (or a higher quality brand) fruit leather. While this may be a good alternative to someone who is eating a lot of junk food, people who are already health conscious should be aware that this is borderline junk and holds very little of the fruit's original vitamins or dietary fiber but ALL of the natural sugars. Yes, I know, fruits have a lot of sugars...but when I eat something made from fruit I want to eat all the nutritious parts too...not just the sugar left over after heavy processing.

When we received them in the mail and I opened the box they were all a very brown color, they look nothing like the red color in the picture shown.  Before giving my daughter one I wanted to try it myself to make sure they were ok.  I took one bite and spit it out.  It was very dry and did not taste like fruit at all.  It was awful.  From all of the outstanding reviews I am hoping we just got a bad batch but am not going to order another batch to find out.  I went back to Target and got the Archer Farms fruit strips.

Super snack and healthy too to keep in my purse for my daughter or myself when we suddenly have a sugar low and crankiness is setting in.

review/summary: Delicious, healthful, and well-priced!
review/text: I love stretch island fruit bars! Our local Costco started carrying these a few years ago, for about the same price found on amazon. I quickly became attached to these delicious and healthful treats, and was very disappointed when Costco stopped carrying them. Amazon to the rescue, of course!<br /><br />Great for kids, no added sugars or bizarre ingredients, and try a few of these in lieu of an "energy bar" before strenuous exercise, along with a small handful of nuts... Plenty of energy whatever the activity!

review/summary: Addicted to these!!!
review/text: I LOVE these fruit strips. One review said that they were a brown color, "nothing like the red picture shown". Well, that is true, they are a brown color. It was not a "bad batch". Most people are use to fruit snacks, that are chewy, soft and sweet. These are actually made from REAL strawberries and have NO artificial colors and/or flavors. So people who are use to added sugar in fruit snacks, would think these are not sweet. This fruit strip is natural in every way, its more tough, not soft & chewy, you can rip it. Has texture to it when you chew. I am addicted to these things..so are my kids, who eat only organic snacks. Good thing these are 1/2 serving of fruit per strip, because we eat alot of these! I buy the pack of 30 from amazon, every 2 weeks. The price here is alot cheaper than the local grocery stores.

review/summary: Not as good as Kettle Valley...
review/text: I used to get the Gerber fruit strips for my kids, but they were so expensive for the dinky little strips so I got Kettle Valley.  I really liked the Kettle Valley bc it had actual strawberry seeds which tells me there are actually strawberries in them (as well as one full apple).  I thought I'd try these Island ones because they were cheaper...and I've found they lack quality too.  Instead of being berry colored like the picture mine were brown.  They tasted ok, but they weren't my favorite.  Looking at the label the only benefits it had was 4% of your DV vitamin C.  I'd say they are probably better for kids than the regular sugar packed fruit strips you find in the store, but I don't think they are really worth the advertised 1/2 serving of fruit.

review/summary: Hard to open & really sticky
review/text: I purchased these as an alternative to the Gerber fruit strips for my toddler.  The kid won't touch most fruit with a ten foot pole, but these he will eat, though not as easily as he eats the Gerber ones.<br /><br />While I appreciate that he does eat these strips, the individual plastic packages are difficult to get open.  If you open them slightly wrong (which happens about 50% of the time), they require scissors to get the plastic the rest of the way off.  These fruit leathers are also extremely sticky, which makes them less than ideal for a snack on the go.<br /><br />Overall, they are an acceptable alternative to the Gerber fruit strips but certainly not ideal.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: I had such high hopes based on the reviews.  The product is pretty good, not outstanding.  A quick peek at the ingredients shows the top two ingredients to be pear and apple puree, not strawberry.  I do commend the makers on the fact that all the sugar comes only from the fruit and there is nothing weird or hard to pronounce in the ingredients.  The texture is a bit like leather and the color is brown like leather.  (Maybe we got an old batch like some have complained of here.) We happened to get Target's organic version in a goodie bag from a party.  We preferred it and will be buying those in the future.  However, if your kids are eating fruit roll us...no question, these are better in every way.

review/summary: Absolutely Love These
review/text: These are my favorite fruit leathers. I love this flavor as well as the mango. And they are so much better for you than the fruit roll-ups we ate as kids. They are soft and chewy, not hard like other reviewers have noted. They just received bad products.<br /><br />Until now, I was spending absolutely too much money on these at natural food stores and Albertsons. Unfortunately, our Costco does not sell these. Using Amazon's subscribe and save feature, I am getting them for a much better deal than I otherwise could. These are the perfect proportion for storing in your purse to tide you over when you are hungry and circumstances do not allow you to eat your next meal.<br /><br />For all those of you who are worried about receiving products close to their expiration date or products that are hard or inedible, I have read in other food reviews on Amazon that Amazon will replace the expired or inedible/hard products if you are not satisfied.

review/summary: Excellent! Fruit roll-ups for adults
review/text: These are excellent tasting fruit strips.  I have eaten all the different flavors and while they are all good, the strawberry is by far the best.  Regardless of which flavor you buy, these are primarily made of apples and the apple taste is recognizable in each flavor.  They are only 70 calories and do fairly well at filling me up when I need a snack.  The box that the fruit strips come in is convenient for setting on the counter for easy "grab n' go".  The only negative to these is they are very sticky on one side (which is odd), and you need to watch how you unwrap and eat them or you end up with sticky fingers. Therefore, due to the sticky fingers, I have to take away a star.

review/summary: Great tasting, but truly a "leather"
review/text: I bought these instead of getting more of the Gerber toddler fruit strips, thinking it'd be cheaper as well as more healthy.  Well, it is, and the product tastes great.  Very fruity, but not *sugary*, which is nice.  Think dehydrated fruit without cornsyrup. So, they're not quite as sweet as the Gerber ones, but only by a little bit.<br />  However, it is much more "leathery" than I expected.  I have to cut the strips up for my small toddler to eat it, and it takes her some effort. She's still at an age where she likes to fill her mouth too much.<br />  Also, one side has always been sticky when I remove it from the wrapper.  I have no idea why, but this has been the case for every strip thus far.  So, for travel, I'd say this may not work real well for small toddlers, and definitely wouldn't be good for car interiors.  At home?  It's easy enough to cut up.  At least I know it's all fruit, and American made.<br />Overall, a good, healthy snack that is cheaper than buying the tiny gerber boxes, but beware it's chewiness for real little ones.

review/summary: eh
review/text: it's fruity. it's leathery... but is that really all you expect from your fruit leather? personally i like mine a little less leathery and a little more chewy. The fruit has also been 100% liquified before dehydration, so there is a weird, soylent-green like uniformness to the texture. I will stick to 365 (Whole Foods) brand for now.

review/summary: Yuck. Seriously. YUCK!
review/text: Ugh! I really wanted to like these as I love Fruit Roll-Ups, yet wanted something healthy. Well, unfortunately ity wasn't meant to be; these straps are just awful, they have such a bizarre off-putting texture that it makes it possible to enjoy the taste. (Not that the taste is great either.) The name "Leather" is so apropos; this snack is seriously like chewing a belt, although I'm sure some belts have a better taste than these "fruit" bars.

review/summary: good flavor but not so great texture
review/text: I always loved fruit leathers and growing up they were always a part of our snack cupboard (thanks to an aunt that was all about organic and healthy well before it became trendy to do so!) I usually stock up when I am at Trader Joe's but since I haven't made the trip there in months I needed to stock up again. I ordered these when they were on a Goldbox special and decided on the strawberry flavor due to the reviews. I did enjoy the taste of these but took issue with the texture. Too much moisture? or maybe because apples are used as the primary fruit base ? The bars remind me of semi-dried pears- slightly mealy and grainy. The true fruit leathers I am accostomed to have a wonderful chewy and sticky quality complete with the tiny seeds found in and on berries. These were an interesting shade of reddish/beige, and did not live up to the decription of a fruit "leather". Slightly gummy, easy to bite in to and chew- perhaps a Godsend for children or others with dental issues, but missed the mark for what I was looking for. Again- the flavor was nice even though the strawberries are a "flavor" more than the bar itself. Just be aware that if you are accostomed to homemade fruit leathers or similar store bought products that these are not the same.

review/summary: Fruit Leather snacks
review/text: These aren't our favorite flavor of stretch island snacks, but they are good and have less sugar than the typical fruit snacks. I wish they'd make them a little larger.

review/summary: Where did the REAL stuff go???
review/text: If you like a hint of the past then this stuff is for you. All I can say is what a disappointment...<br />The problem with these, Archer Farms and Kettle Valley are that all Fruit Leathers have become APPLE leathers with a smattering of the desired flavor in puree form. There used to be real pure fruit leathers made from the actual fruit (Apricot, Strawberry, etc) but for some reason they disappeared from the market about 10 years ago (last company I recall was 'Nature ...' something). I guess like everything else these days the emphesis is 'make it on the cheap' and forget the real quality.<br /><br />It's a shame if it's merely a cost decision, there's a bonafide market out there for the real thing even if it's a little more expensive.

review/summary: Not that great
review/text: I am a die hard Fruit Roll-up fan. So I decided to give these a try since they are all natural. I did NOT like the flavor or texture of this product. It was dry and does not have much flavor. Do not recommend. I am going back to Fruit Roll-ups permanently.

review/summary: Our twins love this one. With the subscription, the price is fair
review/text: Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.  I'm glad they are eating something green because we couldn't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months, but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months.<br /><br />Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon. They love all the fruit varieties.<br /><br />I'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein, although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients.<br /><br />This one also has carrots and I've heard all babies like carrots.  I don't know if they would like it without the carrots.  I haven't seen this one - lentils and brown rice - in our local stores, so I'm glad to get it here. Along with some others, we get this one with the subscription.  Of course, with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we're so busy that it's great to get these delivered.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent.  I've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 10% protein, 100% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult.

review/summary: Dessert to Them.  But is it Nutritional Enough?
review/text: My twin 10-month old babies treat this one as dessert.  Their first Earth's Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes.  After water, sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one, followed by apricot puree.  That's dessert for them right there.  After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour (not as good as brown rice though).<br /><br />This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  Add apricot puree and there's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  I recommend this flavor brand.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.<br /><br />Nutrition per label: 80 calories, 15% protein, 90% vitamin A, 2% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 6% iron.<br /><br />This one had the most vitamin A of all Earth's Best jars I've tried.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: Repeated deliveries of broken jars.  Great product though
review/text: I liked getting this one for my twin 10-month olds because it has such interesting ingredients, particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans.  I like the fact that it's vegetarian yet I believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice.  This list of ingredients looks excellent and it's a green color naturally.<br /><br />The babies liked it.  They have liked everything that has carrots.<br /><br />I have the subscription for this one as I really like the ingredients and the fact that I'm giving the babies food that is naturally green.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 8% protein, 40% vitamin A, 10% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 2% iron.

review/summary: Good flavor, too runny though
review/text: Baby loved this one, but as he has progressed I had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if I have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands, it is all over! I think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one.

review/summary: 12% Protein and 50% Vitamin A
review/text: Earth's Best Turkey Vegetable Dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey. You can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level.  I just can't find non-sweetened and non-dried cranberries even at the better food stores.<br /><br />Apples, carrots and turkey taste good to my 10-month old growing twin girls.  Babies love carrots since they're sweet to their taste, so that made a great addition.  The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistency.<br /><br />The ingredients per the label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, mechanically separated organic turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />In addition to 12% protein and 50% vitamin A, it has 6% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earth's Best.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: Baby Lilly says 2 thumbs up!
review/text: My little girl can't get enough of this! I like that it is organic and contains fruit, veggies, protein and grains in one tasty meal. I wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars.
